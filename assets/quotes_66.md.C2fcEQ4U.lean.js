Classics are hard to get into, and maybe the first chapter was slow but at the same time ghostly.I picked out few faults and though I'm an inexperienced school girl I haven't read many more books which were so intense, an yet somehow managed to keep the reader on tenterhooks.How real life her writing is, but at the same time supernatural. For me, Jane Eyre is a living person and she always will be."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"In short, Jane Eyre is the story of a fairly unconventional life. Jane is orpahned when she is young and sent to live with her Aunt Reed, to a horrible &quot;school&quot;, then to work as a governess at Edward Rochester's home. She falls in love with Mr. Rochester but his secrets may make it imposible for them to ever be together.The book has a really slow, melodic feel to it, so if you like fast reads, it is not the book you're looking for.This is one of the best books I have ever read, so good its one of few that I have actually read several times over. Definately a classic."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"This is an absolutely wonderful and captivating book. Once you start it you just gotta finish it!The best part of Jane Eyre (pronounced \\"air\\") is the love story between Jane and Edward, her employer. Edward keeps a dark secret , the nature of which isn't telegraphed but instead thrust upon the reader all at once (very well done!!!), that makes him both penurious and tragic. This makes him a somewhat odd match for Jane who is the epitome of virtue and is self denying. The cat and mouse play in the begining of their relationship, the way they individually struggle after the secret is revealed, and the ultimate resolution of their love story makes this one of the greatest novels in Engish literature.This brings me to the movie. It isn't a very good adaptation of the book. Major parts of the plot are missing or altered beyond recognition and signifigance. I watched the movie AFTER I read the book and was glad I did it in that order. Their are some stories that just have to be read in order for you to enjoy them;Jane Eyre is one of them (David Copperfield is another). But that's o.k., Charlotte Bronte has provided us with a tale that mesmerizes and impacts its reader like few others can. If it comes down to the movie or the book...read the book."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"I recently finished Jane Erye and I couldn't bear the thought of there not being more of it to read. At first I thought it was strange that Jane could fall in love with such a cold, hard man. But then it turned out that he had a certain charm and gentleness that was buried deep inside him, not to show its face until Jane uncovered it. I think a big reason that some people don't like this book is because they expect Jane to fall in love with a handsome, obviously charming man. But that kind of romance is done too often in literary works, and eventually it loses its effect. In his own suttle way, Mr. Rochester is Prince Charming, though it takes time and patience to see. The book has a slow start, but stick with it. I've seen two movie versions of this story already, and it's a shame to put the title Jane Eyre on them. They are great stories in themselves, of course, but they hardly do the book justice. I'm 14 years old now, and in a few years I plan to read this book again, in hopes of getting more out of it than I already have."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"Jane Eyre, by Charlotte Bronte, is a thrilling romance novel. Set in England in the 1800s, this novel tells of the life of Jane Eyre. Jane is an orphan left in the care of her aunt, Mrs. Reed. At Gateshead, the Reed's estate, she lives a life of solitude and hate, mistreated and misunderstood by all. At the age of ten, she is sent to grim Lowood school, a reformatory school for orphans. Her years at Lowood are gloomy and dull, and she has few friends. When she is 18, she advertises as a governess, and finds a job at Thornfield Hall. Thornfield is all she ever wanted; there she is happy and loved, until a twist of fate and a long kept secret find her once more in peril. This novel is very romantic and heart warming. Charlotte Bronte has a knack for making her characters and situations seem real. At times I felt as though I were right there with Jane, sharing her hopes and dreams. I found this book to be interesting and fun to read, although at times it became drawn out. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes romance novels with wonderful characters, settings, and situations."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"The Brontes were a family of brilliant minds; Charlotte was the most brilliant among them (so beat me up, Emily fans), and Jane Eyre is far and away her masterpiece. I have imagined Handel laying down his quill after penning the final note of the Hallelujah Chorus, reading it over, and exclaiming aloud, \\"Whoa--where did THAT come from?\\" Jane Eyre is the same type of work. The tricks and seams and recycled gimmicks on which artists rely to connect pieces of greatness are absent here. The novel seems unedited, unreviewed, untouched--uncreated, like Jack's beanstalk that just sprang up overnight.That Charlotte Bronte was a genius in the field of human psychology is best proved by the facts that she was a desperate 20-something daughter of a country parson, she craved love (and sex) and excitement and had none, yet she wrote a novel of moral self-denial that remains satisfying to people who have long since kissed their 20's good-bye--people who have, perhaps, denied themselves very little. Without having had the opportunity to kick up her heels (much less participated in the 12-Step program to bring her down to earth), she understood in advance the processes of temptation, restraint, remorse, and rejuvenation.The first 2/3 of the book concerns temptation. It is the Hollywood part of the work, and the section that most appealed to me as an adolescent. Without the final third, however, the novel is another dopey Cinderella story--Maid in England, maybe: nice ordinary girl somehow attracts the attention of prince, great happiness ensues, no one learns anything, close curtain. (The really interesting psychology in these Cinderella stories, if you ask me, is that of the Prince--what's he looking for under those rags and foreign accents? Who's he pissed off at in Prince-land?) To an adult reader, Jane Eyre is monumental because of the struggle through hardship and denial to a less perfect (but, of course, more perfect) happiness at the end. While Jane's moral quandry takes place within the limits of a 19th century British system of Christian ethics, there is surprisingly little hellfire involved. After all, to Bronte, the daughter of a parson, the answer to Jane Eyre's dilemma could have been a simpleminded, \\"It's wrong, don't do it--just get on with it!\\" just as the answer to modern western readers is, \\"It's wrong but fun--just do it!\\"This book is even great in Italian, which is how I reread it--and I'm not sure Italian even has words for restraint and self-denial.Jane Eyre should not be assigned reading for most teenagers, however, and it frequently is. I can't even imagine the torture it would be for that large percent of teenage boys who are just not interested in the human heart; there is very little action in it--it's purely character analysis. (\\"Ghostly happenings\\" occur now and then, but probably not enough to hold the interest of most modern kids.) On the other hand, some first-time adult readers might put it down early, finding the opening 2/3 of the book somewhat ridiculous--there are some broad character portraits, a plot that seems to be heading down that Cinderella path, and a pretty unbelievable series of events leading to the crisis. So, I'm going to recommend this book to people exactly like me: Girls, read it first in your early teenage years and keep it in the back of your brain; then, every 10 or 15 years, as you pass through another stage of life, pick it up again. There's more in there, believe me--even in a foreign tongue!"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"I am a 14-year-old girl and a novice towards 19th century British lit. I've never read an Austen and I cannot compair this book to Wuthering Heights (as I have never read that one either). I can only offer my less than expert opinion.This book was very enjoyable, at times. Until Mr. Rochester shows up, however, the book is very slow. The heroine grows on you quickly, so it makes the reading more fun. Jane is likeable, and I certainly cared more and more about her as the book progressed. I liked how blunt she could be at times and how stubborn. She displayed a great deal of strengh and determination, in a tough world, without the gifts of beauty and fortune. Jane has to make it on her own steam, and I think that a lot of modern girls could learn from her example.The story line with Mr. Rochester's crazy wife is a bit random, but very interesting none-the-less, and it added a layer of mystery to the plot.The ending of this book irked me the most, however, because (without giving it away) everything sort of falls into place. This bugged me because, up until then, Jane had to overcome issues and, in the end, her happiness was more or less handed to her.My one other complaint is that dear Jane Eyre likes to ramble about God and life and whatever else she sees fit to ramble about. It is dull dull dull, as the young girl muses on and on in her own head and we have to sit through it.I still very much liked the book though, and I would recommend it to anyone looking for an interesting little romance with an awesome heroine."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"Jane Eyre is my very favorite book, and this is the copy I'll pass down to my grandchildren.

I exult with them momentarily, but their brightness fades quickly once I set down the book.Jane Eyre was different. So many of the book's elements defied nineteenth century convention; so many of the book's elements set my heart racing and my mind on edge. The unexpected first person perspective. Charlotte Bronte's mesmerizing lyrical prose. The strength--or, as the British might say, the pluck--of the book's indomitable heroine. The tenacity of Jane's love for Rochester and the reciprocal power of his love for her.I don't often cry when I read novels, but for the last twenty pages of Jane Eyre, I read transfixed while tears streamed down my face.

And it's all wrapped in the misty, haunting atmosphere of a true gothic story -- madwoman in the attic and all.Jane Eyre was an orphan, abused and neglected first by relatives, then by a boarding school run by a tyrannical, hypocritical minister. But Jane refuses to let anyone shove her down -- even when her saintly best friend dies from the wretched conditions.But many years later, Jane moves on by applying to Thornfield Hall for a governess position, and gets the job. She soon becomes the teacher and friend to the sprightly French girl Adele, but is struck by the dark, almost haunted feeling of her new home.Then she runs into a rather surly horseman -- who turns out to be her employer, Mr. Rochester, a cynical, embittered man who spends little time at Thornfield. They are slowly drawn together into a powerful love, despite their different social stations -- and Rochester's apparent attentions to a shallow, snotty aristocrat who wants his wealth and status.But strange things are happening at Thornfield -- stabbings, fires, and mysterious laughter. Jane and Rochester finally confess their feelings to each other, but their wedding is interrupted when Rochester's dark past comes to light. Jane flees into the arms of long-lost family members, and is offered a new life -- but her love for Rochester is not so easily forgotten...\\"Jane Eyre\\" is one of those books that transcends the labels of genre. Charlotte Bronte spun a haunting gothic romance around her semi-autobiographical heroine and Byronic anti-hero, filling it with brilliant writing and solid plot. It has everything all the other gothic romances of the time had... but Bronte gave it depth and intensity without resorting to melodrama.Bronte wrote in the usual stately prose of the time, but it has a sensual, lush quality, even in the dank early chapters at Lowood. At Thornfield, the book acquires an overhanging atmosphere of foreboding, until the clouds clear near the end. And she wove some tough questions into Jane's perspective -- that of a woman's independence and strength in a man's world, of extreme religion, and of the clash between morals and passion.And Bronte also avoided any tinges of drippy sentimentality (Mrs. Reed dies still spewing venom) while injecting some hauntingly nightmarish moments (\\"She sucked the blood: she said she'd drain my heart\\"). She even manages to include some funny stuff, such as Rochester disguising himself as an old gypsy woman.The story does slow down after the abortive wedding, when Jane flees Thornfield and briefly considers marrying a repressed clergyman who wants to go die preaching in India. It's rather boring to hear the self-consciously saintly St. John prattling about himself, instead of Rochester's barbed wit. But when Jane departs again, the plot speeds up into a nice, mellow little finale.Bronte did a brilliant job of bringing her heroine to life -- as a defiant little girl who is condemned for being \\"passionate,\\" as an independent young lady, and as a woman torn between love and principle. Jane's strong personality and wits overwhelm the basic fact that she's not unusually pretty. And Rochester is a brilliantly sexy Byronic anti-hero with a prickly, mercurial wit.Of Charlotte Bronte's few novels, \\"Jane Eyre\\" is undoubtedly the most brilliant -- passionate, dark and hauntingly eerie. Definitely a must-read."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"If you are a Jane Eyre fan, junkie, or a first time reader, this is a wonderful edition to pick up.

I thoroughly enjoyed this book and I read some parts over and over again. Sorry guys but this is mostly romance and drama. How the author tells the story and the plot are very interesting. This book is considered a classic. All of the characters are explained in such detail. You have a connection with Jane Eyre. When I read the back of this book there was one sentence in particular that caught my attention. I hope that will help you in thinking about reading this book. Jane Eyre is now one of my favorite books.\\"Published in 1847 under the pen name Currer Bell, the book heralded a new kind of heroine- one whose virtuous integrity, keen intellect, and tireless perserverance broke through class barriers to win equal stature with the man she loved.\\"That sentence and the quote at the top describe Jane Eyre best."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"Although I found this novel a bit too windswept, making it hard to turn the pages in an orderly fashion, I was awe-struck by its darkly gothic mood, the barely suppressed passions of its characters, and the threat of violent transgression that seems to haunt every scene like a towering shih-tzu.My gym teacher used to warn me about books like this. One morning after dodge-ball, he pulled me aside, put his hand on my shoulder, and said, \\"Son, I know your English teacher is having you read a lot of gothic Victorian novels about frightened young women who fall for mysterious, unattainable men with a dark side...\\" He leaned down and looked me straight in the eye. \\"You know I'm worried, don't you. I'm worried about your manhood. I'm worried you're going to waste that great gift you've been given, that great dodge-ball arm, and just -- \\"Oh forget it. I'll save the rest of this story for my therapist."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"Word has it that \\"Jane Eyre\\" is one of the most imitated novels in literature, having almost singlehandedly spawned the genre of romantic fiction which supplies all those erotic-looking pulp paperbacks you see next to the magazine rack at the supermarket. What I found in Charlotte Bronte's masterpiece, however, was a smart, resolute, and independent heroine who stands out like a beacon in a sea of Victorian fictional women. As if obeying some sort of literary convention, the book does have a sad beginning and a happy ending, but in between there are some very rich surprises: moments of mystery, tension, and ghostly images, delivered in a tightly paced narrative.Jane Eyre is an orphan who has spent the first ten years of her life with a mean aunt who mistreats her and the next eight years at a miserable school for indigent girls called Lowood. With this education, she qualifies herself as a teacher and secures a position as a governess at a house called Thornfield Hall. Her employer is a man twice her age named Edward Rochester, and her charge is his ward, a little girl of French parentage named Adele.Given that Jane soon falls in love with him, it might be guessed that Rochester is a dashing, noble, gallant gentleman; but no: He is unattractive, eccentric, shifty, assumes disguises, and rarely gives a straight answer to a question. These might merely be manifestations of a quirky, enigmatic personality, or maybe he is so evasive because he is hiding something from his past -- as indeed he is, and that \\"something,\\" incriminating and dangerous, is locked up in Thornfield Hall, unknown to Jane and most of the servants.Rochester falls in love with Jane, too, despite his apparent attention to a conceited society woman named Blanche Ingram. After a short courtship and a marriage proposal, however, Jane breaks off with him when she discovers his secret. Abandoning Thornfield Hall for a new life, she meets a young parson named St. John Rivers who is planning to go to India to do missionary work and would like to marry her because he thinks she too would make a good missionary. Thus, she has had to reject two men in her life: the first because he was not honest with her and made her feel used and deceived; the second because he is not looking for a wife, but a co-worker.Jane is not foolish, but she is human. That she returns to Rochester does not mean she has decided to accept his faults, but that she realizes they have developed that special kind of mutually dependent relationship that only two people who are truly in love may foster. By the end of the novel, Rochester loses a great deal because of his mistakes, and Jane's love is his only redemption; Jane, on the other hand, gains much because of the strength of her character, and Rochester's love is the fulfillment of her desire."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"The book, Jane Eyre, by Charlotte Bronte, is considered to be a work of genius, and with good reason. The story revolves around the life of an orphan, Jane Eyre, living in England in the 1900s. The book starts out during her childhood, when she lived with her cruel Aunt Reed and cousins Georgiana, John, and Eliza, and her years at the Lowood School as both a student and a teacher. Then, Jane takes a job as a governess at Thornfield Hall. When she lives there, she falls in love with her master, Edward Fairfax Rochester, and they plan to marry. But Jane's happiness is destroyed when she learns of the horrible secret Mr. Rochester has keeping from her, and she leaves him. A few years pass, and Jane is now the head master at a small school, when she learns that she has cousins who are still alive, which is very important to her. She lives with her cousins for awhile, but eventually returns to the love of her life, Mr. Rochester, because she misses him. When she returns to him, she learns of the many bad things which have befallen him and Thornfield Hall, but in the end, she is very content with her life.This is an excellent book, especially because of the way the main character, Jane Eyre, is portrayed. She is not perfect, because she isn't very attractive, or very well liked. She is very shy and has many personality flaws, including \\"a wicked heart, especially for such a young girl\\" ( pg. 39). But she also has many good qualities about her; she is very kind and humble. The book provides just the right balance of good and bad to make Jane Eyre a very real and likeable character. Another reason why Jane Eyre is such a great book is because although it is very long, over 600 pages, the book moves very quickly, and there are almost no long portions of the book where nothing happens. Anytime there was a lull in the book, a major event would occur and the plot would move quicker, thus making the book seem shorter than it really was. Another reason why this book was so good was that it was a great picture of life for women in the 1900s. The book really showed that all that most women possessed was there title, and if they lost that, then they had nothing. However, Jane Eyre managed to rise above this, and in the end, the book's moral was about rising above your position in life, so that you could be truly happy.However, some people might disagree with my view on this book. Jane Eyre is at times a very sad book, and not everyone likes a sad book. Although Jane is generally happy, there is always a touch of sadness in her words and actions, which is why not everyone would agree with my review. However, there is plenty of good to out way the bad. This is a very interesting and compelling book which is very highly recommended. The plot is full of interesting people and places, it is written beautifully, and is a definite must read."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"I still have the copy of &quot;Jane Eyre&quot; I first read when I was 12 years-old--it is now worn with love and many readings. I can think of no higher compliment to a book than to see its pages worn, cover creased by repeated use. With every reading over the years, I have gained new insight into Jane and Rochester.Jane is (as she describes herself) &quot;poor, obscure, plain and little&quot;, but she is also possesses incredible strength and conviction. Rochester is her match in passion, a dark and complicated hero. Theirs is a love story of two equals. Nowadays, this may seem commonplace (though, unfortunately, not as common as we may think); in Charlotte Bronte's time, this was a major revelation. Indeed, it was considered scandalous. Imagine--a woman asserting her own ideals and independence, considering herself equal to a man! Shocking!I have heard some say that they believe Emily Bronte's &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; to be the masterpiece of the Bronte family. While I loved that book, its protagonists cannot begin to compete with the strong, complex characters that Charlotte Bronte has given us. &quot;Jane Eyre&quot; is not only the masterwork of the Bronte family; it is one of the greatest books of the nineteenth century.Because I love this book so much, I cannot truly do it justice in this review. Please read it if you have not before. If you read it long ago, read it again. I promise you a great read and moving experience!"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"A Realistic, Relatable Fairy Tale, by Michelle Giullain, student of Professor SWILUASome people never get sick of fairy tales. I, for one, have an incredible ability to hear the same story over and over again and never tire. Every once in a while, though, I crave something a little more realistic, while still maintaining that fairy tale \`happily ever after' ending. It is hard to appeal to both sides of the spectrum, but Charlotte Bronte's Jane Eyre accomplishes this daunting task. Though it does have the typical fairy tale ending, it is a novel the audience can relate to. Instead of a fairy tale princess, Jane Eyre is the fairy tale story of a plain girl who faces real struggles. Bronte's realistic, relatable characters who face normal struggles allow the reader to relate to the novel, making it a book that will be thoroughly enjoyed for years to come.The characterization Bronte uses is truly genius, combining archetypal characters with human flaws. Oddly enough, it contains some of the fairy tale archetypes we are oh so familiar with, the evil stepmother and stepsisters. In this case, it is an abusive aunt and her spoiled children, but they fulfill the same role. Other archetypes, such as the sacrificial best friend, Helen Burns, and the crazy ex, Bertha, all show up in the novel. It speaks to the reader's emotions, because everyone has and archetypal figure in their life of some form. Whether or not you have an evil stepmother, or mother in law, it is comforting to read about other people who go through the same struggles as you, especially if your ex is still haunting you.Additionally, the characterization of the protagonist, Jane Eyre, gives the reader a direct connection to the novel. Her imperfections are what make her so perfect. Her outside appearance pales in comparison to the beautiful princesses, literally. Her pale skin and her plain face do not match the description of the usual princess. But, because Jane is not perfect, the audience can relate to her. Not many of us look just like a princess, have a castle, or a fairy godmother to grant our every wish. When we read about someone who isn't that beautiful, those who feel they are not as beautiful as Cinderella have someone to relate to. However, it is not only the outer appearance that makes Jane so ideal. She also has character flaws. She does not posses the patience to tame a beast, like Belle, or Snow White's affinity to the caretaking of small innocent creatures. Rather, her honesty and stubbornness, un-princess like qualities, show that she is human. She is not entirely confident in herself and feels loneliness. In her own words, \\"I abhorred myself...I was hateful in my own eyes\\" (329). Though we may not loathe ourselves all of the time, there are many instances in which a normal human in the normal world would not like themselves. This additional perspective into the imperfect Jane helps the reader connect to the book.Bronte also makes the other character's flaws apparent, especially in the man Jane comes to love. Prince not-so-charming, Rochester, has his own flaws inside and out. He, like Jane, is not beautiful, dashing, or handsome. He is rustic, unrefined, and unkind and that is not all. He tries to control Jane's actions and play with her mind. He has hidden baggage, too. His crazy wife, Bertha, is locked up in his attic. By the end, however, he has proven that he is a good person, just like Jane. He heroically tries to save his servants and crazy wife from his burning house, and loses an eye in the process. The key to the audience connection is the imperfection of not only Jane, but also Rochester. For, how possible would it be that Jane could find a dashing prince charming when she is not beautiful? And if Rochester were handsome, why would he pursue a relationship with a plain Jane? The two is absolutely perfect for each other. To the reader, it makes perfect sense that these two imperfect characters should get together. And, it might even remind them of their own romantic endeavors, or give them a little hope for the future.Beyond the imperfect characters, the relationship between the characters also contributes to the appeal to the audience by creating even more reality amid a fairy tale story. The Rochester-Jane romance is not a love at first sight experience, even though she does sweep him off his feet. (Actually, his horse slips on the ice the first time they cross paths, but that is not really the same thing). Though Prince Charming and Cinderella lacked a bit of communication, they never had any significant relationship problems. Snow white didn't even need to meet her Prince. One kiss and he made her feel alive. However, like most human relationships, Jane and Rochester fight, argue, feel jealously and hurt. They keep secrets and experience disappointments. Rochester invites a party of beautiful women to his house to make Jane jealous. Then, on the morning of their wedding, she finds out that he has a wife in the attic. Jane then runs away because she cannot bear the thought of being a mistress to Rochester. Rochester is devastated and almost gives up living because he has lost Jane. Though they love each other, their relationship is not always perfect. Jane Eyre has no magic spells, princes, dragons, or balls. She has to deal with real life in the real world of relationships. Because this is more like the world we live in, the audience, who has likely experienced jealousy and conflict in a relationship, is able to see themselves in the story.Alas, all is well in the end, once the real life struggles are over. This fairy tale ending is the perfect finishing to the story, because it what the reader \`wants'. Though life doesn't always follow that pattern, sometimes it does. For Jane, something finally went right. Not many sentences in the novel provide as much joy as the simple declaration, \\"Reader, I married him\\" (462). Jane Eyre finds the love she has always wanted, and the reader, at that moment, experiences a small moment of triumph. That moment is the defining emotional moment of the novel, and what makes this novel so appealing to an audience. But, that is the same with any fairy tale.Because Jane Eyre does not simply focus on the \`happily ever after', but integrates the story into a complicated and realistic plot, it is a more believable story. The book does not begin or end with the usual \`Once upon a time\\" and \\"Happily ever after\\", nor does it focus on the marriage and courtship between the two characters. Jane has struggles throughout the novel, from the abusive cousins to the malnutrition at school to nearly dying from exhaustion. Even after she marries Rochester, she must deal with a blind husband who is an emotional wreck. With small triumphs are placed intermittently between many struggles, it reflects what life is like for the audience, and anyone who lives in the real world, for that matter. Jane may have struggles, but she sees the fulfillments of her dream.Ultimately, those who live in the real world have the opportunity to escape into a book that isn't just about some perfect fictional character in a far away kingdom. Jane Eyre is about the same world we live in because it presents the struggles many of us face, and the triumphs that even plain Jane can experience. No matter what time you may be reading this novel, the breadth of the archetypes and the imperfections of the characters give you the opportunity to enjoy and relate to this beautifully crafted novel. If you have not had the privilege to read this book, do so at once! You will be rewarded by one of the most enriching and inspiring books out there."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"Jane Eyre is written by Charlotte Bronte, who is a famous female novelist in England during nineteen century. This is also the first famous book she wrote. The book was written in Sheffield, England which is also the hometown of Charlotte. A lot of people consider this book Charlotte's autobiography. That's not exactly true but we still can find many personal experiences of Charlotte's in that book. The entire book's theme shows the values that humans should always live with dignity and love.The book tells a story about a woman named Jane Eyre. Jane was born in a very poor churchman's family and her parents died of enterotyphus when she was very young. She had to live in her uncle's family. Her aunt was a very mean and snobbish woman. She used a lot of ways to abuse Jane and even taught her child to bully Jane. Jane lived there for ten years, but she never yielded to her aunt so her aunt just treated her worse and worse. After Jane's uncle died, her aunt sent her to an orphanage. Although the life in the orphanage was still hard, and children there could not get enough food and the teachers treat them very curly, Jane got her first friend in the orphanage, a girl named Helen. Helen gave Jane much comfort and support but this happiness for her did not last too long; Helen also died by enterotyphus. After that the orphanage improved. Jane studied there for six years and taught there for two more years. Then she left the orphanage and was hired by the steward of Thornfield Hall as a tutor. Thornfiled was a big manor owned by Edward Fairfax Rochester. The life in Thornfield was good and after a long time Mr. Rochester spent with Jane, he was deeply attracted by Jane's dignified character. Jane also fell in love with Mr. Rochester. Before their marriage, bad news come, Jane was told that Mr. Rochester was already married and his violently insane wife was locked in Thornfield Hall. Jane could not bear this shock and left Thronfiled manor. Her life truned harder after she left Thornfield. After a few months later, a clergyman named St. John took Jane in and gave her a job teaching at a local school. One day, Jane got a large amount of money as inheritance from her dead uncle, which her aunt had been keeping from her, Jane also learned from her aunt that St. John is her cousin. At this time St. John asks Jane to marry him and go to India to do missionary work. Jane refused him and realized she was still in love with Mr. Rochester so she decided to go back to him. When she came back to Thornfield Hall, it had already become a ruin. She was told that after she left, the insane woman set a fire in Thornfild Hall, and died during the fire. Mr. Rochester also was hurt during the fire. When Jane returned to him, he was not rich anymore and had become a poor disabled man. But Jane did not care about this at all; she found Mr. Rochester and married him.I strongly recommend Jane Eyre. This novel is very engaging. The plot of the novel is continuous and changes a lot. Every girl should read this book because it teaches you how to be an independent woman with dignity. There are so many characteristics of Jane's that are very valuable in today's society.When I first connected with Jane Eyre, I was a fairytale age girl. Strange thing was when my mother read the novel for me; I was fell in love with it very soon. The story was interesting and I was always curious about what's happen next. Little Jane's poor experiences and her brave impressed me deeply. Those contents really motivated me a strong sense of compassion which is really important for every child in their growth. I still remember when I knew that Jane was locked in a dark room by her aunt. I felt so worry about her and after her recovered form that disaster, I felt so happy for her. That's definitely a good lecture for me that how to share the same feeling with a friend. Little Jane also taught me that no matter how bad thing you experience, you should keep your heart pure and dignity, and always fight against unfair rules until you get the freedom. One more important thing I learned from the book is grasp every opportunity to study. Jane read a lot of book during she lived under her aunt abuse, she learned so much in the orphanage. The difference between Jane and others is she never gives up study or the process to enrich her inner world no matter how terrible the outside environment is. She successfully transfers her miserable live to her tenacious soul. All of these made her a thoughtful woman, and that also the reason for Mr. Rochester is attracted by Jane.The second time I read Jane Eyre was during my high school. At that period I was very depressed due to a heavy course load and a sharp competition. In an unexpected chance, I decided read Jane Eyre again. From I opened the book; I could not drop it any more. I finished it in three days. During I read the book, I felt so peaceful and calm. That's exactly what I needed for that period and I had lost this feeling for a long time. Beside my spiritual enjoyment, the book also gives me a strong influence on my value system. Until now, I still strongly believe that true love should build on the respect of each other. That's what Jane Eyre told me. This time I have a deeper understanding on the relationship between Jane Eyre and Edward Fairfax Rochester. At the beginning, Edward is a rich, strong and talented upper class man. But the real of him is a lonely heart, until he met Jane. A lot of women approach him in order of him money, but Jane is totally different. She did not care about him money or his social statue, she care about him just because she loves Edward and she really wants to comfort him from his painful experiences. Edward also loves Jane and appreciates her. He respects Jane and views her as his true friend in soul, he likes to talk with Jane and share his feeling with her. Their love is deep and stable. The ending of the story is not perfect but it's the best ending for Jane. She needn't choose from her love or her majesty. She obtains both of them. In the end, Edward became an old and poor blind man, but Jane still married with him. The only thing changed is they love each other deeper. This ending emphasizes Jane's characteristics as well as the substance of the book, which is the wroth of live should be respect and love.The negative part of Jane Eyre is the writer strength too much on Jane's insistence and independence. But in real world, things may much more complexes and cannot be overcome just by insistence and independence. However, I still believe Jane's characteristics will always shining in all times. Another negative echo for Jane Eyre is the book is not profundity enough. It only tells a story about a woman's life and her love experience, it did not tell enough about the time-background or the class contradiction. But I think that's just the reason that Jane Eyre do not bring too much heaviness to reader but the enjoyable feeling.All in all, I love the novel Jane Eyre. I believe everyone should read it; because it likes a cup of ice water, simple and clean, purify every reader's sprite."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"I love this book. I am a hopeless romantic and I read this book because it is a classic, but I thought it would be boring. I was so wrong. The love in this book is so good! I love how Mr. Rochester is so witty -he is so smart and i don't know, his wittiness just makes him really attractive. I love it how he is a bit out there and he is always asking for her hand, he shows simple ways that he wants Jane. I love how he was trying to make her jealous, I don't know why I just like it! I love how he treats her when they are together, like she is so precious to him. The way he explains his love, I just want to swoon and have someone say these things to me. He is a bit odd though, but it suited him. There were such funny moments between them also! Even though he is not described as handsome, It doesn't matter- the affection he feels for her is just beautiful, something which is hard to find. But he has a secret and things happen....I have read many romantic books and this is my all time favorite even though this isnt really classified as romance. This book doesn't have things that a romance book has like shagging scenes. That makes it all the better because the dialoge is so good that you don't need scenes like that. I love when the characters in a book really get to know eachother before they fall in love and in many romance books you won't find that. I take out this book almost every week to reread what I feel are the good parts; I look foward to doing that in free time that is how good it is. I don't know what your tastes are in books but this book is as good as it gets for me. There are times where it does get a bit slow, but I just love to read the bits with Jane and Mr. Rochester; they just make the book. I love the scene where she is leaving and he asks her about money; it is very funny."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"It is said that you accidentally trip on a stone and find it out to be a gem. Jane Eyre for me is something like tripping on a book full of gems. Never in my life, have I ever read for which my heart has so passionately cried, laughed and felt sad. Every page of this book is craftfully written to make you want read the next. Oh, from where does the author gets a vision to make someone cry over what are essentially black inked words. When Jane leaves Rochester to go to the Moors, my heart really sanked into an oblivion. And when she came back was overjoyed as though Jane Eyre is me. Right from the first page till the last, the author has painted a picture. One that induces you to travel with Jane from her childhood to adulthood. A piece of gem, one that you can cherish for ever. As a reviewer had written earlier, it is one that would force you to give up watching that stupid idiot box, it really does. At least it did that for me."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"Someone below complained that only English teachers were giving this book 5-star ratings. And while I'm guilty of this, it's the other way around: I don't love this book because I'm an English teacher. I became an English teacher (in part) because I have always loved this book. I suspect there's been a school project somewhere requiring the class to write Amazon reviews of JE. If that's the case, hang in there, kids: it's a spooky, touching, dramatic story, well worth some of the less interesting bits (like the St. John subplot). Not all of you will like it, and yes, the language can be a bit difficult. (In case this shows up on the test, it's Victorian, not Old English--a difference of approximately 1000 years.) You don't have to love it or have it change your life. But it's a window into the literary tastes of the past (almost like 19th-C chick lit), which shaped and reflected pretty much all other ideology of the time. That's why it's important, and that's why a lot of people, even those who didn't have to read it (like me), continue to genuinely love it.My only problem is with the ending. It still bugs me that Jane can be so powerful and end up doing such a cop-out. I hate to think that Bronte was pandering to popular taste, but that's the only explanation I can think of."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"I adored this book. I cried over and over again. Jane Eyre is beautifully wtitten. I give a standing ovation to Ms. Bronte."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"Odd, how re-reading a classic can become a meaningful experience. I'm sure I read Jane Eyre at least two times when I was in high school and again at college. Then there were the films, the most memorable being the one with William Hurt playing Rochester. Yet, last weekend when I was visiting friends and had nothing at hand, I looked at the first chapter and thought &quot;I've don't remember any of this,&quot; and was hooked.No wonder this book endures and no wonder that readers are entranced: it is an extraordinary story of an individual's struggle to live in a harsh world, find and create physical comfort and sustain an unacceptable love. Even though the story is intensely atmospheric (food, structures, furniture, temperature, clothes and flora are in constant reference), it is Jane herself who drives the story. Where she will find herself and what she will do next is the surprise. No wonder feminists were interested in this book: Jane never succumbs to anyone's idea of what she should do, she wrestles with decisions and bases her choices (that she insists on having choises is already delightful) on her own moral, social code. Hard choices she makes too and we wonder if she'll manage when, for example, she leaves Thornfield and finds herself forced to beg for food.The writing is sharp and intelligent and...funny too: take, for example, the little girls toppling off their stools during prayers, or the description of Adele's &quot;French&quot; personality. The plot is a stretch but a loveable one. Jane, we are told often, has neither beauty nor stature, the type of person that gets ignored in any social situation. However, this seemingly ineffectual person has two highbrow offers of marriage,inherits a fortune and reaps the bounty of a geniune, loving relationship with the one man who is her intellectual and emotional equal. Not bad for a poor, plain governess in the 1830s.Today, it might be that religion, scripture and even the idea of morality are concepts that carry too much weight for popular fiction. Jane, a level-headed girl, is neither silly nor preachy. That her thoughts are informed with the religious moral tone of the period makes this story more than a romance or tale of finding true love. It demonstrates how conviction is founded."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"I throroughly enjoyed reading Jane Eyre. Although it was quite lengthy, it was filled with suspense and excitement. I feel that Jane Eyre was a strong, independent and proud character which makes her a great role model for women and children. From when she is only ten years old she already possesses courage, honesty and generosity despite her unpleasant life. Going to Lowood School only adds to her miserable childhood, but somehow she has the strength to overcome it and move on. Even though she is a poor, unattractive woman in the Victorian era she believes in economic and social equality. When she meets Rochester he is amazed at her intelligence, wit and frankness and though he is a man, she is his intellectual equal. When she realizes she must leaves Edward, she is able to resist the temptation of being with him to uphold her strong morals. This is also a very commendable quality that Jane Eyre possesses. Through her determination, she is able to survive poverty and loneliness and find a home with the Rivers. Here she exhibits true generosity when she divides her fortune among her new found friends. Again, she resists the temptation of a good home and safety and leaves St. John to find her lost love. Jane shows compassion when she decides to stay with Rochester for he rest of her life, and nurse him in his unhealthy state. Reading about a woman like Jane Eyre is very empowering and it makes you want to be a better person. Cudos to Charlotte Bronte for a novel very (long and) well written."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"Lost yet somewhat hopeful, Jane Eyre spent some of her child hood with an evil aunt after her parents had past. Troubled by the haunted shadows that lurk in her mind, young Jane decides that she needs change in her life. Slowly yet surely she does find some happiness which appears to be a struggle. The character, Jane, seems vulnerable throughout the telling of the story. At the age of eighteen, Jane finally presents herself in a newspaper as a governess. As a penniless orphan, Jane Eyre is appointed as a governess at Thornfield Hall by the mysterious Mr. Rochester. Her integrity and independence are tested to the limit as their love for each other grows, and the secrets of Mr. Rochester's past are revealed.This story tells of a young woman, Jane Eyre, who makes modesty and plainness appear to be the most noble and admirable qualities in a young woman. She learned over time to be independent and had developed a strong mind. It's almost a romance novel underneath all the inner searching. She struggles through many obstacles and when faced with them, she does what is right for her and no one else. What I liked about it the most is that it was a real person's story to some extent. It glorified female independence and seemed almost like a fairy tale. Jane Eyre becomes someone because she puts in her best effort, not because of a wish, or a dream, or someone else's pity. She made herself beautiful in the way she saw fit.This incredible book brings detail of what's written and both love and sadness that people can relate to. An example of this would be Jane as she was experiencing friendship for the first time when she started school and then had lost someone she's close to. If you're a person who loves romance novels then I recommend this book to you. She is a great role model for women today. And this should be read if over the age of fourteen and up."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"I am only 12 years old but at least read a book a week.

The numerous movie versions of it, including the most recent, never do Bronte's prose justice. I believe all modern romance novels sprang from the Bronte sisters' great works, Jane Eyre and Wuthering Heights. Jane Eyre is the more tightly wound of the two. Charlotte spins Jane's interior monologue and her emotional dialog with Rochester into a taut emotional web at the core of Jane, who is a complex and powerful lead character. Rochester is painted as an aloof, arrogant elitist, who is then humanized as Jane's gentler character opens him up.The story itself is masterfully plotted with the same craft and care as the characterizations.

It has romance and action. Everything you could want in a good book. This is one of those rare classics that are actually cool."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"Whew...I finally finished! I have been holding on to this book since April 2011. It's not because the book was loathsome but because I began to feel as if Jane and I had become friends. As crazy as that may sound, I really hated for this book to end because it felt as if I was parting ways with an old friend.We are introduced to Jane Eyre as a young orphan residing with her uncle's (deceased) wife, Mrs. Reed, and three cousins. Jane was not welcome in their home and was sent to Lowood boarding school. The conditions at Lowood were horrible. Lowood was about survival and Jane soon found out that some didn't. Jane remained at Lowood until she was nineteen where she then transferred to Thornfield Hall to become a governess. It is at Thornfield Hall where Jane's strong resolve and concrete emotions are put to the ultimate test. Here is where the love story begins. Jane and her new employer Edward Rochester fall in love but not without challenges. Even though it was the perfect fairy tale \\"rich man falls in love with lonely orphan,\\" this is where the story takes a turn. Mr. Rochester has a secret. Just when you think nothing else bad can happen to Jane worse knocks the door down.Needless to say Jane had to flee Thornfield Hall abruptly without any direction or much else. She was stranded, starving, and sick when she ended up on the door step of a family that would nurse her back to health. The Rivers family took Jane in and she began to gain her strength mentally, emotionally, and physically. The family was made up of two sisters and a brother. Jane became instant friends with them all. The brother, St. John Rivers, actually discovered the destitute Jane who had been turned away initially by the family servant. During her season with the Rivers family, Jane received one of the best revelations of her life. Her ending up on the door step of the Rivers home was not a coincidence it was \\"divine\\" intervention. St. John Rivers had other plans for Jane once he had studied her for a while. St. John is very stoic and manipulating individual all under the guise of \\"minister.\\" Jane does not fall for his manipulative tactics and follows her heart back to Thornfield Hall. When she arrives at Thornfield Hall she stumbles upon a shocking and horrifying surprise.Jane Eyre is just a \\"boss\\" type chick (if can describe her in hip-hop terms). She faced some insurmountable odds but all these back to back hardships birthed a certain unexplainable resilience in her. Jane was not easily broken because she was grounded in her faith. Bronte developed a character that we need to encourage all young women to read and get to know. Jane didn't succumb to fleshly temptations but instead she fled and this led to a great rewards. Jane's valley experiences let her to a mountaintop of blessings and real love.This book is a classic that has been reviewed numerous times. Most that read Jane's story count her as an old friend because they have been reading her story since high school. Prior to reading this book, I saw several references to it being \\"gothic\\" and there is even a goth illustrated edition. As I read, I began to think it should be categorized as \\"Christian\\" fiction. I absolutely fell in love with all the Biblical references and how grace and faith played major roles throughout the entire story.

And it's all wrapped in the misty, haunting atmosphere of a true gothic story -- madwoman in the attic and all.Jane Eyre was an orphan, abused and neglected first by relatives, then by a boarding school run by a tyrannical, hypocritical minister. But Jane refuses to let anyone shove her down -- even when her saintly best friend dies from the wretched conditions.But many years later, Jane moves on by applying to Thornfield Hall for a governess position, and gets the job.

Jane flees into the arms of long-lost family members, and is offered a new life -- but her love for Rochester is not so easily forgotten...\\"Jane Eyre\\" is one of those books that transcends the labels of genre. Charlotte Bronte spun a haunting gothic romance around her semi-autobiographical heroine and Byronic anti-hero, filling it with brilliant writing and solid plot. It has everything all the other gothic romances of the time had... but Bronte gave it depth and intensity without resorting to melodrama.Bronte wrote in the usual stately prose of the time, but it has a sensual, lush quality, even in the dank early chapters at Lowood. At Thornfield, the book acquires an overhanging atmosphere of foreboding, until the clouds clear near the end. And she wove some tough questions into Jane's perspective -- that of a woman's independence and strength in a man's world, of extreme religion, and of the clash between morals and passion.And Bronte also avoided any tinges of drippy sentimentality (Mrs. Reed dies still spewing venom) while injecting some hauntingly nightmarish moments (\\"She sucked the blood: she said she'd drain my heart\\"). She even manages to include some funny stuff, such as Rochester disguising himself as an old gypsy woman.The story does slow down after the abortive wedding, when Jane flees Thornfield and briefly considers marrying a repressed clergyman who wants to go die preaching in India. It's rather boring to hear the self-consciously saintly St. John prattling about himself, instead of Rochester's barbed wit. But when Jane departs again, the plot speeds up into a nice, mellow little finale.Bronte did a brilliant job of bringing her heroine to life -- as a defiant little girl who is condemned for being \\"passionate,\\" as an independent young lady, and as a woman torn between love and principle. Jane's strong personality and wits overwhelm the basic fact that she's not unusually pretty. And Rochester is a brilliantly sexy Byronic anti-hero with a prickly, mercurial wit.This particular edition is illustrated by Dame Darcy (who looks pretty interesting if the back cover is any indicator), and it's definitely a good supplement to the book -- dark, a little creepy, yet also vaguely quirky in a childlike way.Of Charlotte Bronte's few novels, \\"Jane Eyre\\" is undoubtedly the most brilliant -- passionate, dark and hauntingly eerie.

Not long after she was born her parents died of typhus by caring for the poor. Growing up and being raised in Gateshead by her aunt was not easy. This orphan girl never got loved from her aunt \\"Mrs. Reed\\" or her cousins \\"Eliza, Georgina\\", and her bullying cousin \\"John.\\" She was like any other child, trying to survive in this world. For the Reed's being an orphan is not good enough. Jane was treated like she was not part of the family and was living a life of negligence and abuse. \\"I am glad you are no relation of mine. I will never call you aunt again as long as I live. I will never come to visit you when I am growing up; and if any one asks me how I liked you, and how you treated me, I will say the thought of you makes me sick...\\" Every moment that passed by with every inch of every word that came from Jane's mouth we can see that she had hatred inside of her knowing that it did not develop alone.After a visit from the family apothecary, he suggests Mrs. Reed to send Jane to a school where maybe she may find happiness. Mrs. Reed decided to send Jane to Lowood for free, to an orphan school where she was treated harshly and overworked. Growing up in this school made her stronger. Six years later she became a teacher in the same school where she was treated crudely and her best friend died. Then she decided to move out to a new city, Thornfield. There a new journey and life will begin but....What is waiting for her? Is it worse than what she has been through? What can she really expect? Can she support more cruelty? The answers lies ahead in the book called Jane Eyre by the author Charlotte Bronte."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"This book is one of my favorite books of all time.

It's an asorbing page turner, causing you to grunt and yell aloud at the stupidity and density the two main characters seem to live on. This is thee original romance novel; introducing you to memorable characters and plotlines. It's said to be gothic, and in a sweet, quaint way it is. The narrator is a plain girl, who has morals and lives by them(however much it makes you scream). The fancied is Edward Rochester, a genius in his own right, with brilliant plans. The hidden secret-- it's a shock. (Just don't let anyone tell you beforehand). This book gets five stars, because of all it contains (or, rather, because it leaves out nothing a great novel should have)."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"I know, trite title for a review.

I recommend buying a hardcover copy that you can keep forever."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"I read the book Jane Eyre once when I was in 5th or 6th grade (or possible the summer in-between...?) and I absolutely LOVED it. I read it again the summer after seventh grade (last summer) and I still love it just as much. It's one of those books that you can just read over and over and over....and you never get tired of it. Charlotte Bronte tells Jane's heartbreaking storing of being mistreated as a child and growing up into a shy, reserved young adult so well. I can see everything in the book happening as I read it. I especially love the ending - I'm so glad it's a happy one. This book is SO a two thumbs up in my opinion!"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"One of the things that I liked most about \\"Wuthering Heights\\", by Charlotte Bronte's sister Emily, was the \\"scenery\\", the way in which the author conveyed a weather, an opressive environment, a climate of tension and impending doom. In Jane Eyre this too happens, but in a different way. For one thing, the characters move around more and it is not always foggy and rainy. You can actually see the novel like a film, and feel the damp air and the ominous silence.\\"Jane Eyre\\" tells the story of a woman, since her childhood. The orphaned daughter of a poor Anglican priest, she goes to live with his uncle and aunt, but the man soon dies and she is left to live under the iron fist of the aunt, a horrible woman with horrible kids who torment Jane constantly. Of course, we get only her version, since the book is narrated in the first person. After an incident when Jane is left to terrorize in the \\"red room\\", where her uncle died and where she fears his ghost will appear, she gets out of control and sent to an orphanatory. A brief digresson is worth here: ever since she is a child, Jane shows enormous self-assurance and pride. Her strong character refuses to be mistreated, and she reacts even violently to injustice. Her personality will grow through the novel, giving her the endurance to sustain repeated blows of fate. So she goes to the orphanatory, where after a period of incredible suffering and mistreatment, she finds a home and a friend in one of the school teachers (a young woman). She becomes a teacher herself, and when she's 18 she feels the time to fly away has come, so she advertises in a newspaper as a tutor for children. She receives a positive answer and moves to a manor house far in the countryside, the typical Bronte scene in the moors. The job consists in teaching a young French girl, with whom she develops a strong, if not too intimate, bond. But, and it's a big but, there is a mystery. The girl is not (at least not legally) the manor's lord's daughter. He's not even there when Jane is hired. He's supposed to be a stern, unpredictable man near his forties called Mr. Rochester. Finally the man appears, and he and Jane slowly develop a strange relationship. He's initially cold and sarcastic, but somehow he becomes impressed by the girl's strong character, ability for irony, and her unwillingness to be defeated. As time goes by, the other mystery of the house starts to intrigue Jane: in the third floor there's a locked room, from where sometimes come, muffled, a hysterical laughter and incoherent and incomprehensible words. Jane is led to believe it's one of the servants, an efficient but \\"strange\\" person. Subsequent episodes not worth revealing in a review slowly happen, and believe me they are terrifying, Gothic and violent. Little by little Jane falls in love with Mr. Rochester, but it takes time for it to dawn upon her, and at some point, when she realizes, she realizes too taht she has no chance. He's rich, she's a poor thing without a name, heritage or fortune. She thinks he's going to marry a beautiful and arrogant woman from the neighborhood. One day, the horrible aunt gets terminally sick, and Jane is sent for. She shows remarkable ability for forgiveness and stands by her aunt's side until the witch finally dies. When she comes back to Mr. Rochester's house, she will find her Fate, which I won't spoil for you.This rare novel is a jewel. First, because of the perfect construction of the character, indeed a person. Even though unbelievable coincidences happen sometimes in the novel, Jane is created so well that she is totally fleshed out before us. She is rather plain and short, a tiny, seemingly insignificant woman. But in truth she happens to be charming, funny, a little shy but courageous to the point of recklesness. She has a penetrating and acid sense of humor. Jane's life is an example of braveness, of the truly free individual creating his or her own destiny. Sometimes you just want to take her in your arms and comfort her, only to receive a bitter comment. At the time the novel was published, it raised eyebrows for the uncondescending presentation of an independent woman, always figthing for her rights and conscious of her being a free spirit, slave to no one. Jane is easily on of the best created character is all literature. For people like us, usually living in big noisy cities, experiencing life in the moors is a refreshing, even if sometimes terrifying, thing.Finally, \\"Jane Eyre\\", like \\"Wuthering Heights\\", is totally original literature. It comes from the fantasies and dreams of a woman who, like her sisters, lived practically isolated from the outer world, from the inelligentsia and from any literary or political circles. The Brontes were girls from the wild, and lived tragic and Gothic lives which get greatly reflectd in their books. Excellent."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"And each time I still find something new to love. On about the fifth or sixth reading, you finally start reading all those long descriptions word for word rather than breezing through for plot. They're wonderful and frequently humerous. Bronte has a tremendous sense of humor.My favorite things about the work are its humor and how it attacks fundamentalist Protestant Christianity while embracing Christianity. Unfortunately it has little tolerance for Catholicism. But that is only a minor theme and I think Charlotte Bronte herself was much more liberal minded when she was dealing with particular individuals rather than stereotypes. At the very least it is a lesson in the prejudices of her day.Jane Eyre is ultimately a fairy tale. Everything is made right in the end. But it has far more edge than a mere romance. How many romances have ten year olds telling off the fundamentalist ministers who threaten them with hell? How many of them have the eight year old outlive her anger and grow into a generous and forgiving spirit. How many mere romances rely so heavily on playful intellectual banter? Jane Eyre is Cinderella and she is rescued not by beauty and a fairy godmother and pumpkin coach, but by wit and heart."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"This book was a complete surprise to me. I started the book not knowing anything about it, and finished with a new favorite book. The story is captivating, the characters are distinct and well realized, and I simply could not put it down!"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"A young girl is orphaned as a baby and is entrusted to her uncle and his family. When her uncle dies, it falls to her aunt to provide her care. Unfortunately, her aunt despises the young girl and eventually finds a way to send the young girl away. The young girl, Jane Eyre, enters a boarding school for girls of less significant means and it is there she can truly begin to take charge of her life and where her adventures, so to speak, begin.Jane Eyre did catch me up immediately and keep me involved through the first half of the book. It moved fairly quickly. However, I thought the story dragged a bit about halfway and throughout the second half. Personally, I found the book suffered from what most Romance era and Gothic writers had an affinity for: why use 5 words when 15 or 20 will do. The novel became wordy and overlong at times and I found myself putting it down for long periods of time. Quite frankly, I think the story is better told in the myriad of movies that have been released. I am quite at a loss as to exactly why this novel is such the classic it is.The character of Jane Eyre bothered me as well, but I think she was more truthfully written and my dislike reflects the wordy nature of the book. Jane is morally strong - and that is to be admired - but she is so emotionally cold - I never imagined her being \\"in love,\\" passionate or otherwise. Even though she states she is in love, there seems to be no passion or fire. What an oddly matched pair! Though, I get the same feelings when I read Jane Austen, so perhaps readers of Ms. Austen's novels will appreciate this one.This novel is not all terrible, despite what I've said. It is engaging, though I think parts can be skimmed. Those who absolutely adore Gothic romance will love it. Those of us who find Gothic romance dull and dreary will find this novel less than enchanting."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"This is such a great book.

I only read it because it was free. Maybe an English major would appreciate it more."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"Anyone who has read Jane Eyre will be more than ready to assert that there is more to this novel than just a protracted love story. There's the issue of class boundaries, marriage, faith and religious zealotry, self-realization, the circumstance of women in Victorian times, and so on. But being a self-confessed simpering romantic, I have no choice but to focus on my favorite theme.I loved Jane most whenever she's in the company of Mr Rochester, or even when she's just thinking about him. Somehow, for me, she becomes quite fervent, feels more human and behaves more womanly. Plus, I loved the fact that the author fully expressed in words the love that Mr Rochester himself feels for our eccentric heroine--so passionate, in fact, that I think some readers may gag at the \\"syrupy-ness\\" of his avowals. Not for me though. In fact, I feel a sort of regret that such emotion from a male character is rarely encountered in romance novels nowadays.Though a bit rough for me to begin with, Jane Eyre, as both the novel and the woman, became engaging as the story progressed. Dark, emotional, often dialectic, at times drily humorous, this story is sure to be remembered for a long while."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"if i had to say anything about jane it would be that she seems to revel in pain. the injustic of her childhood caused it i suppose or, perhaps, she was always that way. was rodchesters wife crazy before she was locked up? or did locking her up make her that way? well, jane seems to like to be in pain and rodchester seems to like to cause it, they make a happy pair. it was a dark book with a happy ever after, as happily ever after as a dark book can be.the book was interesting, clear and well written though something of a slow read."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"With an unexciting introduction of Jane's abusive childhood, Jane Eyre later develops into a dramatic struggle in search of autonomy and love. The story constantly shifts between poignant moments in Jane's life and triumphant ones. Like a typical classic, the novel starts with an abusive childhood and ends with a happy marriage. As mundane as it may sound, the story is unique and the reader grows to respect Jane for the hard choices she makes.Jane struggles to choose between her passionate love story and desire for independence, asserting that satisfaction results from a balance between emotions and desire. Jane develops from a miserable and mistreated child, to a well-respected and independent woman after she learns to discern between passion and reason.Jane decides to flee Thronfield and escape from the luxurious style of life to find her identity. She sacrifices her true love for Rochester and prefers starvation in order to flee from passions and desires. Yielding to her emotions would cause Jane to be a prisoner in her own eyes.Jane's social status does not compare to Rochester's wealthy possessions. When Jane, however, becomes rich, from an unexpected heritage, she willingly returns to Rochester, after having balanced between morals and passions.When Jane finally leads a comfortable life, she refuses to yield to reason, choosing love instead. Jane refuses St. John's proposal because she finds it necessary for her to choose love and happiness over the ideal woman society expects of her. Jane once again leaves her previous comfortable life in search for her true love. Even with Rochester's physical and social deteriorating conditions, she is able to find true love because she balances between desires and expectations. Jane's sense of freedom is to not yield to the position she is in if her conscience and desires are not both satisfied.Adding to its thrills, the Gothic character of Bertha Mason portrays the dark romanticism movement of the era in the late 19th century. Setting the house on fire, and tearing Jane's bridal gown on her wedding night, she is the conflict that tears Jane and Rochester apart. She also causes Rochester's blindness and loss of his house. She is killed in the fire and Jane, much stronger now, is back to compensate Rochester for all what he has suffered."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"Jane Eyre is an unusual, mysterious and refreshing love story. Right from the start Jane's suffering sets the tone for the novel. Jane is mistreated by her aunt Mrs. Read and abused by her cousins.

Sad, plain and orphaned, Jane is a new kind of heroine.Jane Eyre is not the beautiful, perfect and delicate character dominates fairy tales. After years of watching Disney's various versions of handsome Prince Charming fall in love with a beautiful girl whom misfortune has befallen, Jane is most certainly a welcome change. After surviving an epidemic of typhus, near starvation, intense cold and chilblains, she certainly makes Sleeping Beauty look pretty pathetic for fainting at the prick of a needle. Indeed, Jane's life begins as more of a tragedy than a fairytale. However, her story really begins when she leaves Lowood and becomes a governess at Mr. Rochester's Thornfield.When Jane first encounters Mr. Rochester, she is happy to help him and feels comfortable doing so. As Jane and Mr. Rochester talk and spend time together, their love for each other grows. Despite the presence of haughty and beautiful Blanche Ingram, Mr. Rochester and Jane become engaged. At this point in a typical love story, the couple would be married and live happily ever after. However, in Charlotte Bronte's Jane Eyre Mr. Rochester's mysterious past seizes the fairy tale moment to reveal itself and haunt the happy couple. This portion of the book is a bit long but is pleasantly new, as Mr. Rochester is a welcome substitute for the ubiquitous Prince Charming. Rochester is not handsome or young, instead he is bad tempered and is rescued by Jane more often than he does any rescuing of his own. It is very rare to find a novel with such fresh characters, and it's bracing that the book is not dominated by excessively beautiful people. Rather, Jane and Rochester are easy to relate to.After the marriage ceremony is interrupted and Rochester shows Jane his wife Bertha, the novel slows to about the pace of a sloth. Charlotte Bronte's novel would have benefitted greatly from an aggressive editor who could have cut about a hundred pages out of the book. Jane makes the dramatic and frustrating decision to leave Thornfield, and preserve her honor as well Mr. Rochester's. At this point in the book the level of my admiration for Jane plummeted along with my interest in the story. As starving Jane wanders through the wilderness in apparent agony over a decision she made of her own free will, she happens to stumble on the home of her distant relatives. After recovering, and beginning a job as a teacher she receives an inheritance from a long lost uncle. Unable to suppress her curiosity as to what had become of Rochester, and receiving no response from Mrs. Fairfax, Jane searches for her beloved Mr. Rochester.As the novel ends, it regains its excellence with the sweet reunion of Jane and Mr. Rochester. Although Rochester is crippled and blind, the story gets its long sought after happily ever after. Jane and Rochester are unusually fascinating characters, who make a more lasting impression than their beautiful fairy tale counterparts."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"Jane Eyre, written in 1946 by Charlotte Bront, tells the story of an orphan girl who struggles to overcome the hardships that threaten her relationship with Mr. Rochester. After leaving her hateful aunt and cousins, and then her school, Lowood, Jane Eyre travels to Thornfield Hall to become a governess. It is here that she encounters Mr. Rochester, and the two fall in love. However, the novel is full of surprises and their love does not go untested.The chapters describing Jane's time at Gateshead and Lowood bring to mind characters such as Matilda and Harry Potter. As familiar as it is, the story is still heart-warming and builds up the reader's feelings for Jane for the rest of the novel. At Thornfield Hall, it is obvious that Jane is falling in love with Mr. Rochester. It is less clear that Mr. Rochester has feelings for Jane. After waiting out the suspense, the reader is finally rewarded with Mr. Rochester's proposal to Jane. Jane herself is not excited, and I found myself wishing that she was happier. Even though Charlotte Bronte's foreshadowing hints that something is not right at Thornfield, the horrific revelation of Mr. Rochester's deranged and murderous wife is a twist that surprised me. I was irritated with Jane for her choice of reason and pride over true love, but eager to find out what becomes of her.For one chapter, Jane wanders through villages in Yorkshire, desperate to find work, food, and shelter. I was angry with her for forgetting her parcel on the carriage, and I just wanted her to return to Thornfield Hall. Reluctantly, Jane reasons that returning to Mr. Rochester goes against her pride and sense and she refuses to go back. Eventually, she encounters the Rivers, who provide a place for her to stay. Simultaneously, Jane discovers that she has inherited a fortune and the Rivers are her cousins. Jane is far more overjoyed because she has a family rather than that she is rich.St. John Rivers trying to persuade Jane to marry him is the only really low point in Jane Eyre. These chapters are full of long conversations in which Jane agrees to go with him to India but not become his wife, followed by St. John saying that she must marry him. The same points are debated between the two many times, making this part of the book slow and boring. Finally, Jane leaves the Rivers and returns to Thornfield. I was disappointed that Jane didn't put her foot down immediately because it is obvious she will never marry St. John.Jane does suffer many hardships throughout the book, but Bronte rewards her with a happy ending. I liked the fact that Charlotte Bront wrote the prologue so that it took place ten years later. The reader finds out what happened to most of the characters in the book, including St. John, the Rivers sisters, and Ad&egrave;le. I like books that finish completely, with every loose end tied up, and Bront certainly does this in Jane Eyre. This novel is not a simple love story: it is filled with hardships, gothic elements, and mystery."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"The plot revolves around Jane as a child to adulthood. Orphaned since an infant, she grows up with her harsh aunt and unpleasant cousins. Around the age of ten, she gets sent to charity-school, where they provide education for the poor and orphaned. The school is run so poorly, many of the students die from meager provisions and disease. Jane survives the hardships of being at school; she would rather be anywhere than her aunt and cousins. She stays until the beginning of her adulthood, where she obtains a job as a governess to a child within the moors of England, namely Thornfield Hall. Thornfield Hall is owned by Edward Rochester, whose satirical character meets Jane's sharp wittiness, creating an intense bond between the two.Bronte intrigues the reader with the intricate development of the characters, making them truly realistic. For example, the choices she has Jane makes choice that are never straightforwardly done. As she goes through a great deal of obstacles, the author has Jane dwell on them in a heart-wrenching and analytical manner. The characters are also realistic to the Victorian time period in which it is set in. The roles of women and men are clearly distinct to the 1800's. It critically explains the patriarchal domination that she's constantly up against with the men in her life (Mr. Brocklehurst, Mr. Rochester, and Mr. Rivers) and England's social hierarchy while in her discovery of the complicated social position of governesses.****SPOILER ALERT****The author also explores a couple themes make the book quite interesting to its readers. One is the concept of morality. Jane decides whether her commitment to her philosophies is strong enough to resist the appeals of Mr. Rochester and refuses to be Rochester's mistress because of her \\"impassioned self-respect and moral conviction.\\" She rejects St. John Rivers' marriage proposal because they were not in love and forgives her Aunt Reed despite the cruelty she had Jane endure. Another was religion, when Jane attempts to gain a balance between happiness and faith. She encounters three extreme aspects of Christianity - Mr. Brocklehurst's strict religious discipline, Helen Burns' submissiveness, and St. John Rivers' commitment to charity and accomplishes stability between the three to help control her passionate personality but not completely changing her true self altogether.*****SPOILER ENDS*****Honestly, from the title and cover of the book, you would think it would be an uninteresting biography. However, Charlotte Bronte's story of Jane Eyre has a great deal of twists and turn of events and constantly keeps the reader interested. The book has it all - a blend of passion, romance, mystery, drama and suspense. I believe this to be one of the everlasting classics of English literature and a must-read for everyone."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"This is one of the best readings of this book I've heard - and I've heard (and read) the book many times.

Jane Eyre in no way is one of those bad books. I had to read Bronte's novel for my college English Lit class and at first thought it might not be that interesting seeing as it was written over 200 years ago. The story of Jane Eyre pulled me in and found myself thoroughly interested in what happened to her. I now know why Jane Eyre is such a classic novel and is still being read today. The character of Jane Eyre is very strong, however she keeps most of who she is to herself due to her class in society. She becomes a sort of female detective and finally discovers where she is meant to me in the end."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"I really want to tell you what happens because I thought it was so good! But of course I won't because it would spoil it for you.I will say that I have been avoiding 'the classics' for a good long time (except for The Scarlet Letter which I actually enjoyed way back in High School). And I'm thinking maybe it's been a mistake. If only every book could be as wonderful as this one. I really loved it.My copy of Jane Eyre has an introduction by Joyce Carol Oats and I would caution those who don't know this story; do not read the introduction! It will spoil the story. Thankfully I didn't read it until after I finished the book and I am so glad, it tells everything that happens!Jane never forgets that she must love and respect herself first and foremost. She is clever, direct, honest and true to herself even when holding true to her principles costs her dearly.It is a gothic story, dark and heartbreaking full of love, devotion, obsession, isolation and oppression.

When she discovered his sad secret, she did not follow her own fleshly desires, but left for the good of her lover, heartbroken, yet triuphant in knowing that she'd done what was right.

Prepare yourself to go slowly at first to absorb the heroic character of Jane Eyre as she survives the not-to-be-gotten-around class system of 19th C England. By today's standards, she is not only fiercely independent and incredibly intelligent; she is morally superior. Suspense builds and delivers even if you have seen the movie. What a love story!

Indeed, it probably would not have challenged her!"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"Because people who don't like this book are stupid poopheads. It's just that simple.

Actually, I wrote it several months ago. However, I found one review that disturbed me. The reviewer said, and I quote, &quot;Thank the gods for Jane Austen, I say. At least her heroines were role models well worthy of attention by impressionbale female readers.&quot;Okay, now here is my opinion on that statement. I have read Jane Austen and I absolutely adore all of her novels (Mansfield Park I cannot speak for, I have never read it.) However, I find that her heroines are not to be admired. Take for instance, Anne Elliot in Persuasion who spends 8 years in a state of depression and makes her self ugly because she made a mistake. Or Elizabeth Bennett in Pride and Prejudice, who is much to prejudiced to even hear Mr. Darcy's side of the story. And don't forget Catherine Morland in Northanger Abbey who almost scares herself to death romantizing every little detail in an old house just because she has read too much. Then there is Marianne Dashwood in Sense and Sensibility who is so concerned with dying for love that she can't see that the man of her dreams is right in front of her face and she falls in love with some jerk. And last, but not least, Elinor Dashwood, Marianne's elder sister, who closes up her emotions inside and because of that eventually snaps. Jane Eyre, on the other hand is a heroine to be admired, for she shows us all that even in the worst situations of life (which she experienced) you can still be strong. Jane Austen's characters may live the fairytale &quot;happily ever after&quot; life, but they do not prove as strong as Jane Eyre in the least."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"This is my absolute favorite book!

What really made me fall in love with this book, initially, was the cover. If I was going to get a classic why not do it in style?? After receiving my book in the mail I got started and really fell in love with the story. Honestly, giving Jane Eyre a chance would be recommended, but if your going to do it buy this book with this cover and you will not be disappointed!"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"This book is fabulous!

In fact, someone pointed out to me that her childhood dragging on and on helps you suffer with her and gives you a lot of sympathy for the character (Thanks Miriam!). Oddly enough, when I read this a second time before I saw the movie, I found the beginning went a lot faster. So you'll have to judge for yourself if you like the pace, but either way the beginning is worth it.The movie adaption of Jane Eyre by Focus Features was very well done and I really liked it. They were especially faithful to the characters. A few of my favorite scenes got left out, but I liked the characters so much I forgave them. The Gothic themes in the novel were played up as well making it a little spicy."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"I had ordered two DVD's of Jane Eyre.

The point which haunted her was during the orphanage her aunt has consigned her to: she kept thinking those who are talented are destined for greatness, but her best friend with the fair hand was let off and killed. That was the most disappointing part of her youth and haunted her to no end and no beginning. She most willingly settled to be with a mocked up version of male counterpart of her friend from youth as repairing the damages she saw but could not escapes. Who could not but questioned her senses on why would she not accept the person who she is, but she tries to escape her own drawing ability and let the skinny girl have the crown, in the end, she makes up by letting her of all the grieves with which she felt as a child and watches another woman die in her own care. In fact, she condone murder twice to marry into her unloved imagination. I am not sure if in fact, when love being equal, she herself is any more sane and/or shameful for her desire to escape the part of her soul that does not want to see her friend as gone awry, but she could have chosen to say no, to the man who has thus found her to be a willing body for his child in custody. So the subject became the unacceptable girl and her mother became more of disowned love tale's antagonist. I don't believe the author hints at polygamy, but it wanted to be so to satiate its own desire to compete with all the other females at all cost for a chance at marriage."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"My mom encouraged me to read this book when I was 13. She said that it was a great classic for girls and that I would love it. And so I did read it and love it, but now I'm amazed that I got through it. I don't have a copy of it anymore, so I read some of it on-line, and I was surprised to see that the writing is rather ponderous and even tedious. I'm amazed at the length of some of the sentences. When I was young, I didn't worry about difficult words. I certainly never looked up unfamiliar words in the dictionary because I didn't want to destroy the momentum and flow of the story. I could usually tell from the context the meaning of the word. I'd been told that it was an exciting story so I buckled down and forced myself to get into it.Before I knew it, I'd put myself in Jane's shoes, and my own life started to look really good in comparison. Terrorized by the family who raised her, abused by the administrators of the school she attended, my heart was bleeding for her and then, finally, she received some emotional sustenance from a caring, understanding teacher and a saintly, loving classmate.When she goes to work for Mr. Rochester as a governess for his \\"ward,\\" Adele (actually his illegitimate child), she is a love-starved, vulnerable young woman. Worldly Mr. Rochester has been around shall we say, and his heart has been hardened by various circumstances in his life. However, Jane's goodness, innocence, and intelligence win him over. They fall in love and wish to marry.But remember this is a gothic novel, and there are mysteries in the big house they inhabit. Screams can be heard coming from the attic. There's a fire one night. Strange laughter can be heard on occasion.Suffice it to say, they're not allowed to marry--as they're about to exchange vows a man storms the church and insists that he can tell why the couple should not be allowed to marry.Jane goes away, she nearly marries someone else, and then one night she believes that Rochester is calling her...Enough said, this is the sort of information my mom gave me when she was seducing me into reading this book--a Cinderella sort of heroine falls in love with an older man who lives in a big spooky house--that was enough for me. I proceeded to make my way through all those long sentences and was richly rewarded at the end. I can tell you that this isn't exactly a fairy-tale ending but it's more happy than sad. Very poignant. You'll cry, but you'll be so happy that you shared Jane's misery and witnessed her happiness."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"At 50, with the kids all growing up and moving out, I'm finding more time to read, and most of it is on my Kindle I recieved for my birthday. Free classics from Amazon seemed like a good place to start. There are many books that I know the story line to from other sources (movies mostly), but never had a chance to read the original source material. Jane Eyre is one of those books. It wasn't a quick read, and it did drag on at times. Honestlyh, I thought to myself quite often, \\"What amd I doing reading a gothic romance\\", but I carried on. I had also seen the 2011 movie adaptation (which I also recommend) and wanted to fill in the missing pieces. I also wondered what I would have thought of this book if I HAD read it as a young person (teenager)? I probably would have hated it! I'm glad I read it this summer as upon reflection I did enjoy this Bronte novel. I hope you enjoy rereading the classics like I am."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"Jane Eyre follows the life of a Jane Eyre - a poor, plain, unconnected and very small-bodied young woman. When the novel begins, she's ten years old and lives with her horrible Aunt Reed and her equally dreadful cousins, who enjoy bullying her. Deemed a troublesome and disagreeable girl (even \\"passionate\\", gasp, the horror!), Jane is passed onto Lowood, a school for orphaned girls.After six years in that hell-hole, having survived a typhus outbreak and malnourishment, Jane is promoted to teacher, and stays on for a further couple of years, until the headmistress gets married and takes off. Eager to broaden her horizons now that her friend is gone, Jane advertises for a position as a governess. The only response is from Thornfield Hall, where a young French girl needs tutoring.At Thornfield, Jane finds her pupil to be very vain, but agreeable nonetheless. The housekeeper, Mrs. Fairfax, is an old dear and life is a bit monotonous ... until the master of the house happens to finally return. Edward Fairfax Rochester - harsh, sarcastic, brooding ... and oh such a darling deep within. And about 20 years older than Jane, but what does that matter when you're in love? Question is, can an unconnected governess really find happiness with the rich master of Thornfield?While I love the story and the characters, I'm not necessarily a huge fan of the novel itself, because it has issues. Charlotte Bront's pacing is peculiar - the first twelve chapters tend to drag on a bit and she's too fond of very long, rambling descriptions. Not to mention the over-the-top \\"coincidences\\" which might have been classed as \\"providence\\" back in the day, but today they sound far-fetched.Regardless of anything else, Jane Eyre is a powerful (and somewhat melodramatic) story of love against all odds, self-respect and female independence. It stays with you ... at least if you manage to get through the chapters where Jane isn't at Thornfield. I have to admit I find the Gateshead and Lowood parts quite tedious - I'm just waiting for her to get to Thornfield so the story can start for real. Then, I tend to shoot through the chapters and then it grinds to a halt in Morton and the pages drag on until finally, it picks up again at the very end.There is a reason some books are still read and cherished 160+ years after their first publication. It's because they're well-written, tell a compelling story and have themes which we can still associate with and understand. We can still relate to Jane's passion and a good love story always works. Charlotte Bront's most famous novel has stood the test of time so far, and I think it will live with us for many years yet.4 out of 5 dreadful charity schools for orphans, because while I love the story, I'm not keen on the very convenient \\"coincidences\\", nor at times the writing itself. Charlotte Bront was a great dialogue writer, but her descriptions ... sometimes she just doesn't know when to stop."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"Got this book for my daughter.

I ended up reading it right away and devouring it. I absolutely loved this story and the writing was so beautiful and thought provoking and I immediately thought to myself &#34;THIS is what a writer should 'sound' like&#34;. I want my daughter to read it because I take away from the story that it is okay to be yourself, to be humble but proud of being who you are. To be true to yourself and be strong and though difficulties come your way, you can and will get through them. I wish I had read it when younger and had made it a part of my references as I grew and to have it to fall back on in my mind but I didn't but I am sure glad I have finally read it and now I look forward to also watching a movie about it that I found :).

It took eight years for me to finally get around to doing so (I'm 18 now) and my God, I could not be more pleased. Bronte's story is phenomenal! While some may say that the story is nothing original, it should be remembered that this was published in 1847, so it is everything that followed it that is unoriginal. I don't wish to give any of the plot away, but I must say one thing: The novel excellently explores numerous themes, but the one that particularly stood out to me upon reading it is the inability to ever truly love someone else and to stand side-by-side with them before learning to love oneself. Following Jane, our beloved heroine, as she journeyed down this long and winding road, was wonderful for me.

However, although the pace in this book certainly does slow down at times, it is usually fast. And exciting. With a touch of suspense.

I have read it five times and ask you to read it."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"No one reads JANE EYRE for the plot or for the fine sense of irony that her sister Emily Bronte showed. They do read Charlotte Bronte for how she overcomes an admitted use of heavy-handed Gothic romanticism that includes all the traditional trappings of gloomy castles, Byronic satanic heroes, crazed prisoners, and even a shrieking telepathic message. If JANE EYRE had no more than these Gothic trappings, then it is not likely that I, or anyone else for that matter, would be discussing its literary merits. What sets Jane EYRE apart for its earlier and more heavy-handed predecessors was a sense of palpable realism that rings true with events that harken back to Charlotte Bronte's life that ran parallel with that of Jane Eyre's. This realism stems from experiences that Charlotte had in a school that was perilously close to Dickens' school in NICHOLAS NICKLEBY and Jane's school in Lowood. Further, the mistreatment that Jane underwent at Gateshead Hall must have originated from similar such savageries in her early youth. It is a tribute to Charlotte Bronte's realism that she could make her readers feel the pathos and sentimentalism of an outraged childhood.When we first see Jane as a child in the opening pages, we see her as one who is orphaned and left to the not so tender mercies of an aunt who for want of a better term is just plain mean. Jane is made to feel like an outcast by the very ones, who because of their consanguinity should have blessed her with love and affection. As she matures, she is at first pictured as one who must balance precariously between being an obnoxious little brat and one who deserves our sympathy for her state. In the school to which she is sent, first as a student then a teacher, Jane is seen in terms of such purely perceived sensibility that we do not doubt for a moment her own reality, even if we doubt the validity of her external reality. It is this successful ability to create a sharply defined subjective heroine that paves the way for us to equally accept the existence and credibility of the wild, moody, and totally Byronic Rochester. We do not see him as what he truly is: a flat character whose only purpose in the novel is to dash about on a horse and hide crazy women in his dank castle. We see him as Jane does; that is as Charlotte Bronte does, as a real life man from her own days of fantasizing about a teacher who was, to Charlotte at least, the very personification of manliness and virility.Charlotte Bronte also included a number of sociological subtexts that probably ring just as much true today as they did in her day. She presents in chilling detail the child abuse that was rampant simply because not enough people took the trouble to take notice and petition the government for redress. She addresses the male patriarchal attitude that did not allow a young woman to make her way alone in the world except in the accepted role of governess. She also exposes the unwanted issue of what to do about the rights of the mentally ill. As we read JANY EYRE today, we notice the melodrama and the sociological subtexts, but we do not pay them much attention, which is probably just as well. Instead, what we take away from JANE EYRE is the ability of Charlotte Bronte to make us feel the pain of a cruel world, even if we, or Jane herself, can do little about it except to remain as human as we can."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"Jane Eyre is a powerful story of struggle and of love. Jane lives a difficult early life, and struggles to find a place just right for her to settle down. She starts out living with an emotionally abusive aunt and cousins who do not understand her. From there she is shipped to boarding school, where she is a student and later becomes a teacher. Here she is always hungry, and living conditions are not the best. Jane then becomes a governess for a little girl in a home called Thornfield Hall. It is here where she begins a somewhat strange and unconventional relationship with the master of her house, Mr. Rochester. The love that develops between them goes against all of the conventions of their time, and is almost lost. The last part of the book is beautiful and well fitting with the rest of the story.Charlotte Bronte uses amazing, flowing language that in itself makes the book terrific. Her story is full of a wide range of emotions. It is not a difficult read, but really gets your mind thinking. This is a classic, timeless novel that will have people engaged for ages. Have your pen ready to mark some of Bronte's beautiful passages that will be unforgettable!"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"This summer, as I was searching for a free-choice book to read, I stumbled upon Jane Eyre by Charlotte Bronte. I chose this book because I was curious to see if it was anything like Wuthering Heights (a book I rather enjoyed) writen by the other Bronte sister.Jane Eyre is a conflicted love story. It follows the life of, surprisingly, a woman named Jane. She lives a harsh childhood, first in the hands of an unloving aunt and her abusive son and then later in the confines of the deteriorating Lowood school. She resides at the school for 8 years and realizes that she wants to experience more of the world outside of the Lowood school. Jane then works as a nanny at a place called Thornfield where she falls in love with her master, Mr. Rochester.This love story is complicated and conflicted in that the love between Mr. Rochester and Jane is forbidden on more than one level.Jane Eyre was much more than I had expected. Although I enjoyed Wuthering Heights, I found Jane Eyre to be much more engaging. At many times, while reading this novel, I found myself completely frustrated yet intrigued and eager to continue at the same time. Bronte evokes such emotion in this novel, from the harsh realities of Jane's childhood to the whirlwind romance between her and her master. I found Mr. Rochester's courtship of Jane to be the most entertaining. I found Jane's confusion and reluctance to be frustrating, yet thought-provoking. And I found the separation of the two to be vexing and upsetting. Ironically, I found the ending to be strange, yet fitting in a story of constant ups and downs. It was an overall great read!"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"I never thought myself the type to write a review for a book, but Jane Eyre presents itself as an exception. After reading the review below by a \\"teenager\\" I felt I, also being a teenager, must add a good word for this book, and for the teens out there who don't whine to their teachers when they try to share something great. I was 11 when I read Jane Eyre for a school book report of our choosing and was the first \\"real\\" book I ever read. It is the book that changed my gaze from the television screen to the written page. To this day, I prefer a book over a TV show any day, and I am 19. If it can do that for an 11 year old, I'm sure you will enjoy it too."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"I read Jane Eyre for my AP Lit. Class in the 12th grade. I figured, oh just another boring book. WOW! was I completely mistaken. ALthough long, Jane Eyre could have been 1,000 pages and I still would have read every page, with joy. The growth Jane Eyre, the novels main character and Protagonist, goes through throughout the novel is amazing. Born into an unloving world, with rejection and anger at every corner, Jane is forced to keep herself company and therefore, her only friend is herself. Adopted by her uncle, who soon dies, Jane is forced to live with her aunt Reed. I dont want to summarize about all this stuff, I am going to get down to the nitty-gritty. The novel mainly centers around Jane and her love for Rochester. When Jane becomes eighteen, she is hired to govern at the mansion of Rochesters, and to guide and teach his daughter, Adele. The marvelous love story between Jane and Rochester is as intense as anything you will ever read. At times while reading the novel, I would have to put the novel down and take in what I was reading. The passion and heart exhibited by these two characters was at times unbearable. If you want to read a true novel, full of power and emotion, read Jane Eyre- the best novel ever written. :-)"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"I chose to read this novel over my spring break and it turned out that reading it was about the only thing I could do. Upon picking up the gargantuan book I was a bit wary of the read, but after reading the first paragraph I was enchanted and further lured on. Bronte did a wonderful - no - fascinating job of creating such a strong, honest, and demanding character as Jane Eyre. Even as an orphaned child, in the care of her abhored aunt Reed, Jane displays such an immense amount of passion and creativity. These characteristics are further refined and blended with a touch of integrity as Jane suffers through the ill-treatment and neglect that she receives at Lowood, a charity school that Mrs. Reed sends her to so to be corrected of her faults. After having spent nearly eight years enduring the ghastly conditions of Lowood, Jane leaves her old life behind so to fill the position of governess at Thornfield Hall. During here stay at the mansion, she is confronted by something she has been completely ignorant of before - love. Her dark and strong, though not handsome, master, Mr. Rochester, causes a hearty seed to implant itself within the unmoving foundation of her soul. This seed of love flourishes and intertwines Jane's emotion's with those of beloved Mr. Rochester. Though love is said to withstand and conquer all, a mysterious and horrifying obstacle challenges the bond that has developed between Jane and Mr.Rochester. As the battle is carried out, Jane's soul and destiny are both tried and tested, thus forming a truly moving and unforgetable novel. Charlotte Bronte's writing is one of intense passion - not just the violent emotion of love, but that of faithfulness and devotion to ones' self and to others. As you travel from page to page of Jane Eyre's life, you will be forced to take into consideration your own character and moral values. Although it was a rather extented read, I do not regret for one moment the time I spent indulging myself in this enticing piece of profound literature. I sincerely believe that all who take on the task of reading this novel will benefit by it in one aspect of their life or another."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"It's hard to imagine a better gothic romance than \\"Jane Eyre\\" -- gloomy vast houses, mysterious secrets, and a brooding haunted man with a dark past.In fact, Charlotte Bronte's classic novel has pretty much everything going for it -- beautiful settings, a passionate romance tempered by iron-clad morals, and a heroine whose poverty and lack of beauty only let her brains and courage shine brighter. And it's all wrapped in the misty, haunting atmosphere of a true gothic story -- madwoman in the attic and all.Jane Eyre was an orphan, abused and neglected first by relatives, then by a boarding school run by a tyrannical, hypocritical minister. But Jane refuses to let anyone shove her down -- even when her saintly best friend dies from the wretched conditions.But many years later, Jane moves on by applying to Thornfield Hall for a governess position, and gets the job. She soon becomes the teacher and friend to the sprightly French girl Adele, but is struck by the dark, almost haunted feeling of her new home.Then she runs into a rather surly horseman -- who turns out to be her employer, Mr. Rochester, a cynical, embittered man who spends little time at Thornfield. They are slowly drawn together into a powerful love, despite their different social stations -- and Rochester's apparent attentions to a shallow, snotty aristocrat who wants his wealth and status.But strange things are happening at Thornfield -- stabbings, fires, and mysterious laughter. Jane and Rochester finally confess their feelings to each other, but their wedding is interrupted when Rochester's dark past comes to light. Jane flees into the arms of long-lost family members, and is offered a new life -- but her love for Rochester is not so easily forgotten...\\"Jane Eyre\\" is one of those books that transcends the labels of genre. Charlotte Bronte spun a haunting gothic romance around her semi-autobiographical heroine and Byronic anti-hero, filling it with brilliant writing and solid plot. It has everything all the other gothic romances of the time had... but Bronte gave it depth and intensity without resorting to melodrama.Bronte wrote in the usual stately prose of the time, but it has a sensual, lush quality, even in the dank early chapters at Lowood. At Thornfield, the book acquires an overhanging atmosphere of foreboding, until the clouds clear near the end. And she wove some tough questions into Jane's perspective -- that of a woman's independence and strength in a man's world, of extreme religion, and of the clash between morals and passion.And Bronte also avoided any tinges of drippy sentimentality (Mrs. Reed dies still spewing venom) while injecting some hauntingly nightmarish moments (\\"She sucked the blood: she said she'd drain my heart\\"). She even manages to include some funny stuff, such as Rochester disguising himself as an old gypsy woman.The story does slow down after the abortive wedding, when Jane flees Thornfield and briefly considers marrying a repressed clergyman who wants to go die preaching in India. It's rather boring to hear the self-consciously saintly St. John prattling about himself, instead of Rochester's barbed wit. But when Jane departs again, the plot speeds up into a nice, mellow little finale.Bronte did a brilliant job of bringing her heroine to life -- as a defiant little girl who is condemned for being \\"passionate,\\" as an independent young lady, and as a woman torn between love and principle. Jane's strong personality and wits overwhelm the basic fact that she's not unusually pretty. And Rochester is a brilliantly sexy Byronic anti-hero with a prickly, mercurial wit.Of Charlotte Bronte's few novels, \\"Jane Eyre\\" is undoubtedly the most brilliant -- passionate, dark and hauntingly eerie. Definitely a must-read."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"I cringe as I read the reviews here that were written by children who were forced to read this in school. I can imagine feeling similarly if I had to trudge through this very long, mature novel with its outdated language and flowery descriptions as a teenager. However, as an adult, I loved the book. I do think it is overly long and could have done without some of the passages that describe the scenery. The best parts of this book are in Jane's elaborate, vivid thoughts and her interactions with the various people she meets. In a book that is less good, I would've taken away a star for the excessive scenic descriptions, but the best things about this book make up for that.Since there are already hundreds of reviews up here that go into what the story is about, I won't bother. What I will say is I am not generally a sentimental nor easily moved person, but I found this story very moving. I don't know if I'd recommend it to many men, and I'd probably not recommend it to anyone under 24. As an adult woman who spends much of her time lost in thought and doesn't always follow the most obvious path, I found it to be an excellent, engaging, and emotional read and am very glad I stuck with it until the end."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"There are many excellent books written about the human heart, but few writers master the artistry needed to combine both thought and dialog into a free flowing story that, filled with mystery and torment, capture the imagination as does Charlotte Bronte's tale of love and desire struggling upstream against the elements of life station, society's pressure, and mistakes made in youth that never lie in peace no matter how much time passes.Such is the novel Jane Eyre. I knew it was a Classic, and acknowledged it; I had seen several versions of the movies made of it, but did not recall having ever read the book as an adult. Written in 1847, it seemed something to watch on film, but not explore in the written word, as many such novels are difficult to read. Nothing could have been farther from the truth, and I was given an extraordinary literary experience once again by chance. It is particularly interesting given that this book was written by a woman at a time when license was thin; she managed not only to pull it off, but gave up nothing in the process while taking the reader to the smoldering destiny of what she intended to deliver.Jane Eyre is a hauntingly beautiful tale of a plain but highly mature and intelligent girl, shunned and unwanted by her family in her youth, much like the fairy tale of Cinderella. The reason for this travesty is finally delivered in the epilogue, yet it's integral importance yields completely to the unlikely romance that she finds as a result of it.She, frightened and alone but possessed of a courage and confidence that she will somehow prevail against her odds, is arranged a position as a governess for a mysterious, often absent gentleman of means who needs a tutor for his little girl. Upon arriving, she immediately senses there is a sinister intrigue surrounding the big house and it's inhabitants, but is too conscious of her place to be too inquisitive; beyond that, her sense of honor and integrity prevents any covert investigation on her part. But it is a place to flee from on occasion, and one night she leaves to send a letter out in the next town, which is a long walk through a dusky, cold winter's evening. There, on a lonely bridle path, she unwittingly meets the owner of the Estate, Edward Rochester - as he returns homeward, although in no glamorous way to be sure, as he has fallen off his horse and sprained his leg, all within her immediate vision. She come to his aid, helps him to his feet; and the first of the fateful encounters between a world-weary yet vital man and a much younger, guileless, yet very capable woman has come to be.The author waxes splendid in her descriptive paragraphs of the countryside and surroundings; of the morning mist shrouding the walks under the cherry trees in the old gardens surrounding the mansion; of moonlight shining in windows at night adding visuals as if by magic. But that's the periphery; the undercurrent of something else is running dark and deep. There is a secret hidden on the upper story, one that is closely guarded, yet threatens to expose itself continually, with the potential to destroy not only Mr. Rochester himself, but any chance for happiness he may decide to take.Rochester senses something out of the ordinary in the governess he has inherited by chance to educate and care for his child. The flighty little girl is the irritating and very tangible link to his past that brings him continual reminders of his \\"error\\" - yet has somehow been the vessel that brings about his emotional emancipation - through the hiring of Jane. And as Jane becomes acquainted with her benefactor, she realizes that despite his eccentricities, he is above other men in many, many ways, for even in her protected environment she has noticed his encouragement of equality for her; encouragement to speak her mind and reveal her thoughts to him. She is reluctant to do so, because she is wary of the differences in station between them, and realizes he has ultimate and enduring power over her. He cleverly attempts to seek out and determine ahead of time each of his moves toward his desires so that he may emerge to the next level unscathed.The idea flow is exquisite; articulate without a misstep anywhere in connecting her intricate plot with the characters and the moments that filter unerringly down to create the mood and the sensuality between the two unlikely lovers that are caught up in the vortex. The night the Gypsy arrives unbidden to the big house is a perfect example.The scene Jane endures with the \\"gypsy\\" in the parlor is truly one of a kind; I don't believe I have ever read anything quite it's equal for astonishing originality. The depth of emotional insight, passion, and fear of rejection and/or discovery is intensely woven into this particular part of the story in an unforgettable exchange of dialog and mental dueling; a subtle, ingenious breaking of barriers, of discovery without risk.Turn charlotte Bronte loose with word software on a computer with the literary license of today and one can't help but wonder just what form it would have taken. For certain though, it could not have been more masterfully written than was the \\"original.\\""},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"I've seen meritorious film adaptations of JANE EYRE but never got around to actually reading the book until now. What I found was a strong-willed story that moves like a high-speed freight-train even in some long-winded passages. In the tradition of the best 19th century English fiction, the book possesses a sharp social eye, tinkers with narrative technique for great effect, endows settings with a character all their own, and deploys verbal and dramatic irony with abandon. It tells a whopper of a romance between two extraordinary people from the perspective of the title character, who survives every kind of hardship life has to throw her way but who never loses herself, even when she falls for Mr. Wrong-and-Right-at-the-same-time.This book must have knocked the socks off early Victorian England. Our heroine goes to great lengths to establish that she and Mr. Wrong/Right do not conform to the beauty standards of their world, and yet they are most attractive characters. Jane insists on being the captain of her fate, no subserviance to men, not even the one she loves. Mr. Wrong/Right who is no angel is still sympathetic. Probably the most startling theme Bronte sounds countermands her generation's zeigeist: don't marry for money, security and respectability, go for the soulmate no matter the cost. This is pretty bold stuff for the daughter of a clergyman.I won't get into the plot because the danger of spoilers lies in every twist. I will say that one of its climatic points bequeathed me a nightmare, such is the writer's spell. The film adaptations by their very nature cannot convey the written voice and by necessity they must conflate some characters and events to accommodate the flow of action. Watch the Orson Welles or the recent PBS version, both of which are nifty, but don't substitute them for the book, especially if you have to write a book report or pass a test on it."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"You know all those 'classic' novels you read in high school? How many of them do you actually remember? Well, if Jane Eyre was one of those long-forgotten books, pick up a copy. To read it as an adult is a joy: it's a sweeping, disturbing, intense, thrilling, very romantic gothic love story, written in the voice of a very intense, almost claustrophobically self-aware young heroine. Jane is no Ophelia - she's a complicated, remarkable character, and a very strong female character in a genre that usually draws women as beautiful victims at best.There's something for everyone in this book: Windswept castles, difficult and neurotic family members, dark secrets about tragic former lovers, good triumphing over evil, all that good juicy stuff that makes a great romantic story. What elevates Jane Eyre is Bronte's remarkable style & skill and her sharp and complex characterizations.Trust me on this: If you don't remember it from your teens, you should give it a try now. Here is one novel that more than lives up to it's 'classic' status."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"I first read \\"Jane Eyre\\" in eighth grade and have read it every few years since. It is one of my favorite novels, and so much more than a gothic romance to me, although that's how I probably would have defined it at age 13. I have always been struck, haunted in a way, by the characters - Jane and Mr. Rochester. They take on new depth every time I meet them...and their's is a love story for the ages.Charlotte Bronte's first published novel, and her most noted work, is a semi-autobiographical coming-of-age story. Jane is plain, poor, alone and unprotected, but due to her fierce independence and strong will she grows and is able to defy society's expectations of her. This is definitely feminist literature, published in 1847, way before the beginning of any feminist movement. Perhaps this is one of the reasons why the novel has had such a wide following since it first came on the market. It is also one of the first gothic romances published and defines the genre.Jane Eyre, who is our narrator, was born into a poor family. Her parents died when she was a small child and the little girl was sent to live with her Uncle and Aunt Reed at Gateshead. Jane's Uncle truly cared for her and showed his affection openly, but Mrs. Reed seemed to hate the orphan, and neglected her while she pampered and spoiled her own children. This unfair treatment emphasized Jane's status as an unwanted outsider. She was often punished harshly. On one occasion her nasty cousin Jack picked a fight with her. Jane tried to defend herself and was locked in the terrifying \\"Red Room\\" as a result. Jane's Uncle Reed had died in this room a little while before, and Mrs. Reed knew how frightened she was of the chamber. Since Jane is the narrator, the reader is given a first-hand impression of the child's feelings, her heightened emotional state at being imprisoned. Indeed, she seems almost like an hysterical child, filled with terror and rage. She repeatedly calls her condition in life \\"unjust\\" and is filled with bitterness. Looking into the mirror Jane sees a distorted image of herself. She views her reflection and sees a \\"strange little figure,\\" or \\"tiny phantom.\\" Jane has not learned yet to subordinate her passions to her reason. Her passions still erupt unchecked. Her isolation in the Red Room is a presentiment of her later isolation from almost every society and community. This powerful, beautifully written scene never fails to move me.Mrs. Reed decided to send Jane away to the Lowood School, a poor institution run by Mr. Brocklehurst, who believed that suffering made grand people. All the children there were neglected, except to receive harsh punishment when any mistake was made. At Lowood, Jane met Helen Burns, a young woman a little older than Jane, who guided her with vision, light and love for the rest of her life. Jane's need for love was so great. It really becomes obvious in this first friendship. Helen later died from fever, in Jane's arms. Her illness and death could have been avoided if more attention had been paid to the youths. Jane stayed at Lowood for ten years, eight as a student and two as a teacher. Tired and depressed by her surroundings, Jane applied for the position of governess and found employment at Thornfield. The mansion is owned by a gentleman named Edward Fairfax Rochester. Her job there was to teach his ward, an adorable little French girl, Adele. Over a long period the moody, inscrutable Rochester confides in Jane and she in him. The two form an unlikely friendship and eventually fall in love. Again, Jane's need for love comes to the fore, as does her passionate nature. She blooms. A dark, gothic figure, Rochester also has a heart filled with the hope of true love and future happiness with Jane. Ironically, he has brought all his misery, past and future, on himself.All is not as it seems at Thornfield. There is a strange, ominous woman servant, Grace Poole, who lives and works in an attic room. She keeps to herself and is rarely seen. From the first, however, Jane has sensed bizarre happenings at night, when everyone is asleep .There are wild cries along with violent attempts on Rochester's life by a seemingly unknown person. Jane wonders why no one investigates Mrs. Poole. Then a strange man visits Thornfield and mysteriously disappears with Mr. Rochester. Late that night Jane is asked to sit with the man while the lord of the house seeks a doctor's help. The man has been seriously wounded and is weak from loss of blood. He leaves by coach, in a sorry state, first thing in the morning. Jane's questions are not answered directly. This visit will have dire consequences on all involved. An explosive secret revealed will destroy all the joyful plans that Jane and Rochester have made. Jane, once more will face poverty and isolation.Charlotte Bronte's heroine Jane Eyre, may not have been graced with beauty or money, but she had a spirit of fire and was filled with integrity and a sense of independence - character traits that never waned in spite of all the oppression she encountered in life. Ms. Bronte brings to the fore in \\"Jane Eyre\\" such issues as: the relations between men and women in the mid-19 century, women's equality, the treatment of children and of women, religious faith and hypocrisy (and the difference between the two), the realization of selfhood, and the nature of love and passion. This is a powerhouse of a novel filled with romance, mystery and passions. It is at once startlingly fresh and a portrait of the times. Ms. Bronte will make your heart beat faster, your pulse race and your eyes fill with tears. The Best!!JANA"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"Jane Eyre is about as unprepossessing a heroine as one could hope to find. Not only is she an orphan, she's extremely plain, her manners are stilted, and her relatives hate and bully her. Jane's one chance at freedom is the charity school her aunt sends her to. After buckling down, she finally manages to scrape up enough accomplishments to take on a position as a governess. What she finds as governess, though, is a mysterious manor and its even more mysterious owner, Mr. Rochester, who takes a strange fancy to her. Will Jane find love at last? Or will the secrets she reveals destroy all hope of happiness?\\"Jane Eyre\\" is one of the most well known gothic romance classics, and for good reason. This book enchanted me as a teenager and introduced me to the genre as a whole. A must-read for anyone who likes romance or mysteries. Bella and Edward are pale shadows of Jane and Mr. Rochester."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"Don't get me wrong, Jane Eyre is one of my favorite books. However, this version of Jane Eyre has millions of footnotes so you are forced to constantly flip back and forth to see if the footnotes are saying anything useful.When the character Adele is speaking paragraphs of French, they don't bother translating it for you but they will gleefully tell you what's going to happen one-hundred pages later in the book.Reading this version of Jane Eyre is like watching a movie with an over-enthusiatic friend who keeps talking through the whole movie and telling you what's going to happen. If you're going to read Jane Eyre, I would reccomend different version"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"There is so much to be said for this novel that it's difficult to know where to begin. It is a superb evocation of a time and place; it is a complex, detailed character study; it has a believable and compelling plot; and, more than anything else, it is a magnificent love story.Of course, love stories are the common denominator of human existence and have been the subject of literature since mankind first put charcoal to rock, so the fact that Jane Eyre is a love story is nothing terribly significant. No, what makes this novel so special is the thoughtfulness with which its narrator, Jane Eyre herself, documents her love affair. She is extremely intelligent, she carefully analyzes her feelings and actions, and she is scrupulously honest with both herself and her reader. This is what sets it apart: it is the depth of these thoughts and feelings that make the novel interesting. Beyond that, though, it is the character of Jane, slowly revealed, that makes the novel a delight.The plot is Jane's story. Orphaned, she is sent to live with her cruel aunt and cousins. At the age of ten she is sent away for good to a charity school, at which she gets her education, but which is run in such a miserly fashion that many of the students there actually die of disease and starvation. Jane survives, and at the age of eighteen, is able to secure a position as a governess to a child in a great house of England: Thornfield Hall. It is owned by Edward Rochester, the man who will become the centerpiece of her life.How the two begin to slowly realize their affection for one another, how they then cautiously begin to act on their feelings, and how they must then surmount the obstacles in their path--both societal and self-inflicted--are what make up the bulk of the novel. There are at least a few surprises along the way. The strong-willed Jane's moral code requires that she respond to these difficulties in certain ways. It is to the novel's and the author's great credit that these decisions are never simply made; Jane agonizes over them in heart-wrenching fashion. As in life, the standards one chooses to live by can be difficult to maintain.This defining tension is what drives the novel, but that it is delivered in such a skillful and assured way is what raises it to its lofty status. The dialogue, particularly, is fantastic. It is the stuff of an actor's dream: much of it can be interpreted in several different ways. Jane describes Rochester as being moody and tempestuous, and he often is, but at the same time--particularly after Jane agrees to marry him--he is hilariously wry and bemused. Jane comes across as being earnest and pleading, but she can be very playful and is often flirtatious. As mentioned above, these are deep, achingly human characters.The setting is also very evocative. The English countryside, class system and moral understanding were obviously familiar to those who read the book in Ms. Bronte's day, and probably familiar to many of us in this day and age. Nevertheless, Ms. Bronte took the time to document these things carefully. The descriptions of Rochester's home, the lanes in front if it and its orchards and fields; the destitute and grimly cold school for girls; and the small country town where Jane makes the acquaintance of a small group of benefactors towards the end of the novel are all a testament to life as it existed at this distant time and age.The novel is looked upon as a classic and should be. Ms. Bronte not only created a beautiful piece having to do with the nature of love--personal to her but universal in nature--but did so in such a spectacular way that she actually makes the reader feel this love, both for her creation, and for her."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"This turned out to be an exceptional book though I didn't think so in the beginning. By what seems the hundredth page, I had decided it was a feminine version of David Copperfield but not as interesting. By the hundred and fiftieth page, I was completely discouraged and was sure it had turned into the very romantic mush I detest (a lot of what she feels about him and what he feels about her, and so on). Somewhere soon after that, I fell in and was absorbed. It became a tremendously good book with a fantastic plot and a good pace. I read for hours and hours at a sitting enjoying every single minute of it and only stopped when something absolutely forced me. Excellent, excellent!Jane Eyre is an orphaned child under the guardianship of her maternal aunt. Not liked by her aunt and not able to get along with her cousins, Jane is sent to Lowood School for the children of the poor (it is a charity school) to be taught the fundamentals and, more importantly, to be conditioned for a life of poor expectations. Lowood changes the strong willed, impetuous Jane into a woman of uncommon restraint. When she accepts a post as governess to Adele at Thornfield Hall, she attracts the attention of Mr. Rochester, the master of the house, who has the desire to reclaim himself from a sordid past. He comes to believe that Jane has the power to transform him and help him to realize himself in the better light that he has not heretofore been able to achieve on his own. But his secrets are not far away and peculiar events at Thornfield make the reader question his advances. Sworn not to ask about who or what is in the room on the third floor, Jane's iron resolve begins to falter with the dreamlike romance and the reader begins to trepiditiously hope for her happiness. When Mr. Rochester is unable to keep his past under wraps, however, Jane is forced onto a path that will require all of her internal resources to survive but will ultimately put her in the position to make choices for herself rather than just choose among available options. The question is, with her conditioning, can she lead with her heart instead of her head?My only legitimate greivance, and given only in the vein of humour, is that is seems like Jane would have taught Adele some English. The child speaks only in French and myself not being able to read French, I did not understand anything the child ever said. Luckily, her exuberance and intent still comes through and the reader can develop a softness for the child without understanding her dialogue."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"I will agree that this performance is given with sensitivity to the voice of Jane Eyre and of Charlotte Bronte, but alas it's an abridged version. The above listing does not give any indication of this, consequently I was very disappointed when it arrived. I personally have no use for abridged books. When I pick up a book (print or audio) I want to experience the entire book. Abridged books always leave me feeling cheated, wondering what did I miss?"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"I first read this book when I was ten and reread it every decade as a special treat to myself. It is one of the great classics of English literature. It is, essentially, a Cinderella story, and I STRONGLY recommend it as an andidote to the Woman-Hear-Me-Roar (or is it &quot;Girl Power&quot;?) stuff being pushed on young ladies nowadays as a means to making the sex strong. The story begins when the heroine, Jane Eyre, is a young orphan of about nine, and follows her through school and her career as a governess in a wealthy but mysterious man's home. She falls in love, learns of an impediment to her immediate gratification, does the right thing and suffers for her pains, but in the end is rewarded for her suffering. Very irrelevant to the late twentieth century, obviously. Charlotte Bronte (the author) is frquently encountered around the same time in life one encounters Dickens--youth--but, like Dickens, she most definitely wrote for adults. Therefore, the book is probably a difficult read for all but the most tenacious middle schooler, but as it begins from the very real, very painful point of view of a powerless child, it has a good hook to draw in the young reader. Its literary style is Romantic, with the liberal use of semi-colons, inverted sentences, and detailed descriptions. This book is a MUST for all well-educated young ladies--the next step after Little Women and before the Jane Austen novels. And sorry for the gender stereotyping; I'm sure there are boys and men out there who read this book and loved it, but I never met one."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"I recently saw a preview for a Jane Eyre movie soon to come out... and after having just gotten a Kindle, I thought I would read the book before I see the movie. A wonderful bonus... when I went to download it, it was free!Don't let the title of my review discourage you from reading it... This is a wonderful story--- more about overcoming horrible tribulations and finding peace and love through perseverance.The first page or two kind of threw me, as this novel was written in the mid 1800's. I was worried the language would make it too difficult to comprehend, but I was wrong. By the third page I was hooked, and hardly put it down the next 3 days until I finished it. This book grabs you from the beginning and doesn't let you go, even after you've finished it. It is definitely one of those novels that leaves you wanting more of these people. It is so well written, you feel submersed into their world-- and can picture every detail with great clarity, and feel every emotion.My only regret with this book is that I never read it till now. Wonderful, wonderful book!"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"I'm going to try to keep this short and sweet,I'm rating the movie-tie in edition not the story its self.Now with Jane Eyre being my #1 favorite book of all time, I'm very excited about the new adaptation coming out next month. I thought this movie tie-in edition would be worth picking up, since it's suppose to have a ton of extras including the story behind the story, John Maynard on Jane's sexual awakening, John G. Peters on Jane's otherness etc(Which I found listed in the table of contents on bn.com). The extras and the nice cover were my only reasons for buying it, seeing as I already own a copy of the Barnes & Noble classics version of the book.Now to my surprise and disappointment all the extras that I looked forward to reading seemed to be jam packed into two pages and not really all that interesting.But there is hope,if you buy the ebook version you get a copy of the screenplay by Moira Buffini(Which is why it gets 4 stars). In my opinion after reading the screenplay it is worth the $6.36 and a nice treat for those of us who are impatiently awaiting the release for this bold new vision on Jane."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"If I read it in high school, I don't remember it. I do remember reading Wuthering Heights ~~ but that was in college. Jane Eyre is much more romantic than Wuthering Heights ~~ it is a Cinderella Tale with a happy ending too!Jane was orphaned at a very young age and was raised by a cold-hearted aunt and terrible cousins before being shipped off to an institution. Jane makes the best of her lowly lot in life and decided to take a chance of living life to the fullest by taking a governess job for Mr. Rochester. Little does she know how much life would change because of that decision!The trials and tribulations that beset Jane are those that every woman can identify with. The joy and fear of falling in love with Mr. Rochester (Edward) is inspiring. The tragic secret that Edward failed to disclose to Jane ~~ sending her away is so sad. Jane finds herself again in a town many miles away from her beloved ~~ and finds her family after all these years. Only the unrequited love for Edward was the mar on the beautiful paradise she has found. She does find love again and grows into this splendid woman who is strong and independent ~~ and yet, still very feminine.I strongly believe that everyone should read this classic as Charlotte Bronte wrote a thought-provoking novel filled with description and conversations. It is a moral book ~~ designed to make the reader think of what is right and what is wrong. Jane stood up for her belief at the cost of her love ~~ though it was one of the hardest decisions she has ever had to make. And love finds her again.This is a book that makes you believe that if you have faith, things will come right and true for you. Even if it wasn't already a classic, it should be. How many books have withstood the test of time? This one is a golden treasure to add to your library!"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"The free Kindle version is fine if you aren't reading the book for study purposes and if you know a tiny hint of French. In fact, I'm of the opinion that reading 160+ year old books on Kindle has the distinct advantage of access to the built-in English dictionary. You can look up archaic words immediately without losing your page, thanks to the 'back' button. I didn't mind the fact that there were no page breaks between chapters as one previous reviewer did. In fact the novel was so gripping and compelling that the very fact that there were even chapters to break it up left me feeling somewhat impatient!The reason I am giving it 4 stars instead of 5 probably has more to do with Kindle books in general rather than this book in particular. It reads as easily as any other book I've read on Kindle. But it's the kind of novel where you want to flip back to a certain section and re-read a portion just because of what is currently being said by the characters, and there is no way to do that. As for the French passages I had mentioned earlier, they are really very few in number and even if you don't know any French, don't let it stop you from reading this novel. They're all things said by one character or another, often repeated in English. (Thank you, Charlotte Bront)! None of it is important to the plot or to the characters themselves.Charlotte Bront shows herself to be an incredibly masterful writer in \\"Jane Eyre.\\" There were times when I just stopped to admire the style with which she conveyed something and the techniques she used. She is also incredibly insightful into human nature. The main character is an introverted person and all of her thoughts, beautifully laid out, make her into one of the most compelling characters in literature. Although it may be difficult to see this, I do think that the author was showing her feminist colors, such as they were in those days, when she conjured up Jane Eyre.Thanks for making these classic books available for free on Kindle!"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"As much as I know this is a classic, and I feel a review a tad redundant, I've just read the magnificent Jane Eyre for the first time, and I'm so utterly enamoured, I simply must wax poetic about it a while!Where to start. I've just finished reading Charlotte Bront's Gothic masterpiece for the first time, and I feel a mixture of breathless and speechless.Chronicling the life of the orphaned Jane Eyre, the novel begins with a truly upsetting account of what can only be called horrific child abuse. We encounter Jane as she strikes back at her childhood tormentor--her cousin John--for the first time, after quietly enduring teasing, beating, and the hatred of her only family (her dead uncle's wife, and her 3 cousins) for the whole of her short 10 years. As punishment, she is confined to the 'Red Room', the room in which her uncle died. As the sun sets, and she's left in darkness, the terrified child has a panic attack, and her aunt advantageously uses the event to have Jane sent away to Lowood School--a change of scene to save her nerves.We watch Jane grow into a passionate young woman, develop self-respect, a distaste for injustice, and her own strong sense of right and wrong. After completing her education, and working two years at Lowood as a teacher, Jane hungers for a new situation in life, so advertises in the paper, and is invited to take up a post as governess for a child, at a wealthy, private residence. Here we experience part spooky mystery, part love story, and see the world of Thornfield Manor through fiery and fascinating Jane's eyes.Jane Eyre is many things--a journey of self discovery, a love story, and a surprisingly progressive tale for its day. It holds some strongly feminist ideas, or perhaps more than feminist, ideas about justice, class systems, and equality. It's Jane, a relative 'commoner' who shows more backbone and self-respect than many of her high-bred 'superiors'. Social standing, graces, and superficial manners all come second to intelligence, self-respect, actually having character, and one's own mind.It's mentioned--and constantly reiterated that neither Jane, nor her suitor, are physically much to look at. The idea of true beauty coming from within, and beauty being in the eye of the beholder is another strong theme here. Jane as a character is in strong contrast with others, such as the beautiful, yet shallow and capricious Georgiana Reed, or cruel and superficial Blanche Ingram. Where these women are admired in the highest regard in their upper class society, despite their lack of character, Jane is despised, but she is the better human being. I love that she KNOWS it, also.We're also presented with a wonderful array of unique and colourful characters, very few of whom seem black and white. Rochester, most obviously, struggling to justify his actions before God and society, every bit as much as to his own self; wanting to be good, wanting to be a better man, but really--let's be honest--failing. He's resigned to the fact he can't be better without outside influence. We have a role reversal here: rather than our male hero being a knight in shining armour to a damsel in distress, Rochester views Jane as his saviour. Then characters like Bessie: sweet, but with a temper that will turn as quickly as the wind. She's neither good, nor bad. The adorable, but admittedly vapid, Mademoiselle Ad&egrave;le, and above all Jane, who lives by her own rules and sense of morality, rather than those of society... and really, who's are better, here?. There are still clich&eacute;s here, though. The lunatic wife, the wicked stepmother and stepsisters (In the shape of aunt and cousins)... But at the time, were these clich&eacute;s at the time this was written?Amidst all the romance and wonderful characters, it's easy to forget the wonderful gothic thriller/mystery at the heart of Thornfield, and for anyone new to the story, its heartbreaking conclusion. And the romantic tension between Jane and Rochester? It's as palpable--if not more so--than any modern romance I've read (here's looking at you Twilight), but for once we're dealing with a girl with backbone. This is nothing like a Jane Austen love story. We're not dealing with manners and moving within the bounds of acceptable society--this is unrequited love, people.On an aside, for those who've readA Room of One's Own (Annotated), and Wolfe's criticism of both Charlotte Bront and Jane Eyre, it's interesting to see parallels between the two works: that a woman doesn't need a man to define her; that having one's own means is essential for any woman who wants to create (or maintain an independent mind); that it's the value of human being's heart and mind--not outward appearances--that is what gives them value (I'm thinking about Judith and William Shakespeare, here). Jane is every bit as good as Mrs and the Misses Reeds, the Ingrams, and indeed, a number of the men of this book. She is the intellectual equal of Rochester, and perhaps superior of St John, regardless of her sex.Despite the time since it was written, Jane Eyre is not hard to read. I often struggle with older novel but it's far easier than Dracula, which was an effort for me, though not necessarily a good comparison. It's hugely entertaining, in parts absolutely heartbreaking, and there is a good reason why it remains popular, and a 'classic' over a hundred years later. It's an extraordinary work of fiction, beautifully written, and with just as much to enjoy now as it did when it was first published."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"Jane Eyre, a girl of no importance and the daughter of an unapproved match, lives a troubled life for her first ten years under her aunt's roof. Her parents died when she was a baby and she was left as Aunt Reed's charge with no other living relatives that she knew of. When her aunt can no longer stand Jane any more, she sends her to a boarding school where the rules are strict and the headmaster is every bit the tyrant Aunt Reed was. But Jane conquers, becomes a teacher, and then wishes to become a private tutor. After her ad is received and her application accepted, Jane finds herself in the home of a mysterious and strange man, Mr. Rochester, who has put his ward, Adele, under Jane's tutelage. But then Jane finds herself falling deeply in love with Mr. Rochester, who she could not imagine would love her in return. This, and the strange happenings in Thornfield Hall, give Jane cause to doubt her future. And when Mr. Rochester's dark secret reveals itself, Jane must question her love and discover what she must do with her life before she can find the happiness she never had.____________________________________This is one of those \\"Can words describe?\\" books. And while I feel there aren't very many words that do an adequate job, I will try my best.Can you believe that I haven't read this book yet? I can't. For years, people have been telling me, \\"Sierra, you have to read this book.\\" \\"Sierra, this is one of the best books I've ever read.\\" \\"Oh my GOSH! You haven't read Jane Eyre?!\\" \\"What are you waiting for, you, the reader, of all people?\\"So here I am, having read (devoured) the long awaited book that has been loved, cried and giggled over by hordes. And I'm here to tell you people who have not yet read this book - \\"What. In the world. Are. You. Waiting for?!\\" (I know...I'm one to talk...but now I know how everyone else feels! haha!)Throughout the course of the book, I got choked up. But there was too much ahead to slow down, stop, and actually cry. However...when I got to the last chapter, I lost it. Tears came and the two-year-old little boy I was babysitting put down his yogurt and stared at me, head cocked to the side, probably completely confused as to why I was smiling and crying at the same time. After all the heartache and sadness, and even the little bits of joy in between, the happiness of the end just overwhelmed me. It was just too beautiful to not feel that way - there was so much emotion in my heart that I felt it would almost burst.Jane is a character I look up to - I want to be like her. Her decisiveness, her courage, her resolution, her faith...it amazed me, and amazes me still, even after the book has been set back on the shelf. She knew what she had to do and she did it - no matter the cost. And the way she loved everyone so unconditionally - especially Mr. Rochester - continually surprised me. Her kind heart, her gentle but firm manner, and her intense love... Wow. I also loved her close study of human nature and how she described and saw people - why she was intrigued by them.Mr. Rochester himself is quite a character. Going into this story, I was NOT expecting him to be the least like he was - physically ugly and mentally independent. He was strange, but yet so perfect for the story. In all my travels through literature, I've never met a character like him, and I doubt I ever will again. That character will always be embodied by Mr. Rochester alone. I easily fell for him as Jane did; her love for him was pure; she never once judged him for his faults; she loved him all the more for them. The reader cannot help but feeling the same. I loved seeing his pride break down, slowly but surely, and the way he described the experience after. It was just amazing.As far as the story line and the writing... Both were equally magnificent. The story captured me from the first, especially when I expected the novel to begin when she was older. But I loved every bit of it - every second was glorious, and painful and lovely. I cared for Jane so much that it didn't matter what she was doing - I wanted to read about her. And Mr. Rochester and St. John and Adele and everyone else. The writing was incredible, down to the very last word. I loved how she wrote most of the time in past tense, and then sometimes slipped smoothly into present tense, showing the reader exactly what it felt like, to be doing instead of remembering. I'm actually not a huge fan of present tense, but this was so perfect I just couldn't resist liking it.Favorite character: Mr. Rochester because of his originality...and how much I loved his character within the first few pages of his introduction.Favorite aspect: DUH! The love story, of course! Totally intriguing the way it was played out, the intensity of Mr. Rochester's secret hanging over it part of the time, the rest being Jane's own doubts about Mr. Rochester's nature or her sadness over him being engaged to a woman who would not and could not love him - and who he had no passion for either. Oh my gosh this story had me in its clutches and didn't let me go!!!There are no single words to describe this book. Magnificent and heart-pounding and gut-wrenching are about the best I can do. They are true - as true as true can be - but there is something about the book that can only be felt and understood by reading it yourself. It's not anything that can be described - it's an experience. One that I can't wait to relive again and again and again!!"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"I remember watching the movie as a young girl and how the story never really left me.

I'd give it 3.5 stars. I think it is a well written autobiography of a poor, plain but fiercely independent girl. You do feel sympathy for that girl and her moral and emotional struggle. However, there are some elements in this book that I do not like:1. The author's constant addressing of the \\"reader\\" is just peculiar. Most part of the book is written in first person voice, but every now and then she felt the urge to pause and remind the \\"reader\\" (thus switching to second person), this rather takes the reader out of the flow of the narrative. I personally do not like this.2. The two main male characters are wholly unlikable, even repulsive. Rochester comes across as a rude, sullen, selfish, deceptive and manipulative character. On the last point, I am referring to the episode of him, in order to arouse Jane's jealousy, pretending to have fallen in love with another prettier girl. And of course much can be said about his deceptiveness and selfishness. It is indeed hard to understand why Jane would fall for this guy, except that he is really the very first male person she encounters in the real world. As to St. John Rivers, he is simply a religious nutcase, all he talks about is his missionary work, showing no human compassion to even his own sisters. Yet, although Jane eventually rejects him, the author pains him in a saintly aura.3. The constant references to scripture is really irksome.Nonetheless, I do think the personality of the main character is believable and depicted vividly, that's why I would give it 3.5 stars (good but not great).Now on the introduction and notes by Michael Mason, I think they are atrocious. First in the introduction he arrogantly suggests that the general reader cannot \\"get\\" serious literature, only professional critics like him holds the canonical interpretation (I paraphrase). Here's news to Mr. Mason: we have a brain and we can think for ourselves too, thank you very much. But if the introduction is mildly annoying, the notes are just ridiculous. There are chunks of conversation in the book in French, but he never bothers to translate them; however he *constantly* FORWARD-references plot elements. For example, before we find out who Rochester's maniac wife is, he already mentions her name and what she's going to the next day; at another point when Jane had a dream about Thornfield on fire, he says something like \\"considering what happened next, this is so accurate that it is like a 'second vision'\\" (I paraphrase again). This is called \\"RUINING THE BOOK\\", as some other reviewer said (I believe he or she was referring to Mason's notes), this is like an annoying friend constantly telling you what's going to happen next when you watch a movie. This is so frustrating at times I wish Mr. Mason was standing next to me so I can whack him with the book (and shove his \\"canonical view\\" of serious literature down his throat)."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"Charlotte Bronte's Jane Eyre, the subject of many AP required reading lists, perhaps strikes discontent to those who read the novel in high school. A better appreciation for this classic will probably be gained reading it later in life.Bronte seemed to have modeled the character and conditions of Jane Eyre around her own life, so the novel has some biographical elements. Jane Eyre, after a difficult childhood quite Dickensesque in nature, eventually lands a job as a governess of Thornfield Hall as she approaches adulthood. Jane works here for awhile, and begins to adapt to her new station in life. Her employer, Mr. Rochester, comes and goes from Thornfield, but eventually news comes back that he is to marry the beautiful but snobbish Miss Ingram. As time wears on, however, there is an indication that Rochester marrying Miss Ingram might only be a ruse for him to actually find the secrets of Jane's heart. Jane struggles back and forth between her feelings for Rochester as her employer, and him as a man. Eventually Rochester asks Jane to marry him, but he has some baggage in his past that he is able to keep from Jane until the moment they are to be married. Jane then discovers the truth: Rochester is married to a woman named Bertha, who is insane and resides locked in the basement of Thornfield. Jane knows she cannot marry now, and leaves Thornfield to pursue a new life. Romanticized in nature, events suggest that this is not the end of Rochester and Jane, and that they will cross paths sometime later. How and under what circumstances you discover in the book's second half.One theme Bronte explores is the importance of equality within backgrounds and classes. Jane changes her station by beginning in poverty and living as a governess only to eventually be able to gain a sense of independence. Jane, despite struggles, is often conscientious and fair to others, which is juxtaposed by Miss Ingram and her family, who loathe the site of governesses, thinking them to be unintelligent and worthless.There is also a sense that Jane, although first seeing herself as lower to others, builds self-confidence and understands herself as equal to others, especially Rochester: \\"I was an equal--one with whom I might argue--one whom, if I saw good, I might resist.\\" When she discovers and matures, this gives dimension and depth to her character.Perhaps Jane Eyre has as much to do with illustrating a heroine's ability to be a free thinker, independent, and even a bit brash at points, which could be viewed as atypical of female protagonists during this time. We experience Jane's introspective outlook on all things by the first person narration, and Jane displays a depth to her character, especially when she is skeptical about Rochester's first proposal of marriage, which seems too \\"fairy tale\\" to be true. She doesn't give in because it seems like the proper thing to do, or the easiest. She refuses to marry Rochester earlier in the novel out of principle, and despite his pleas, she sticks to her guns, even though she knows it will be a rough go in life for both her and Rochester.Character depth is illustrated in both Jane and Rochester's change from beginning to end. Rochester has moments of \\"blindness\\" in the novel. First, he is \\"blind\\" to humility and life responsibilities in the first half of the book at Thornfield Hall. Later in the novel, he is physically blind after the tragic accident that leaves Thornfield a ruin, but, has learned a sense of sympathy and humility that he didn't have earlier. Jane also undergoes a transition from her outlook on life: she believes and knows by novel's end that she is equals to her peers.While a bit overly romanticized at points, Bronte's novel has fantastic character development. The scene when Jane battles with her conscience while leaving Thornfield is epically captured by Bronte: \\"He who is taken out to pass through a fair scene to the scaffold, thinks not of the flowers that smile on his road, but of the block and axe-edge..\\" Although Jane feels a sense of tragedy at this moment, she is not afraid to stick to what her intuition tells her is right, and she uses her faith as her instrument to guide her fate.Over all, Bronte captures a powerful and moving story of a \\"plain\\" girl who overcomes difficult moments to find faith and healing in life. I felt that it was a strong story, but tended to drag during Jane's stay at St. John's after leaving Thornfield. The story seems to get \\"stuck in the mud\\", and many moments of Jane's narration become repetitive. However, it doesn't detract from an otherwise powerful, impressive classic."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"Jane Eyre is book #6 on theThe Well-Educated Mind's list of must-read novels, and it immediately draws comparison to the two prior selections,Pride and PrejudiceandOliver Twist. Both Pride and Prejudice and Jane Eyre were written by female authors and feature strong female protagonists. Elizabeth Bennett and Jane Eyre are both very feisty and committed to finding romantic love in a time when that wasn't always the basis for marriages. The major difference between the two books, though, is that Pride and Prejudice is far more subtle, with the \\"action\\" taking place largely within the lead character's thoughts and emotions, while a whole lot of exciting, external action happens in Jane Eyre. That's not to say one is better than the other, only that they are different in this way while being somewhat similar in overall theme.Like Oliver Twist, Jane Eyre is an orphan. \\"Luckily\\" for her, though, she wasn't abandoned to a work house but adopted by a well-to-do uncle. I say \\"luckily\\" in quotes because the uncle dies when she's one (this isn't a spoiler, I promise) and she's then left in the care of her hateful aunt, who shows her no love or mercy for the ten years Jane lives with her. Jane is the victim of vicious beatings at the hands of her older cousin John, too. But the difference between her and Oliver Twist is that she fights back -- she's spunky, not just a miserable sad sack like Oliver (I hated that character and the entire book). When her aunt says that Jane is unfit to associate with her cousins, Jane shots back \\"They're unfit to associate with me!\\" When asked by a preacher what she needs to do to avoid going to Hell, Jane says, \\"I must keep in good health, and not die.\\"The level of abuse young Jane suffers is far less onerous than that of Oliver, and therefore more believable. She inhabits a world of realistic characters, not stereotypes. I felt bad for Jane; I just rolled my eyes and said \\"Oh brother\\" whenever Oliver was absurdly mistreated.But Jane doesn't stay a child in the story for long -- soon enough she's an adult young woman with new kinds of problems. And of course, she falls in love... The love-story component of this book is probably the best I've ever read, and there are a few chapters composed solely of dialog between two lovers that are absolutely beautiful to read. This IS, however, an action-oriented story, and the plot is both believable and engaging. The story is well-paced, too: Twice when I felt things were just beginning to get a bit tedious there were abrupt changes of scenery that kept me tuned in. I loved this book! While not quite as good asGulliver's Travelsor Pride and Prejudice, this might just be the third best novel I've ever read."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"i thoroughly enjoyed this book. i must admit they have some pretty BIG words! but it aint nothing a dictionary cant fix. i never did use a dictionary though and i got by well.the story in this book is just amazing! i have NEVER read a book like this before and i have read a lot of books. if u read this book u will not be disappointed!in fact you'll probably want to read it again. after i was through i basically read it again just looking and comparing stuff. its so beautifully written. i've never read any other charlotte bronte books but im planning on it.if u get this book u will definitely enjoy it!"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"Published in 1847 under the pseudonym Currier Bell, Charlotte Bronte's Jane Eyre has definitely become a timeless classic. Even now, over 150 years after its debut, Jane Eyre's popularity amongst scholars and avid readers has not wavered. However, nowadays, its use of old language and portrayal of a time long past has made it less appealing to the general public.Jane Eyre, the protagonist of the story, is an orphan cared by her aunt, whose whole family views her as an onerous responsibility pushed upon them at her uncle's deathbed. After a few incidents with her taunting cousins, Jane is shipped off to Lowood, a school run by a hypocritical minister. Despite the hardships she had to endure at Lowood, Jane graduates and eventually leaves Lowood to become a governess. At Thornhill, she meets and falls in love with her master, the cold and mysterious Mr. Rochester. However, when it seems that happiness is finally within reach, Jane discovers Mr. Rochester's dark secret that puts a halt to their relationship. But of course, due to her high morals and strong determination to stick to them, all ends well for Jane and Mr. Rochester.While this piece is a story of finding love and happiness, Bronte utilizes Jane's experiences (which are based partly off her experiences in school and as a governess) to criticize the inferiority with which women were viewed at the time. Although Jane is more educated, well-mannered, and morally superior to her master, her status is still considered far beneath his. The Rivers sisters is also representation of how Bronte feels women should be: poised, knowledgeable, and talented.It is no wonder that Charlotte Bronte is known for her ability to make characters and situations come alive. Bronte's vivid and lively narration makes Jane a loveable and relatable character. Through the details of her narration and the fitting syntax structure, her readers are able to clearly grasp the struggles, decisions, and dilemmas that Jane faces constantly. When Jane fought hunger and the cold at Lowood, when she choose to leave behind her ticket to \\"happiness,\\" when she came into inheritance at the Rivers's home and returned to Thornhill, Bronte took us with her. The imagery is also plenty and a great aid in visualizing the setting, especially the mysterious Thornhill.I thoroughly enjoyed reading Jane Eyre. Maybe it is because I am just a sucker for romances or maybe it is because I generally love historical fiction, but I did not agree with my peers when they said that the story was boring. I admit, the plot does become a bit dragged on at some points, like Jane's time at Lowood and her stay with the Rivers. Overall though, I still say that Jane Eyre is definitely one of my more favorite ones that I read last year.If you don't mind historical fiction and can get your head around the archaic diction, then I highly recommend Jane Eyre. Especially if you are a sucker for romances like me."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"Any reader that enjoys cuddling up with a romantic novel should definitely read Jane Eyre by Charlotte Bronte. It is a classic love story that features many brilliant twists in the plot. It includes characters that are well developed and realistic, which makes it easy for the reader to relate to them. The book has a wonderful theme about relationships that easily applies to life today.I suggest that people ages 14 through 18 read this book. Younger readers may find it difficult to read because Bronte's writing style is somewhat advanced.I would read this book again, and easily be swept away once more to Jane's life at Thornfield Hall. It's a shame that the author did not write a sequel, because she easily could have continued on and embellished on the latter half of Jane's life to create another terrific and more enchanting story than the first.I greatly enjoyed this novel because it was fast-paced and there were so many shocking coincidences that it almost seemed like a fairy tale. I think that all girls at some point in their life should read Jane Eyre to see what a classy love story is like."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"I have just finished reading this book in school (I'm in year 10, and im glad Ive read it now before it was too late; all adults who have read this always say they wish they had done when they were a teenager). As it's so long, the class only had to read half of it, but I felt compelled to read the rest at home as I really felt for the character, and I felt like I'd just die if I didn't find out what happens to her! That's what defines any good book: only if the reader is made to feel for the characters can they be interested enough to take in the issues raised in the novel. I usually find that novels that are fun to read, about characters that readers warm to, are generally superficial, whereas novels involving two-dimensional characters contain relevent and worthwhile morals and issues for us to dwell on. Thats what defines Jane Eyre as a classic; it has the best of both worlds."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"Charlotte Bronte's Jane Eyre is a book that reveals, the complexities of a woman's mind, her struggle for independence and her search for a separate identity. It is a journey beginning with the innocence of a young girl, an orphan, and unfolds to show us the growth of the female protagonist in her search for an identity, helping us to see the world through her eyes.Bronte's style of writing is such, that the confusion and bewilderment young Jane feels is palpable, as is her hunger to be loved and the hurt she feels, on being ill-treated. The novel cannot be called an autobiography, but many of the incidents that go into the making of the novel have been taken from the life of the author. There is also an element of the supernatural, which appealed greatly to the readers of the time but does not invoke the same response today.The book also gives us an insight into the age in which the author wrote. The position of women, in the society or rather the lack of it. The portrayal of Rochester's wife in the attic at Thornfield can be interpreted as the darker side of Jane's personality. The part of her that she suppresses after being locked in the \\"Red Room\\" at the Reed mansion. Mad bertha is that part of Jane that she has to lock away in order to be accepted in a stifling and prudish Victorian society."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"Well, I can't call Charlotte Bronte another Marlowe, Shakespeare, or Dickens. But what I will call her is a very close runnerup. Bronte masterfully shows us a young girl's growth in an abusive environment to a mature an admirable woman. The images are deep and convincing. The scene where Jane forgives her abusive aunt is very touching and memorable. Bronte also strikes us with the complex Rochester. Perhaps Bronte's greatest accomplishment is how she makes Jane such a Christ like figure. It is interesting that this novel came out in 1847. It is also possible to wonder if this work inspired Charles Dickens' masterpiece &quot;David Copperfield&quot; (1850)."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"I have read this book in Hungarian, but I know it is as good in English as in my mother language...

In other parts, I felt the story flashed by and I missed it (the ending where Jane went back to Rochester, Saint John's marriage proposal, Jane's botched wedding with Rochester). I do NOT think the woman in the attic (Bertha, Rochester's first wife) is a lunatic. I think her actions, although violent, are justified (ripping Jane's veil to shreds- She doesn't want her husband marrying another woman while she is locked in the attic). Though this review appears negative, I really did like the book. I, too, was assigned this as an AP English reading assignment (as JACKIE from Rotterdam, NY), and I am glad I was assigned it, for had I not been, I might not have ever read the timeless story of thencredible heroine, Jane Eyre."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"I was assigned to read Jane Eyre for school, but I did not realize that it would take me forever to read! Although many disagree, I think that Jane goes into too much detail about every single thing that goes on in her life. We could understand the story and enjoy the themes of it without reading so many detailed descriptions of unimportant things! Overall, I would recommend this book to people, but I would suggest to skip the things that do not seem important."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"I just finished reading &quot;Jane Eyre&quot; for my grade twelve English class. I borrowed the book from my school library. About four chapters into the book, I returned the novel to the library, and went out that night to get my own copy.I cannot express in words how this novel has touched my heart. The musical nor the movie will never ever return the stirring of emotion that I felt for Jane's character while reading it from the creative and romantic mind of Charlotte Bront. I did cry when Jane witnessed the death of her very best friend, Helen Burns, in Lowood School. I felt bitter and angry when Mr. Rochester did not tell Jane about his first wife, but I also felt relieved when Jane and Mr. Rochester rekindled their love to face a new life together.If there is one novel that will ever touch my heart, look at my life as a woman, and respect the heroics that women of past ages have undergone, this is the novel.Jane Eyre: this will be a novel respected for ages to come."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"When I picked up this book, I was expecting Jane Austen, and instead had to contend with the foul Bronte way of writing: dry, emotionless, humorless -- and plain dull.

It was extremely difficult to get through the book because not only was the plot an absolute bore, the characters also contributed to that boredom.After reading the book twice, trying to comprehend what was the point of the story, I still have yet to understand why Charlotte Bront even bothered writing this book. From what I can interpret, Jane Eyre is a girl who is lonely and dejected but finds love in a man called Mr. Rochester. Everything that happened in the middle is not significant. The story is extremely boring because it is too sentimental, too dull (just like Jane Eyre), and too long for a story with that plot line. What the characters say or do have no lasting effect in the reader's memory- it just blows right by. The characters are basic and have superficial, unoriginal motives. They do not do anything exciting or significant to help add to the plot. I kept skipping pages or rereading the same stuff because each and every page seems identical content-wise. The entire book has absolutely no memorable moments, proving how insignificant the work of literature truly is. Reading the book is a world of pain.If you are thinking about picking up this book and reading, save yourself the time and money, and go read something else worthwhile."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"Reading this book was about as pleasant as a throwing knife to the face.

Aesthetic standards can't be grounded.Thus, don't listen to anyone who tries to distinguish between &quot;serious&quot; works of literature like this one and allegedly &quot;lesser&quot; novels.

Somehow Bronte manages to develop her personality perfectly, and gets you to like this Jane Eyre, though she is probably the only one in the story who you will like. Bronte makes all of the other characters extremely one sided in their personalities, all dominated by a fatal flaw of some type (the domineering spirit of Mr. Rochester, the extreme sacrafice of emotion by Saint John, the extreme simplicity of Mrs. Fairfax, etc.) This was both good (in that it helps one to see that nearly any character trait can be taken too far and become bad) and bad (the characters were rather stiff somehow).The only other complaint that I have is that it was a bit long and drawn out.

Charlotte Bront was not that much different than the main character, Jane Eyre, in that they both lived without parents and they both know what loss can be like. The book flows eloquently from start to finish and contains many life morals concerning pride, love, and what it takes to live in this world.

When she grew up she found a job as a governess at Thornfield and fall in love with Mr. Rochester, who kept a terrible secret.Maybe it's because I'm only 10 years old,but I found this book rather [odd] and not very romantic at all"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"The book Jane Eyre, by Charlotte Bronte is about a girl who is about ten years old, and she lives with her aunt, cousins because her parents had died when she was young. Her cousin John, who is the master of the house, always harasses her. Jane leaves to go to school, and then she put an ad in the newspaper. A lady named Mrs. Fairfax comes to take her to where she works so Jane can live with them. Jane is a governess who teaches a little girl named Adele. When the master of the house, Mr. Rochester, comes and Jane starts to like him. Jane is eighteen when she went to live at the house in Thornfield.After Jane has been at the Thornfield house for so long she gets a letter saying that her aunt is dying. So Jane goes to her aunts house before her aunt goes and stays for a little bit until she has to get back to work at Thornfield. After that she leaves Thornfield and found a nun who knew her parents. Jane heads back to Thornfield and falls in love and almost marries. But then she finds her self-alone and penniless, then Jane finds that she is rich. The book is good and exciting until the end because of what happens to Jane in the novel.The book has a lot of mystery like when Jane had to put out a fire in Mr. Rochester's bedroom, and romance. In the book in the beginning there is discrimination against woman's rights when master John hurts Jane with his bare hands, this book does have woman's rights in the beginning and in the middle of the book. This book is interesting because it was very expressive of how a teenage life is through this book. The reason why it is so expressive is that the book drags out a teenager life of how problems come and go around. When they explain what is going on in the story with Jane the author explains the weigh she takes the problem in the novel.This book would be really good for people who like love stories and mysteries all in one. This book is a good for maybe teens to high school or even the beginning college students that what a adventure or two with the love and passion in the novel."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"This was a Book club suggestion.

Half of the book is Jane rambling on about Mr. Rochester. This book is very religious (this i don't mind) and Jane rambles on about this later on in the book. Nonetheless, the book was great. It had a many twists and turns. Yet it ticked me off that it all fell into place all of a sudden, for it dragged the conflicts. The book brings up Jane from a young girl of 8 to a woman of 19. This book would bring tears to your eyes. Don't get deceived by the first 150 pages. It is not all dull dull dull.

There is something about Charollet's writing that captured my imagination and the story line of Jane and Mr. Rochester is enchanting. A great romanitc/mystery/gothic novel for everyone!"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"In the 156 years since its publication, Charlotte Bronte's Jane Eyre has been a source of controversy - first, over its suitability for and, later, its portrayal of women. When it first emerged in three volumes from the British publishing house of Smith, Elder, and Company under the nom de plume of Currer Bell, it was popular in spite of being deemed unsuitable reading for the Christian woman. Ironically, a century and a half later, it's come under feminist criticism for its allegedly archaic and weak depiction of the Victorian woman.The story itself is familiar to many. The orphaned Jane is left in the care of her mean-spirited aunt who pampers her own selfish children. The aunt can't abide Jane's willful temperament and banishes the child to Lowood, a charity school run by the hypocritical, Bible-thumping Brocklehurst. After disease epidemics for reform, Jane becomes a teacher at Lowood and then a governess for the adopted daughter of the mysterious Mr. Rochester - a man whose many secrets threaten to destroy Jane when she falls in love with him in spite of herself.In large part, the novel is autobiographical. Bronte herself was born in Yorkshire in 1816 and sent to live with an aunt when her mother died. She and her sisters were sent to Cowan Bridge - a strict Methodist charity school where two of Bronte's sisters died (and became the inspiration for Jane's saintly schoolmate, Helen Burns). Bronte became a teacher and then a governess herself, a position she detested.Jane Eyre is a blend of romance, Gothic horror, and a literary form known as Bildungsroman - an internal and external first-person account of coming-of-age. This is the most basic sense in which Jane Eyre is radical - most coming-of-age stories were (and, for that matter, continue to be) told about boys. Jane Eyre's story is not only about a girl, but about a girl who rebels against social conventions on her own principles.Ultimately, the story is about choices and extremes Jane faces and her journey to finding a middle ground that is suitable for her and doesn't compromise her personal integrity.Spiritually, Jane is faced with Brocklehurst - the epitome of the sanctimonious Evangelical movement. She then meets Helen Burns, whose love for God is certainly sincere, but leads to passivity and self-denigration. Later, Jane finds her counsin, St. John, whose religion is neither hypocritical nor meek, but leads to ambition and self-righteousness. Jane navigates the extremes to find her own understanding of love for God, ending her tale with, \\"Amen; even so come, Lord Jesus\\".Jane equally struggles to find her ambiguous place in the structure of Victorian class society. She comes from a monied family to whom she doesn't truly belong, giving her the social carriage and education of the aristocracy. Yet she works in the lower class jobs of teacher and governess reserved for unmarriageable women, where her intellect and her sense of self rebel, as they did for Bronte.But Jane's deepest conflict is between her need for independence and her desire for love. Rochester offers her love at the price of dependence. St. John offers her professional fulfillment at the price of love - a conflict I found meaningful and with which I could deeply identify. The dichotomy remains 156 years laterbetween ambitious, independent women living lives devoid of love versus dutiful wives and mothers living lives devoid of self-awareness and intellectual satisfaction. Even if few women desire these extremes, they continue to be offered and expected and refusing them can be the same source of pain and confusion that Jane experiences.Her love for Rochester is tempting because he can offer her two things, even as a mistress, which she has lacked her whole life - money and a sense of family. Jane realizes that the lack makes her needy and that neediness can never be the basis for an equitable relationship.Rochester is a basically good man, though deeply flawed. He hasn't locked Bertha away which, to a Victorian reader, would have indicated his kindness given the atrocities of the Victorian asylum. He adopts Adele with little reason to believe she's his own child. But Rochester's problems are largely his own doing and Jane is clearly his intellectual and moral superior - another factor unlikely to make for the equitable relationship Jane seeks.But he does tempt her and it's no accident that at the moment of her greatest temptation, Jane sees Bertha Mason - the symbol of Victorian wifehood - locked away to the point of bestial insanity. Is it any wonder Jane flees?The final third of the book - the \\"Whitcross section\\" - feels forced, overlong, and dull despite its importance to the story. In it, Jane finds her family and her inheritance while Rochester gains in humility and moral strength. With these needs fulfilled, Jane and Rochester are finally able to come together as true equals.The book's epilogue, beginning, \\"Reader, I married him\\" has been the source of much debate. Many feel the entire last chapter in which, a decade later, Jane extols the blessings of married life, indicate that Jane has submitted at last to the mundane wifehood expected of her. However, even the first sentence belies this conclusion - Jane is the subject of the sentence, not the object of it. Like everything else in her story, marriage is something she does for herself, not something that simply happens to her. In it, she describes her marriage as \\"free as solitude\\", in which talking and sharing one another's thoughts are their greatest pleasures. Rather than a dismal descent into dailiness, this is Bronte's summary - that women who remain true to their own integrity and give in neither to the temptation of ambition nor that of meek dependence find what they seek - a love shared by two whole people who are able to remain fully themselves."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"I have to read this book for English and I can't stand it. I struggle through about twenty pages at a time, and then drop the book in boredom. I think it is interesting that all the girls in my class have absolutely no problem with it. My judgement is not entirely fair because I despise romance novels, but unless you want a book where there is only one exciting scene, and a short one at that, avoid this book!!! If you are assigned this book, however, don't panic...there are always &quot;Cliff's Notes&quot; :)"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"Tis story had a little of everything, romance, mystery, horror, and more. I love this book and could not put it down. I would recommend it to anyone seeking a beautifully romantic and riveting experience."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"In this timeless first-person narrative, Jane Eyre --a small, plain-faced, intelligent and honest English orphan-- recounts her childhood and latter years leading to her marriage to the mysterious Edward Rochester.What make the story fast-paced, fascinating, and ultimately admirable are not the mundane events and incidents that happen to her, but the manner in which she tells them. Within a few pages it becomes obvious that the narrator is a character who is a master of the English language. Her sentence openers are well thought out, well measured, and well balanced--a veritable fountain of wisdom.In addition, Jane owns a terrific imagination, which coupled with her lust for life, will get her to where she wants to go--but only after she experiences hurt, physical abuse, and much suffering.The novel goes through five distinct stages:1. Gateshead. This is the residence of Jane spends of her childhood, and where she experiences the cruelties volleyed at her by her aunt (Mrs. Reed) and cousins.2. Lowood School. In this school she meets the mystic Helen Burns and Maria Temple, whom Jane admires and sees as a role model. In this school she also endures the headmaster's humiliations and gratuitous abuses.3. Thornfield Manor. The manor is owned by Edward Rochester, who is her employer and with whom she falls in love.4. Moor House or Marsh's End. Owned by the Rivers family who happen to be her relatives. Here Jane received a marriage proposal from her passionless clergyman-cousin St John Rivers.5. Ferndean. A second house owned by her beloved Rochester.While we enjoy child characters such as Dickens' David Copperfield, Little Dorritt, and Pip, we admire Jane Eyre much more because she is proud and shows a fighting spirit. She fights back. \\"I resisted all the way: a new thing for me,\\" she tells us as Bessie takes her to be locked in the red-room, following a fight with the brat John Reed.She doesn't just let things happen to her; and the fact that very same spirit gets her in trouble, she also fights extricate herself from her predicaments. Resourceful is the word that fits Jane. I always admire the passage in the novel in which she wants change in her life and how an epiphany comes to her: Advertise! And that single action gets her not only her first employment, but also her first and only love: Mr. Rochester. But little did she know the mystery that engulfed the manor, and much less the source of the hideous laughter: \\"While I paced softly on, the last sound I expected to hear in so still a region, a laugh, struck my ears. It was a curious laugh - distinct, formal, mirthless. I stopped\\"The author, Charlotte Bronte, a magician of the English language will take you back to England as it was in the 1840s, making you experience the highs and lows of life in England during that period.Jane Eyre is true work of literature that will introduce readers of any age to memorable characters and a story that is inexhaustible in its wisdom. Not long ago I was moved by all the attention given to J. K. Rowling and her lovable character Harry Potter. Moved I was but not fascinated as I am every time I re-read Jane Eyre. While J. K. Rowling is an entertainer, Charlotte Bronte is a literary artist.If you like low-brow romances you won't find it here. It is a story of a woman who struggles with a world in which she doesn't quite fit. While the novel may be read as a critique of both gender and social class, it contains a strong feminist stance:Women are supposed to be very calm generally: but women feel just as men feel; they need exercise for their faculties, and a field for their efforts as much as their brothers do; they suffer from too rigid a restraint, too absolute a stagnation, precisely as men would suffer; and it is narrow-minded in their more privileged fellow-creatures to say that they ought to confine themselves to making puddings and knitting stockings, to playing on the piano and embroidering bags.Or,And was Mr. Rochester now ugly in my eyes? No, reader: gratitude and many associates, all pleasurable and genial, made his face the object I best liked to see; his presence in a room was more cheering than the brightest fire.The protagonist and narrator has no amazing qualities, she's a plain girl and it says so, many times in the novel, but she shows some endearing qualities --which I won't mention-- that readers inevitably discover.Ahead of her times, Charlotte Bronte, hints and unveils as much as it was permitted then, erotic tensions, boundless passions, and hateful marriage ironies. These were not qualities encouraged in Victorian women writers, and Jane Eyre was offensive to many a contemporary. That a woman should expose her inner most feelings, was unheard of:I had not intended to love him; the reader knows I had wrought hard to extirpate from my soul the germs of love there detected; and now, at the first renewed view of him, they spontaneously revived, great and strong! He made me love him without looking at me.Jane Eyre is a trans-formative book from which we can all learn. I always say that the depths of human emotions one doesn't find in either in psychology book or philosophical tracts--but only in fiction. \\"Reader, I married him.\\"Read it!The writing techniques I use in this article are all explained in Mary Duffy's writing manual:Sentence Openers"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"I loved the cover to this book.

The novel, dense, surprising and powerful, is illuminated in these remarkable illustrations by Fritz Eichenberg. (You are able to view a sampling of them on this page.)

Never had to at school, like so many people I know, so I had a totally open mind. I love Wuthering Heights, by sister Emily, and I was sort of expecting something of the same calibre. Maybe it is because Jane Eyre is more from the romance genre... I am not so sure. I certainly don't think that Charlotte's writing is anything near her sister's. I also find that there are two stories in Jane Eyre - the main one with Mr Rochester, and the second one with St Johns, and I found them slightly disjointed.

Bronte and Thackery both admired the enormous capability of women even if not recognized by nineteenth century society. Jane Eyre, and Becky Sharp of Vanity Fair, are both strong women but in different ways. Jane is selfless, innocent, filled with love and yet heroic. Becky uses people. And she outwits nearly everyone. While they are different types of people, both are strong women who take the initiative.Jane Eyre exposes the narrow mind of the dogmatic evangelical. He wishes to serve God. However he doesn't care much for people. On the other hand, Jane in her own loving and simple way, seems to be a much better person. She reminds me of Dorthea of Middlemarch.This wonderful book should be read by one and all!"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"one of my favorite romances. i reread jane eyre at least once a year. just about wear out my copy. good read for all ages.... look for the movie with orsen wells and joan fontain excuse name spelling.. windy"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"I read Wuthering Heights a number of years ago and never was very interested in it.

The language is beautiful, character development rich, and scenes dont move too slow. Anyone who's been prematurely judged in life or has loved to the point of heartbreak will see themselves in Jane.

She still loved him as much as she did before, even when he was half blind, poor, and only had one hand. That's what you call true love.

My point of view changed as I realized that all of the families mentioned in the book are all dysfunctional, all of them had some sort of problem. I made this my thesis. In order to get the most out of this book, you must appreciate the detail of each thought that Charlotte Bronte put into text. I think this book is an excellent classic and anyone who thinks different does not appreciate classic romantics. I think Bronte did an excellent job and hope that she knows that there are people who appreciate all of her hard work.

Charlotte Bronte is an excellent author, really gifted. Why, then, did I only give it four stars? This is because I grew sick and tired of the long, dull details towards the end of the book. I just wanted Jane to go away. I wanted it resolved, but quickly. I was becoming quickly agitated and annoyed. But still, as angered as I was towards the ending (by the way, I didn't care for the deal with the Rivers family at all), the beginning was so majestic I just couldn't insult it too much.

It is a wonderful example of a book that can be read over and over again and with each reading comes a new experience. Charlotte Bronte tells a formidible tale of one woman's intellect and passions which break across &quot;custom&quot; and &quot;caste,&quot; to use Bronte's own words. Bronte wonderfully describes the inner voice of Jane which Jane instinctually values from a young age. It leads her to take extraordinary emotional risks. She does not allow herself to be shamed into behavior, nor does she shy away from her own desires and ideas. This is a book for ANY person, male or female of any color who likes a great mystery and a profound tale of human strength and experience"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"This book has a very long, slow beginging but once you get into it, it gets interesting.

Charlotte Bronte's writing style is so wonderful, different and refreshing. Her descriptions are so vivid, I can see why she caused such controversy in her day! This novel is honest, compelling and Jane is way ahead of her time, as Charlotte must have been. This has sparked me to dive headfirst into more classics and see what truly makes them classic. I would really recommend this for summer vacation at the beach, or curled up in a storm."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"Jane Eyre truly deserves its place in the pantheon of classic literature.

This is a classic that I think young women will enjoy because it presents a strong heroine in Jane, who faces hardship and temptation as she grows up and later deals with romance and creating a secure, stable position in life for herself.As a man, reading the book for the first time, I enjoyed watching the story unfold through Jane's eyes. Sometimes she makes what I thought were foolish choices, but she remains true to her character. She also maintains trust in God, and I was surprised how many references there were in the book to both Bible concepts and characters."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"Nope, I've never read this book until now. Can you believe it?! One of my goals for 2011 was to finally read the classic Jane Eyre and I am so glad I did! I get nervous reading classics. Alas my concerns were for naught because I thoroughly loved this book and I would highly recommend that everyone read this classic novel if they never have before (or re-read it if they haven't read it since high-school)!Having enticed my book club to join me in reading it since the movie adaptation was coming out in March as well, we had Jane Eyre as our March book pick, so with that I settled in for a classic read. Every time I sat down to read this book it would take a few pages to get back into the language but once I did, it didn't bother me and I totally understood everything that was going on, I just let it wash over me.Jane, how I loved you. You were strong at a time when many women were not. Your life sucked! If you are ever feeling down about yourself, pick this book up because it will make you feel better about your own lot. Poor little Jane did not have an easy start in life but she dealt with her hand and got through it, becoming quite the young little lady.Then she met Edward Rochester. Oh my goodness, brooding, ugly (as defined by Jane), kinda mean to his ward Adele, hiding crazy wives in the attic, Rochester. And guess what, even with all of this against him? We still kind of love him! Jane wants Rochester and Rochester wants Jane, but there are twists in the plot to keep them apart so will they be together? Oh so much angst and pining in this book will be had!Like I said, I am so glad I read it and would heartily recommend it to others. Everyone in my book club really enjoyed it as well, some more than others, and all seemed glad they read it."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"It's hard to imagine a better gothic romance than \\"Jane Eyre\\" -- gloomy vast houses, mysterious secrets, and a brooding haunted man with a dark past.In fact, Charlotte Bronte's classic novel has pretty much everything going for it -- beautiful settings, a passionate romance tempered by iron-clad morals, and a heroine whose poverty and lack of beauty only let her brains and courage shine brighter. And it's all wrapped in the misty, haunting atmosphere of a true gothic story -- madwoman in the attic and all.Jane Eyre was an orphan, abused and neglected first by relatives, then by a boarding school run by a tyrannical, hypocritical minister. But Jane refuses to let anyone shove her down -- even when her saintly best friend dies from the wretched conditions.But many years later, Jane moves on by applying to Thornfield Hall for a governess position, and gets the job. She soon becomes the teacher and friend to the sprightly French girl Adele, but is struck by the dark, almost haunted feeling of her new home.Then she runs into a rather surly horseman -- who turns out to be her employer, Mr. Rochester, a cynical, embittered man who spends little time at Thornfield. They are slowly drawn together into a powerful love, despite their different social stations -- and Rochester's apparent attentions to a shallow, snotty aristocrat who wants his wealth and status.But strange things are happening at Thornfield -- stabbings, fires, and mysterious laughter. Jane and Rochester finally confess their feelings to each other, but their wedding is interrupted when Rochester's dark past comes to light. Jane flees into the arms of long-lost family members, and is offered a new life -- but her love for Rochester is not so easily forgotten...\\"Jane Eyre\\" is one of those books that transcends the labels of genre. Charlotte Bronte spun a haunting gothic romance around her semi-autobiographical heroine and Byronic anti-hero, filling it with brilliant writing and solid plot. It has everything all the other gothic romances of the time had... but Bronte gave it depth and intensity without resorting to melodrama.Bronte wrote in the usual stately prose of the time, but it has a sensual, lush quality, even in the dank early chapters at Lowood. At Thornfield, the book acquires an overhanging atmosphere of foreboding, until the clouds clear near the end. And she wove some tough questions into Jane's perspective -- that of a woman's independence and strength in a man's world, of extreme religion, and of the clash between morals and passion.And Bronte also avoided any tinges of drippy sentimentality (Mrs. Reed dies still spewing venom) while injecting some hauntingly nightmarish moments (\\"She sucked the blood: she said she'd drain my heart\\"). She even manages to include some funny stuff, such as Rochester disguising himself as an old gypsy woman.The story does slow down after the abortive wedding, when Jane flees Thornfield and briefly considers marrying a repressed clergyman who wants to go die preaching in India. It's rather boring to hear the self-consciously saintly St. John prattling about himself, instead of Rochester's barbed wit. But when Jane departs again, the plot speeds up into a nice, mellow little finale.Bronte did a brilliant job of bringing her heroine to life -- as a defiant little girl who is condemned for being \\"passionate,\\" as an independent young lady, and as a woman torn between love and principle. Jane's strong personality and wits overwhelm the basic fact that she's not unusually pretty. And Rochester is a brilliantly sexy Byronic anti-hero with a prickly, mercurial wit.Of Charlotte Bronte's few novels, \\"Jane Eyre\\" is undoubtedly the most brilliant -- passionate, dark and hauntingly eerie. Definitely a must-read."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"I thought I would never read Jane Eyre. I'd seen the old Joan Fontaine-Orson Welles film - very nice - and that seemed to be enough for me. But Amazon's generous list of free or nearly free classics for Kindle got me to thinking I might try some of the Victorian novels I had long resisted. And I'm so glad I did.Jane Eyre turned out to be a surprisingly exciting, even thrilling read! It was very hard for me to put it down, and I was up many nights until 2AM because I wanted to know what would happen next. I can't believe a 160-year old novel could cast such a spell on me, but it did.This is a very satisfying, very exciting and emotional book. It is not so simple as any of the movie versions would lead you to believe. Jane is a wonderfully complex and compelling character, especially as she endures the struggles between her heart and her reason, between her desires and what she feels is right.Most highly recommended."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"I was not familiar with Charlotte Bronte's works so I decided to give it a go, and the fact that it was free was helpful.

Also, the romantic aspect was wonderful. The plot was quite simple, but yet, beautifully written all at the same time.

It is a classic that combines mystery and romance effortlessly, in a writing style that is beautifully unique.Jane Eyre is not a heroine, at least in her own opinion. She's orphaned, but educated; penniless, but not without family: just none that would claim her. She accepts a job as a governess to a young French girl named Adele, a Mr. Rochester's ward, who may or may not be his illegitimate daughter.Thus begins the epic romance between the young, plain governess and her grizzled, older employer.

I can say that the begining was a little boring but as you keep reading you feel captivated by all the obstacles that Jane has to overcome in life. It is a beautiful reading that promotes real love and not just superficial love, the characters are not beautiful or perfect and even thought they are described as ugly, you can not help but to fall in love with them and cry or laugh with them. In general a great reading!"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"Somehow I managed to get through high school and a minor's worth of Brit Lit credits in college (including a Victorian literature class) without ever having to have read this book or seeing any of the movies, numerous as they are. Oddly enough, a facebook quiz is what prompted an interest in this book that I knew close to nothing about beforehand.This book really captured my attention and it has been years since I have loved a book such as this. I usually don't take an interest in novels where love is a major theme of the book, but this is a fine exception. The author captivates the reader so thoroughly through the titled character it is like being told a story with a literary painting. The style of Charlotte Bronte's writing is beautiful, and despite predictability at times, it does not withhold any suspense.As for the edition of this book, the illustrations in both black and white and in colour from artist Darcy Dame made this a great edition. I really can't say how much I loved the illustrations. There is something dark, haunting, and paranormal to these illustrations which is so fitting of the Victorian era, well-known for their high interest in the occult. When I saw this edition in a store, I knew immediately that this was the perfect edition for me, as I love interesting pictures in books. I also have a certain love for ink drawings, so the images within the pages are very welcome as well. This certainly beats many of the dreary looking versions of this book. Yes, I know, don't judge a book by it's cover, in it's most literal sense, but an interesting exterior never hurts a good novel.As for other aesthetics of this edition: the paper is good and the colour illustrations are printed on glossy paper. This is of course in paperback, but it is very nice for paperback and I'm surprised that it did not cost more. A typical edition of Jane Eyre seems to be in the 300-page mark, but this one nears 550 pages due to the slightly larger font which is very welcome when reading heavier works."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"Jane Eyre is the most fabulous book ever written.

Then you go back to it years and years later and find that not only does it maintain its quality, but it reveals an even further message you might have missed the first time- almost like a whole different story that just helps to illuminate the story you gleaned from it the first time you read it. While I don't find it \\"gothic\\" in the traditional sense, I do see those elements, but most predominate is a story that can be believeable and one which people can relate to on some level with one character or another in today's world. That is why its still a favorite for me after all these years. I consider it a romance novel told through the eyes of a character who does not want to speak about romance; just experiences it. Subtle and refined, but outgoing and with strong convictions at the same time. Same as the character of Jane.

Once of the strongest female characters I have ever read - loved it."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"As a caveat I must say that I am not a huge fan of the \\"Regency\\" novel. And this novel is so typical of that style of 19th Century British Literature. There is a different view of virtue in the Regency novel. In some novels, virtue is defined as heroism in battle, in others virtue is fidelity to one's morals and integrity. In Jane Eyre, virtue is defined as fidelity to one's class or station in society. And this woman, an orphan and governess by profession, is at the bottom of rural English aristocratic society.The character Jane Eyre is best described, at the risk of being crude, as a doormat. Her only concern is to do whatever is necessary to please those around her. In this heart breaking story, Jane goes from being a student in a school for orphaned little girls to being governess to a Mr. Rochester, who is a rude and self-centered man. Rochester takes a liking to Jane because of her never-wavering devotion to his comfort and ego, so he asks her to marry him. And on her wedding day, she finds out that Rochester already has a living wife, a woman who is chained up in his attic because of her madness. Despite the fact that Rochester already has a wife, he asks Jane to live with him as though Jane were his wife. To her credit, Jane does not agree to this. She has enough self-esteem to run away at this insistence, although she takes nothing with her and is impoverished in her flight.So Jane ends up as a pauper on the doorstep of a random rural English family, only to fortuitously discover later that this family are actually her long lost first cousins. They accept her as family after requiring her to spend a cold winter night asleep outside on their doorstep. Ultimately the young man, who is a parson at the local church, asks Jane to marry him. Jane refuses, not because he is her first cousin (interesting how family relationships were viewed so much differently in 19th century rural England than they are today), but because he thinks of Jane more as a colleague than as a romantic partner. Despite her refusal to marry him, she agrees to travel with him to India as a fellow missionary, but he refuses because he wants her as a wife. She is willing to give up her life in the service of a man who wants only to use her, but then this is the same attitude she had toward Rochester. It is definitely a trend in Jane Eyre's life.In the meantime, Jane learns (also fortuitously) that she is the sole heir of a foreign fortune left to her by a long lost uncle. The fortune would elevate her to a member of the gentry, but Jane, being true to her station and her self-identity as a doormat, splits the fortune with her undeserving cousins. However, at least now she is not destitute. She returns to Rochester to discover that Rochester's crazy wife has escaped her chains, burned down the house, killing herself and blinding him. His future is bleak, but this only makes him more attractive to Jane Eyre. She marries him and rebuilds his house and estate. And, at long last, Rochester sees her as more than a tool. It is a nice ending, I suppose, at least as good as it gets for the Regency novel.It is difficult for a 21st century American to relate to the kind of self-degradation that Jane Eyre not only endures but actively works toward in the face of the prospect of a better life. Perhaps it is a tale of true love, unconditional in the face of adversity. It is also a sad commentary on the social values of a bygone era. If nothing else, Jane Eyre offers an answer to those silly nostalgic people who see 19th Century rural England as some sort of golden era. We can be thankful that, in our era, these kinds of values of self-debasement are no longer acceptable."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"THIS IS ABOVE ALL A GREAT AND GRIPPING STORY.

I like the concept of listen and move about.. do not like the need to review..."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"The main theme of Jane Eyre is that happiness and contentment can be found during our lives on earth. This is shown in the fact that Jane led a very discontented and sad childhood, but she found happiness in her relationship with Mr. Rochester. This theme also came out very strongly through Jane's cousin John. He was so dedicated to serving God and being a missionary that he asked Jane to marry him because he thought she was a hard worker. He didn't love her, but he believed that serving God came before his own happiness. The book makes it seem as though this is wrong, because in the end John goes to India by himself and does not enjoy the rest of his life. It is presented as though Jane did the fulfilling and satisfying thing by marrying Mr. Rochester, and John did the good but unhappy thing by becoming a missionary in India. Obviously, it is not good to marry someone that you don't love, but Charlotte Bronte seems to take this to the extreme by saying that unless you get married to the person you love, you will not lead a satisfied life. In truth, if you lead a life dedicated to serving and praising God, you will have a satisfied life. It is not just people and circumstances that can make us happy, but a close relationship with God. Nevertheless, I thought that Jane Eyre was a very good book. There was always a little hint of mystery to keep the reader interested, and the book presented some interesting ideas to think about. Jane Eyre did a good job of presenting Charlotte Bronte's ideas, and it is a very well-written, descriptive book."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"Jane Eyre is the rarest kind of novel - one that conveys boundless emotion without stumbling too far into darkness and misery.Plain and poor, Jane works as a governess in the house of Mr Rochester, a brooding and temperamental man with a dark secret, and eventually falls in love with her wealthy employer. She looks to the future and begins to overcome the unhappiness that has plagued her all her life, but Rochester's shady past comes back and brings everything down again.But unlike in the author's sister Emily's Wuthering Heights, this sadness neither dominates nor concludes the book when all is resolved in a happy, if somewhat bittersweet, ending.The real brilliance of Jane Eyre lies in the characters - we can all see ourselves, or our aspirations, reflected in Jane, who overcomes her circumstances to find happiness."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"Jane Eyre is the rarest kind of novel - one that conveys boundless emotion without stumbling too far into darkness and misery.Plain and poor, Jane works as a governess in the house of Mr Rochester, a brooding and temperamental man with a dark secret, and eventually falls in love with her wealthy employer.

But, beware as Jane is falling madly in love with Mr. Rochester (her master as she calls him-is it just me or is I Dream of Jeanie popoing into my head), who has a secret terrible enough to destroy Jane and himself too. I recommemd this book for the older more mature reader (13 and up).

Bronte definitely has a way with words, and Jane's story, though in some parts a bit unrealistic, certainly makes for a good read. However, the dialogue is a little confusing sometimes because the author uses the wrong pronouns (like: &quot;Would she like a morsel of bread?&quot; when it ought to be &quot;Would YOU like a morsel of bread?&quot;)This happens pretty often near the end, and it's terribly annoying. These flaws not withstanding, however, &quot;Jane Eyre&quot; will appeal to anyone who enjoys the romance and soap-opera plots of Victorian literature paired with some gothic characteristics (crazy Bertha screaming and doing mischief in her locked cell)."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"As many people may know, \\"Jane Eyre\\" is the story of an orphaned girl who has an evil aunt that locks her away in an eerie red room where her uncle died in. Being the protagonist of the novel, Jane breaks away from her aunt's oppression and stands up for herself. As Jane lives life away from her aunt, she realizes that the outside world is just as strenuous. Against many odds, Jane pushes forward with her life. She finds a job as a governess and falls in love with her employer and he loves her back, but of course with Jane's luck, more obstacles are hurdled at her.Being set during the Victorian period, social status already plays a big obstacle in Jane's life. When obstacles, though some highly unlikely, beyond social class prevent her from marrying the love her life, Jane must establish her own code of ethics. What is wrong and what is right? What can she do and what can she not do?The novel may seem to focus much on the aspect of Jane's love life, but there's much more to it than that. Throughout Jane's love story, there's always eerie things going on, for example the shrieking yell coming from a room no one is allowed in and that's just the beginning. \\"Jane Eyre\\" is a book that has many different aspects and a hint of gothic fiction. There's love, mystery, strength, courage, and faith. It's the journey of a lost female on the road of identifying herself. This is a classic that should not be passed up especially if you're a person who believes that love prevails against all odds. This classic is a refreshing book to read; it's not every day that you find such a strong female character in literature.Even though the only complain I have to offer is the lengthiness and the endless dialogue, this novel is worth it all. Read along with Jane's story as she discovers what she has to offer the world and herself. The story will have you at the edge of your seat wondering what is going to happen next. The main question, however, will Jane get her happy ending?"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"This book is really good. It is one of my favorites. I read it as a teen and wanted to reread it as an adult. The Kindle app is amazing. I downloaded Jane Eyre for free and am now able to enjoy it on my Ipad and my pc whenever I want to take a little walk down memory lane."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"I read Jane Eyre in high school and recently decided to pick it up again. It's a different experience reading as an adult! I wish I could say I loved it but I just can't. Charlotte Bronte used so many words and descriptors when much less would have done just fine. (Have a dictionary handy. Many of the words used in Jane Eyre are archaic and need definition. Otherwise much of what Bronte is trying to convey is lost. This is not a criticism - just part of reading Jane Eyre.)I have 2 main difficulties with Jane Eyre. First, it was difficult for me to see either Mr. Rochester or St. John Rivers as desirable. Both were manipulative control freaks. Secondly, there are some \\"coincidences\\" (specifically with regard to the Rivers family) that seem so entirely unlikely that it's distracting. (As a side note, I question whether Jane's time with the Rivers was necessary to advance the story. That section of the book seemed especially plodding.)Last but not least, Jane Eyre is deeply religious. This is not a bad thing, but much of the book is spent sermonizing. This, too, adds to its length.I came away from Jane Eyre disappointed but also appreciative of Jane's amazing (if flawed) journey."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"I'm going to rate the quality of the Kindle Edition since this seems to be the only place to do so. I won't go into the story since there's a perfectly good sysnopsis on the description page and several well written reivews on the work itself. The kindle edition was good to say the least. I did find a few spelling errors that were annoying, but none more so than the heroine, Jane, repeatedly being referred to as 'Janet' throughout the entire novel; I find this to be unacceptable. I do not know if this occurs in the print-versions as this was my first encounter with the story. Had there been less (or no) spelling errors as well as the correct name reference to the main character, I would have given it 5 stars on content alone---although it still creeps me out that 19 year olds and 40 year olds so frequently ended up marrying in that day and age, but I just had to put it out of my mind when reading. Otherwise it was a good read and I look forward to reading more works by the Bronte sisters."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"Jane Eyere is my absolute favorite book and I was thrilled when I found the book marked as collector's edition and leather bound.

So glad I made this purchase!"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"It's hard to imagine a better gothic romance than \\"Jane Eyre\\" -- gloomy vast houses, mysterious secrets, and a brooding haunted man with a dark past.In fact, Charlotte Bronte's classic novel has pretty much everything going for it -- beautiful settings, a passionate romance tempered by iron-clad morals, and a heroine whose poverty and lack of beauty only let her brains and courage shine brighter. And it's all wrapped in the misty, haunting atmosphere of a true gothic story -- madwoman in the attic and all.Jane Eyre was an orphan, abused and neglected first by relatives, then by a boarding school run by a tyrannical, hypocritical minister. But Jane refuses to let anyone shove her down -- even when her saintly best friend dies from the wretched conditions.But many years later, Jane moves on by applying to Thornfield Hall for a governess position, and gets the job. She soon becomes the teacher and friend to the sprightly French girl Adele, but is struck by the dark, almost haunted feeling of her new home.Then she runs into a rather surly horseman -- who turns out to be her employer, Mr. Rochester, a cynical, embittered man who spends little time at Thornfield. They are slowly drawn together into a powerful love, despite their different social stations -- and Rochester's apparent attentions to a shallow, snotty aristocrat who wants his wealth and status.But strange things are happening at Thornfield -- stabbings, fires, and mysterious laughter. Jane and Rochester finally confess their feelings to each other, but their wedding is interrupted when Rochester's dark past comes to light. Jane flees into the arms of long-lost family members, and is offered a new life -- but her love for Rochester is not so easily forgotten...\\"Jane Eyre\\" is one of those books that transcends the labels of genre. Charlotte Bronte spun a haunting gothic romance around her semi-autobiographical heroine and Byronic anti-hero, filling it with brilliant writing and solid plot. It has everything all the other gothic romances of the time had... but Bronte gave it depth and intensity without resorting to melodrama.Bronte wrote in the usual stately prose of the time, but it has a sensual, lush quality, even in the dank early chapters at Lowood. At Thornfield, the book acquires an overhanging atmosphere of foreboding, until the clouds clear near the end. And she wove some tough questions into Jane's perspective -- that of a woman's independence and strength in a man's world, of extreme religion, and of the clash between morals and passion.And Bronte also avoided any tinges of drippy sentimentality (Mrs. Reed dies still spewing venom) while injecting some hauntingly nightmarish moments (\\"She sucked the blood: she said she'd drain my heart\\"). She even manages to include some funny stuff, such as Rochester disguising himself as an old gypsy woman.The story does slow down after the abortive wedding, when Jane flees Thornfield and briefly considers marrying a repressed clergyman who wants to go die preaching in India. It's rather boring to hear the self-consciously saintly St. John prattling about himself, instead of Rochester's barbed wit. But when Jane departs again, the plot speeds up into a nice, mellow little finale.Bronte did a brilliant job of bringing her heroine to life -- as a defiant little girl who is condemned for being \\"passionate,\\" as an independent young lady, and as a woman torn between love and principle. Jane's strong personality and wits overwhelm the basic fact that she's not unusually pretty. And Rochester is a brilliantly sexy Byronic anti-hero with a prickly, mercurial wit.Of Charlotte Bronte's few novels, \\"Jane Eyre\\" is undoubtedly the most brilliant -- passionate, dark and hauntingly eerie. Definitely a must-read."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"\\"Jane Eyre\\" is one of the world's best-loved classic novels for so many reasons.It's an exciting piece of feminist literature written at a time when feminist literature was little known and even more poorly accepted. That it is a semi-autobiographical novel written by a staunchly, independent female author who herself was struggling to survive by her own wits and means and stand on her own two feet makes the story all the more poignant and compelling. While it is a prime example of Gothic romance peppered with the typical fixtures of a Gothic novel - the spectral Thornfield manor that seems to attain a life of its own; the allusions to mythological characters such as ghosts and vampires; the uncanny timing of such weather phenomenon as lightning or a chilling, drenching downpour to accompany major events in the novel - it also breaks new ground in that it avoids some of the typical conventions of Victorian literature. And, finally, it is a piece of masterful story-telling built around larger than life characters that for over 150 years has enchanted readers of all ages and thrilled watchers of numerous television and movie adaptations.For those few of you that have yet to read this wonderful novel, the story can be summarized quickly enough. A dying father extracts a death bed promise from his sister to raise his infant daughter, Jane Eyre. The sister, a spiteful and mean spirited woman grows to hate the obligation that Jane represents and soon sends her away to a boarding school. (Did anyone else have flashbacks to Charles Dickens' Nicholas Nickleby when they were reading this portion of the novel?) In spite of the harsh mental and physical cruelty she endures at the hands of the school's administrator and its teachers, Jane survives to become a teacher at the school. Ultimately she leaves to seek her own way in the world and secures a position as governess in the household of Edward Fairfax Rochester.At this point, most readers will correctly guess that Jane and Mr Rochester fall in love with each other but to tell more of the story would be to spoil the effect of this magnificent novel for first time readers.Suffice it to say that Charlotte Bront has woven an enthralling story into the exploration of a multiplicity of themes that will occupy students of the English language novel for decades to come - the interplay of self-respect, morality, conventional mores and religion; the effects of social standing and class discrimination; gender relations in a patriarchal staunchly male-dominated society; legal issues of the day that related to marriage, inheritance and ownership; contrasting extremes of religious zealotry as displayed by Brocklehurst's hypocritical Puritanism reflected against St John Rivers' obsessive but well-intentioned determination to spread Calvinist dogma as a missionary abroad.While many of these issues have clearly been relegated to the history of the 19th century, it's also a fact that much of the controversy that Bront has so eloquently built into her characters' lives persist as issues into our own 21st century. Little wonder that \\"Jane Eyre\\" has such enduring power in the world of English literature!Highly recommended.Paul Weiss"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"I have always loved this story though I had never read it.

She shows rare strength of character and wisdom when she literally runs away from temptation. She knows if she stays with Mr. Rochester, she will never be able to be truly happy, and that despite his promises to the contrary, that she will lose his respect, and she will lose her self-respect.

Some of the events Jane experiences are based on Bronte's own life. Bronte began writing Jane Eyre in 1846. It was an immediate and thorough success upon publication in 1847.

Despite the rigid life she was forced to endure, Jane started a life of her own. She faced many conflicts and difficulties in life.

Jane Eyre is the book for you. Jane Eyre follows the life of a \\"plain Jane\\" and goes through the hardships and successes that she does. The author, Charlotte Bronte, wrote the novel from Jane's perspective so the reader can get and insight into Jane's mind and truly feel the emotions that Jane is feeling. At points of conflict, the reader will often find themselves hoping and wanting Jane to make a certain decision. Jane's life does not start out easy and so the reader immediately gains pity and empathy for Jane. It is the classic story of whether a girl should follow her head or her heart. Bronte writes in beautiful, eloquent language that paints a very clear picture for the reader. There are points in the novel where it is just the constant flow of Jane's thoughts, but that adds to the immense character development. As the reader gets to know Jane, they are able to relate to her because she is painted to be a very plain, yet strong-willed, young woman. The mark of Jane's passion comes from the beginning when she is talking to her aunt and says, \\"I am glad you are no relation of mine. I will never call you aunt again as long as I live. I will never come to visit you when I am grown up; and if any one asks me how I liked you, and how you treated me, I will say the very thought of you makes me sick, and that you treated me with miserable cruelty.\\" From this point on, the reader can see that even though Jane wants to be a \\"good child,\\" she has a more rebellious streak in her. Jane Eyre is a good read for someone who likes very good character development and has patience to get through much detail. I personally did not like the ending very much because it seemed to contradict the main idea of the rest of the novel, but other than that, I found myself engaged and interested in Jane's life and her decisions."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"Jane Eyre is a novel that follows a woman from the Victorian times in which she struggles to find her true identity and what really brings her happiness. Starting off as an orphan adopted by her aunt who despises her, she works her way up to become a governess. Through her struggle of finding independence in a society where women are looked down upon, she meets Mr. Rochester and hopelessly falls in love with him. Torn between finding independent happiness and romantic happiness, Jane indulges in a self journey fighting between what her heart desires and what her mind wants. Rochester is a man with much power and in a way intimidates Jane with his status but little did Jane know he was hiding a dark secret from her.\\"Women are supposed to be very calm generally: but women feel just as men feel; they need exercise for their faculties, and a field for their efforts as much as their brothers do; they suffer from too rigid a restraint, too absolute a stagnation, precisely as men would suffer; and it is narrow-minded in their more privileged fellow-creatures to say that they ought to confine themselves to making puddings and knitting stockings, to playing on the piano and embroidering bags. It is thoughtless to condemn them, or laugh at them, if they seek to do more or learn more than custom has pronounced necessary for their sex.\\"Not only is this a dramatic romance novel, but it is also a very eye opening novel in which Jane discovers that women should not confine to the expectations society has provided for them, but instead has a whole world to them for them to explore and obtain."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"\\"Jane Eyre\\" by Charlotte Bronte is a classic gothic romance story. Its intense, thrilling, and disturbinging details are told from the autobiographical standpoint of the narrator, Jane Eyre. A definite feminist novel, Bronte created an untraditional character who defies the expectations society has of her. Jane is no Disney character; Bronte's heroine is not blessed with beauty nor money, but she is a fiercely independent character with remarkably complex emotions.The novel begins with Jane Eyre, as an orphaned child, living at Gateshead with her Aunt Reed. From the very beginning, readers understand that Jane does not and will not have an easy life. Bullied and suppressed by her aunt and cousins, Jane is an outsider. She is sent to the Red Room as punishment one day by her Aunt Reed. In defiance, even at a young age, Jane exclaims to Mrs. Reed, \\" I am not deceitful: if I were, I should say I love you; but I declare I do not love you: I dislike you the worst of anybody in the world except John Reed.\\" Appalled by her outburst and fueld by her hatred for Jane, Mrs. Reed a decides to sent Jane to Lowood School, an institution for orphaned girls. After years at Lowood, a glimmer of hope appears later when she becomes a governess at Thornfield, home of a certain Mr. Rochester. Since the story is told from the memory of Jane, the reader is given a first-hand impression of the heighted emotional state of Jane and troubles she suffers through.At Thornfield, Jane becomes governess for a little French girl, Adele, and soon becomes entrapped in a spiral of emotions when confronted my Mr. Rochester. It is clear that Jane is the subordinate and Mr. Rochester is the master, but one cannot help but root for their romance and love to endure. Bronte's story of dark gothic elements, insanity, and dark lingering secrets make up this tragic romance story. Bronte draws attention to the cultural assumption of the Victorian woman's role and the relations between a man and women in the 19th century. Her novel calls for women's equality and equal treatment.The characters are very thoroughly developed. From the point of view of Jane, as a reader, we learn every bit of detail about Jane: her plainness, her loyalty, and unwavering independence. When confronted, Jane demands, \\"'Do you think I can stay and become nothing to you? do you think I am an automaton? - a machine without feelings? and can bear to have my morsel of bread snatched from my lips, and my drop of living water dashed from my cup? Do you think, because I am poor, obscure, plain, and little, I am soulless and heartless? you think wrong! - I have as much soul as you - and full as much hart! And if God had gifted me with some beauty and much wealth, I should have made it as hard for you to leave me, as it is now for me to leave you.'\\" Such an exclamation defied the stereotypes of a subdued and quiet lady.Interweaved throughout her novel, Bronte obviously develops the major theme of female independence and strength. However, Bronte also employs several motifs, one being the constant appearance of wings and birds. At the very beginning of the novel, Jane reads Bewick's History of British Birds which wrote of \\"the solitary rocks and promontories by them [the sea-fowl[ only inhabited,\\" symbolizing the independence of birds and the ability to fly away that she wished she had. Then at Thornfield, Jane describes a party of guests as \\"a flock of white plumy birds.\\" Upon seeing the ladies and gentlemen at Thornfield, Jane is even more aware of her dependence of others and the lowly status she has claims to. Still, she admires the freedom the guests have to come and go and indulge in frivolous activities. Even Rochester tells Jane to \\"be still; don't struggle so, like a wild frantic bird that is rending its own plumage in its desperation.\\" Each instance, Jane is struggling to find her freedom, her own independence.Jane Eyre is a tantalizing novel deserves to be read. Be prepared for a complex and nuanced plot. Written in true Victorian style, Bronte writes in long, elegant sentences that sometimes takes a few reads to truly understand. The plot she weaves is enrapturing, leaving reader on the edge of his or her seat, just waiting to read what happens next. However, Bronte takes her time developing her plot and ends up writing a three-hundred page book that could have easily fit into one hundred, but perhaps the Victorian readers of her generation had the time to sit down and read longer novels. Don't hesitate to purchase this book, it's a story you won't regret reading!"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"In this gripping novel, Charlotte Bronte tells the story of a fiery young governess who finds love in an unlikely place. Through the use of descriptive and flowery language, Bronte successfully writes a prize winning book with extremely well-developed characters, a dramatic plot, and thought-provoking themes. Jane, the protagonist, is a young orphan living with her cold-hearted and widowed aunt, Sarah Reed. She is taken to Lowood School, where, among severe circumstances, she manages to find a friend called Helen Burns. Later, Jane decides to be a governess so she travels to Thornfield to work for the tall, brooding, and menacing Mr. Rochester. This book is considered to be one of the first feminist books because of Jane's unconventional personality and sense of independence. Jane, although physically plain, surprises and wins the heart of both the reader, and Mr. Rochester through her witty dialogue and frankness. Mr. Rochester maintains the reader's interest with his passionate and strong personality that often shows a soft side when it comes to love. It is most entertaining to read their playful and clever back and forth, as well as to see their fondness for each other grow. The characters in this novel are delightfully well-developed. Bronte does a thorough job of giving all characters life, including the minor characters like Mrs. Fairfax and Miss Temple. She uses foils to really differentiate between characters and to emphasize specific traits that are important, for example, Mr. Rochester and St. John are foils, contrasting St. John's \\"handsome Grecian features\\" yet cold personality with Mr. Rochester's unhandsome looks and passionate and emotional personality. The title, even though it may not catch the reader's attention, really reflects how Jane thinks of herself as just plain Jane. So don't be fooled by the simple title and long-winded sentences. Jane Eyre will certainly be a surprising, and delightful read."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"Jane Eyre is the quintessential feminist novel. Jane is faced with and ultimately opposes her traditional role as a woman in the 1800's as she is subordinate to her love interest, Mr. Rochester. Beforehand, Jane endures a tough childhood as an orphan living with her deceased uncle's family at Gateshead. She is sent away to an \\"orphan school\\", Lowood, and eventually works as a governess at Thornfield. That is where she meets Rochester, and soon learns of a dark secret that threatens their budding romance. Later on, Jane rejects the love that she feels for Rochester, and leaves Thornfield. She faces trouble and is rescued by a second love interest, St. John. A multitude of events ensue, and this novel closes with an unorthodox, but fitting end.Jane is not the typical female character, as she is outspoken and quite independent. She does not allow herself to be pushed around, which is evident through the incident in which she physically fights with her cousin, John at Gateshead. Jane is confronted with themes of gender roles, social class, love, etc.Rochester is Jane's superior, and their romantic relationship almost replicates their professional relationship. Since he is of wealthy status, and Jane is not, they aren't on equal ground and she is portrayed as his subordinate. This is evident when Rochester refers to Jane as \\"my little friend\\" among other monikers.St. John is a foil to Rochester in every sense. He is a morally upright individual, who is devoutly religious and appeals to Jane as a cold person overall. This is in stark contrast to Rochester, whom Jane views as warm and has \\"flaming\\" eyes.In my opinion, the plot was excellent, but was a bit drawn-out. Jane's journey is full of riveting twists, but the build-up was a bit long, and the intricate language of the novel left me uninterested at times. However, regarding the major events and Victorian/Gothic elements, the language/rising action was appropriate, just not as appealing from a modern perspective. The ending was unorthodox, although I did somewhat expect it. Nevertheless, Jane's words reassure that in the end, Jane is not a subordinate, but an equal. She states \\"we are precisely suited in character--perfect concord is the result\\" which lets go of all of their societal/gender role burdens, and assures that they were meant for each other because of their match in personality/character. There are a multitude of themes present in this novel that require an approach from a wholly different perspective. For example, one cannot understand the importance of the character Jane Eyre within literary history, without considering the fact that she was the first strong/independent female protagonist. This novel, overall, is timeless and is a suitable example of feminist ideals."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"I received the book in a timely matter and book was in great shape and very clean.

The parts where Jane is not with Rochester can be tedious sometimes but, fortunately, since I've read it, I can skip those parts and just read the good ones. When Jane leaves Rochester, Bronte describes it in such a way that it makes the reader feel as if they were leaveng their one true love.

It was a bit slow for the first 100 pages or so, but still good to read.

In this novel, Bronte writes like a pro, opening the story with a conflict that immediately engages her readers' interest in Jane and quickly follows up with another that firmly cements that affection. When the evil Rev. Brocklehurst asks Jane what she must do to avoid the eternal torture of hell, she replies, \\"I must keep in good health, and not die,\\" and her immortality as a literary character is secured. One strength of this novel is the first-person narration with everything seen through Jane's eyes. Although we know her to be a passionate individual, she is also absolutely trustworthy,and the generous and smart woman she becomes plays no games in telling her tale in simple, straightforward narration. We burn with indignation at Aunt Reed and Rev. Brocklehurst, grieve over Helen, share her growing affection for Sophie and Mrs. Fairfax, and rejoice in her discovery that in Rochester she has at last found someone who is her intellectual and emotional equal, the first true friend since leaving Lowood School. In short, in the first two-thirds of Jane Eyre, Bronte's work is close to a masterpiece. However, her story goes off the rails in the St. John Rivers section, the part of the book that many readers dislike and the section most film adaptions do their best to diminish or eliminate. In earlier readings, Jane's decision to flee Thornfield with a few shillings and a small bundle of clothes made perfect sense, and her subsequent discovery that the Rivers siblings were actually family -- her first cousins -- adequate explanation for her decision to share equally with them the fortune left to Jane by their uncle in Madeira. But on this reading I saw how unnecessary, how unJane-like, her flight actually is. Jane has already learned from her Aunt Reed that her uncle intends to leave her his fortune, and it is that uncle who sends his solicitor to crash her wedding and prevent her bogus marriage to Rochester. The solicitor explains exactly that before leaving Thornfield. Above all else, Jane Eyre is smart and capable, smart enough to recognize that her uncle's solicitor will provide her with necessary support and capable enough to get herself to London to receive it. However, a few hours later, Bronte sends Jane rushing across the moors in a coach heading god knows where, a destination that will be determined by how far her meager money can pay for transport. Is this the young woman who ably advertised for a post when she wanted a new life? Is this the young woman who traveled to her aunt's deathbed and remained long enough to help her hateful cousins settle their affairs following their mother's death? Absolutely not. While Jane's flight makes sense, her decision to flee blindly to parts unknown is ludicrous, given everything else we know about her. And so the results of that flight -- her fortuitous discovery of her cousins and the jousting with priggish St. John over his desire to have her join him in his missionary work as his wife -- are ludicrous as well. No wonder readers recoil from that section of the book. Having written Jane out of character and into a tight corner with Rivers, Bronte comes to her rescue with a hokey gimmick -- the sound of Rochester's voice calling her name across the vast moors that divide them. Jane's dear readers are certainly happy that she has found a loving family and secured an income that provides independence. And they're happy that Rochester has proven himself a man of honor in sacrificing his vision and his hand in attempting to save his mad wife from the burning battlements of Thornfield Hall. So they forgive Bronte the flaws of the St. John Rivers section of the novel, glossing over it as quickly as possible to arrive at Jane's well-deserved happy ending. But while not fatal, the flaws are serious enough to prevent Jane Eyre from being a true masterpiece."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"I just finished reading this for the first time.

But I found myself drawn into the novel and captivated by the storytelling. Even as a man, I found myself empathizing with Eyre, feeling the mud as it clung to my clothes in that desperate moment of dangerous hope and determined self-reliance.

However, I finally revisited the book after many years and enjoyed it much more this time around.Jane Eyre is a young, determined girl who is determined to find her proper place in the world. As an orphan who was brought up by her cruel aunt, Jane is sent away to boarding school at a young age, where she and the other students suffer under the hand of an evil headmaster. Things improve at the school when the institution's poor conditions are brought to light following a typhus epidemic, and Jane finishes her schooling and then remains at the facility as a teacher for several years.Although she's content working at the school, Jane still thinks that life has something else in store for her. She accepts a governess position at Thornfield Manor, where she is employed by the dark, brooding Mr. Rochester. Despite his rather surly disposition, Jane finds herself falling in love with Rochester, and is stunned when he returns her affections and proposes marriage. Unfortunately, the wedding never takes place due to a massive secret that Rochester unsuccessfully tries to keep hidden. Jane ultimately flees Thornfield and arrives at another manor called Marsh End, where many surprises await her. Another man eventually proposes marriage to Jane, but she must listen to her heart and return to the one place where she's ever truly felt at home.Jane possesses great strength, self-worth and personal dignity. She's a woman who stays true to her principles throughout her entire life, regardless of the many challenges thrown into her path. Also, \\"Jane Eyre\\" is a love story of sorts, and it has a very romantic ending, which I always enjoy.I still think there are parts of this novel that really drag, but I appreciate it a lot more than I did when I was younger. \\"Jane Eyre\\" doesn't come close to \\"Wuthering Heights,\\" in my opinion (Emily was SO the better Bronte!), but it definitely stands on its own as one of the first truly feminist novels ever written."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"This was the first book I read by Charlotte Bronte, and after I finished it I immediately got Villette, then The Professor, and Shirley, and others! She quickly became my favorite author, mainly due to the spirit I felt coming through her writing. She seems to be a true Christian, free from a religious mind-set, and with hopeful views of humanity. I think she is very intelligent, and a little ahead of her time. I love her language and the flow of her writing. The book is romantic but a bit dark, which was a bit refreshing actually. (Although nowhere near as dark as her sister's Wuthering Heights). Read it, it is great, and don't stop at just this book. Shirley is by far my favorite."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"Contrary to popular fiction of her day, Bront is keen to keep reminding us that Jane Eyre is no beauty, irregular in feature, and plain.

Other times he calls her by another name, an invention of endearment. What does he call her? From calling him Sir she moves to a name born of equality and devotion. What does she say? New naming is not so strange, as in Revelation 3:12: \\"I will write upon him my new name.\\"Can we ordinary persons unite? Can we couples live with each other's limitations, and be happy and joyful?

But to fully appreciate this book requires that you be a \\"mature\\" reader. And also realize that this book was written in another era, where society and standards were much different than today.I originally read this book years ago for my highschool literature class. Although I didn't dis-like the book, I didn't exactly like it either. It did not have much of an impact on me. I think I was too immature (lacking in life experiences) to relate to and understand some of the strong emotions and the complex sides of human nature portrayed in the book.Reading this book years later as a mature adult, I was deeply touched by the story of Jane Eyre. You experience a variety of emotions: abandonment, despair, love, romance, mystery, danger, heartache. And Jane Eyre was really a character ahead of her time - Although content to conform to the standards expected of a woman in her time period, Jane had an independent mind and spirit. She would not do something against her will, heart, or conscience. She was not afraid to speak her mind. She had strong Christian moral beliefs and would not waver from them. She is a heroine to be admired and respected.So much more could be said, but I will leave it at that. If you were disapointed by Jane Eyre if you read it as a teenager, try reading it again as an adult."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"Quite arguably one of the greatest British novels ever penned, Charlotte Bronte's &quot;Jane Eyre&quot; is so all-around-wonderful, it's no wonder that it's been adapted into 5+ movies.We first meet Bronte's Jane as a child, young and abused, in the care of her aunt. We immediately take Jane under our wing, feeling more her personal protector with each turn of the page. Then, one day, Jane is a woman. Though retaining many of her childlike tendencies, Jane is determined to be independent: leaving her old boarding school victorious and free, she begins a governess position at the manor home of the elusive and mysterious Mr. Edward Rochester. It is Jane who tames Rochester's brooding and arrogant heart, reducing him to schoolboyish desperation.So deliciously provactive is &quot;Jane Eyre,&quot; that it is impossible not to devour it within days; my own worn-with-love copy sits next to a dog-eared &quot;Villette.&quot;It is sometimes speculated that Charlotte Bronte exercised her complicated mind through the written word; &quot;Jane Eyre&quot; is beautiful evidence of that.As the story slows to its conclusion, you will find yourself lost: hungry for more of Jane, more of Rochester, and more of the magic that is &quot;Eyre.&quot; Quench that thirst with more Bronte (perhaps Emily's &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; or some of Anne's poetry?) or, if you're like me, a second read of the irresistible &quot;Jane.&quot;"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"It seems silly to say that a book can affect you on a profound level. well I definitely believe in this power that a good book has. Jane Eyre is one of them. I cannot say that this was an easy book to read. But it was a book that I was very enriched by reading. Romance is a genre that is looked down on by many \\"sophisticated readers.\\" Perhaps they would look down on Jane Eyre, but would probably get some eyebrows raised at them. Well Jane Eyre is the archetype for the romance novel. After having read thousands of them, I know a romance novel when I see it, and Jane Eyre does qualify. But it is much more than this. It's a story for the person who wonders why the keep trying to do the right thing, and persevering in life, instead of just taking what they want when they want it. If Jane Eyre had been that sort of person, she would not have gotten her happy ending. Instead, Jane walked away from the thing she wanted most in the world. She almost died doing what she felt in her heart was right. Had the story ended there, I probably would have detested this book. But it doesn't. We see Jane continue to grow and act as the phenomenal person that she was. Although often downtrodden, she is no meek mouse. She has a fighting spirit that keeps her going when others would have laid down and died. But despite being a fighter, she is not a user and abuser. It's hard at times for the difference to be clearly delineated. Well there is no question about Jane's level of strength and intregrity. Although it is made clear several times in this novel, that Jane is no beauty, her soul makes her a beautiful character. Beautiful in a more profound way.There are moments when you feel, how can one person suffer so? But taking the journey, you realize that all Jane's suffering had a purpose. It refined her into a woman who could look beneath and love what others could never love or understand. It made her the woman who could love and heal Rochester.At the same time, Rochester was made for Jane Eyre. He had searched his life for a woman like her, and made quite a few mistakes along the way. And out of love, he was able to let her go when he wanted to keep her. But she came back to him, when he needed her most.Rochester is the hero that formed the archetype for many of my favorites: tortured, scarred, dark, enigmatic, all of those things. Best of all, loving little, plain, ordinary Jane with a fundamental intensity that pours out of the pages of this book into my heart as a reader. Despite his lack of perfection, I could not love him more.Ah, how maudlin I sound. I can't help it. This book moved me to tears. Yet I smiled at the same time. I enjoyed the conversations between Rochester and Jane. There was a heat there, a passion. Yet this book is clean enough to read in Sunday school. That is grand romance. The journey so well expressed, that no sex scenes are needed. It's all there.This novel is also inspirational. Not preachy, in my opinion, but for a believer, one can definitely find spiritual messages in this book. About perseverance, about not wearying about doing good. About the profoundness of God's love. It's all there, but in a narrative that expertly showcases it, not preaching it.I feel I am failing to write the review I want to write for this book. The words do fail me. All I can say is that this book will always be a favorite of mine because of the way it touched my heart and challenged me."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"In many ways, \`Jane Eyre' can be seen as an autobiographical novel. Certainly, Charlotte Bronte drew on her experiences as both pupil and teacher in shaping the character of Jane Eyre. The story of Jane Eyre is a triumph of character and spirit over circumstance. Jane herself is depicted as small and plain and with an independent spirit. She believes, fundamentally, in equality and, absolutely, in the healing power of love.The story can be read on a number of different levels: as a triumph of \`good' over \`evil'; as a claim of a woman's independence; and as a love story. I have read it three different times over the past 40 years and have formed different impressions each time. Perhaps on a fourth read I may form another impression altogether different.\`Jane Eyre' is a wonderful mixture of the conventional and the unconventional. Jane is a survivor who uses her strength of character to survive the adversities which form part of her life. Many of the views expressed through the characters had critics arguing about the relative morality of the work. Some of those debates would be viewed with astonishment through our late 20th and early 21st century eyes but in the context of the 19th century it was not accepted that women could be the equal of men.Charlotte Bronte wrote \`Jane Eyre' in 1846, and it was accepted for publication in 1847. Charlotte outlived her younger sisters Emily and Anne and had a number of other novels published: each of her novels is worth reading.Jennifer Cameron-Smith"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"Jane Eyre was authored by the inimitable Charlotte Bronte of the Yorkshire writing Brontes of Haworth Parsonage. The novel was written under the pen name \\"Currer Bell\\" in fears that it might be thought to have been by a woman. Bronte dedicated the book to one of her literary heroes William Makepeace Thackery whom she met on a London trip. Little did Charotte know that Thackery had to deal with a wife gone mad as had Rochester in her novel!Jane Eyre suffers through a miserable childhood. She is raised by a cruel aunt Mrs. Reed after the death of her parents. Jane is sent to the odious Lowood Academy where she lives for eight years from age 10 to 18.At Lowood, Janes befriends the older girl Helen Burns. Helen dies at an early age; Jane remains at Lowood. Miss Eyre eventually becomes a teacher at the school as she has learned French, sewing and social skills.Jane departs Lowood to become the governess of Adele the illegitimate daughter of Mr. Rochester. Rochester is a Byronic figure who has a madwife named Blanche living in the third story of his estate Thornfield. Jane leaves Rochester at the wedding altar when it is discovered he has a living wife. Jane flees to a home of evangelic Christians where she is courted by the future missonary Mr. St.John. He rejects the wealthy Rosamund Oliver for Jane. Jane, however, loves Rochester. In a dramatic ending the little Miss Eyre is reunited with her lover and weds Rochester. Jane comforts Rochester who has become blind and maimed due to the burning down of Thornfield. The fire had been set by his mad wife Blanche who leaped off the roof of the building. Daphne Du Maurier would use a similar ending of her novel \\"Rebecca.\\"The name \\"Jane Eyre\\" can be interpreted in many ways. Jane was the middle name of Charlotte's sister Emily. Eyre may refer to her desire to fly freely in the independent air of personal freedom. Eyre also hints at the fact that Jane is an heiress. Jane also \\"errs\\" in some of her decisions as she makes her pilgrim's progress through northern England. The book is a Cinderella story in which a poor and plain young woman wins her lover. The dialogue is sharp, witty and the scene is populated by interesting rural servants and domestic animals such as the dog Pilot.The book contains elements of Gothic terror, romance and a defense of the rights of women. Bronte is often taught in courses on Feminism. Charlotte Bronte writing in the first person uses a rich language drawing on Biblical, Classical and Shakespearean language and metaphor. Bronte knew how to tell a good story for her life was similar to that of Jane Eyre. Bronte saw many of her sibling die young and lived in genteel poverty as a governess and teacher.Jane Eyre is an immortal classic which will continue to be read and enjoyed by future generations. It is the kind of book which will hook you on reading. Excellent and deserving of several rereadings.

One more thing I cried reading this book(add this to my list of books that make me cry: Marley and Me, The Return of the King, and now Jane Eyre)."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"When Charlotte Bronte wrote Jane Eyre in 1847, she was forced by the ideals of the time to publish it under a man's name: Currer Bell. However, the novel's accurate depiction of a woman on a quest of self-discovery and love would correctly identify the author as a woman herself. In it, the title character leaves her childhood school to serve as governess at Thornfield Park, where she falls in love with her master, Mr. Rochester. However, the discovery of his insane wife makes it impossible to be with him, and Jane must leave to gain her own independence before the two can be reunited. This exquisitely written novel is truly a classic, but don't let that be a deterrent: Bronte's style remains consistently readable and lucid throughout. Add this to the effortless relatability of the title character, and we have a completely compelling novel on our hands. Throughout her master work, Bronte uses literary techniques like characterization, appeals to pathos, and theme to make Jane and her story highly relatable to nearly all girls and women.From the outset of the novel, the reader is given a very good idea of Jane and her character. In fact, the main traits mentioned by Bronte in the narrative are what make Jane so immediately relatable to the audience (which, by merit of its basic plot as a 19th century gothic romance, would logically be made of older girls and women of all ages that would find it intriguing). Jane, from the beginning, describes herself as, \\"poor, obscure, plain, and little\\" (272). These descriptors are reinforced throughout the novel as Jane and others describe her in terms of wealth, popularity, looks, and stature; as Jane has very little of all four of these things, she is often looked down upon by herself and others. Very rarely are fictional heroines depicted in such terms; add this to the fact that Jane has a heart of gold and Bronte has given us one of fiction's most relatable characters. Even if the reader is not poor, obscure, plain, or little, they have felt that they were each of these things at least once in their lifetime. Because Jane is so far from the ideal, the reader, as another person very far from the ideal, automatically relates to and invests in the story of Jane Eyre.Charlotte Bronte also makes Jane incredibly relatable though her usage of appeals to pathos. She makes these appeals from the outset of the novel, when Jane is sent from her relation in order to live at Lowood School, a strict institution that treats the students there terribly. Here she feels lonely and suffers lashings for offenses as quizzical as not standing when a teacher enters the room. It is when Jane starts teaching at the school that we get one of the most relatable appeals to pathos. Jane narrates, \\"I desired liberty; for liberty I gasped; for liberty I uttered a prayer; it seemed scattered on the wind faintly blowing. I abandoned it and framed a humbler supplication. For change, stimulus. That petition, too, seemed swept off into vague space.\\" (88). There isn't a person in the world hasn't longed for some sort of freedom for a change in their life only to find it not forthcoming. Jane's desire for something new and the ability to do what she wants rather than what others want her to do is relatable on all levels of life -from a girl's elementary school years to her advanced womanhood.These appeals to pathos are also apparent in regard to Jane's love for her employer, Mr. Rochester: she believes it is unrequited for the first half of the novel and then, when he reveals that he shares her feelings, discovers that he already has a wife, insane though still very much alive. Jane's moral standards make it impossible for them to be together, and so for a large portion of the text Jane has lost her love and her dearest friend. Bronte writes, from Jane's perspective, \\"It shivered in my heart, like a suffering child in a cold cradle: sickness and anguish had seized it; it could not seek Mr. Rochester's arms--it could not derive warmth from his breast. Oh, never more could it turn to him; for faith was blighted--confidence destroyed! Mr. Rochester was not to me what he had been, for he was not what I had thought him\\" (319). Throughout this passage and many others in the text, Bronte creates a sense of loss, specifically of a loved one; this is also an emotion which can be considered relatable on all levels of the board, because every woman or girl has lost a loved one, be it romantic or platonic, and this awareness of commonality between the reader and Bronte's Jane is the obvious result of appeals to pathos made throughout the novel.Finally, the theme of the novel is perhaps what makes it most relatable: Jane Eyre is, essentially, a woman's quest to be loved on her own terms. Only when Rochester's wife has died in a house fire and Jane has achieved her own economic and emotional independence do the two marry and be together. In essence, Jane completely succeeds at her quest. \\"Reader, I married him. A quiet wedding we had: he and I, the parson and the clerk, were alone present\\" (488). In their previous engagement before the discovery of Rochester's wife, he had sought to bedeck her with jewels and expensive fabrics, and he had been proud and arrogant in her love for him. It is different and far more agreeable to Jane now that he spurns the luxuries and arrogance that were once so integral to his happiness. Far more than that, the last chapter focuses on Jane's happiness with her marriage, which is in direct, though welcome opposition to previous chapters, in which her struggles, sacrifices, and hardships are chronicled. Jane, who had been a loveless orphan, now has a husband, children, and familial ties; similarly, each girl or woman who reads this fantastic story wishes for each of these things. Jane's desire to be loved on her own terms is a direct reflection of the readers; the theme Bronte creates from this--a quest to be loved--sustains Jane Eyre's relatability to modern readers.This marvelously crafted novel is truly a classic which remains highly readable in both style and plotline. Additionally, Bronte assured its immortality when she made the main character, Jane Eyre, such a relatable character. Using characterization, appeals to pathos, and theme, Bronte created one of fiction's most relatable characters. I would highly recommend this to girls and woman passed the age of ten; it truly is"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"This illustrated edition has gorgeous neo-victorian ink illustrations by Dame Darcy, reminiscent of the style of Edward Gorey, author/illustrator of \\"Amphigorey,\\" among others.

It was totally different from all the other books I've ever read -- it was shocking, it was romantic, it was haunting, it was disturbing, it was joyful... It was the story of an orphan, and her trials while she's trying to find herself. It had all different emotions and troubles, and Charlotte Bronte really wrote the book well, taking from her own life experiances. There have been sentences in the book that I have never been able to forget because of the energy and passion that the author wrote into them. \\"Jane Eyre\\" can be called a haunting tale about one young woman's conflict between two different worlds.

Because I identify with Jane on so many levels, her world becomes a sort of fantasy world to me when I read it.

I was very sympathetic towards Jane Eyre from the first- I appreciated how honest and true to life a character she turned out to be, and her less-than-stunning appearance was a breath of fresh air (no pun intended) compared to some of the stereotypical heroines of that time period.What was more surprising to me was that I actually liked Mr. Rochester, because at first I admit my reaction was something like \\"Oh No!, not another Heathcliff!\\" He may have had some kind-of odd quirks, but I thought that he was rather endearing in a way- especially at the very end.Considering that I came into this novel expecting another Wuthering Heights (a book that I despise), I am very happy that I was proven quite wrong.

The same things you hear about Wuthering Heights (which is a superb read as well...more - flowery, perhaps). I got a copy from my English teacher one day thinking I'd read it that night and give it back to her the next day. Well, it took me almost a year to get around to it, but then it sucked me in. It was a long time ago since a book did that. I, myself, am quite a plain person with a passionate spirit. Jane is a person who knows WHO she is, WHO she wants to be and WHO she can't. That is this struggle. She can give in to her passion, give into her dreams, but then they will slip from her grasp because everything that makes her the most beautiful person you've ever seen on the INSIDE would be tainted; Jane's simple purity and athletic mind would be no more. So: Give in and Regret or Die and Keep Living?I love Mr. Rochester. I see him as the male version of Jane; he can see who people are without looking into their looks to find it. St. John was a handsome man, but what pleasure did Jane take in his features? Perhaps he was prudent, but he was not wise. Anyway! Rochester. He is a brave, valliant man, willing to go all measures to give Jane what he feels himself. In his own words, \\"Little Jane's love would have been my best reward. Without it, my heart is broken.\\"Try and understand this book, and then feel that which our society lacks.One last word from a mouth that runs freely and...with INTELLIGENCE: \\"It is hard work to control the workings of inclination, and turn the bent of nature: but that it may be done, I know from experience. God has given us, in a measure, the power to make our own fate; and when our energies seem to demand a sustenance they cannot get - when our will strains after a path we may not follow - we need neither starve from inanition, nor stand still in despair: we have but to seek another nourishment for the mind, as strong as the forbidden food it longed to taste - and perhaps purer; and to hew out for the adventurous foot a road as direct and broad as the one Fortune has blocked up against us, if rougher than it.\\" (From 'Jane Eyre')This book is TRULY one of the best."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"Charlotte Bront's Jane Eyre is a true and timeless piece of English literature. Bront's story of the life and love of a young woman is definitely a worthwhile read. Although not without its defects, Bront's message of true love and self-discovery come across loud and clear.Jane Eyre is a story about love and its effects on a plain and simple woman. Jane, the narrator as well as the main character, tells the reader of her childhood years spent at an orphanage, her position as governess at Thornfield Hall, and her love for the master of Thornfield Hall, Mr. Edward Rochester. Throughout the novel, the reader recognizes the changes love has created in Jane's character. One remarkable change is the fact that Jane forgives her heartless aunt for past cruelty and selfishness. \\"\`Love me, then, or hate me, as you will,' I said at last, \`you have my full and free forgiveness'\\" (242). Love has matured Jane from a misfit orphan to a woman who has the strength to forgive. This change is just one example of Bront's insight into love and the human psyche. Through Jane, Bront explains how true love matures and strengthens people. Yet Bront does not paint an ideal picture of love, and instead shows Jane's misery and torment. \\"Gentle reader, may you never feel what I then felt! May your eyes never shed such stormy, scalding, heart-wrung tears as poured from mine. May you never appeal to Heaven in prayers so hopeless and so agonized as in that hour left my lips: for never may you, like me, dread to be the instrument of evil to what you wholly love\\" (324). Jane's misery is an important aspect, because it dismisses the myth that love is a fairy tale. Jane, as well as the reader, realizes that to love someone, is to experience agony, joy, and a range of high and low emotions. This roller coaster experience of being in love nurtures Jane's growth and maturity.Bront's characterization and insight into the human mind are beautifully written, but her language tends to be too verbose and detailed. Sometimes, Bront's lines seem to be pure poetry, for example when Jane is gazing on Mr. Rochester. \\"I could not keep their lids under control: they would rise and the iris would fix on him [Mr. Rochester]. I looked, and had an acute pleasure in looking, - a precious, yet poignant pleasure; pure gold, with a steely point of agony: a pleasure like what the thirst-perishing man might feel who knows the well to which he has crept is poisoned, yet stoops and drinks divine draughts nevertheless\\" (176). Yet at other times, Bront repeats herself over and over again, drawing out what has already been said. For example, for more than ten pages, Bront describes Jane's refusal of an unwelcome marriage proposal. A simple \\"no\\" was not sufficient for Bront. The novel could have been shorter if Bront had chosen to edit certain sections of the book. Many of her sentences are run-on and complex. There are well-written pieces of poetry in the novel, but there is also a line between verbose and poetic; Charlotte Bront is hovering above that line. I think for the audience that it was written for - 19th century - the poetics and language are perfectly acceptable. Yet for today's audience that is used to instant gratification, the book might be tedious.My overall opinion of this novel is mixed. I love Bront's underlying message of true love and self-realization. Yet, the language she uses is both poetic and over-the-top. Either people will love it or hate it. Personally, I liked Jane Eyre despite its defects. It is a novel about how love makes you realize who you are and who you want to be; how loving someone is difficult and heart wrenching, but unforgettable and eye opening. Jane Eyre is one classic that I will read over and over again for its universal and timeless messages of true love and self-discovery."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"We read this book last year in my English class and it was one of the best books I've ever read. I loved it's mix of love, mystery, misfortune, blandness, and phychological struggles. There is much to learn from this book in the ways we see Jane grow and learn to love Rochester. We see all the different kinds of people; for example, Helen; the religious one, Jane; the rebel, Bertha; the insane wife who is a foil of Jane and many other suncharacters in this book. It is an absolutely brilliant book and it's worth the time."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"Jane Eyre is just a great book... full of color and depth. It's story not for society as a whole, but for each unique individual that reads it. The coincidences that many complain about were superb to me, because in everyone's life, especially mine, strange things happen everyday that wouldn't seem &quot;normal&quot; or may appear coincidental. What I think is most prevalent about the story are the internal changes that occur in the lives of Jane Eyre and Edward Rochester; they're the only two characters in the book that are changed and humbled by the experiences that they went through for the sake of love. When first read, Jane and the reader are nearly &quot;tricked&quot; into thinking that this book would be another tale of &quot;true love&quot; triumping over an evil society, crossing the boundaries of wealth and caste. Such a theme is as unoriginal as &quot;love at first sight.&quot; Yet, we should already know from many other books that society will not change for the individual, and the author does a great job in showing that individuals (with the aid of God) can change for each other, something completely different than the other theme. In the end we find that society has nothing to do with internal battles that Jane and Edward faced; the development of their love had little to do with external circumstances. All in all, this book is a must read, not just because of the romance (but that part was very interesting and moving!), but for the passion and the wisdom that the author is able to bestow on the reader."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"You have to read this book.Why? Because you may love it.Or, you may understand it.And it's well worth the investment to pick up this book in order to do one or the other, or, with luck, both.I read this book as a child, and it changed my life. Had I never read \\"Jane Eyre,\\" I suspect I would be a different person, a lesser one.When people ask me, \\"How did you come to travel the world ... write ... survive ... \\" there are many answers, but one of the most important is, \\"I read 'Jane Eyre.'\\"As you quickly learn from other reviews, or from the jacket cover, \\"Jane Eyre\\" is about a girl who isn't much to look at, and hasn't any material wealth.If you can't identify with that kind of a person, why should you read this book? There are two reasons.You should read it because it is a classic of Western Civilization, and you should read it because it articulates, in an historically important and artistically excellent way, the insistence of one lowly born female on being a full human being.When this book was written the words \\"We hold these truths to be self-evident\\" had already made history -- for men.We still await the world where women are men's equals.\\"Jane Eyre\\" has the courage to say, in relentlessly feminine language -- Jane never has to resort to a karate kick to make her point -- that women have just as much value as men. Not just women who make good eye candy. But really plain and poor and unexceptional women, as well.\\"Jane Eyre\\" also says a heck of a lot about how women -- not all women but many -- most want to be loved. I think a man could learn much of what he needed or wanted to know about seduction just from reading this book.I've read other reviews here that speak of this book with great love, and that speak of Jane as a living being. I've read of other reviewers who read this book at an early age and felt it changed their lives.I'm part of that club.Now, stop reading this and go read \\"Jane Eyre.\\""},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"This book was an amazing piece of literature that's exquisitely written. The characters seem to come alive off the page, especially the heroine, Jane Eyre, who seems to have a very twenty first century frame of mind. While the plot line is fairly hard to believe, the thoughts of the heroine is what makes this piece of work a true literary masterpiece. She deals with the perils facing her with an open mind, and is willing to stand up for her beliefs and morals even in a time when this wasn't acceptable for a woman. She's a true role model for all young girls and women, and a real figure of the ages.I would recommend this book to anyone, but you have to have an appreciation for good, in depth description and old-fashioned style of writing. You also must have patience, because this is a fairly long book with many twists and turns, and there were definite times in this book that I didn't think anything good could come of it!! You must also have faith in the writer, because I was afraid for a while when I was reading that it would end horribly.I have heard many negative things about this story, but I truly don't agree with any of them. Jane Eyre, Edward Rochester, Mr. St. John, they are all fabulously written, almost as though this story was written about actual people instead of fictional. I loved this book and will read it many more times."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"Adrienne Zillmann September 12, 2000My Opinion of JaneEyreWritten in a time when women had no rights, and were not allowed to hold any serious jobs, Charlotte Bronte's novel Jane Eyre is a porthole traveling back through history. Charlotte Bronte was a sort of maverick herself, assuming a man's name in order to have her works published. Jane Eyre provides a witty, masterfully written story of a governess trying to overcome the hardships of lower-class life, and her difficult rise to nobility. It's an enjoyable story for all audiences. Bronte's plot renders many twists, provides worthy role models for all ages and genders, and presents a romantic conclusion that is heart-warming enough to make any reader smile. Though she sometimes went off track, Charlotte Bronte eventually leads young Jane along the right path of destiny by using a series of random events to guide her in the right direction. There are two ways of looking at the fluke events that befall Jane throughout the book. Some people might say that Bronte overdoes her use of uncanny coincidences when Jane happens to meet her future employer, Mr. Rochester, on the road, and his horse falls as he is passing Jane. However, the truth is, the world is a small place. Coincidences such as this happen all of the time in every day life, and much of the time, they pass unnoticed. Another such example is when Jane is looking for a job and she happens to stay with St. John and his sisters. She later finds out that they are none other than her very own cousins, and she had thought she had no relatives. This event could be thought of as unrealistic, but many people may enjoy these sly little detours from the plot and Bronte's use of destiny. This quality enhances the book tremendously by making it a far more unique, fascinating, and pleasing book to read. Another positive attribute about Jane Eyre is the happy ending. All too often, things do not turn out the way people want them to in their lives. The novel's joyful solution is a refreshing change to readers who wish their own lives worked out so perfectly. How could the story get any better? Jane, the poor, rejected orphan, finds a man so in love with her that he will forsake his own fortune and reputation to marry one of his own servants. Mr. Rochester, the eccentric, moody man he is, finds a wife so well suited to him, who returns a love so strong, that she marries a blind and crippled husband. The fact that Jane Eyre had a romantic and heart-warming ending will really secure one's opinion on the book. After all, most people do not enjoy books with unhappy or unfinished ends. They leave readers hanging and feeling unsatisfied. Jane Eyre is just the opposite. Its conclusion wraps up the story beautifully and leaves the reader feeling fulfilled. It makes one happy to know that true love does conquer all. Probably the most important virtue of Bronte's whole book is the main character, Jane Eyre. If there had to be only one reason why people should read the book, this would be it. Jane has so many admirable qualities, and her own actions teach the reader many valuable lessons on life and good morals. She provides the perfect role model for readers of any age or sex when she demonstrates such qualities as self-discipline, strength, dignity, humbleness, and faith. She illustrates these traits constantly in the book, but one section that is a particularly good example of her wonderful character is when she leaves Rochester. At this point in the story, Jane has already found out that Rochester is a married man. She knows she can not stay with him because she can not love a married man. That would make her his mistress. She loves him more than words can say, and no matter how painful it is, she decides to sneak away in the middle of the night. By making the choice to abandon her own emotions and do what is morally right, Jane is demonstrating her own self-discipline and strength all at once. Then, when she leaves, taking only what she was wearing, she is retaining her dignity. She wants to show Mr. Rochester that she is strong, and she does not need anything he gave her to lean on or use as a crutch. She is an independent woman who has dignity, but she is also not too proud. She is humble when times demand so. One instance is when she is hungry, and has to go begging for food. It is an embarrassing task to take on, but Jane does it even though she realizes it will affect her own reputation. Lastly, Jane constantly has faith. She not only has religion, but a real faith in herself. When she is sick and living with St. John and his sisters, it is her faith and will to survive that keep her alive. She is definitely a praiseworthy character and an exemplary role model for any reader. As one can see by these bounteous compliments on the book, any reader will enjoy Jane Eyre, and it is earnestly recommended to someone who is looking for a good book to read. It is an enjoyable novel with a good ending, and the book Jane Eyre truly illustrates model human beings that anybody can look up to and learn from."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"Before it was fashionable or even acceptable to be an intelligent women in command of herself, Charlotte Bronte created Jane Eyre, a heroine unsurpassed in courage, dignity, wisdom and self-containment. Bronte didn't resort to stereotypes of the day by creating a beautiful but wan heroine with giddy, sensual, flirtatious or fickle allure, but rather a woman who earns the reader's respect with her naive and quiet candor, her wit and constancy. Even her plainness, mediocre physical appearance and lack of skill become endearing as Jane is created to be real.However, though I respected Jane, the tale was so sluggish in the beginning that I almost stopped reading. Most characters were dull or too unlikable, and the storyline, though of interest to me, was blandly written. It was the entrance of the tempermental and ugly Rochester that sparked my attention. The dynamics and chemistry between Jane and Rochester are the best I've experienced between two characters in a novel. Their relationship was far deeper than most romances written in the novels of Jane Austen or Georg Elliot, as Bronte explores the characters' thoughts and feelings more than she does their economic dilemmas.Having read this novel innumerous times, I count it amongst the most satisfying and engaging of the stories I've known. Not only do I collect hardcover copies of it, I also own every movie made from the book (5 to date, I believe). It isn't necessarily a flawless novel, but it is passionate, haunting and stirring in its very imperfection."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"Jane Eyre is one of the classics of 19th century English literature. It is not possible to judge the book by to-day's literary standards: books must be judged in their own time and social setting. The language is, at times, tedious, and the plot absurd - with impossible coincidences, but, to English reader of the mid 19th century, these were accepted and demanded. The characters are well drawn and the atmosphere is vivid. Miss Eyre is a strong character who proves that the good and honest will prevail in God's good time.

(A complex person, a good man in a bad situation)Seriously, although it is rarely mentioned, I was struck by the Biblical and religious references and overtones of this book. Charlotte Bronte, as a clergyman's daughter, sure knew the Bible. And contrary to popular opinion, religious people understand the trials of temptation, perhaps more than most. That is why Jane's struggles with her desires ring true. Although she suffered, her self-respect remained intact. As a modern woman I respect this character's moral uprightness and her strong sense of self--I wish more modern young (and not so young) women would learn from her example, and thus avoid much heartache and regret\\"Dread remorse when you are tempted to err, Miss Eyre; remorse is the poison of life.'--Mr. Rochester"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"This is a really interesting book if you are interested in sad, mystery, and love books.

This is a lovely and somewhat autobiographical tale of Jane Eyre, orphaned and raised by self-centered and uncaring relatives until they send her off to school. Eventually she is hired as a governess to a young girl and meets the girl's guardian Mr. Rochester, and of course they fall in love and plan to marry. But, there is a mystery about the house that once it is discovered destroys the wedding plans.A lovely tale, and Bronte has such a wonderful prose that makes you want to slow down and savor it and the story like a fine red wine or chocolate. The version I read is a set with selected works of all the Bronte sisters, so I did not have the distraction of the foot notes to refer to, and I don't feel that I missed much without them.Highly highly recommended, one that should be taken off the shelf and reread every couple of years or so."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"Since I had read the book Jane Eyre, I had an urge to see the movie.I was impressed and fascinated by the classic English language, thereforemy choosing of the actors \\" Tomothy Dalton & Zelah Clarke \\".A real enjoyment !!!"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"Hard to believe that JANE EYRE was written over 150 years ago since women of all ages still fall in love with its hero, Mr. Rochester, today.

The beginning part of the book is reminiscent of Dickens since Jane survives a horrible childhood of mistreatment. And when she meets Mr. Rochester and against all odds he falls in love with her (for her character and intelligence as she is \\"plain and poor\\") the book really gets interesting for most of its fans.

The character of Jane is so amazing: so quiet and humble and patient, yet at heart so passionate and full of longing! She is small and plain, but has more determination than any other character we meet. She has a pure, beautiful heart and a passionate, tender soul. She is the most amazing character I have ever enountered in all of literature!The book follows Jane Eyre who, despite the stability of her quiet, peaceful life as a governess, is ultimately lonely and longs to experience more of the world. Mr. Rochester is a cynical, haunted man, living a life of sin and debauchery, but whose pure heart yearns for a clean conscience and a chance at happiness. Their love is deep and tender, filling up Jane's lonely life and rejuvenating Mr. Rochester--but true love can never be built on lies. When Jane discovers Mr. Rochester's awful secret, she cannot stay with him. He has lied to her the entire time, loving her completely but selfishly, using her for his own purposes.

We find Jane Eyre the orphan child soon to be abandoned by her uncaring aunt to a stern stark girls school. Jane has a spirit that does not quake in the face of dangers. She is the model for feminists in years to come.Charlotte Bronte the author of the book was born in 1816 and like Jane had experience as a governess. Jane Eyre was first published in 1847. By reading the book one can experience the harsh times that existed in the era. Young children had little protection from society outside of their family and those without families were at risk. The school, Jane attends is a uncaring and stoic establishment. Even so Jane flourishes because of her strong spirit and desire to learn.After leaving the school Jane bravely sets out to be governess. It is here that she meets Mr. Rochester her silent and mysterious employer. Jane has the ability to see the real spirit of a person and draws for Mr. Rochester with her subtle elfin charms. Throughout the book Jane maintains an integrity of being and an independent spirit. She demands that others, who she cares for respect her as an individual as well as a woman. Jane is a person who doesn't accept the limitations which fate has set forth for her.In many ways this novel was far ahead of its time in recognizing women as individuals who were capable and independent beings.

Orphaned when she is a small child, Jane Eyre is left in the clutches of her hateful aunt, Mrs. Reed, and her bullying cousins at Gateshead Hall. So marks the reader's advent into Jane's dreary world. Sent to Lowood School at the of ten, she eagerly expects a genial environment only to be met by a cold, hostile institution plagued by Mr. Brocklehearst, the arrogant headmaster. Despite two high points in her stay at Lowood (she is befriended by Miss Temple, a solicitous music instructor, and a saint-like pupil named Helen Burns), they are brutally taken away from her. Helen tragically dies from typhus, and Miss Temple marries a minister and moves away. Jane's only escape from Lowood is a position as a governess at Thornfield Hall eight years later (when she is eighteen) that she accepts. When she arrives at the manor, she is heartily greeted by the housekeeper, Miss Fairfax. Mr. Edward Rochester, the owner, usually travel abroad and is absent most of the time. Jane's duty is to tutor his foster-child Adele Vareans, an adorable six-year-old French girl. It finally seems as if Jane has discovered a home for herself and is at last distinguished as a bona fide person. However, her tranquility and niche are suddenly threatened when the brooding Mr. Rochester returns home. Odd events occur, such as screams in the night, crazed laughs echoing in the halls, blazing fires, and the presence of an unexpected guest. To worsen matters, Jane finds herself falling in love with her master despite the fact that she suspects he is concealing a secret past of himself from her and others. Exactly what is it and will Rochester ever be romantically interested in &quot;plain&quot; Jane? To unearthen the answers, one has to enter the allure, intrigue, and enigma of Charlotte Bronte's delightful story of the struggles, identity, and emotions of a heroine on a quest for her destiny: Jane Eyre. --P.

However when it is forced down the throats of unwilling English students, Bronte's ultra-quixotic plot, and seemingly incessant need to detail the most superficial minutia only add to the painful legnth of the novel.By page 400, I had become so tired of Jane's apathetic nature, I was indifferent to the outcome, so long as it came swiftly."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"I am not sure whether or not I enjoyed this book. I liked the Biblical references that are littered throughout the story but the book gives very little insight as to whether there is any real religion observed. From this angle, the book seems to go at a pious anti-piety, as odd as that may sound. The book also seems to show some beginnings of feminism, which I am not a fan of, since it is anti-Biblical.

She starts out in the home of her aunt and three cousins all of whom despise her. She was left there as a young girl with her caring uncle when both of her parents died. Her uncle died shortly later and Jane was left in less than desirable conditions. After a blood-curdling incident her frustrated aunt sends her off to boarding school where, for the most part, she is treated worse than she was in her aunt's home. From there she becomes a governess and takes care of a little girl for a man whom she later falls in love with. This is where the story really gets interesting as several twists and turns take the couple towards an unexpected ending.Charlotte Bronte, the author, has a writing style typical of the romance period. Her vivid descriptions, while being wonderfully picturesque, can at times be lengthy. There are so many images of gardens and mountains and sunsets that the plot often gets lost somewhere along the way. The story can also become frustrating at times. I often longed to yell at the characters and set them in the right direction as they slowly picked their way through the tangled mess they were enveloped in.Bronte's heart was in the right place with this one. The story is one of a great love and an extraordinary woman. Jane Eyre is a one in a million kind of girl whose life story is definitely one worth telling. However, it is one that could have been told much more simply. There are parts of the novel that don't seem to have any real purpose other than to fill pages. They don't give away anything as to how she is going to end up. It merely confuses and frustrates the reader into utter boredom. So while the story and writing are both tasteful, Jane Eyre can only be taken in small doses."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"Jane was such a brave woman throughout her misfortunes .She began as a womanly child, professing to ignore her troubles and trying to love life for its worth .She deserved LOVE."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"I have a good hint for all you people who have to read this or any other book for summer reading or as a class assignment.

All I say is that there was an Anti-Semitic comment by Jane Eyre in the middle of the book that turned me down. I started to doubt Jane's moral and could not recover from that ignorant statement. I finished the book just to know how that story would end. I don't have any admiration for the character."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"It seems that the basic purpose of the character Jane Eyre is to suffer nobly and then eventually succeed. Both elements are highly problematic as presented. Her noble suffering acts to undermine her actual character, making someone that reacts the same to most of the challenges--stoic, determined, largely silent, resigned. This required attitude makes her too much of a blank slate, too reactive, with insufficient personal details to be memorable or seem like a complex psychological portrait. One gathers that Bronte was trying to subvert common norms in representation of woman, by making Jane a lot plainer and less accomplished than was the usual style. She may have made a major improvement in this, and as discussed below there are some interesting elements to all this, but the basic result undercuts the character's agency too much. Jane can work as a symbol, she does not work as a person, and the novel is too deeply linked to her consciousness for that to be a passable loss.As well there are major pacing issues and apparent questions on the larger arc, with much of the first hundred pages and the last hundred and fifty being off-tangent to the necessary interactions for the particular story. Still, it was hardly the worst or most difficult work to get through. For much of the first two hundred pages I found it moderately enjoyable, without thinking it was very good. I was reading it as a dark comedy, framed by a blank protagonist in a fundamentally ridiculous situation. The humor--genuine though presumably unintended--came from the contrast of the stylized language forms and general etiquette focus and how cruelly people acts. See in particular the treatment of Jane in the devil child scene, in the way that's she stiffly defends herself as opposed to how the school argues she's a literal follower of the devil, and how that's a bad thing. Amusing, in a twisted sense, at least as I took it.Where I stopped being able to do this was precisely the point that the horrid and creepy Mr. Rochester became crucial to the story. He was a fundamentally twisted, harsh and disturbing person in his own right, and the eventual arc of the book where Jane does marry him and this is apparently a good thing fatally undermines the book. The way Jane plods on is problematic in itself, but it's what he ultimately plods to that is truly wrong. Rochester's focus on pride and control, his lies, his age, his borderline-deranged manner of fixating on women, the fact we have only his own word on the true story with his first wife, all these make Jane's eventual marriage with him very far from a happy thing. Yet the book seems insistent to regard it in this light, as if Rochester's injury has in itself transformed his character enough that Jane waiting on him for the rest of his life a satisfying resolution. It's the ending scenario that makes the conclusion of the author and the whole structure of the narrative less than even good.Nevertheless, the novel is an accomplishment in a number of ways. That it exists at all, that early in the nineteenth century a woman could be published. Furthermore, it's extraordinary that she was able to include so centrally in her work a protest and anger against the systemic condition of women of her time, and that both elements have been perpetuated down into the present. Creepy as some of the above subtext is, that's a worthwhile development amidst what was a pretty terrifyingly close-minded century.There's also some interesting stuff at work with religion, class and attitudes in the nineteenth century context, Jane occupying a bit of a hybrid position in all of these, not affluent nor truly destitute, not tightly religious or a firm skeptic. The hybridity of her position is very revealing to a lot of norms that we might not see in novels of the period, as her very existence in the text portrays social structures even while it undermines them. Jane Eyre the character and book are transgressive in certain ways, then, and the way this plays out is interesting. Yet, I find this appealing and informative more in my hat as historian than as a reader. The book is quite revealing of the cultural context of the author, but that's going to be the case for almost every book ever published, and it's notably less effective in framing the context for its invented narrative, cast of characters, and atmosphere. I could forgive a lot more in this book, and even come to value much of it, if it weren't for that ending that pushes the whole thing into a disturbed romance. However the book does, and so let it rest.Jane Eyre reminds me of and is better than: Bronte's Wuthering HeightsJane Eyre reminds me of and is worse than: Shelly's Frankenstein"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"Jane Eyre was a clever book that brought you through the twists and turns of her obscure life. Beginning from childhood, Jane was faced with the choices of life which lay before her. She moved from struggle to struggle with courage and self-determination which gained the reader's respect. Her character is strong and clever in a way that brings her to be a heroic personage in the novel. I liked how Jane obtained a strong-willed personality and how she stuck by her beliefs no matter what.I thoroughly enjoyed reading this slower paced romance from beginning to end and like many other books of its kind, it captivated me with the beloved mixture of romance and challenge. I liked how there was a fair amount of lovey-dovey moments in the book which held your attention, and made you strive for more. It wasn't a constant shower of romance and flirtatious quotes, and this I found, allowed the reader to excite themselves whenever the romance was present.Charlotte Bront used a lot of descriptive imagery throughout the novel ranging from the texture of light to the precise emotions Jane was feeling. This seemed to make it easier on many levels to comprehend exactly what was going on at every point of the novel. Although it had a few sluggish parts, I found was no struggle to read through those select scenes. The beginning of the book had a slow start, but I believe it was necessary to set up the stage for the rest of the novel. As a final comment, I'd like to simply state that I really enjoyed reading Jane Eyre."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"This is a very good book. If you read this I would also suggest watching the new masterpiece theater DVD of Jane Eyre."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"This was my first Classic novel. While it was not fast-paced and begging to be read, it was a beautifully written novel. It was very lyrical. I thought the love between Jane and Mr. Rochester was true, withstanding the test of time. It was a truly romantic book, but not so easy to read because of the time period in which it was written. For instance, this is not a novel I would read in bed at night because I would fall asleep. Still, having said that, I am happy I read it and thought Charlotte Bronte was an exceptional novelist."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"I usually read murder mysteries but ordered the audiobook after viewing the Brontes' sisters biography on television. It's a wonderful book. I can't believe I waited this long to read a book so popular for centuries and I don't know why this wasn't required reading in school.The characters are endearing, the language, beautiful and I think knowing the history of the author makes the book much more enjoyable and realistic.I had read Emily Brontes' Wuthering Heights years ago in my teens and enjoyed it very much but didn't appreciate the history of the author then.Maybe everyone should read or watch the sisters' biography then read the books."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"As I was in the middle of the book, I was so drawn to the characters I felt full. Later there was sadness for awhile. At the end I was full of joy. My feelings were \\"wow - what a wonderful journey.\\" I loved the two main characters, Edward and Jane, their individual natures, their love for each other and how they pursued it. There were interesting and unexpected conversations and events. I enjoyed the way early in their relationship, Edward would pass Jane in the hallway, sometimes scowling and sometimes politely nodding, yet she was not offended because she knew his moods were unrelated to her. The St. John character was odd yet amazing. He loved a girl, but easily gave her up because he believed she wouldn't fit in with his missionary goals and service to God. Instead he asked someone else to marry him whom he did not love but she fit with his vocation. The novelist Thackeray wrote \\"St John is a failure I think but a good failure.\\" Bronte describes St. John as being made of what heroes, conquerors and statesmen are made, but not marrying material. St. John was not a major character in the book, but I mention him as an example of the variety of interesting characters. An idea that continues to intrigue me is \\"fact is stranger than fiction.\\" One reviewer of the book (back in the 1800s) thought one of the characters was too unbelievable and stated \\"such creations as Helen Burns are very beautiful but very untrue.\\" Ms. Bronte responded saying that Helen Burns was a real person and that Ms. Bronte exaggerated nothing about Helen. Sexual language: none. Number of sex scenes: none. Setting: 1800s England. Published 1847. Genre: historical romance."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"This is a great book to read! I really love the voice of Jane throughout the whole story, making me really feel that I was reading her journal rather than Charlotte writing fiction. Definitely a must read!"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"I first read this in high school (oh, gosh...25 years ago!). I remember liking it then, though at the time I think I preferred Emily's Wuthering Heights. But as another reviewer mentioned, classic books really should be re-read from time to time. In some ways I think they're wasted on the young! Now I find Wuthering Heights a good story, though a bit melodramatic. However, reading Jane Eyre again, in my forties, I realize what an unusual book it is. On the surface, it has many of the standard plot devices of Victorian novels: a mistreated orphan, a romantic setting, a brooding romantic interest. But Charlotte Bronte's deft touch lifts this above the ordinary. She uses Jane to cry out against all the injustice she saw in the world. She addresses religious hypocrisy, women's rights, and the mistreatment of children, among other things. And it's a very good read. I find I am staying up late at night because I want to read on, rather than go to bed."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"With this novel Ms. Bronte crafted what is undoubtedly one of the most beautiful works of the English language. One concern I always have with reading classics is to avoid their introductions as they inevitably forego on the minute details of the work (I suppose they assume everyone who's someone has already read it.) As such, I'll avoid disclosing the inner workings of the plot of Jane Eyre -- it's too beautiful to divulge and I hope you'll take up the novel for yourself.Simply put, we see Jane Eyre, the epitome of the term \\"Plain Jane,\\" evolve from mistreated orphan as she ascends the ladder of social status and, as with all bildungsroman novels, plummets to an even further depth than whence she came. We read as our heroine negotiates the complexities of early Victorian womanhood and confronts the haunting past of her mysterious master, all in the quest for conflicting longings for self-satisfaction, independence, and love.If interested, the reader may also enjoy Jean Rhys' 1966 classic novel Wide Sargasso Sea, which traces the story of Jane's symbolic inner woman, the \\"mad\\" Antoinette \\"Bertha\\" Mason."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"This is a reprint of the famous Bronte novel that even now after so many years can thrill and captivate the reader.We are introduced to the heroine Jane EYRE on the first page and we soon realise she is a most put upon child, unwanted by Aunt, cruelly treated by her spoilt cousins and mostly ignore by the servants, save for Bessie who perhaps has the best understanding of the sufferings that Jane has to ensure under her Aunt Reed's indifferent care.We follow Jane from her miserable home life in Gateshead to her time spent at a charity school, her friendship with the doomed Helen Burns and her elevation to student teacher, a role that allows her to eventually take up a post as a governess for the child Adele, the possible illegitimate daughter of the enigmatic Mr ROCHESTER who owns the eerie Thornfield Manor.From Jane's first day at the Manor we are treated to a mystery story that slowly grows and grows with each passing day, soon Jane realises that all is not well at the Manor but she is not sure what the problem is, it has something to do with the enigmatic Grace POOLE and the attic where she works, but who cries out at night and why does Mr ROCHESTER almost get burnt to death in his bed in what is obviously not an accident but which he insists is the case.Ms BRONTE'S book is suspenseful and daring, in that she talks about illegitimacy, marriages of class, and the abuse of children in charity schools to name but a few subjects she incorporates into Jane EYRE.This particular edition is excellent because it is a faithful reproduction with no abridgement and is also can be purchased for a pittance, one way of getting the classics on your shelves, I will certainly be going out and buying myself more of these editions and look forward to re-reading Dracula, The Picture of Dorian Grey and Jekyll and Hyde."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"After reading the last words of this novel, the only word that escaped my mouth was WOW! Jane's character is so real. In one way or another, every woman can relate to her passage from the insecurities of childhood to the life defining moments of adulthood.For me, Bronte's main characters Jane and Mr. Rochester mirror the traveler in Robert Frost's Poem \\"The Road Not Taken,\\" as they struggle between raw human desire and moral righteousness. Jane chooses the \\"road less traveled,\\" where as Mr. Rochester takes the well worn path. In both cases, their choice defines the fiber of their spirit."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"Why I waited until I was middle-aged to start reading the classics, I'll never know, but I'm glad that I did. When I received my new Kindle Fire a few weeks ago, I downloaded some free books to test it out and among them was Jane Eyre. I enjoyed the eloquent language and writing used. I went between applauding Jane's high morals and commitment to yelling at her for being such a doormat.As I was reading the story, I asked my husband, \\"Was it really like this in Europe back then? Super rich people and super poor people and no in between?\\" It makes for a good story of a girl thrown into a charitable facility/orphanage, going out on her own, falling in love, and staying true to her feelings. The ending was warm and fuzzy.The gist of the story is girl gets abused, sent to an orphanage, succeeds as a teacher and when she turns 18 ventures out to be a governess, falls in love, is gilted, ventures out again, finds relatives, and then . . . well, I don't want to spoil it for you, but it's a good read."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"I decided to read the book after seeing the 1996 movie version. I heard that the 2011 rendition was great and I wanted to have more insight before reading it. After seeing the movie and loving it, I didn't think the book could get any better.The book starts out with Jane Eyre in her youth. She lives with her aunt and cousins. Unlike families should be, they mistreat her and are abusive to her. Her aunt, claiming that she is a wicked child, sends her to a catholic school. If you thought things were going to get better, you thought wrong. She is still mistreated and shunned by the residents of the school. Jane Eyre grows to be a woman of strong opinions and independence. In adulthood she does not grow to be a woman that is handsome, in fact she is very plain. But she believes that intellect and personality are what really make a person. When she advertises as a governess, she is immediately answered. She arrives at her place of occupation and begins well enough. There are strange things that occur in the house however, for instance, strange laughing and disappearance of objects. It's troubling, but she hardly minds it. After some time, Jane begins to become closer to the master of the house, Mr. Rochester. He's mysterious and different. But in the end, will it be for nothing?The narration and the way the character conducts herself is what really makes this such an incredible read. It's a very unique style in which the book is written. The words are very fluid and it wasn't at all a difficult read. I was stunned with the beauty of the book and how much I loved the book.

The romantic in me was just spellbound by the intensity of Rochester and Jane's love for one another. A thought that repeatedly crossed my mind was \\"Has anyone ever loved anybody the way Rochester loves Jane?\\" If you read it as a teen, go back and read it with adult eyes.

I love old meloramas, spy novels and Hemingway but this is the best--EVER.Jane and Mr. Rochester and Adele and Pilot and Mrs Fairfax and Bertha and Helen are all so very amazing and still so wonderfully penned. This book doesnt fade, the magic doesnt get dated, the story is never old, and oh my goodness--I STILL hate her aunt and Mr. Brocklehurst."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"\\"I need not sell my soul to buy bliss\\"Jane Eyre is an orphan, raised by her aunt, until one day, she is sent to a horrible school. Eventually, she leaves this school and is employed by the mysterious Mr. Rochester, to care for his ward, Adele. Jane finds herself growing more fond of the man...and more curious about the mysterious circumstances surrounding his home.I have just finished listening to this audiobook, and I am still trying to pick my jaw up from the floor. WOW, just WOW. This was a positively amazing experience, a thrill and a joy, a pleasure from beginning to end. I haven't had this enjoyable a time listening to a historical/classic/romance novel since...well, \\"Gone with the Wind\\"! From characters to plot to story to setting, everything was a joy to unfold, and while I knew somewhat how the story would go, I was still thrown for loops and wondered if Jane would ever get her happily ever after.From the beginning, I knew Jane was interesting and different. She may have been plain, but she was relatively well behaved, curious, and intelligent. Throughout the entire book, Jane grows and develops as a person. She pushes for her own destiny and does not let others tell her what to do--and in her day and age, that is remarkable. She puts up with her cousins until self-respect tells her not to. She begs to be put into school away from her relatives. She deals with the hardships of school, knowing things would be worse in her adoptive home. She is studious, becoming a teacher, and when she learns she can make more money being a governess, she leaves her job. While working for Mr. Rochester, she never forgets her pupil, she remains cordial and appropriate in front of Mr. Rochester, and when she is called back to her aunt's side, she gives the dying woman forgiveness. When Jane learns of Mr. Rochester's secret, she doesn't succumb to what she sees as sin, but leaves even though it could mean starvation and hard work. When Rev. Rivers tries to coerce her into going with him to India, she refuses to accept his temrs and presents her own. Time and again, Jane proves to be independent, smart, and moral--something many a modern protagonist that supposedly is these things could take a lesson in.Our secondary characters are painted with equal care and detail. Jane's aunt and cousins are horrible, and they grow up to be horrible people (well, sort of). I grieved when Helen died; I fell in love with Mr. Rochester alongside Jane; I was devastated at his secret; I loved being with Mary and Diana; I bristled at Rev. Rivers' cold attitude. All in all, the cast is well-crafted and enjoyable.I knew the big secret of the story before hand, but I didn't know how or if Jane ever got to be with her beloved Mr. Rochester. I was kept on the edge of my seat the entire time, wondering how Bronte would pull it off. I was shocked at what happened to Mr. Rochester's manor AND Mr. Rochester. Most authors nowadays wouldn't DARE damage their major characters so permanently and so obviously!The descriptions are long and sometimes laborious, though it paints Jane's surroundings beautifully. I also found myself getting bored in the last third (where Jane hangs out with Diana and Mary) and found some of the circumstances of that part to be a bit hokey (no spoilers!). Also, apologies in advance, but the narrator was particularly bland and almost sounded like those automated computer voices you get when calling your bank or Fedex or some other big business. Her voice was clear and precise, but had almost no emotion and was very dry. A few hours of listening to that voice drained me.This book is excellent, much better, in my opinion, than Charlotte's sister's book, \\"Wuthering Heights\\", which seemed more of a study on how not to fall in love . This is a real, true romance story with real, true obstacles populated with real, true characters. I definitely enjoyed it and recommend it highly.Brought to you by:*C.S.

This was the very first classic novel that I ever read in English. As I needed that for an exam, and didn't have enough knowledge for reading the original I was supposed to read an abridged version. And so I did. And I loved the book.Years later, I decided to read the real thing, the original novel. Much to my surprised it turned out to be highly accessible, and as entertaining and a nice read as the abridged version. Moreover, in the original book I could find all the details, and were able to savor Charlotte Bront's language.Written more than 150 years ago, \`Jane Eyre' reads as fresh as a XXI Century novel. Bront's use of language is vivid and remarkable. Her descriptions bring the book into life. We cannot forget that the book is the social portrait of the women in the writer's society. It shows how they struggled --and failed most of the time-- to reach a respectable position in the society.Jane didn't have any attractive that was required in her time. She wasn't rich or even beautiful, although smart. But smartness wasn't a good thing for a woman in those days. She is even punished for having brains. She ends up being a governess, and end up having a humiliating experience, being forced to change places and even name. Ms Eyre is only noticed when she receives a heritage and becomes rich. And she does not let all she has suffered affect her.\`Jane Eyre' is a novel ahead its time. This book is about feminism much before the term was created. When Jane speaks to her aunt about her rights --can you imagine a girl speaking about her rights in that time-- she is doing what other women would do years later. Charlotte Bront has managed to creat a strong and sad girl, who is trying to find her place in the world. With that, the writer made a book that will be read for generations to come --even if they read an abridged version before reading the unabridged book."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"This book, like my title says, was hard for me to put down. I just became so inthralled in the book and its characters.You become, early on, compassionate to Jane's pain, hopeful with Jane's encounter with Mr. Rochester, afraid for her when she meets with a ghastly face, and so on and so forth.At times I almost didn't want Jane with Mr. Rochester, but in the end he won me over. Their love is unique, it was very nurturing and longing, but love nonetheless.I recommend this book to anyone who likes a good love story with a little suspense all throughout."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"I have read this book several times, on differentoccasions, and ech time I've enjoyed it immensely.This is one of those classic stories that will stay with youforever. It appears simple on the surface, but underneath itare well-thought out passages.Bronte is a superb artist, weaving her two main characters, each suffering in their life, into a tapestry of love. Each so different from each other, yet each needing the otherdesparately.I recommend this book highly."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"First of all, I would just like to say that Jane Eyre is most likely a good book for all those bookworms out there. I am postive that you will not be disappointed with this book if you like classical and dramatic novels. Yes, the novel may seem to be a little long, but it keeps you interested and guessing to the very end. Don't get me wrong, it is not some book that is a mystery. Although, the end is very unpredictable and I had no idea which path Jane Eyre was going to take.When I opened the first few pages of this book, I must admit that I was questioning whether or not this was going to bea dull and drab story. It seemed as though this might be a challenging book to be able to finish. Although, after some questioning, the plot took a turn for the better. The story really started to pick up as I began to enter the life of the orphan, Jane Eyre. The uninteresting beginning was well worth reading because the story was really good.This story begins with Jane Eyre living with her mean Aunt Reed and cruel cousins. She goes through awful torments like being locked up in a dark room all night. The beginning of the story kind of reminded me of the enchanting story of Cinderella. Jane is then sent off to school all alone in the world to become a well-educated lady. She thinks she begins to find happiness there, but some awful things happened. She then goes to Thornfield Hall to try to be a teacher. She actually ends up falling in love with her master, Mr. Rochester. Jane once again begins to feel that everything is going well and that she actually might have found true happiness. Jane and Mr. Rochester are then about to be married when an awful secret is revealed about Mr. Rochester. Jane then has to figure out whether to stay with her one and only true love or just move on to a different life and forget that all of this happened. Jane then does take a small journey away from Thornfield to find out where to go from there.I found that this book contained mystery, drama, romance, andeverything else a person could ask for in a book. This book is the type of book that you would want to take and curl up in bed and just keeping reading it to the very end. There was great detail about the life that Jane Eyre and all the feeling she felt were revealed to the reader. I seemed to really be part of the story and sometimes forgot where I was. There were also some amazing twists in the story that kept me guessing about who did that or why is that women so suspicious. There was also many characters that kept the story alive and interesting. Although, once and awhile it did seem as though the story was confusing. Things were being said and I was not quite sure who was saying them and places I was not quite sure what was going on. Although, with some of this negativism, everything else made up for it. All and all, it was a really good book. For me, it seems to reflect back on today's life. All Jane was doing was trying to find acceptence, love, and happiness. It seems at this day an age, that all people are trying to do is find true love and someone to be there. For this reason, I think that many of you would really love this book and read it. The novel is well worth the reading. I am sure that once you began the story that you will just want to keep reading it to find out if Jane really does find what she is looking for and if she finds true happiness. Now it is you turn to go to your library and check out this great classical novel that you are just going to love.The grade I would give this book would be about a low grade A because sometimes it was confusing. Highly recommended for people who like drama and romance."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"Reading Jane Eyre for the first time, I was engulfed in the novel itself: the characters, the plot, and the setting completely draw the reader's attention and make it difficult to put down. The second time, I read it slower, paying special attention to the characterization, something Charlotte Bronte is terrific at, and the various details that I may have overlooked originally, but which add to the general enjoyment of the novel. The third time, I read Jane Eyre for the language - Bronte's style is captivating: every word, every sentence has a beauty within it that a reader wouldn't want to miss. I read it, again and again, because her words made everything seem new and exciting no matter how often I read them. The explicit descriptions, the prolonged narration, the time she takes to develop the charaters - everything creates a novel that one can read over and over.

Mr. Rochester, a sardonic, bitter man, accepts Jane as governess to his ward; from there their feelings begin to develop for each other. Mr. Rochester is not the conventional hero (one might even imagine him to be an ugly man), which makes the tale more believable (and thankfully steers it away from bodice-ripping romantic territory).All in all, this is a great book with the usual plot twists, reversals, and character revelations one would expect from its genre."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"After reading this story, I feel safe and sound, a large genuine feeling.

Please, don t waste your time."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"I read this book in junior high school and, like so many other girls, fell head over heels in love with Mr. Rochester; after all this time, the book is still a terrific read. The first part is classic Cinderella with an interesting twist. Jane is an orphan who is abused and mistreated by her rich and evil stepmother and her nasty cousins; unlike Cinderella, Jane stands up age age 10 and fights back. She is promptly shunted off to a school for girls from poor families, where she spends the next eight years. Needing a change of scene and environment, she answers an advertisement for a governess and enters the household of Mr. Rochester. Rochester, however, is no Prince Charming; he's 17 or 18 years older than Jane, hard, bitter, cynical, selfish, and, unknown to all but a few, encumbered with a wife who is the prototype of the \\"mad wife in the attic\\". Rochester is a romantic at heart, however; he is captivated by Jane's innocence and simplicity.Many years' distance from junior high school has led me to re-think the entire creation of Mr. Rochester. When all is said and done, he's a very curious romantic hero. In fact, this guy is a world-class jerk. What kind of \\"hero\\" would deliberately try to trap an innocent young girl into a sham marriage? He makes all kinds of rationalizations to himself that his Maker will understand and approve of what he's doing, but come on, now, who is he kidding? Imagine an alternative plot line midway through the book: Jane doesn't write to her uncle in Madeira, so he remains ignorant of the planned wedding. He doesn't send anyone to England to prevent it, so the wedding goes off as scheduled. Five years and two or three children later, Jane finds out about Rochester's first marriage. Can you imagine how she would feel? Her marriage is a sham and her children are illegitimate. What would she say? How would she react? And how would Mr. Rochester feel knowing he had brought this calamity on her by his own selfishness? I don't know about war, but all is definitely not fair in love. Mr. Rochester is a selfish ess-oh-bee.Anyway, the alternative never happened an we all know how the book really comes out so there is no sense in rehashing the plot; suffice to say that Bronte is a marvelous storyteller. The one problem I really have with Jane Eyre is the same that arises in Bronte's other books, and that is her stifling insularity; she seems unable to find value in anything that outside her own narrow, English Protestant frame of reference. However, this is a small caveat in this book. \\"Jane Eyre\\" is a classic romantic novel that has entranced generations of readers and looks good for generations to come, flawed hero and all.Judy Lind"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"I first read &quot;Jane Eyre&quot; when I was entering my sophomore year in high school. I was so fascinated by the beautiful language, expressing the love between Jane and Edward Rochester. I love Edward so much, because he is human. He is depressed with his life, and wishes for another. He searched for another, taking any and every risk he needs to...even adultery or bigamy. His love for Jane is deep and real, as is her love for him. This classic hasn't lost it's details, details about hope, love, and dreams, in the some 150 years since it's been published. I still enjoy it, even after reading it about 100 times!!~ I consider it the greatest love story ever written.....a story that defies the stuffy rules and regulations of 19th century England. It just shows that love can be more powerful than anything. With that, I give this story 5 stars....only wishing I could give it all the stars in the world. Why?

But when I got older, and could read at my own pace and place, the book is one of the best mysteries ever written. I can't imagine going to a horrible school like Lowood, but perhaps that was preferable to living with her Aunt Reed, a most disagreeable person even unto her death. I cried when she and Mr. Rochester could not get married because of the 'house secret'. She seemed to have such a hard life anyway, that was icing on the cake, or de-icing if you will. The book flowed smoothly and I even managed to get past the 'true English'. I've always had trouble reading English writers, but Charlotte Bronte is an exceptional writer. I like when she addresses her audience, &#34;Reader, you would not believe this but...&#34;, etc. As I said it's a great mystery, and autobiography, but I don't want to say more to spoil the story! Chance it to say, if you've only read the book because, 'you had to', read it again in a new light.

It sure doesn't have to be, though, if you read from a larger perspective.To fully appreciate today's world, it helps to understand the attitudes and experiences of the past, and JANE EYRE is one of the novels that helps us understand.The book takes an orphaned girl taken in by an unloving aunt, and follows her into an unhappy school experience and ultimately into as good a career as a woman of that time and station could hope for, that of governess.Well, this is one of the earliest gothic novels and true to the genre, you know the girl's going to fall in love with her employer who, unfortunately, has a deep and dark secret.There's tragedy of sorts here and there's triumph, all told against the mores of a bygone era. There's much to learn and to enjoy here if you open up to it. It is dated, and not 100% relevant to today's life, which is why I give it four rather than five stars.It may be helpful to read and compare JENNA STARBORN to JANE EYRE. The former pales horribly by comparison, but by setting the story in the future, today's reader may gain a better understanding of the original story."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"I will be honest, the first fifty pages of Bronte's &quot;Jane Eyre&quot; are tough to get through, the story moves slowly as Bronte sets up the plot and introduces us to many of the major characters.

Jane is unlike other girls, she describes herself as plain and boring and after leaving Lowood, she decides to take on the job of governess at Thornfield Hall.This brief synopsis is all that happens during the first part of the novel, but after this, Bronte creates a story that is mesmerizing and full of intriguing symbolism and a surprise plot twist at the end that was completely unexpected. I loved Bronte's play on names: Jane Eyre, Helen Burns, Mrs. Fairfax, Thornfield Hall, etc. The scenes between Jane and Mr. Rochester are at once heartbreaking and romantic, including my favorite scene in the garden (the details of which I will not give away).It's easy to be tempted to give up on 'Jane Eyre' because of the slow beginning, but once Jane begins her job as governess, the novel comes alive as Bronte weaves the intricate plot that is full of joy, sorrow and bizarre occurrances."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"A true classic, I found an old copy in my mothers house and devoured this book one hot summer. It has been made into several motion pictures, the most recent of which being in 1996 starring William Hurt.The heroine of the novel, Jane Eyre, ends up in a strict boarding school after her parents die and her only living relative, and aunt, can no longer stand her 'wickedness'. She endures hardships at school, and the school mistress tries to dampen her passion and opinions.Jane does not lose her spirit, she merely hides it behind her plain face and grows into a proper lady of her station. She graduates from school and takes on a position as a tutor for a young French girl, the ward of a Mr. Rochester. She is given a room in his large house the likes of which she has never seen in her former spartan existance. She falls in love with the little girl as well as Mr. Rochster.Rochester is hiding a tragic secret however. One that he kept from Jane and everyone else for many years. The truth is finally exposed and Jane is heartbroken. This, however is not the end of our tale. Their love does not die, and the end of the novel is poignant and romantic.

Well here's one! I am 23 years old and have just finished it for my literature class, but it's not unprobable I would have read it otherwise anyway, sience it is a classic. Anyway, I first of all think it was very well written with a fluent language. The main reason why I enjoyed it so much, though, is because of the way the writer seems to understand and symphatise with her characters (which are all very real), even for the ones that have faults she condemns. You might think I, being a man (or a boy), could not identify with Jane, but in many ways I could. Maybe because Charlotte Bront is so superb in making her literal world coming alive, that I almost feel I'm there myself, or maybe just because Jane Eyre is the kind of person you'd want to be."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"Jane Eyre is a plain woman in looks, but her intelligence, strength, and feistiness make her a heroine who I think gives much-needed justice to women of her time. She is a spitfire who makes you want to know her and hear her story, and she tells it in a clear, first-person fashion that makes it an easy story to read.Orphaned at a young age, Jane is sent to live with her aunt and cousins, who abuse Jane physically and mentally for ten years. Eventually ejected from her aunt's household on false charges of thievery, Jane is then packed off to Lowood, a charity boarding school whose conditions were deplorable; students were scarcely provided with food and clothing (think Oliver Twist), and were regularly terrorized by the school's cruel headmaster. If that weren't enough, Jane's only real friend at Lowood dies during an outbreak of Typhus.Fast-forward eight years - Jane, still nearly penniless after a two-year stint as a teacher at Lowood, ventures out to make a life for herself as a governess. Her charge is a precocious French child named Adele, with whom she develops a fast friendship. But the real story of Eyre lies in her relationship with the child's foster parent, Mr. Rochester, the dolefule, aloof, yet passionate and somewhat mysterious master of Thornfield. Despite their differing castes and the 20 years separating their ages, their feelings for each other grow deep, and they decide to marry. But it doesn't go exactly as Jane had planned - their wedding ceremony is stopped when it is revealed that Mr. Rochester is already married - to a madwoman whom he has kept locked up in one of Thornfield's bedrooms for years!Horrified, Jane flees Thornfield, ending up a beggar on the streets because she spent her entire savings to leave. Eventually taken in by a clergyman, St. John Rivers, and his two sisters, Jane makes a new life for herself as a teacher. During this time, Jane finds herself the sole heir of her father's estate. Soon after, St. John proposes marriage to her repeatedly, but Jane finds his cold demeanor lacking in comparison to the man she truly loves, Mr. Rochester. (She also finds out that St. John is actually her first cousin - a staple of this genre, it seems.) Prompted by hearing Rochester's voice calling her name during a prayer for guidance, Jane returns to Thornfield, only to find it burned down, and Mr. Rochester blinded by the fire his wife set before killing herself. Naturally, Jane and Mr. Rochester live happily ever after, but if you think this is merely another sappy love story (which I am no fan of!), you would be wrong. In Eyre, Charlotte Bronte shows us a depth and realness of characters which you would be hard-pressed to find in any other novel.Do yourself a favor by reading it - you'll understand why it's considered one of the finest examples of English literature."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"Charlotte Bronte's fine novel has been ill served by its thousands of formulaic romance imitators over the decades. Though it is the model for many a successor novel with an innocent heroine, a surly ugly-handsome hero with a secret, a big house with a monstrous creature in the attic, it confounds them all by having more substance and staying power than any.The love story at the heart of the novel must be founded on real experience, the depiction of the growing attachment between Jane and Rochester is so specifically poignant. The emotional crash and long period of recovery Jane suffers before she reunites with her beloved is also heart rendingly real to anyone who has ever suffered through such a loss. The gothic trappings of the story heighten the dreamlike intensity, but it is the solid reality at the foundation that make this novel stay and stay and stay.There's nothing cheap here about Janes sufferings and something magnificently strong about her victories. She does not just 'get her man.' She lives to be fully her best SELF. And this makes her triumph wholly honorable and beautiful.When I was 12 or 14 and first read this novel, I thought that I could never have forced myself to run away from the man I loved into the starving unknown. Jane's integrity -- not, by the way really principally a religious integrity, but rather an integrity of self -- knows that the man she loves truly would have come to despise her if she agreed to be a mistress. Author Bronte shows us this when she shows Rochester fantasizing taking Jane off to live with him 'on the Moon' . . . he knows himself that his project is merely a fairytale he's spinning to take himself away from his unpleasant reality.This very kind of confrontation between the integrity of self and the demands of the world she lives in--sometimes as a helpless child, and later as a strong willed but penniless runaway, and later still as a woman of independent means--tell the real under story of Jane Eyre that makes her a great heroine and the story a great novel and not just a cheap bodice ripper.Jane revisits every single scene of abuse, defeat and humiliation in her past, and through the strength of her own character, triumphs. Her cruel Aunt Reed, still a difficult and unkind woman on her deathbed, she quells with forgiveness; she outlives her miserable existence as a deprived child in an ill-conducted school, to become a teacher in that same school, reformed; her dark night of the soul and self-exile from her love is a time of utter destitution that she manages to turn into a home, worthwhile work, an inheritance of fortune and family, and another proposal of marriage from an unexceptionably moral man. When she has achieved all this, NOT because she knows anything has changed back at Thornfield Hall, she feels free to obey her deepest self--the self governed most by love- and returns to see what is become of Mr. Rochester. Only when she really truly acts solely from desire and not from need, only when she has a place of her own to stand firm in the world, does she hazard her return. None of these scenes, the ones that I hurried over as a teenager to get to \\"Reader, I married him\\" merit a slurring glance. Jane is growing stronger all the time. She never, from first to last, changes a bit from that deep essential person who loves intensely and desires love returned more than anything. But she becomes clearer and more secure in her ability to live out that self, as she heals and strengthens the other wounded parts of her life.As it's a novel, there are grand coincidences that make it all work out. Read it through once and notice the role played by her Uncle John Eyre, who never appears in any scene, but operates, like Providence, from afar. He's prevented from helping her in time to ensure that she must seek her living as a governess, his vigilance intervenes when she's about to be falsely married, his benevolence finally comes through with an inheritance and relations just when she needs them most.This is a wonderful story, and even as I get older, it does not 'get old.'"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"\\"It is best to be yourself, imperial, plain and true.\\" Robert BrowningAnother chick Brit classic that I had been eluding since my teen-age years and finally got around to perusing this past month.

I have no idea why teachers continue to shove such classics as this down their student's throats when the great majority of their budding brains, inexperienced hearts and raging hormones make it virtually impossible to fully digest at such an age. However, that is a topic better tabled for another time...To describe this beautiful work as simply a love story would be doing it a grave injustice. While it is arguably one of the greatest love stories ever known in literature (I actually prefer \\"Jane Eyre\\" over her younger sister's classic \\"Wuthering Heights\\"), it is so, so, so much more than that. This 1847 masterpiece is an important history lesson as well on what it was like living in provincial England way back when. It touches upon such common themes as morality, religion, gender relations, Social status, friendship, education, etc... A story such as this can relate so much more about the past than most text books will ever tell us, while at the same time making the whole learning experience a joy as well.Of all the past heroines I have had the pleasure (or sometimes the disdain) of being introduced to through my literary travels, it is almost impossible to think of one that possessed a bigger heart and more passionate soul than C. Bronte's Jane Eyre. I found her to be much more interesting and even brighter than James' Isabel Archer, without the latter's pretentiousness. She is way more down-to-earth and less judgmental than Austen's Elizabeth Bennet. She is much more grounded and has a much stronger backbone than Hardy's Tess. However, what really separates her from all the other heroic belles of invention is simply her burning, incessant quest to find love and to be loved in return. Not just romantic love, like Flaubert's Emma B. and Tolstoy's Anna K. but REAL sustaining love, the kind that brings value and a sense of belonging. The sincere kind that comes from not having to sacrifice (as the above mentioned did) one's own principles and ethics. It is this noble and true love that never dies or withers, because it is genuine and magnanimous, without any kind of contrivances whatsoever. Jane never sold out and held steadfast to her beliefs and values, and in the end, well... you'll have to discover that on your own!You don't need me to rehash the book's plot. You can read other people's reviews to do that. All you need to know is one thing - if you haven't had the pleasure yet of meeting Ms. Eyre and you love literature, then please do yourself a favor and order this one today. If this isn't a five-star classic, then I'm afraid I don't know what is!"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"Jane Eyre, by Charlotte Bronte, is an enticing Victorian love story of a young woman as she grows and matures. The plot made me want to read so I could find out what happens. The characters have realistic feelings and thoughts, which made me sympathize and feel with them. Even though I thoroughly enjoyed this book, I often found myself re-reading a paragraph so I could fully understand what I had just read. These long paragraphs, however, did not stop me from reading forward and liking the book.I would recommend this novel to late high school and college students. Girls who gravitate toward love stories with sweet sentiments might find the tale of Jane Eyre more enjoyable than others who are not such romantics."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"It's hard to imagine a better gothic romance than \\"Jane Eyre\\" -- gloomy vast houses, mysterious secrets, and a brooding haunted man with a dark past.In fact, Charlotte Bronte's classic novel has pretty much everything going for it -- beautiful settings, a passionate romance tempered by iron-clad morals, and a heroine whose poverty and lack of beauty only let her brains and courage shine brighter.

Jane is treated less as a part of the family, and more of a servant in her aunt's household. Dragged into the room of her uncle's death, for fighting with her cousin John Reed, and suffers a mental breakdown. Doctors suggest that Jane be sent to the Lowood Boarding School for Girls. The school proves to be of little comfort to as she finds that the conditions there, under the brutal Mr. Brocklehurst, are barely an improvement on her living conditions at home. The school embracing the poverty as way of life and the girls barely getting by was completely under the thumb of Mr. Brocklehurst. Jane's only relief from the burden of hardships at the school is her dear friend Helen, a kind young girl, who imprints in Jane a measure of Christian patience for the pain, which she has endured in her childhood. An outbreak of typhus prompts many of the girls to leave, but Jane to remain as a teacher at the Lowood School. To expand her horizons, she accepts the position at Thornfield manor, caring for the sweet, French ward of the dark and brooding Mr. Rochester. Despite her best efforts to the contrary, Jane falls in love with her employer. What secrets lie in Thornfield manor? Why does Jane often feel like she isn't getting the whole story? As Jane begins to realize that things aren't as they appear in Thornfield, she is forced to leave the manor, her young pupil, and Mr. Rochester behind. But can she stay away from her true love for long?Jane Eyre is written by Charlotte Bronte, who was born on 21 April 1816. In 1824 Charlotte and her sisters were sent to the Clergy Daughters' School at Cowan Bridge. Within a year her sisters died of consumption and their father removed Charlotte and Emily from the school. The critical depiction of the school at Lowood in Jane Eyre drew on Charlotte's experiences at Cowan Bridge and her eldest sister, Maria, was the inspiration for the character of Helen Burns. In 1847 she published Jane Eyre under the pseudonym of Currer Bell. In 1854 she married Arthur Bell Nicholls and died shortly after due to complications with pregnancy.Jane Eyre is definitely a book everyone should consider reading. It helps define some many things including: love and independence. The entire time Jane pulls you on the emotional roller coaster of life. You go up and down with her through her love of Rochester. This book brings you into it so quickly that before you know it you are crying at the end too! And that's the kind of book you want, the kind that makes you feel like there is nothing quite as beautiful as the relationship between the characters. This book inspired me to read more from the entire Bronte collection."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"It's hard to imagine a better gothic romance than \\"Jane Eyre\\" -- gloomy vast houses, mysterious secrets, and a brooding haunted man with a dark past.In fact, Charlotte Bronte's classic novel has pretty much everything going for it -- beautiful settings, a passionate romance tempered by iron-clad morals, and a heroine whose poverty and lack of beauty only let her brains and courage shine brighter.

While the first couple of chapters are somewhat boring, after that the pace never flags, despite the 500-odd-page length. Many chapters in the book are very intense and moving, and it is not too hard to feel for Jane. I thought she might be a very righteous, prim-and-proper person, but was surprised and delighted to discover that she's very flirtatious with Rochester once they declare their love, and playfully delights in her hold over him. Their conversations are fascinating and very revealing. It is always clear that she is passionatly in love with him and no one else, but still more than willing to leave him once the &quot;terrible secret&quot; is revealed. While not quite as strong and feminist a character as I expected, she nonetheless does show an iron will and desperate desire to do what's right more than once. When someone in the book was talking about a Mr. Rochester and made it sound like he'd died, my heart literally stopped for a minute until I (and Jane) realized the man was talking about Rochester's father. That was near the end, and by then I'd become so caught up in it I really couldn't put it down. It is not just a romance novel for women; I'm a 13-year-old boy and I enjoyed it immensely.

(I'll get to him later, though) This is only the second novel I've read that has a main protagonist that is quite similar to me in personality, which is refreshing in itself. (Most novels have spirited, strong-willed people as the main character--not that it's wrong, it just gets boring after around 500 readings.) I identify with Jane because in many ways, for she acts and reacts as I would in her situation. And Mr. Rochester....I fell in love with him with the first chapter I read (which was Chapter 27; I cheated) and have not stopped since. *Sigh, Giggle*These characters are so brilliantly drawn out--no other classic has done a better job of making me feel as if these characters are dynamic people.The prose sparkles--especially Mr. Rochester's, who I find has the gift of turning me into a pile of mush.In short, this is the best classic I've ever read, and the only one that I will definitely read over again and again and again.....(The only one that came close was Pride and Prejudice) No other story has made feel as this one did--this gothic story of passion and love captivates me and will continue to do so.P.S. The only problem I had with Jane's character is when my darling Edward is singing to her, and she is fairly unaffected. I was sobbing on the floor and yelling at Jane at why she was not doing the same thing. Any one else feel the same way?PPS: Some people might say that she is strong and strong-willed, but she is not. Rather, she is strong-principled. She does not have to have her own way, but when it comes to God's way, she is more spirited about it.PPPS: And I am not Dwight Rhodes. I'm his daughter.

I even seem to recall an abridged comicbook version of Jane Eyre. I read the novel when I was 12 years old and was so inspired by it that I read it over many times that year, and never, never forgot it. Interestingly, I am now reading it for the first time since. I have little to add to the other reviews here, but recommend this book to everyone! The author develops Jane's tremendous character, childhood to young adulthood, with economy and care. The early chapters of the book are both painful and lovely to read. The love story that follows is passionate and terribly hard fought. Told in the first person, much of what I experience reading this book, due to our author's skill, is not written on the page, but felt as my own experience. And Mr. Rochester is, if possible, a more brilliant revelation this time around. He is completely compelling and magnetic, humorous and desperate, and sympathetic. The book also provides a portrait of how life was at that time, by the aristocracy and the common man. I have edited this review to add my advice that if you have never read the book, whether or not you have seen any of the film versions, choose an edition without an added \\"forward,\\" or save comments for last, so that do not encounter spoilers and can form your own impressions.Reader, .... read Jane Eyre!"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"I loved Jane Eyre.

Eventually, she leaves this school and is employed by the mysterious Mr. Rochester, to care for his ward, Adele. Jane finds herself growing more fond of the man...and more curious about the mysterious circumstances surrounding his home.I have just finished listening to this audiobook, and I am still trying to pick my jaw up from the floor. WOW, just WOW. This was a positively amazing experience, a thrill and a joy, a pleasure from beginning to end. I haven't had this enjoyable a time listening to a historical/classic/romance novel since...well, \\"Gone with the Wind\\"! From characters to plot to story to setting, everything was a joy to unfold, and while I knew somewhat how the story would go, I was still thrown for loops and wondered if Jane would ever get her happily ever after.From the beginning, I knew Jane was interesting and different. She may have been plain, but she was relatively well behaved, curious, and intelligent. Throughout the entire book, Jane grows and develops as a person. She pushes for her own destiny and does not let others tell her what to do--and in her day and age, that is remarkable. She puts up with her cousins until self-respect tells her not to. She begs to be put into school away from her relatives. She deals with the hardships of school, knowing things would be worse in her adoptive home. She is studious, becoming a teacher, and when she learns she can make more money being a governess, she leaves her job. While working for Mr. Rochester, she never forgets her pupil, she remains cordial and appropriate in front of Mr. Rochester, and when she is called back to her aunt's side, she gives the dying woman forgiveness. When Jane learns of Mr. Rochester's secret, she doesn't succumb to what she sees as sin, but leaves even though it could mean starvation and hard work. When Rev. Rivers tries to coerce her into going with him to India, she refuses to accept his temrs and presents her own. Time and again, Jane proves to be independent, smart, and moral--something many a modern protagonist that supposedly is these things could take a lesson in.Our secondary characters are painted with equal care and detail. Jane's aunt and cousins are horrible, and they grow up to be horrible people (well, sort of). I grieved when Helen died; I fell in love with Mr. Rochester alongside Jane; I was devastated at his secret; I loved being with Mary and Diana; I bristled at Rev. Rivers' cold attitude. All in all, the cast is well-crafted and enjoyable.I knew the big secret of the story before hand, but I didn't know how or if Jane ever got to be with her beloved Mr. Rochester. I was kept on the edge of my seat the entire time, wondering how Bronte would pull it off. I was shocked at what happened to Mr. Rochester's manor AND Mr. Rochester. Most authors nowadays wouldn't DARE damage their major characters so permanently and so obviously!The descriptions are long and sometimes laborious, though it paints Jane's surroundings beautifully. I also found myself getting bored in the last third (where Jane hangs out with Diana and Mary) and found some of the circumstances of that part to be a bit hokey (no spoilers!). Also, apologies in advance, but the narrator (Josephine Bailey) was particularly bland and almost sounded like those automated computer voices you get when calling your bank or Fedex or some other big business. Her voice was clear and precise, but had almost no emotion and was very dry. A few hours of listening to that voice drained me.This book is excellent, much better, in my opinion, than Charlotte's sister's book, \\"Wuthering Heights\\", which seemed more of a study on how not to fall in love . This is a real, true romance story with real, true obstacles populated with real, true characters. I definitely enjoyed it and recommend it highly.Brought to you by:*C.S.

My only complaint would be that sometimes the book dragged in parts. However, it was still a pleasure to read. Jane is a admirable heroine and I loved everything about her. I truly cared about what happened to her which I haven't been able to do with books I've read. Rochester's and Jane's love was deep and pure and I loved watching them go through the process of falling in love. It wasn't an OMG-I-don't-know-anything-about-you-but-I-love-you-like-crazy thing that I've been reading lately. It was slow but sure and so very sweet. Their difference in age was strange to me at first, but as time went on I found myself not caring. Love really knows no bounds.I love this book. It is definitely near the top of my favorite books. The story, dialogue, and cast of characters all went together. Every character in this story has depth. They're not stale, cardboard cut-outs.Anyway, I definitely recommend this book. It's one of my favorites."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"Bronte was so descriptive that I had no problems picturing what she described. I loved the complexities of the relationships. I never knew what was going to happen next."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"Jane Eyre is Charlotte Bronte's first novel, published under the pen name of Currer Bell. Jane Eyre, orphaned at a very young age, suffers at the hands of her aunt and cousins when her maternal uncle dies. At the age of ten, she is sent to a charity boarding school, where her life is also filled with privation until an outbreak of typhus exposes the austere measures imposed by the manager of the school. At the age of eighteen, she leaves the school to become a governess to Mr Edward Fairfax Rochester's ward, Ad&egrave;le. Here, Jane seems to find happiness: beneath Mr Rochester's moody exterior, there appears to be kindness and perhaps even love? But further events may destroy her chance at happiness.The use of words that seem to be nowadays obsolete, such as: unclose (doors etc); undraw (curtains); undeceive; benignant; show how much can change in a language in a mere 200 years. Described as a classic, it is easy to see why Jane Eyre is one of the most unforgettable of English novels."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"Loved the language and thought.

Jane Eyre is a great character."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"I have reread this book countless times, starting after I first discovered it as a teen. It is a masterful piece of storytelling and the classic romance novel. I hope purists aren't offended by that classification, but Bronte's novel has all the traditional elements of a romance novel -- the meet, the attraction, the obstacles, the Black Moment, the reunion, the HEA (happily ever after) -- wrapped in beautiful writing and characterizations.Although this book has been popular through the ages, it seems to fall in the shadow of the other Jane today. That is, the author Jane Austen, whose works are told and retold in every conceivable way. I sometimes wonder if Austen gets a lot of glory today because she is perceived as a more intellectual read while EYRE is a big, fat, juicy Gothic romance. So unfair if that is true. Bronte's story is clever and intelligent, but also passionate and emotional.If anyone's interested, I've written a book inspired by JANE EYRE but set in old Hollywood.

This book shows a wide range of human experience. I do not think that Jane has to prove anything simply because she is &#34;plain&#34;. I also don't think that Charlotte Bronte had anything to prove.

And of course, the romance between Mr. Rochester and Jane was so beautiful. I wanted someone to love me like that one day!I love how she was able to stand up for herself to Mrs. Reed her cruel aunt, the evil Mr. Brocklehurst, her self-righteous and controlling cousin St. John, and even her beloved Mr. Rochester when he would have her go against her moral fiber.It was wonderful to learn more about Charlotte and her life and how much shows up in her novel.

Susan Ericksen narrates the audio book and the listening experience was something I looked forward to on my daily commute. The narrator had an excellent speaking voice and sounded just like what I would have expected from Jane Eyre. Her characterizations of the other characters were not as dramatic as I would have liked, though she did a good job with the \`master'. I'm getting used to good characterizations since it makes it easier to follow who is speaking. Overall, I would rate the audio book at 4.5 stars instead of 5 due to the characterization issue.The story itself is wonderful. The main characters are very likeable despite their flaws. It's fun to see the main characters be rather homely instead of amazingly good looking as is common in many novels. It is a beautiful love story and shows strong integrity in Jane. In these days it is good to see this type of values in the heroines and heroes of the story.I highly recommend this audio book.

After the second reading, the reader learns to appreciate the beautiful language and wonderful plot devises that make for a ripping good story.

Some people may be put off by the fact that Jane felt like her life wasn't worth living without a man, but that's the way things were in that era. And hey it is really kind of a modern tale because Rochester did after all have a wife, which didn't stop him from falling for Jane. And he lied to her about his wife, and almost marries her while still already married. And that certainly seems to be common these days, maybe Bronte was just ahead of her time. After all, he sounds like a pretty intense and hot guy, so Jane can't be faulted for falling for him. In any case, this is one of those totally romantic and dramatic books.

After years of being emotionally and physically abused by her aunt and cousins she was finally allowed to go to school. However going to school didn't improve her standard of living much. Jane began to feel that there was something else out there for her so she took a job as governess at Thornfield Hall. Everything was going well until she fell in love with her employer, Mr. Rochester.Jane Eyre is one of my absolute favorite books. I just really love all the characters and the dramatic plot twists. A lot of people who read this book just think it's a romance novel. While it is true that Romance plays a large part, the book is much more than just your run of the mill romance. People who are able to get the \`just a romance novel' idea out of their heads will see that the book is more about a woman trying to find a better life against great odds."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"Jane Eyre may seem at first to be a boring 19th century novel, but in truth it is a fantastically rich book. There are so many great aspects in the novel. The characters are developed very well. Even though the author was limited in her knowledge because as a woman she was limited with education, each of the characters is portrayed well enough that he/she becomes real in the reader's mind. Interestingly, but not surprisingly, the women characters are more developed and are more various than the men characters. The men in the book are shown to use women and they are not as diverse, but they are still interesting and realistic. Another great aspect is how well the author intertwined themes of social and financial classes, feminism, and faith and philosophy. Some of the ideas are easy to see without having to think about them, such as how money creates the biggest separation of classes. However, some of the philosophical ideas in the book are much deeper and harder to see and comprehend. The ideas are also not from our time period and are, therefore, harder for us to understand than they were for the readers of the author's time period. For example, the idea of how nature protects us and watches over us to make sure the right things happen to us at the right time is a intricate and remarkable concept.Jane Eyre does have one major flaw, though, and that is the plot. It is an interesting plot and easy to understand, but it is too much like a fairytale. Everything works out almost too perfectly, and seems to be coincidental. The plot helps the theme of how nature makes sure things happen, but it is too planned out. One almost expects to see the all too typical line, \\"And they lived happily ever after\\" at the end of the book. This flaw with the plot would only be seen by readers of our time because we are use to reading books with multifaceted plots, whereas in the time the book was written, people were happy just to read such a developed novel. Even with this flaw, still, it is a great book. While Jane Eyre won't go on my favorites list to read again and again, it was definitely a novel worth reading."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"Set in England of the 1600's Jane Eyre's life story is told through her own perspective, aging throughout the novel. Her thoughts and feelings from early childhood through where she is in life writing the book are told with a grace that comes only from life experience. Jane Eyre is from the time of her earliest memories an orphan. In this book she finds love, acceptance, and herself. Charlotte Bronte's talent for bringing out all sides of a character is shown well in this book, she leaves nothing to be desired as far as rounding out her characters. Such characters as Mr. Rochester who first shows Jane true love, Mrs. Fairfax who helps her to understand her equality to others, and Adele Varens who helps her remember childlike wonder as she goes through her life changing experiences, all play a part in Jane coming into herself. This book is an inspiration and I would highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys a good story.Attention was drawn to the dramatic separation of the classes during the time the book was set it. Jane Eyre is an orphan, and therefore frowned upon by all as a dependent and a burden, almost no one expects her to do anything valuable with her life. This remearkable young woman pushed for the right to be sent to school, then ater her graduation stayed on as a teacher, after a mentor and only tie to the school left she advertised herself out as a governess. This was by no uncertain terms a grand achievement for someone born of such a position in the world. Although a governess was not the highest position during her time, she made due with the job and eventually found another window of opportunity. She fell in love with the master of the house and was asked for her hand in marriage. Certain events delay this already unseemly arrangement before true happiness is found.Many readers and critics alike have compared this story very closely to Cinderella. The plots are similar, however, they are not quite the same. Jane Eyre, born an orphan, falls in love with her version of &quot;Prince Charming,&quot; coming to her in the form of an employer. This idea of romance found in hte most unlikely of places with the most unattainable of people is a common thread through many modern works. This kind of fairy tale is appealing to a broad audience and almost any age. However, the level of reading that Jane Eyre is written for would suggest an age group of 12 through adults.This novel left me both uplifted and very impressed with the style of writing that Chalotte Bronte has. The novel's use of separation in social classes to cause a stir and engage the reader's attention to the romance of Jane Eyre and Mr. Rochester is brilliant. Most people would say that the book is a basic take off of the age old tale of Cinderella, but in all actuality it is a beautifully mastered knowledge of the romantic ideals of many young women. I would remcommend this book to the age group of 12 through adults, this novel is also geared mainly towards women, although it would be a wonderful read for those men in the world who have a taste for this genre. Over all the book was a success, a literary masterpiece that has forever more left it's mark on our society as a classic."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"I've never been a reader but I joined a book club and this was the book of the month. I was very sure that I would never be able to read one of the classics and that I would be bored to tears. To my delight and surprise, this novel far surpassed any expectations I ever had. I was hooked from the beginning and looked for any opportunity to get away to read the book. It is not a fast read as the language was a big difficult at times but I learned to overlook the things that weren't so important to me and get on with the story. I have read two more classics since this novel and although Jane Eyre was my favorite, I am now a full fledged reading junkie."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"Jane Austen wrote the romantic stories. Dickens did the rags-to-riches heartwarmers. Mary Shelley added the supernatural, haunting yet human Frankenstein. Bronte's Jane Eyre pulls elements from all of these works and ends up... something entirely, refreshingly different.What's really great about this book is that it is so rich. The plot moves and moves well, making it an enjoyable and propelling read. While it is mostly romantic-love interest based, it is not as sappy or predictable as, say, Pride and Prejudice. Jane's journey to marital bliss is a bit more pock-marked -- and even drawn into question -- than in most romantic comedies. I enjoyed the fact that, indeed, she questions whether she even wants to marry or should marry -- and refuses to marry, not once but twice, because doing so would compromise who she is.Which brings me to the real reason I like this book and consider it a cut above most. Jane herself is so interesting. She is a very complex character, and the author has clearly taken much time and energy to draw in fine detail the map of her psychosis. This book is re-readable because there is so much to contemplate and reflect on within this finely drawn character. Is she afraid of happiness? Tied to duty? Was it right, or misguided, to leave Mr. Rochester? If it was right, were here intentions right? Was it right to return to him? What changes that allows her to refuse St. John, and return to Rochester?I think Ms. Bronte did us a great favor with this book. She took familiar ground and tweaked it -- taking the romantic comedy formula, so mastered by Austen and Thackeray, in which the tension entirely surrounds marriage, the meeting and mating of two people, and the point of the novel is resolved when the marriage(s) occur. Working within that framework, Bronte brings us a character novel -- in which the tension is only resolved once the character has found a way to be fully who she is, and thus happy and fulfilled. Surely this work broke ground for some of my very favorite works, in which plot becomes a somewhat secondary consideration and the eccentricities of character, the stuff of humans, becomes the focus and point of the novel.

It is arranged for Jane to be sent to Lowood School, a boarding school fifty miles away. At Lowood, the food is scarce, living conditions are poor, and they have no coats or mittens to keep them warm. Typhus plagues the school, killing Jane's only true friend, Helen. Jane's academics thrive, and after six years she takes the place of a teacher. Two years later Jane places an ad in the Herald, which is answered by a single letter. Jane travels 16 miles to find that she is the new teacher to Edward Rochester's foster child. By the second month she is there, Jane comes to be quite fond of her pupil, Adele Varens, and she is beginning to be aware of how she cares for Mr. Rochester. As she spends more time at Thornfield, Jane's affection for Rochester deepens, as he pursues Blanche Ingram. Jane leaves Thornfield shortly to visit Mrs. Reed, her dying aunt. Mrs. Reed confesses that John Eyre, Jane's uncle has been trying to locate her, but Mrs. Reed discouraged him. She then dies, unloved by even her daughters. Jane returns to Thornfield and is immediately proposed to by Rochester. During their wedding ceremony, Mr. Briggs stands up and proclaims that Mr. Rochester is already married. Jane is then shown to the third floor of Thornfield, where Bertha Mason Rochester, Rochester's wife is locked away. Jane flees Thornfield and uses all her money for transportation. She finds herself reduced to begging and is invited into the home of St. John Rivers, a minister. She recuperates from the trauma in her life under the care of him and his two sisters Mary and Diana. Jane accepts a job as a teacher in a local school. She soon discovers that John Eyre has left her with 20,000 pounds, which she openly shares with St. John and his sisters. St. John proposes to her but Jane repeatedly refuses; she does not love him. In turning down St. John she realizes she is still in love with Rochester. She gets news that Bertha Rochester jumped off the roof and killed herself during a fire that blinded her husband. Jane heads to Ferndean, Rochesters present home, and they reunite and plan to marry. The next time we hear from Jane again is ten years later. Rochester has regained sight in one eye and they have a newborn son. This book ends on a happy note with Jane telling us how contented she is with her present life.I found this book to be extremely thought- provoking. We see the trials and tribulations of a young girl who goes through so many hardships yet comes out a better person each time. I gave this book a five star rating because it expressed the life of a truly amazing young woman in a truly amazing way."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"I was shocked to see that many of the people who reveiwed this book gave it one star. It took me two days to read this book. I could'nt put it down! Jane is so down to earth and she refuses to feel sorry for herself, and do what she wanted to do the light of what others would suffer if she did. Her devoted love to Rochester was touching. When she discovered his sad secret, she did not follow her own fleshly desires, but left for the good of her lover, heartbroken, yet triuphant in knowing that she'd done what was right. Charlotte Bronte book is the best I've ever or ever will read. Those who rate this book 1 star need to reread it.:)"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"I am a young teen and although I have not lived long I have read some particularly muture books. When I decided to read Jane Eyre I thought it would be like all the others who have the same basic plot with immoral characters that make the same selfish decisions. But, I soon found out that I was wrong. Jane Eyre will awaken your senses and will leave you feeling like you know the characters. Unlike other books Jane Eyre is a book about intelligent decision making and moral. I feel that this book deserves another look at I hope that others will enjoy reading it as much as I do. By Heather Beers"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"Jane Eyre is one of the most beloved books ever written. Before I had read it, I attributed this to the many movies made of the plot, because I did not think a novel written in formal style by an author often paired with Jane Austen would appeal to the general public. I read it. It was as formal as expected, but different. There was imagination here, like a butterfly on a string, and the contents were Truth. Real Truth is interesting and thought-provoking no matter how presented. The style is a lot like Jane herself: a passionate, creative, romantic young woman, though shy and refined, introspective, rather plain, well brought-up and having strict, if select, morals. This may be in part due to the fact that the novel is written in first person, with Jane narrating. Jane is an incredible character; every word, every action, every thought makes sense, enhances and makes more real her being. All of the characters in Jane Eyre are this detailed, and all are completely different from the others, lending comparison essential to the reader's opinion of each, and of what Jane should do. Although some find the dialogue a bit improbable and fancy -- that no one speaks that way in real life -- I only had problems with that when acting it out. Admittedly, dialogue is at times long and too polished to be spontaneous, but the content of the spoken words makes up for it, and this type of dialogue does not dominate the entire book. Rapid, witty exchanges are just as common.The plot is original and dramatic; keep in mind that Jane Eyre in Ms. Bronte's day might be like Stephen King or Danielle Steel in our day. Jane Eyre is, essentially, a masterpiece soap opera, though a very elegant and refined one. It is a story of characters afflicted and tortured by the rules of society and the self-deprivations of morality and piousness. It is melodramatic and emotional, but not to the point of sogginess; crisper, tenser parts balance the sentimentalism. Suspense begins right away, but continues with something of a snowball effect, reaching its height near the end -- but this is only my opinion; many disagree with me. The one fault with the plot (I had no complaint, but it is my way to accept everything in a good book as Law) may be the frequent coincidences. Giving examples would spoil it for those who haven't read the book, but all contribute majorly to the plot, and all just cross the line between probability and unlikeliness. Critics have softened their accusations with the fact the Ms. Bronte believed in her coincidences, and had likely seen them happen.As a writer, Ms. Bronte is an virtuoso. She uses nearly every tool of the trade: extensive foreshadowing, including prophetic dreams, false suspects, symbolism, effective tense shifting, character analysis from a single point of view, and so much more. It is no surprise that the manuscript of Jane Eyre was accepted and published overnight, and became an immediate success. It is still a success a century and a half later, and as fresh and tangible as it always was. Reading Jane Eyre is an experience you cannot deprive yourself of. I would begin today."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"Jane Eyre is a beautifully written masterpiece! Bronte uses eloquent language to convey a timeless love story. The book was moving and profound, and I thouroughly loved it. I suggest it to everyone. It is a book not to be missed."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"I carried this book around with me after I finished readingit convincing others to read it as well.

If you say &quot;I read that in high school&quot;I urge you to read it again - this time by choice - and Iassure you, you'll be as swept away as I was!"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"At first glance, this book seems like the story of a lower class woman winning the heart of a rich and of a higher tier man. However, there is much more to the book than just a passionate romance. In addition it has been linked to have influenced Henry James, the author of The Turn of the Screw, also about a governess falling in love, but with some messed up consequences... sorry for the tangent. Anyways, Jane Eyre really is good, as Charlotte Bronte mixes Gothic elements with romance and focuses on a dynamic character who undergoes a bildungsroman and matures at the end of the book.Set in London, England, a stereotypical place for love, Charlotte does well in establishing the imagery of the fire between Mr. Rochester and Jane. She constantly uses colors to set the mood and uses it to set off feelings. Mainly, she appeals to our sense of cold and hot, to paint Jane's emotions, it is wonderfully aesthetic and should be a good read to those who enjoys language.Not only is her plot above average, and her literary devices superior, she is able to meld the two together flawlessly for those who love to read for storyline and those who enjoy a good analysis on what they read. By now one should get the tone from me that Jane Eyre is not your average romance novel. It is more than that. It also speaks of moral responsibility. This centers around the two protagonists love, as Rochester is still married, and kept it hidden. When Jane finds out, she is caught in a dilemma between her principles and her feelings. Unable to figure out a compromise she runs away. Only when Rochester redeems himself by trying to rescue his wife from a fire is he then able to prove to Jane that he has changed and is a candidate for her love. Conveniently, his wife dies in the fire, and Rochester is left crippled, but not permanently. This represents his forgiveness; he has repented for his sins and is now able to be married. The story ends with their marriage and Jane Eyre's epilogue.Charlotte Bronte is a very good author, able to appeal to both kinds of readers. With her brilliant use of figurative language, making Jane's decisions seem ever more desperate, and diction, which contributes to the overall gothic mood of terror, most readers will be enchanted by her work. However, it is also this aspect that makes the book lack it's wow factor, because it appeals to both, it does has to divide it's attention between plot and device.I would recommend this to anyone who has not read the book yet, so what are you waiting for?

Absolutely everybody would have known . . . this is not something you could have kept secret.And the whole thing with her saviors turning out to be distant relatives. Why didn't the younger me find this coincidence to be as cackhanded as I find it now? I guess my judgment must have been blinded on account of my being taken with myself for reading the classics . . ."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"I've had a like/dislike relationship with this book since my college days. All right- mostly dislike.Everyone knows the plot by now, since they at least watched the televised versions, so I'll be brief- neglected orphan who grows up with abusive aunt and cousins is sent to charity school, where she experiences more misfortunes, grows up to become a governess in a gothic countryside mansion and falls in love with her Byronic employer. Eventually she finds fortune and happiness through various plot twists, some completely implausible.I've read this book several times since I was 19 and seemed to dislike it more with each reading. I think that what has always put me off this book is Charlotte Bronte's prose. It's just so cumbersome and long-winded and I find the imagery and descriptions heavy-handed and awkward- sorry, when she describes the \\"bonny beck\\" I just don't feel it. I much prefer her sister Anne Bronte's simpler but clearer writing, not to mention Emily Bronte's masterful prose. Additionally, Charlotte is completely humorless. What passes as humor just isn't very funny. By contrast, again, Wuthering Heights has surprisingly funny moments for such a dark gothic tale, once again demonstrating Emily's superiority as a writer.I additionally dislike Jane--somehow, I can't feel much liking for her. I appreciate that Bronte broke the mold with having a poor, plain heroine, but it's stressed so frequently that it loses its effect. She was also stupendously blind not to suspect that maybe, just maybe, there's another person there with the stony-faced Grace Poole who was the source of that mad laughter. And Rochester is a manipulative git. He really is. And he says \\"Jane, Jane!\\" too much and has an irritating tendency to compare her to elves and fairies.What's most surprising is that St. John River is actually a much more interesting character than Rochester. He's a strikingly handsome, repressed ascetic who directs his passion to his religion. Nowadays he would have made either a splendid villain or a disillusioned hero. Rochester and his angst are boring by comparison.If you think that Bronte is a good writer I dare you, just dare you, to read any of her other works. \\"Shirley\\" is painful and I heard that \\"The Professor\\" isn't much better. The only work where I felt that Charlotte finally got a handle on her art was her last novel, the emotionally difficult and thereby much less popular \\"Villette.\\"The best thing about Jane Eyre are the television and movie productions. There's a million of them and I find myself compelled to watch every single one. So I guess there is still something in the story that appeals to me. This is why I give this book three stars rather than two."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"Jane Eyre is a young woman, grown from a rash girl in a harsh life and boarding school, working as a governess to a French girl. This is Bront's romance novel, though it is somewhat vague to call it that, for there is much more involved than just a petty romance. Through some sticky language, and some boring sections-whole chapters, even-Bront relays the life of Jane Eyre through Jane's own eyes tastefully and with flexible, rich language, stringing the reader along.We begin with Jane Eyre's childhood. Through some difficult wording, we find that Jane lives with her Reed cousins and aunt. Her Aunt Reed sees her as a vile child compared to her own vile children, who she sees with a golden halo above their heads. Jane is often tortured physically by Reed's children, while taking the brunt of anger and blame from her aunt. We are brought through the agonizing years of her childhood, making her a rash young girl with dreams of a new life, which comes in the form of a boarding school that she is to be sent to. With such a rush of feeling, she spills out her heart to her aunt about how she really feels, but at such the young and tender age of 10, begins to discover truths about the world that normal 10 year old children do, such as what vengeance and anger could bring about. As Bront describes the feelings and compares them to some rather unrelated things, \\"Something of vengeance I had tasted for the first time; as aromatic as wine it seemed, on swallowing, warm and racy: its after flavor, metallic and corroding, gave me a sensation as if I had been poisoned,\\" I gained a sense of familiarity, for of course, when I pursue revenge, it's often a cold and empty attempt, leaving me cold and empty as she describes.The boarding school is anything but lovely, but Jane often refers to it as better than her previous surroundings; of course, as I, the audience, felt, it was. She begins to accept the discipline and conform rather well to the strict rulings of Mr. Brocklehurst, and, lonely at first, finds someone that she can relate to - Helen Burns, who also often gets lost in her own fantasy world as Jane does. The next chapters are really just an explanation of time in the boarding school, and though rather boring, explained her transition from a brash young girl into something more disciplined. The only truly interesting thing I found in this piece of the book was how Bront utilizes the technique of the \`drop' sentence. To explain it, she builds and builds up to a heavy-impact event, and then uses one sentence to release the suspense, in a rather harsh way, making the impact of the shock all the stronger. In the end of her explanation of Jane's childhood, she uses this here: \\"\\"...my face against Helen Burns' shoulder, my arms round her neck. I was asleep and Helen was - dead.\\" Of course, one thinks that there would be much more of a draw out here to Helen, her best friend, dying, but really, it was just a dropped ball, and I found myself shocked. Even so, there was a good five chapters of useless plot that I found to be quite tiresome.As Jane herself transitions to the next chapters, she explains the things that happened the eight years after that that she stayed in the hall, and how things improved, she improved, etc. This seemed to be one of the least confusing parts of the book, since it was straightforward and not so tangled up in language. Either way, she decides that she needs a change from the boarding school that she now taught at, and advertises herself, quickly replied to for a young girl. She immediately accepts and takes her journey to Thornfield. She is to teach a little girl named Ad&egrave;le in a large manor in which the master never seems to be around. There is an in depth, albeit easy to skip over, description of the lavish home that she now resides in, and Jane quickly falls into the routine. Before Mr. Rochester, the owner or Thornfield and a main character, shows up, I enjoy the passage (and the many after them) when Jane falls into her own fantasy world and fails to realize that something is happening, like this, \\"...Bessie's Gytrash,-a lion-like creature with long hair and a huge head... with strange pretercanine eyes, in my face, as I half expected it would... The man...broke the spell all at once.\\" They often occur, but they're so shrouded in incomprehensible old language, usually, that I can't catch them until I realize that I haven't understood a thing I've read, and read it over again. Once Mr. Rochester shows up, the actually romance novel-esque story begins, the true heart of Bront's novel. The two begin to seduce and fall in love with one another, though not right away like in a woman's fantasy, but over time as if it did in reality. There are many events after this, but I've said enough already!Jane Eyre is an entertaining, albeit sometimes confusing and boring, read. This is more of a novel for a person with an in-depth knowledge of the English language (and perhaps a little French) and that's looking for a satisfying read. Bront places foreshadowing and certain events with elegance and not without reasoning, for those small events begin to fall into place for what comes in the end, but are something the reader may skip over, for they're shrouded behind a tangled language and wordy sentences."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"It's hard to imagine a better gothic romance than \\"Jane Eyre\\" -- gloomy vast houses, mysterious secrets, and a brooding haunted man with a dark past.In fact, Charlotte Bronte's classic novel has pretty much everything going for it -- beautiful settings, a passionate romance tempered by iron-clad morals, and a heroine whose poverty and lack of beauty only let her brains and courage shine brighter. And it's all wrapped in the misty, haunting atmosphere of a true gothic story -- madwoman in the attic and all.Jane Eyre was an orphan, abused and neglected first by relatives, then by a boarding school run by a tyrannical, hypocritical minister. But Jane refuses to let anyone shove her down -- even when her saintly best friend dies from the wretched conditions.But many years later, Jane moves on by applying to Thornfield Hall for a governess position, and gets the job. She soon becomes the teacher and friend to the sprightly French girl Adele, but is struck by the dark, almost haunted feeling of her new home.Then she runs into a rather surly horseman -- who turns out to be her employer, Mr. Rochester, a cynical, embittered man who spends little time at Thornfield. They are slowly drawn together into a powerful love, despite their different social stations -- and Rochester's apparent attentions to a shallow, snotty aristocrat who wants his wealth and status.But strange things are happening at Thornfield -- stabbings, fires, and mysterious laughter. Jane and Rochester finally confess their feelings to each other, but their wedding is interrupted when Rochester's dark past comes to light. Jane flees into the arms of long-lost family members, and is offered a new life -- but her love for Rochester is not so easily forgotten...\\"Jane Eyre\\" is one of those books that transcends the labels of genre. Charlotte Bronte spun a haunting gothic romance around her semi-autobiographical heroine and Byronic anti-hero, filling it with brilliant writing and solid plot. It has everything all the other gothic romances of the time had... but Bronte gave it depth and intensity without resorting to melodrama.Bronte wrote in the usual stately prose of the time, but it has a sensual, lush quality, even in the dank early chapters at Lowood. At Thornfield, the book acquires an overhanging atmosphere of foreboding, until the clouds clear near the end. And she wove some tough questions into Jane's perspective -- that of a woman's independence and strength in a man's world, of extreme religion, and of the clash between morals and passion.And Bronte also avoided any tinges of drippy sentimentality (Mrs. Reed dies still spewing venom) while injecting some hauntingly nightmarish moments (\\"She sucked the blood: she said she'd drain my heart\\"). She even manages to include some funny stuff, such as Rochester disguising himself as an old gypsy woman.The story does slow down after the abortive wedding, when Jane flees Thornfield and briefly considers marrying a repressed clergyman who wants to go die preaching in India. It's rather boring to hear the self-consciously saintly St. John prattling about himself, instead of Rochester's barbed wit. But when Jane departs again, the plot speeds up into a nice, mellow little finale.Bronte did a brilliant job of bringing her heroine to life -- as a defiant little girl who is condemned for being \\"passionate,\\" as an independent young lady, and as a woman torn between love and principle. Jane's strong personality and wits overwhelm the basic fact that she's not unusually pretty. And Rochester is a brilliantly sexy Byronic anti-hero with a prickly, mercurial wit.Of Charlotte Bronte's few novels, \\"Jane Eyre\\" is undoubtedly the most brilliant -- passionate, dark and hauntingly eerie. Definitely a must-read."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"I first read this book when I was about 15 and I loved it. I love Mr Rochester and the playful way he has about acting with Jane. I loved the way their love was the perfect romantic love, not Mills and Boon but a more sedate, beautiful, mature love.As an afterthought though it has shaped my view of love and at 17 am shocked to find out that most people's idea of love is a prenup and till death to you part while I have a view of love as never part and don't need a prenup because you should love someone so much that you couldn't consider getting divorced.

I read it when I was in seventh grade and have read again at least once a year and I'm now in 12th grade. Each time I read it, I understand it better and the love and depth of emotions of Jane and Mr. Rochester becomes so overwhelming. When I saw that 3rd and seventh graders were reading it and finding it \\"odd\\" at times, and boring perhaps, it's because of the age thing. You've got to wait a few years and read it again. Trust me, after all those idiotic teen movies, you'll develop a priceless love for Jane Eyre. The only book I've ever found that was so harshly honest and real was Gone With the Wind. And that book I really don't recommend to young readers. I've once saw a reviewer say Jane Eyre wasn't original at all and the parts that were original were bad. I can't possibly fathom how J.E. isn't original. This book is one of the few books in the world where a normal, poor, average girl finds love that usually happens to supermodel types (Dickens was a big fan of the supermodel love). Jane's life has been anything been peachy, but she has the courage and determination to make the most of everything and let bygones be bygones, and she does. If anyone deserves love like Jane and Edward's, it's the both of them. And even in books and movies of the 21st century you'll rarely see a girl as independent as Jane.

Even though this was written so long ago - you can see how Jane is an equal match for modern women, who do not think that they need others to take care of them. The prose are beautifully written and even though I have seen three of the films, many times, the book is even better. The story takes you through Mr Rochester and on to her finding herself.

Jane Eyre. New York: Penguin Books, 1996 (reprint edition). Genre: Classic Victorian literature; gothic romance and suspense. Age range: Middle school to adult.It is sad that only mad dogs and Englishmen go out in the noonday sun. Clearly, the sun rarely shown at Haworth Grange, or anywhere near the wind-blown Yorkshire Dales--it might have reversed the unfortunate Bronts' madness. Page for page of gothic drama and angst, Jane Eyre can be a frustrating read. Jane's insecurity, low self-esteem, and then dramatic personality change near the end of the (very long) story hardly seem worth the agony for the dubious benefit of the love of Mr. Rochester. Those Bronts were all mad as hatters, and the unfortunate Mrs. Rochester wasn't the only one who should have been kept under lock and key. Be that as it may, the Bronts wrote classic British literature in the early Victorian Age, and therefore should be read, if only to see where gothic romance has come since then (not too far, unless you include &quot;Rebecca,&quot; by Daphne DuMaurier, a far tighter story, with as much spinelessness in the heroine, but at a far faster pace), and to understand that women did not have much else to write about in those days--thank the gods for Jane Austen, I say. At least her heroines were role models well worthy of attention by impressionable female readers."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"Don't get sucked in by the pretty cover and cheap price (like I did)! This is apparently a printed-on-demand book, and the print font is all but unreadable. I tried, but could hardly get through the first page because of the font.

Thats why I gave it five stars."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"This is a nice edition of Jane Eyre. One reason I bought it was because the cover resembles Joan Fontaine, my favorite actress to portray Jane. It has some helpful introductory material, if you are teaching this novel in an English class.One thing that's different about this is it divides the book into volumes, which my previous copy didn't do.I think this book will be very useful as I teach the novel this year."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"I love a good book and this is certainly one of them."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"Do you like drama, excitement, action, and adventure? If so, do not read this book! Jane Eyre is a little English girl who is forced to live with her relatives that hate her. At the age of eight, she is forced to move to an orphan school where she has no friends and is continually abused. The book slowly drags through her life at school until she graduates. After spending eight years at school she becomes a governess for a little French brat out in the country. While living at the manor and tutoring the girl, Jane falls in love with the master of the manor. Mr. Rochester is an older man who has traveled all over the world searching for happiness. The rest of the book spends time explaining the controversy between their personalities and how they deal with each other's love. I give this book points for originality, but it needs a more gripping storyline. Only read this book if you need more reading material."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"I had to read this novel for my IB English class and I couldn't even imagine reading this novel as it was one of the longest and thickest book I have ever seen; not to mention that this book is a \\"classic\\" (aka a long boring book with bunch of long weird words). As if to add on to this little personal hell, my teacher made us mark and annotate every single page in this book and I knew that this was going to make me hate this book even more. However, I was pleasantly surprised by this book, I love it! Without a doubt it was my favorite book of the year and I would even consider it the best book of my high school career. As with most novels, it took a bit of time to get into, especially with this book as it is so long. I wouldn't necessarily describe this novel as a \\"quick read\\" but that only adds to the magnificent effect of the novel. This novel combines a heaping of drama, a dash of romance, and a pinch of Gothic horror. I think that there is something in this book that appeals to all reading Connoisseurs out there.

Her time at Thornfield is spent governing her sweet student, befriending fellow staff, searching for the source of mysterious sounds that she can hear throughout the night, and getting closer to Mr. Rochester.

Living as an orphan she is driven to become successful and fall in love. She becomes a young writer nd often expresses her feelings and thoughts through her writing. As a young teenager I can easily relate to a lot of how she feels. I felt comfort in reading this novel because I am not the only person going through a lot of changes in my life. I recommend this novel to a lot of young readers and especially young teenage girls. Jane Eyre contains a point of view that captivates the reading."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"I don't remember when I first read Jane Eyre. I have read it on and off for years now, along with hundreds of other books. When I was younger, I admired everything Jane did; every decision she made was the right one. Jane was the heroine of the story and I didn't question her decisions. But.. after much reflection on the outcomes of her decisions, I have come to the conclusion that she was TOO strong, too determined that she must lead a faultless life. It was almost creepy, how iron willed she was. I think the true victim of the novel was not Jane herself, but the rich and powerful Fairfax Rochester, who was so much in love with her that even Jane hoped her leaving would not drive him to madness and despair.. His plea, \\"You will not come? You will not be my comforter, my rescuer? My deep love, my wild woe, my frantic prayer are all nothing to you?\\" .. but Jane, in her determination to be true to her morals,walked away and left him in a near suicidal state. \\"Oh, Jane, this is bitter. This is wicked.\\" These words fell from Mr Rochester's lips when he saw that she meant to leave. I tend to agree. It DID seem wicked to leave him on the verge of madness. He ask no more of her, at that time, than to just stay in residence until some alternative plan could be embarked upon. However, she didn't want to be suspetible to the worldy temptations embodied in Mr Rochester...She almost died because of her decision to tear herself away, and what happened to Mr. Rochester will make the reader shudder. But.. Jane's \\"integrity\\" and strength remain intact,and supposedly that is the lesson the reader is supposed to carry away. But I love Jane Eyre anyway,love the story, and have a leather bound edition of it on my bookshelf. It's beautifully written and deeply interesting. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes to read."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"I read &quot;Jane Eyre&quot;, against my wishes, when I was a junior in high school and found it stuffy and dry, much like other books from the Victorian period. However, when I read it again as a sophomore in college my opinion change. I saw &quot;Jane Eyre&quot; as a heroine who fought her way from the bottom of society in order to make something out of herself.What I liked about the title character was that she was smart and even more importantly she was strong-willed. Somehow, Charlotte Bronte created a female heroine who had real character at a time when most women were used solely as ornaments and child-bearing machines."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"The protagonist is clear-headed, thoughtful, and independent. Even when she falls in love, she doesn't let that love take over her life. She knows that it's better to lose her love than to lose herself. That doesn't happen that often in &quot;love stories&quot; of the time.Even the &quot;happy ending&quot; of the story isn't completely happy -- it took a great deal of sacrifice and trouble for both Jane and her lover to get there.Most of today's &quot;Gothic&quot; novels are inferior copies at best of this book. Their heroines don't have half the brains or the personality of Jane."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"Jane Eyre was a very good book. At first glance, I wasn't sure if I was going to enjoy this book because I didn't like the previoius Victorian book I read. This book proved to be a lot better. It was not a typical romance novel. Jane Eyre was a love story, but also had many unforeseen twists that kept my attention. I had no idea what was going to happen, and when something didn't go the way I had expected, I was worried about how it would turn out. I enjoyed the basic plot, but I liked the unpredictablility the most. This book took me a lot longer to read than I had expected. This was because Jane Eyre is at a high reading level. It had many vocabulary words that confused me. This was the only drawback to this book. I would recommend this book to ages 14-20 and to people that enjoy classical literature. It was very enjoyable, but I would not suggest reacing Jane Eyre to anyone who likes more action because this book describes each event in great detail. Overall, I thought this book was very enlightening and enjoyable."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"Alright, joint greatest with Wuthering Heights. This novel for all its faults (journalistic style, over reliance on coincidence, a certain Byronic vulgarity to Rochester) simply transcends other English fiction of its time. Charlotte Bronte magics Jane Eyre into existence, the reader inhabits her consciousness. The book's first readers had never read anything like it: you can see why. It is has been continuously in print for over one hundred and fifty years and is a classic in the truest sense of the term. Fie on those who gave it one star!"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"Mixed with Charlotte Bronte's eloquence is a character you actually feel when you read this book. The descriptive characteristics of Jane's surroundings make it easy to imagine what Bronte is trying to portray. Her writing is a work of art in itself.

The story is an extraordinary one. Jane Eyre is gripping in its intensity and the plot continues to keep the reader guessing until almost the last page. Rarely has a story contained such a diverse content. There is cruelty, romance, gothic undertones, joy, sadness and the torment of unrequited love. Here you will find human emotions in their extremes. It's a fantastic story! The 18th Century dialect may be troublesome if your not used to it, so keep the dictionary to hand and enjoy!"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"What a wonderful book! I just finished reading Jane Eyre for the first time, and I already know that it will be a book I return to often!

I was in awe by the time I reached the last page....what an ending! As they say, &quot;Be still my heart&quot;. If you are a fan of Victorian romances, I *definitely* recommend this book to you! Take my word for it, you will be returning to these enchanting pages again and again!"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"From the very beginning I couldn't put this book down. It was a beautifully written story of love, strength and courage. The characters were so real I could feel their every emotion as if I personally knew them.

I like watching the movies but reading it is the best."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"Jane Eyre is a classical literary work that encompasses a variety of genres from mystery to romance. The novel is told from the perspective of Jane Eyre, a young woman orphaned as a child, who struggles to find her place in the world. Traveling among many occupations, Jane finds herself as a governess and begins to develop feelings for her employer, the rude mannered Mr. Rochester. However, Jane discovers that his country estate holds frightening secrets among a mysterious past.This Gothic romance encompasses many themes that are relevant to society today which not only makes the novel relatable, but also intriguing. The reader becomes wrapped in Bronte's descriptions as the story unfolds and takes unexpected turns and twists. From the beginning, Jane struggles to find those who love and accept her as a human being. Throughout her life Jane is oppressed by others who tell her that she is not good enough and is constantly put down even when she tries to change her situation. She is told that she is too ugly, too poor, and ultimately too powerless to overcome obstacles, but she tries regardless. In every situation presented, Bront touches on relationships with people. As human beings ourselves, we are able to relate to these struggles and the ways which we attempt to survive difficult moments within life.Jane Eyre represents these themes and continues to affect readers even today. This novel presents the emotions and desires of everyday people while also including an exciting, thought provoking plot. Jane Eyre is one of those novels that will travel with you over time. Personally, rereading the book at different points in my life has allowed me to read with a different perspective which I may not have considered before.I would also recommend reading Wide Sargasso Sea if you enjoyed Jane Eyre. This other novel written by Jean Rhys tells the story of Bertha and defends some of the judgments that could be made of Bertha in Jane Eyre. The novel also questions whether Bertha's mental state was altered before even arriving at Rochester's estate. It is a very interesting companion book to read after having read Jane Eyre."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"What can you say about this book that hasn't already been said.

Anyone who has ever read it should be able to clearly notice it's underlying message about redemption and second chances. I personally love that Jane is not some beautiful, perfect heroine, but is flawed and considered &#34;plain&#34; by her peers. Her personality and attitude are what entices Mr. Rochester to fall in love with her, not what she looks like. Their love overcomes so many obstacles, it's ridiculous.

Family, love, relationship, friendship, on one hand; and on the other, backstabbing, scheming, rivalry, heartbreaks etc. All such things apparently do not lose their meaning and value over time, unlike technology, social establishments, cultural distinctions and class differentiation, to name but a few. The author masterly describes human nature in its various negative and positive aspects, thus subtly inferring the moral of the story, filled with action, tregady, drama, struggle, romance, affection and ultimate achievement. The main characters, who eventually fall in love through loads of trouble, are heroic in their development, however, realistic, emerging and aspiring, unselfish and memorable; whereas being quite natural modest and sincere since the very beginning.Overall, there is a lot of wisdom and sense in this lovely book. Something for anyone who is truly interested in personal improvement, good manners, real feelings and emotional intelligence, and last but not least, immaculate language and style."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"Romance and love. Principles and rash decisions. All these are included with much more in the edge-of-your-seat novel: Jane Eyre, by Charlotte Bronte.The main character, Jane Eyre, is first pictured as a poor, neglected, mistreated ten-year-old. Her temper is yet wild and uncontrolled, so she gets into many scraps, consequentially landing her in a boarding school fifty miles away. After a bad epidemic of typhus, the unhealthy structure of Lowood school is discovered. It is at once put to rights.After eight years at Lowood (two total as a student and six as a teacher), Jane discovers that she longs for a different life. She puts an ad in the paper, and soon receives a letter from an old lady named Mrs. Fairfax. This lady writes to hire Jane as governess of a little French girl. Upon taking the job, Jane presently meets the owner of the house, Mr. Rochester, and falls in love. However, while at the altar, about to make their vows, a disruption occurs.Jane runs away with nothing but a few pounds, which she accidentally leaves in the coach. After three days out in the open with hardly any food or sleep, she encounters a happy family, which takes her in. Se doesn't give her true identification, but soon becomes at home and gets a job as the local girl's schoolmistress.However, not very long after, Jane meets a bend in the road. No sooner does she get settled in, but she finds that she does have family and a large fortune after all! She begins to feel restless and uneasy to have left Mr. Rochester, and sets out to find him.I won't say the ending, but I will say that I loved this book! It is so romantic and sweet. I would definitely recommend it to anyone. Besides, \\"they all lived happily ever after,\\" and that's the best part."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"Young Jane has a tough childhood growing up with her cousins and aunt after her parents passed away. Treated like a servant, and not like a member of the family, Jane felt she was all alone in the world, and it doesn't make it better when she's sent away to school. First as a student, and then as a teacher/guverness, but neither is like a dance on roses. Then her skills bring her to a mysterious and quite arrogant Mr.Rochesters house where she becomes the guverness...This book illustrates very well the passionate love from a woman's point of view. No longer is the female character a background character, but becomes independant with feelings, passion, integrety and a strong mind.The book is very realistic, and you can easily identify yourself with the feelings that the main character has. Her devotion for what she loves, and her effort to make the best out of her life.Charlotte Bront, who first published this book under a pseudonym, is probably the most well-known of the Bront sisters who all died very young. Jane Eyre is a brilliant book of a woman who can be a role model for young girls of today. Her determination to make life the best for herself as no one else seems to bother, and her passion for what she loves. One of the first romance novels written. A true classic that I very much enjoyed to read, and I'm certain I will read it many more times. Even my friend, who doesn't like reading very much, totally loved this book. I warmly recommend this to anyone who loves a good novel, and most certainly to young girls. I think the language might be a little advanced for anyone younger than 16."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"JANE EYRE is a wonderful story about a woman's struggle to survive and go on to realize her full potential. It is also a stirring tale of romance in which love conquers evil and despair.The plot is interesting while the main characters are multi-dimensional and very intriguing. The book has almost too many characters but some are memorable simply because they seem so real.The story begins with Jane Eyre as an unwanted orphan in the care of a cruel aunt who has two spoiled children of her own. Jane is sent to an austere boarding school where she develops into a remarkable young woman able to overcome tremendous obstacles and discouragements. She gets a job as a governess for a young girl at Thornfield which is owned by Edward Rochester. The evolving love relationship between Jane and Edward becomes the focus of the novel whose broad message is uplifting in spite of the sombre mood and tragic events which often intervene.I like Charlotte Bronte's writing style. It is easy to see why she became an immediate success with the publication of JANE EYRE in 1847."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"This book is probably my favorite that I have ever read.

Jane is one of my favorite characters in literature. It is an incredible, beautiful story, one of the best ever written. Jane Eyre is a plain, unattractive, poor orphan. She goes through a difficult childhood, first in the house of her abusive aunt, then as a student who endures the harsh and unjust conditions of Lowood School. At eighteen, she takes up the post of governess at Thornfield Hall, meets and falls in love with Mr. Rochester, her employer.Despite the wrongs and harsh treatments she recieved as a girl, despite having no family and few friends, Jane at eighteen is strong, thoughtful and intelligent when her character meets the nasty and sarcastic Mr. Rochester. Their conversation is so full of wit, humour and hidden meanings. There is nothing more charming than how Mr. Rochester attempts to provoke Jane and tries to bully her a bit, but his efforts miserably fail as he finds he has met someone who is quite his equal. In her novel, Bronte stresses that their relationship is based on 'sympathy' and 'a likeness'.A dark secret of Rochester's past impedes their marriage, and after an emotional and heart-breaking scene, Jane adheres to her morals and leaves Thornfield in the night. What follows are two days of degredation, neglect, and pain, as Jane finds herself in an unfriendly town where none will help her. An unusual twist of fate brings salvation at last, in the form of the handsome St. John and his sisters. Again Jane's strength of character is tested when St. John (is it me, or is he a lot like Enjolras of Les Miserables?) makes her a difficult proposal. She has to make a final decision of either sacrificing her heart or seeking Rochester again.The novel is full of heart-warming moments, suspense and intrigue. The narrator, Jane herself, constantly addresses the reader, and makes you feel like you know her personally. Through this and the beautiful use of language I've found a friend and an idol in Jane. She is a wonderful character, and you come to realize she is not at all plain, she is interesting, complex, and passionate.When speaking of her Rochester says \\"Consider that eye: consider the resolute, wild, free thing looking out of it, defying me, with more than courage...And it is you, spirit - with will and energy - and virtue and putiry - that I want: not alone your brittle frame.\\"Did I say the language is beauitful and thrilling? My copy of the book, although new, is quickly wearing out! Again and again I pick it up to read my favourite passages, which I've marked. Although I absolutely adore this book, I must say if you are not a fan of the genre and don't read classics, you might think it slow. But with some patience, your efforts will be rewarded. Read this book if you think yourself unlucky, Jane's courage and faith will inspire you."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"When I was little, my mother would always read this to me. I was named after the writer, who my mother loved. This book is a classic. You must read this to be considered a true reader or &quot;book lover&quot;."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"True, the first few chapters are difficult to get through,but after those this story brought out tons of emotions in me.I felt ashamed when Jane heard the ladies talk about her in the game room with Mr. Rochester there.I felt shunned when Mr. Rochester brushed Jane aside seemingly without a second thought.And I felt the romance in the garden.Not to give away any more, I will just simply state that I felt some emotions that no book has ever brought out so fervently in me.This isn't your classic love story..boy meets girl, boy and girl fall in love and live happily ever after. There is tragedy and heartache on the sides of both characters.There isn't just the longing of one or the heartache of one, you see each,longing and heartache, in both.The characters are put into such detail and described so well you can almost imagine what they will say in response to other characters in the book.This is a truly unique book and if you like feeling angry,fearful,mourning,loss,and romance this book is for you!When I first started it,it really was not that interesting to me, and it actually took me two times to go check it out before I eventually got past the part I didn't like.So if you bear through the beginning you'll eventually get to the really good stuff...oh, and one more thing. If you have seen any of the movies,don't go by them.Of the movies I have seen based on this book,none live up to the standard set by the book.I hope this was helpful:)"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"I absolutly loved this novel. It does not matter how long ago it was written or how much time has passed since I have read it. The characters are interesting, well-developed, and exciting. I had forgotten about how Jane Eyre's childhood was such a struggle. She experienced mental and physcial abuse at the hands of unfeeling and wicked relatives. Later in the story when she is &quot;left&quot; at a &quot;school&quot; her life is again that of a sad and angry child. Somehow through it all she manages to become a affable, caring, and trustworthy adult. This assures her not only a position has a teacher at her school but later has a governess to a child in the care of the intimidating and wealthy Mr. Rodchester.

Plus the fact that along with this ability, these old classics are available for free (at least for the most part).(Spoiler alert)I would say that with a few of the old english titles now under my belt, the authors of the time leave a lot to incredibility in order to advance their plots. In the case of Jane Eyre, this came up with a majorly coincidental meeting of a man and a letter in the town of Maderia (or some such spelling). Also, of a rather psychic lament being heard by the story's protagonist. Also of a chance meeting of the protagonist, on the verge of dying of starvation and privations; finding herself on the doorstep of some long lost relatives.Guess they had a lot of faith back then that God's will, will out. Otherwise it did make for a nice story.

Every time i read it again i discover something. I recommand it to people of all ages. Easy to read for teenage and enjoyable for adult readers"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"It's easy to see why this novel is regarded as one of the greatest of all time. If you love classic English literature, Charlotte Bronte is unsurpassed in her command of the language. She delves into the depths of feelings of her characters which must have been especially gripping to her audience in the mid-19th century and indeed today. Well read by Juliet Mills."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"Many people consider Jane Eyre to be Charlotte Bronte's masterpiece (with a minority preferring Villette). I have to agree- Jane Eyre is my number one of her novels, by far.We all know the story by this point. A governess falls in love with her employer to find out he has a dark secret...dun dun dun! It's very much a Romantic as well as romantic novel. It's very different from anything Jane Austen ever wrote, that's for sure! (Charlotte was not a fan of dear Jane, by the way).The first time I read this book, as a freshman in high school, I didn't get into it until after Jane got to Thornfield. I found the parts with Jane as a child draggy. Now I get sucked into the story right from the beginning. Young Jane is a fiery, passionate creature who's not afraid to speak her mind. Lowood makes her take on a more controlled, reserved front but she never loses her inner passions. I find Jane so strong and still a realistic character- I just love her.It's not a totally perfect book but it's close. It's only little nitpicks that bug me- like all the coincidences. Rochester isn't exactly my favorite character but I totally get the connection and the love between them and on a literary level I do like him. On a personal level, I don't- but it works in a book. I appreciate how he has to suffer for his sins and really has to earn his happy ending."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"A good, solid transcription to Kindle. I read and enjoyed it. The one drawback with this particular version: no navigable table of contents. So buyer beware."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"Charlotte Bront's Jane Eyre was truly an enjoyable novel for me to read. Jane Eyre, the protagonist of Bront's novel, grows up as an orphan child in oppressive surroundings; however, she overcomes the repression of her cruel childhood and follows her heart to find out who she is and where she truly belongs. Readers, especially female readers, can easily identify with Jane because they are all searching for themselves or have already done so at some point in their lives. Although there are a few parts of the novel which are difficult to read, the novel is essentially easy to read and understand, mainly because it is actually written to and for the reader. Readers are still able to make a connection with Jane's passionate feelings, her love of religion, and her struggle with difficult decisions, because the readers of today must still deal with those same situations that Jane dealt with over one hundred and fifty years ago. Readers can learn from the balance Jane maintains between her conscience and her intuition as influences to the difficult decisions she makes. Jane's undying sense of hope is inspiring and shows readers that hope and faith are the only things needed to carry on in life."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"Jane Eyre has an odd place in literary history. It is one of the most compelling reads ever written, and in my opinion, it uncovers so much about the nature of being a human. The novel's a page-turner for its entertainment value as well as for its ability to enlighten.Jane is a poor orphan born in a society that fights her ability to attain financial, emotional, sexual, and spiritual freedom. From the beginning of the novel, Jane is on a quest to gain her liberation. Of course, she cannot do so by herself. She must retain enough fortitude to be her true self, and she must be an instrument of grace, of change, in the life of Rochester.Everything in the novel conspires toward the creation of a near-perfect novel. I cannot believe I waited so long to experience this masterpiece, but I will certainly be returning to it over and over through the rest of my life. This novel cannot be missed by anyone who wants to read truly great literature or by anyone who just wants to experience a great read."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"I first read Jane Eyre when I was thirteen, and I fell in love with it almost instantly as soon as I finished the first chapter.

After all, aren't we all plain Jane Eyre's at times?"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"It took me a while to get into this novel.

Don't be intimidated by the length, because you will certainly get so enraptured, and taken in, that you wont even notice it. I must say that Jane Eyre is one of the most endearing and enjoyable characters that i've encountered. Charlotte Bronte develops her perfectly. I love her ability to poke fun at and tease her admired one, Mr Rochester; it's refreshing, and my idea of love. It develops at a nice, steady pace, never lagging. The tone and the references to the reader suit the book quite well, and I believe that the story was far ahead of its time. Why four out of five? Well, i found certain parts of the story far too unbelievable, and Mr. Rochester seemed to go from stern and haughty, to love-sick and passionate all too quickly, that I found it somewhat ingenuine. I believe that the end is what really made the story worthwhile, when Jane goes back to see her beloved once more. That is when i started to tear.

Yet, yes, this book is at an advanced level, but so many girls between 12-15 read this book. And the funny thing is, that I don't understand the words, but when I read the book, I have a clear view of what the words mean. This is such a great book to give to your kids. I read it like, on my 11th birthday, and it is good for girls 11 and older. I would recomend this book for teens or pre-teens, and parents, don't give them Nancy Drew books.

For the most part ;)!"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"One of the reasons Jane Eyre is such an enduring piece of literary excellence is because of it's simple theme, in a book of numerous themes battling for #1, is of the ability of one human being with absolutely nothing to rise above hell and survive. Yet anyone can write about that, but only a true talent can make you give a damn about it all.Going back to those other themes, they consist of feminism, morality, personal blindness, social reform, and more. A plethora of characters that you'll despise or love or feel like kicking at one moment and hugging the next, it's a breathtaking array of humanity drenched in dysfunction, and one woman who's known nothing else and with great difficulty can still find those rungs on the ladder.Jane is appealing because of her complexities and endurance. Bronte's contemporary audiences found Jane a bit of an enigma, she's a moral strength in the toughest sense but so independent and (has been called) the first feminist in literature. Bronte gives us ample opportunity to see what the social climate was back then, and it only adds to the atmosphere of difficulty for Jane's saga as a poor governess in a male dominated world. Yet Jane is realistic because we see how she evolves from being an free spirited child to a beaten down teenager/adult who strives only to escape to follow her dreams and follow God's word, and eventually the governess who must come to terms with the man she loves and the dark secret that he carries. That's Rochester, who represents everything Jane isn't. He's immoral, crude, nasty, and is inexplicably held down by a bundle of secrets and one rather large one that keeps him a captive of his own life. They have one thing in common, they have thick shells they don't know how to get rid of.And yet Bronte weaves us a story that is full of passion and shows us the cracks in the dams that keep these characters apart, and as the numerous events and intrigues take place, we see how they grow and finally come to terms with their reality and whatever tragic consequences must occur. And at the root of it is Jane who leads us through decision and pain and her intense desire to just be a good and fully human person in a society and situation that won't allow her to.Jane Eyre is a book about us, and is an inspiring book even 160+ years later, not just because of the quality of Bronte's talent, or the brilliant plot weaving and what not, but because it's a masterpiece look at the strength of the human spirit."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"Wonderfully narrated and very alive.

Back then, I had the attention span of a gnat, so rather than give Jane Eyre a try, I opted for Cliffs Notes. (Yeah, I know ... sacrilege)Anyway, fast forward to now. I finally read it, and my God, what a beautiful piece of literature! The first part outlining young Jane's struggles had me flipping the pages till one in the morning. Then when she got to Thornfield Hall and Mr. Rochester, the page turning didn't stop till at least 3 A.M. I savored every paragraph, every word. It was like crack to me. lolI was so enthralled with this story that I wrote a post on it when I hadn't even finished reading the book! I'd reached a section that moved me so much I had to write about it because of its beauty. It showed the core of just who Jane was as a heroine. Here's a snippet:WARNING .... SPOILERS.........Last night, I read something that really moved me, so much that I must've re-read it three times. It was an introspective passage that poignantly demonstrated the beauty and complexity of Jane's mind. Oh, how I wish my heroines were this self-aware and confident!In discussing her opinion of Blanche Ingram (the gold-digging skank who Mr. Rochester is using to make Jane jealous), our heroine goes into great detail about why she cannot bring herself to be jealous of Miss Ingram. Jane isn't a character in denial. She's a strong, logical, thoughtful and methodical woman, one who knows her own mind. After reading this passage, I realized that although I was over halfway through the novel, I never really knew Jane until that moment.Anyway, while this may be a long excerpt, it's well-worth the read:---------------------------\\"I have told you, reader, that I had learnt to love Mr. Rochester: I could not unlove him now, merely because I found that he had ceased to notice me-because I might pass hours in his presence, and he would never once turn his eyes in my direction-because I saw all his attentions appropriated by a great lady, who scorned to touch me with the hem of her robes as she passed; who, if ever her dark and imperious eye fell on me by chance, would withdraw it instantly as from an object too mean to merit observation. I could not unlove him, because I felt sure he would soon marry this very lady-because I read daily in her a proud security in his intentions respecting her-because I witnessed hourly in him a style of courtship which, if careless and choosing rather to be sought than to seek, was yet, in its very carelessness, captivating, and in its very pride, irresistible.\\"There was nothing to cool or banish love in these circumstances, though much to create despair. Much too, you will think, reader, to engender jealousy: if a woman, in my position, could presume to be jealous of a woman in Miss Ingram's. But I was not jealous: or very rarely;-the nature of the pain I suffered could not be explained by that word. Miss Ingram was a mark beneath jealousy: she was too inferior to excite the feeling. Pardon the seeming paradox; I mean what I say. She was very showy, but she was not genuine: she had a fine person, many brilliant attainments; but her mind was poor, her heart barren by nature: nothing bloomed spontaneously on that soil; no unforced natural fruit delighted by its freshness. She was not good; she was not original: she used to repeat sounding phrases from books: she never offered, nor had, an opinion of her own. She advocated a high tone of sentiment; but she did not know the sensations of sympathy and pity; tenderness and truth were not in her.\\"Too often she betrayed this, by the undue vent she gave to a spiteful antipathy she had conceived against little Adele: pushing her away with some contumelious epithet if she happened to approach her; sometimes ordering her from the room, and always treating her with coldness and acrimony. Other eyes besides mine watched these manifestations of character-watched them closely, keenly, shrewdly. Yes; the future bridegroom, Mr. Rochester himself, exercised over his intended a ceaseless surveillance; and it was from this sagacity-this guardedness of his-this perfect, clear consciousness of his fair one's defects-this obvious absence of passion in his sentiments towards her, that my ever- torturing pain arose.\\"---------------------------.....Jane's pain came not from any imagined self-deficiency ... because as far as she was concerned, the pretty Miss Ingram was an empty satin dress---not worthy of jealousy or anything else. Least of all Mr. Rochester. Hence Jane's pain. The mere fact that he would go for a vapid boob like Miss Ingram was the root of Jane's torment.Hard to be jealous of someone you feel is intellectually and spiritually beneath both you and the man you love. This is why I love Jane as a heroine! While not a raving beauty, she has a quiet and unshakable confidence that's very appealing. No wonder Mr. Rochester fell for her.Writers, if you want to see how to create a compelling heroine, look no further. The lesson is in this book!Suffice it to say, Jane Eyre is my all time favorite heroine."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"I have loved this book every since I first read it back in high school.

Some may compare that kind of behavior with today's much more open and free male/fremale relations and not understand the impediments to verbal and physical demonstration of your love back in those days. However, I think that added so deliciously to the sexual tension.Mostly, I find this to be about a particular female who has an incredibly admirable personality. Independent, clever, modest yet feisty, she sets a great example for true feminism to come. We need to pay attention to the hardships she faced, and the ways in which she handled them. It sets an example for us to be better people and to face our own modern day challenges with ethics and fortitude.The characters were clearly delineated and we would have no trouble identifying them if they were to come to life. Bronte handled the English language in a most eloquent fashion, which I enjoyed very much. It is fascinating to see how a language grows and changes over time.

This is too much to comprehed.Is Charlotte Bronte trying to highlight the plight of women, or is she exposing how passive they are?All in all, it is a &quot;nice&quot; novel, with the &quot;goodies&quot; and the &quot;badies&quot;. One final question to ponder on...Where would you place Mr. Rochester?"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"It's true this book, Jane Eyre by Charlotte Bronte, is extremely boring for the first fifty to seventy pages, but the plot line needs that much set up because it is so difficult. Once one has made it past those pages, hold on for the ride of a lifetime because it is a complicated and complete novel. Charlotte Bront&egrave; is an extremely effective writer. Her explicit detail is apparent after the first page. She carries this aspect of writing throughout the novel in describing both her surroundings and the people she meets. Because of her writing style, one learns more about the characters in this novel than in most modern novels, this enhances the enjoyment and knowledge gained from this book. The detail used in this novel helps make it easier to relate to the main character Jane Eyre. Since this book is written in the first person, it is very important that one is able to connect with the main character who is also the narrator.This novel's plot is so complex that one almost never wants to put it down after those first fifty pages. The setup, though boring, is completely necessary to the rest of the novel and the rest of the plot. The most important parts of the plot are often right after a slow spot in the book. I believe this is just to emphasis these points. Included in a way such as that is the portion near the beginning where Jane stands up to her aunt who she is living with. This part is the beginning of Jane's strong headed and straightforward attitude, which was very uncharacteristic of a woman at the time this novel was written.Also, the time at Lowood Academy when Jane's friend Helen dies of consumption is one of the points in which the novel starts to slow down and an important item is introduced. Jane goes through many changes in atmosphere throughout the novel, some by choice, some not. This gives us more opportunity to relate to her because throughout our lives we all will have to deal with changes in location, surroundings, and relationships. The ways in which Jane reacts to her changes will in one way or another affect us for the rest of our lives. The plot has many different places where it is so entangled both by Jane's feelings and the actions of the other characters. This is to represent the times in our lives where things seem complicated.It is easy to relate to the main character, Jane Eyre, which makes it a good novel to represent our life and take advice from. This is a classic because it has survived the trials and tribulations of time and is still considered an excellent book to take advice from and to learn about what has happened in the live of people of the past. Each of us can step into Jane's shoes at one point or another and see things as she sees them. It makes one feel connected to the novel and understand what is going on much better than a novel which does not have the first person interpretation and emotions in it. Because the narrator is a young girl growing up it is harder for males, such as me, to relate to portions of the novel, though it is just as easy to relate to other portions. Also, because of the difference in time periods, it is harder to relate to exact problems, though the problems can be generalized so as to be more relevant.Overall, this novel is a great work in which many people can receive hours of enjoyment and thought. I would recommend this novel to anyone who is thought to be \\"mature\\" enough to read it with full comprehension because it is a novel that has bearing on many issues both of the mind and of the world."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"The day after I watched the 1983 BBC Version of Jane Eyre on video, I went to the library and borrowed the book.

This book displays an almost unusual scenario. An orphan thrown into a tumultuous life and endures to find a man above her social ranking to love. What is more interesting that neither contain perfect beauty in the eyes of a passing stranger. Jane Eyre is the perfect example of love emitting from internal thoughts and experiences rather than exterior imagery. One would think the story to be a simple one, but it is so much more than the ordinary love story! Yes, Jane Eyre and Mr Rochester, the wealthy employer, do fall in love. However, it is the dramatic turn in the story that touches the reader most. What does happen in the end to these oh-so-real characters? At times, it seems very unpredictable. The story is worth the time of reading the book. It is unlike any other!"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"Few people probably need an introduction to this novel, given its popular appeal and long circulation. But some words are needed to explain its importance.At a simple level, the novel is the archetypal 'soap opera'; indeed, one can see virtually every plot found in 'Days of Our Lives' or something similar flowing through this work. But Charlotte Bronte's genius makes this wonderful work so much better than a mere one dimensional soap opera.The protagonist displays a keen intellect, a penetrating psychological understanding of those around her, and amazing powers of description. Whether it is the depressing institution of Lowood, or the passing away of Jane Eyre's childhood friend before her eyes, the scenery, the atmosphere, the emotional power, and the raw beauty of the language shine through.Bronte also makes use of the 'Gothic' element in her novel, particularly in the mysterious, mad wife of Edward Rochester, 'Bertha Mason', a sinister figure who is mad and tries to kill Rochester at every opportunity. The atmosphere in the novel is dark, spooky, and has a strong hint of the supernatural; Eyre's descriptions of the Moon often come into this.The characters themselves (apart from the caricature of Bertha Mason) are also psychologically and morally complex. Eyre pursues her career as a governess and eventually Rochester himself often using dubious means, and Rochester himself is far from a heroic figure. Who is good, or evil? Even the end offers no resolution of this (though Jean Rhys's Wide Sargasso Sea suggests Rochester is the nasty one).Although Gothic romances are not my favorite literary genre, this book is worth recommending simply for the sheer genius of the author.Charlotte Bronte, one of the finest novelists in the 19th century realist tradition,"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"When I first read Jane Eyre, I (and I think many others) was taken in by the odd combination of romance and ominous overtones that makes Jane Eyre such a unique book. Of course, the Victorian-era writing and social commentary also made an impression.But upon reflection, underneath all of this is a story of people with difficult lives learning to find and accept each other and hopefully coming to peace and happiness despite long odds. Maybe my second reading just comes from a twenty-first century mind reading things into a nineteenth century book that just aren't there. But to me, the book does have the feel of a modern story of hardship as well as a Victorian story of people trying to overcome their backgrounds to find love.Jane Eyre tells the life story of an orphaned girl sent away to a harsh boarding school by a cruel aunt. Despite the harsh nature of the school, Jane thrived at the school since she is finally out from her aunt's crushing dislike for her. She graduated and took a job as a governess for a girl in the care of a mysterious man who spent much of his time traveling abroad, Mr. Rochester.At first, the two do not like each other. This is compounded by the fact that Jane thinks she is plain looking and not worthy of his company. But the two develop a peculiar friendship, and there are many signs that their feelings are deeper. But Mr. Rochester is busy courting other ladies at the time. Mr. Rochester also seems to have a secret that he will not divulge to Jane but may have serious consequences for her.Jane's job as a governess and the friendship that develops make it seem that the book will quickly become a Jane Austen book (which of course, would not have been a bad thing) in which the man and woman from different classes find love with one another, but from the point of the friendship blooming, Jane Eyre takes a few remarkable twists and turns that I had not expected and that make for real page-turning.But it is as much the quiet desperation of both Jane and Mr. Rochester and their struggle to find each other despite this that makes Jane Eyre a book truly worth reading and treasuring."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"I read this in order to compare it with JENNA STARBORN, and there's no doubt but that this is the true classic with its Gothic overtones and its portrayal of a strong and independent woman in times not supportive of such strength and independence in women.Many will have difficulty with this book, because it's rich in detail and rich in mood. Today's readers may need patience and understanding to enjoy this. If one relaxes and accepts the book as a portrait of the thinking of the era in which it was written, one can relate it with today's society.Basically, this is the story of a woman guided by her inner values. As such, it's not really a book for guys. On the other hand, it tells of a style of life far from that led by today's high school girls, and therefore takes careful reading.It's classic, and if accepted as a Gothic romance that reveals the thinking and attitudes of the time when written, it's a timeless story that speaks to all."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"JANE EYRE by Charlotte BronteJane Eyre, a rather dry book that somehow captures the heart of the English Literature fans, but makes the young male want to sleep. The story tells the life of a young woman and how she gets through the troubles of work, a hard life, and heartbreaking relationship. Although boring and bare at times, Jane Eyre could be inspirational to the desires of love and romance in the early 1800's.Hard life starts at the age of 10 when she is orphaned and left to her critical aunt. Putting her faith in front of her, she tries to get through all the tough times. As she grew older, she becomes more knowing of her surroundings. Jane ends up falling in love with a man secretly still married. Jane finds out and runs away with no money and finds a family who can care and be her friend. In a twist, Jane, gets a big inheritance from her now passed away uncle. The man that she still loves comes back to find her after a tragedy of his family. They both have come to realize that they have both have found true love and would do anything to be with that other person. The two are married and have one child.The book Jane Eyre is the romantic novel that most women would dream for. It has the perfect fairy-tale ending in a true love that can never break. Jane worked hard and had a rough life and in the end it had paid off by being with the man that she had loved so much who loves her back.

It's just very long. There are too many dead points in the novel. The novel jumps back and forth between different thoughts and actually speaking often. It has a lot of good symbolism in it however. I reccomend reading wide sargasso sea afterwards for it is a novel from Bertha's point of view!"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"Review:Pride and Prejudice is a love story between Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy, an uptight man who has too much pride. Their first impressions gave a big start to this story that developed into the major conflicts and story line. My favorite chapter was the first one because it sets the tone for the story. It gives us the setting and the introduction to the characters. We really get to see how Mrs. Bennett is a really loud mother who all she lives for is for the search of husbands for her daughters. We know that Mrs. Bennett favors Jane, which is the eldest and most beautiful one of all. Then we start to understand Mr. Bennett's attitude towards his wife's plea and towards his defense toward his daughters. He isn't judge mental towards his daughters when it comes to men.I would recommend this book mostly to women/girls between the ages of 17-50, because this story deals with the trouble of what girls go through and it deals with five girls living in the household, which we can relate to. The daughters were not that old yet they were mature for their age. Teens will like it because we all go through these stages of male, and women can relate because of the maturity level that is in this story.One literary term that was used in the story was Analogy. It is used to describe two characters (Elizabeth and Darcy) that are alike by comparing them. In the story we can see their differences but along with it their similarities and common interest start to show.Overall I can say that I liked this book, Pride and Prejudice because it was an interesting story. Nowadays we read about homicide detectives and mysteries happening with murderer, but this story is nothing like this. Is builds its own suspense through characters personalities. It's based on feeling rather than action so we can all relate to this story psychologically. It captivates us in an imaginary world in the 18th century that sets us rules and regulations that were use back then. For example women were just suspected to marry wealth and make a family. They played no other role whatsoever, so since we don't live in that type of environment anymore, than we can just picture how life was back then and see what they went through, and their approach through these situations, to help us get through the book."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"Jane Eyre by Charlotte Bronte was our book club selection for this month.

We all know the story of Jane Eyre, and it is here in it's entirety. The issue I speak of is with the actual book itself, not the novel or story. I was looking for a book to start a library for my wife. Jane Eyre is one of her favorite pieces of fiction, but if we were to start a library that we could pass down, the book should be something worth passing down. The cover here caught my eye, simple enough. Utilizing the \\"Peek inside\\" feature for this specific edition, it notes that it has a cloth bound cover and illustrated interior front and rear pages. Upon receiving the book itself, the cover looks the same, but is not cloth bound and the illustrations are missing. The print is extra large with wide margins. This seems to be more of a textbook or school issue version of the novel than a collector's item. It makes me wonder if the book is misrepresented by Amazon by mistake or if the book itself has done so. If a collector's edition of this novel is what you are looking for, stay clear."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"Jane was orphaned as a baby and thrust upon her widowed aunt, to raise alongside her own three children. Her aunt, resentful of Jane and distrustful of such a quiet and sad child, makes her life miserable. When Jane is ten and the opportunity for her to go away to boarding school arises, she jumps at the chance. Aside from not being constantly harassed by her aunt and cousins, things are not much better at school, at first. The teachers are strict, uniforms are painfully plain, food is scarce and sometimes inedible. However, Jane feels at peace with her life there, even staying on to teach when she is too old to be a student.When Jane is eighteen, her dear friend and former teacher leaves school to marry. Jane decides it is time for a change in her own life. She advertises herself out as a private tutor, and is soon hired to be the governess and teacher for young Adele, a little French girl under the guardianship of Mr. Rochester, who lives in a grand English manor.Mr. Rochester is moody; he is more often grouchy and irritable than pleasant. He insults Jane, and seems surprised and charmed when she returns his barbs without taking offense. Jane begins to dare to hope for a relationship to develop between them. But Mr. Rochester is a society man. He is wealthy, and he surrounds himself with other wealthy folks, including some very eligible young ladies who look down on Jane. Furthermore, Jane can't be certain Mr. Rochester is always truthful with her. Something very strange is going on at Mr. Rochester's manor, something certain to shock Jane.I liked the fact that the protagonists of this story are not beautiful people. Jane is small, thin and plain. Mr. Rochester is often described as ugly, and certainly fierce. It's nice to read a love story about people who are more normal than the usual cast of characters in a romance. I also liked Jane's resolve in staying true to herself. She is confident in who she is and even her love can't make her betray her morals. However, despite her decision to become independent, she still knows that Mr. Rochester has a claim on her heart, and she isn't ashamed of that fact.The weakness of this story is simply that of time and style. It was written in the 1800s, when writers had a tendency to focus on description and long dialog, sometimes at the expense of action. As a result, there are parts of this book that are tedious and require skimming in order to get to the good stuff."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"Charlotte Bronte beautifully constructs each sentence in \\"Jane Eyre\\" with an exacting precision that is at once dated and elegant.While the story can be a bit overwrought in almost a parody like way--it hasn't aged especially well--all of that is a minor distraction to enjoying the exquisite craftsmanship with which Bronte writes.Bronte is as much an architect as a storyteller--every sentence and event ties to an often unexpected event or occurance later in the book. She doesn't just churn out prose in the assembly-line fashion of hacks Janet Evanovich or Stephen King. When you read Bronte, you understand what is meant by \\"classic.\\" She is the difference between junk food (Evanovich/King) and a gourmet meal.This isn't airplane reading and you won't breeze through it in days. It's the sort of book you savor for 20 or 30 pages and perhaps return to a week later.And if you are not a student who resents it as \\"required reading,\\" you'll truly thank yourself for voluntarily finishing a book of such style and class."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"I found the beginning of this book interesting enough, but in my opinion it just went down from there.

I decided to read it again before the movie comes out. Although I enjoyed it, I didn't enjoy it as much as I did as an idealistic, romantic teenager. I can understand why some students have said this book is boring, as they probably can't relate to it. Relationships today, at least in the US, are very different than in Bronte's days. I think readers need to read and understand this story in the context of the culture, mores, etc. of the 1800s.I am giving this only 4 stars, because Bronte is overly wordy in my opinion. She often wrote several paragraphs to say something that could have been written more succinctly in a few sentences.I think this book is more likely to appeal to girls and young women who enjoy romantic, gothic novels than to males."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"I needed this book for a school project.

I bought this copy of Jane Eyre for the cover art.I have always loved the story of Jane Eyre since I was a teen. Everything interested me - the gothic atmosphere, the dark and brooding Mr. Rochester, the mystery of what exactly was locked away in Thornfield...Most of all, I loved Jane as a character. She's not blessed with beauty or wealth, but she is determined to be independant and live her own life. She overcomes hardships, abuse, and grief to live on her own terms. Best of all, she finally does find love. Naturally, that road doesn't run smoothly, but the ending is as it should be.Yes, I have loved Jane Eyre from the very first reading, but never managed to hold on to my own copy. Finally, I decided that I needed to add it to my shelves and started to search for a copy to call my own. One thing that did irriate me were all the various covers of this book. Yes, Jane Eyre is a classic, but I really think all the portraits of women in period garb was overkill. What happened to giving the novel a regular, uncomplicated cover? Honestly, this book is too good to have people turn away because of the \\"classic\\" look. Let's face it - people do judge books based on the covers. Honestly, all the covers I saw of other editions of this novel just flat out annoyed me.I saw this cover and loved it instantly. Superficial? Sure. However, this edition is worth the extra money in my mind. I often loan books to friends and they never want to read the \\"classics\\" because the covers look too old fashioned. If it is old, no one really wants to give the book a chance. Jane Eyre stands the test of time. Not everyone can overcome the sight that is on the surface, so this edition works. (And since the popularity of the Twilight series, other classics have been reprinted with pretty coveres with lovely flowers to draw in younger readers - i.e. Pride and Prejudice and Romeo and Juliet - It is only fair that Jane Eyre gets an upgrade too!)The cover is beautiful and captures the eye. I already know and love the story, but I hope this cover will draw in new readers and create new fans of Bronte's work.I realize many may not really agree with my opinion, but I do get pretty bored of all the classics having to have certain covers that commiunicate the fact that they were written in times past. If a novel stands the test of time, why does that cover art have to be stuck in the past? This particular cover isn't overly modern, but not too period in appearance.I saw the cover, thought it was a beautiful fit for Jane Eyre and had to have it. Now I will concentrate on enjoying re-reading this classic over and over again."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"I wanted to read Jane Eyre since a long time but couldn't make myself do it. Firstly, because I find classics really difficult to read. Secondly, it's too long. The 490 pages copy I have has very small font and everything is kind of crowded with the next chapter starting on the same page the previous one ends.So when I picked up the book to read I was expecting a very difficult read. But the first 100 pages were a breeze.*contains spoilers*Jane Eyre is an orphan who is living with her aunt, who is not a very compassionate woman, nor are her cousins. She suffers a lot in that house. Jane is a spirited girl, she believes she should be treated fairly and even knows there is injustice in the way her Aunt and her cousins treat her. She also believes in speaking her mind.The Aunt gets tired of her and sends her to an orphanage school at the age of 10 where she spends the next 8 years of her life.' I loved the life she described in the school. This section I found very similar to Anne of green gables. Not that there was anything similar in their circumstances but I found their natures quite similar.\\"A great deal: you are good to those who are good to you. It is all I ever desire to be. If people were always kind and obedient to those who are cruel and unjust, the wicked people would have it all their own way: they would never feel afraid, and so they would never alter, but would grow worse and worse. When we are struck at without a reason, we should strike back again very hard; I am sure we should--so hard as to teach the person who struck us never to do it again.\\"Jane works for 2 years as a teacher in the same school before she gets bored with the monotony and decides to explore something else. She applies for the post of a governess and gets a letter from Mrs. Fairfax. When Jane reaches there she finds out that Adele, her pupil is Mr. Rochester's ward and Mrs. Fairfax is the housekeeper.Mr. Rochester is the hero of course. As romance builds up, Rochester proposes to her and on the day of their marriage she finds out that he is already married, albeit to a lunatic. She leaves the house the same night without informing anyone and loses touch with him. She builds a life for herself as a village school teacher and in the end returns to find Rochester blind and his wife dead.What I really liked about the book was that the author seemed to talk to the readers directly. She addresses the readers pulling them into the story very quickly.I found the book a little too descriptive and the language, although very beautiful, very tedious a times.At the very end, when Jane learns of Rochester's ill fate from the manager of the Inn, she decides to go and meet him. I was so excited at this point, I could hardly stay still. I wanted to find out what happened instantly. But again, there were so many descriptions of the path and of the house, I was really irritated.I proceeded: at last my way opened, the trees thinned a little; presently I beheld a railing, then the house--scarce, by this dim light, distinguishable from the trees; so dank and green were its decaying walls. Entering a portal, fastened only by a latch, I stood amidst a space of enclosed ground, from which the wood swept away in a semicircle. There were no flowers, no garden-beds; only a broad gravel-walk girdling a grass-plat, and this set in the heavy frame of the forest. The house presented two pointed gables in its front; the windows were latticed and narrow: the front door was narrow too, one step led up to it.I mean hello? At this point I wasn't really interested in reading about whether there were flowers in the path or not. I was way too impatient and I admit I skipped a lot from that chapter.*****end spoiler******And Rochester? I think he spoke too much. At one point I wanted to say, \`Oh stop talking already'. I thought he was selfish and manipulative. I realized that I will love the book more when I read it for the second time. As I already know the story I won't skip anything and I am sure I will appreciate the language even more.Although I loved the book and although it's supposed to be one of the greatest love stories, Pride and Prejudice is still on top of my list. And Darcy is still the yummiest of all the literary heroes."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"These clothbound Penguin classics are even more beautiful in person!

Don't be afraid to order this \\"bargain Kindle edition\\" - it came through perfectly, no strange charaters or problems."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"Shortly put Jane Eyre is a story that stays with you long after you have finished reading the book. It is no wonder this tale has been dubbed a classic and remains in popular demand today. It is a wonder to be taken back to a time where people actually stood for their morals and what was right, although this lends to the most frustrating element of the story. The plot between Jane and Mr. Rochester, at its core, is one that subsequent love stories of our time try to emulate (dare I say even the Twilight series borrow from Jane Eyre's sorrow, struggle, and passion). As an avid book reader, this one is placed at the top of my list and in my heart!A true must read for all women!"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"This book is currently my favorite novel. I suggest it to anyone and everyone. Jane Eyre was always so interesting and absolutely never boring. Each part of the novel was so enjoyable to read because I got to experience Jane's experiences and adventures with her simultaneously. The whole novel was so youthful and vivacious. I always was yearning for more. And the characters in the novel were so complex, yet identical to the complexity that each individual possesses. This novel is definitely a classic that is entertaining and well-written. Bronte exhibits a sense of expertise with her writing. I adored her writing stylistically. All of her words flowed so fluidly, which I think was conducive to my strong liking for this novel. In the end, I think that anyone would really find this book as an incredible read. I STRONGLY suggest that this novel is read immediately!"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"The story is the same, but Dame Darcy's gothic illustrations provide a unique perspective on the characters and scenes, making another read through the timeless Bronte novel a must. If you're a Bronte fan, a gothic fan, or simply a fan of the classics, this book won't disappoint."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"The book Jane Eyre was only okay. In the beginning it was very hard to get in to. Nothing interesting really happened until later on in the book. It was also really boring in parts when she described things like the weather. She would go in to so much detail and drag it on forever. There would be pages of her describing one thing. In a way it can be good because you can really make a good picture in your head, but it can get really annoying and boring fast. As the book went on it did seem to pick up a little bit. There were very interesting things actually happening in the book. There were times where I did not want to set down the book. For instance, I liked how the main character, Jane, wasn't the rich, beautiful, popular girl. She was plain and simple. I liked this because it is different from most other books. It shows a life about a girl who, like most of us, does not get everything she wants. I really enjoyed that part of the story. I also enjoyed the part when she inherited a lot of money from her uncle. At the same time she learned about three new cousins of hers. Not even knowing them, she split her money. It showed how much she cared about family more than money. That was a good lesson in the book. In another part of the book there is something that goes along with that and that is when Mr. Rochester tells Jane about Adele and her mother. He took care of Adele even though he did not believe that she was even his. That showed some responsibility in Mr. Rochester. However there were a lot of things that happened in the book that I did not like. I did not like Mr. Rochester. He was a selfish liar. It seemed like he was always keeping a different secret and lying about it. He lied to Jane many times but yet they still get married. I thought that was ridiculous. At first I thought Jane was stronger than that, but this really showed how weak she was. She went back to him although he kept lying to her. I mean he had a wife who needed help locked up on the third floor. That seemed a little too crazy to fall in love with a guy who does that. I felt like she got married because she did not want to be so lonely and she did not really care what kind of person it was she did marry. Although, she did know that she did not want to marry Mr. St. John which was a good thing because I do not think that he wanted to marry her for the right reasons. After Jane told him that she did not want to marry him, he went right back to his religion and it did not really bother him. Overall, the book was not the best or anything. It had a couple parts I enjoyed. On the other hand, there were many parts that either bored me or annoyed me."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"Beware when you buy this tape.

It is a stupid excuse for a romance novel and I found the long and detailed descriptions of nothing, utterly boring. It is a set text for our school but even our English class couldn't bear to read the whole thing so we skimmed chapter by chapter, gave up and watched the film (which I might add didn't resembled the book at all). I am quite well educated, have a good understanding of the english language and apprieciate good books, but I was appalled at this ridiculous fairy story and I believe it should be taken off schools set text lists."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"I truly cannot understand why anyone would be awed by Jane Eyre. Charlotte Bronte has trouble explaining the setting of the scenes, for one. Normally, the average reader can comprehend what the setting is like just by reading a few well-written lines. But Bronte bores the reader by over-explaining the setting, as if we needed to know every single detail. Unfortunately, it is this lengthy prose that makes the story itself hard to read. Secondly, the characters are bland, which makes the difficulty even greater. Maybe with livelier characters this novel would be easier to read. Unfortunately, this novel is required reading in certain parts of the nation. This bland, boring novel is not the way to spark reading with young adults."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"I was forced to read this book for summer reading. No ways around it.

If this book had an unknown date and author I'd of thought it was another one of those trashy &quot;love&quot; novels written by Danielle Steel. Pure crap.

I smelt the musty, stale pipe smoke, observed the dimly lit room, and heard the russle of the ladies starched skirts.For my first attempt at such a novel, I wasn't let down, in fact I was disappointed when the book ended, wanting to stay in the life of Jane Eyre.

Well I'm glad I invested the time to prove that was wrong!Jane Eyre is, ultimately, a story of human values and the serious choices in life we all must make from time to time. While not an especially plausible story, it is moving and thought-provoking. I certainly think it would make for required reading for all teenagers; it delivers an excellent message (IMHO) contrary to what seems an obsession of young(er) people of money, good-looks, and &quot;independence at all costs&quot;.As a slight demerit, Jane Eyre isn't the best written novel. Some of the characterizations are weak, and the novel lacks the powerful prose of the works from George Eliott. And the story is a bit wobbly in the beginning.

I read it once a year, and I also have the movie. This is a very captivating book. The descriptions are very vivid and full of life. The love that grew between Jane and Edward survived many hardships, and their romance is one to dream about. Even though the book was written long ago, it still fits in with modern life. It is very easy to lose yourself in this wonderfully written book. This is a book that I think everyone should read.

Even though the vocabulary is somewhat challenging, it was worth it (even if you need a dictionary:)! I enjoyed reading it because it was well-written. Charlotte Bronte has a way of writing descriptions of characters and dialogue with humor. It's also nice to read a book and to be able to say it was worth reading. It doesn't have unpleasant surprises or unnecessary details of violence. It doesn't dwell on violence, either. Though Jane has a rather depressing time in her early life, she doesn't dwell on being unhappy (She kind of reminds me of Cinderella).

Don't miss it! It is so different from nowadays' garbage that we all come across so often!"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"JANE EYRE is a novel of destroyed conventions. At nearly each and every turn within its pages, there is some rule, some assumption of character and plot destroyed. In JANE EYRE, women fight back against tyrannical husbands, governesses \`look above their stations', mothers are absent and men are punished for their subjugation of women. Not content to only poke at society through the safety of a fictional character, Bronte also confronts literary conventions, constructing JANE EYRE as a Bildungsroman about a WOMAN, and an UNATTRACTIVE woman to boot. Is nothing sacred? NO. And this is what makes JANE EYRE such a wonderful read. Looking for just great wit, nascent feminism and in general a pretty good story addled with a few boring inanities about day-to-day life? Go buy a Jane Austen novel. JANE EYRE is nearly the antithesis of orderly Austen, a passionate display of feelings and emotions that would have made Austen's EMMA blush, a full-blown rebellion against the societal constraints upon women.\\"Women are supposed to be very calm generally: but women feel just as men feel; they need exercise for their faculties...they suffer from too rigid a restraint, too absolute a stagnation, precisely as men would suffer; and it is narrow-minded in their more privileged fellow creatures to say that they ought to confine themselves...\\" Within these few scathing lines is contained almost the entire sociological crux of the novel. For Jane, though outwardly calm as \\"women are supposed to be\\", is often raging inside at various acts of injustice perpetrated upon her. Sometimes she releases her feelings and vents, other times she swallows it \\"as women are supposed to\\" do. At this period of time, women in the upper class were mostly ornaments. When men spoke of their accomplishments, they meant things like a woman's ability to speak French, or her grace while playing a piano. Her business acumen would most likely not be counted an accomplishment, but a detraction, a manifestation of too spirited a personality, or too lively a mind. Hopeful mammas made sure that their little girls learned all the correct dances, could play an instrument and sing, or embroider, NOT complete ledgers. Bronte is urging that her fellow women not be confined to the pursuit of such activities, but allowed to exercise their minds and emotions in whatever direction they might want to...and in 1841!It's a wild ride that never ceases to be entertaining. Don't miss JANE EYRE."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"This book is the best book I have ever read. I mean what more could a girl want out of a book. ...

Her reading voice is pleasant and natural-sounding and she conveys just the right amount of emotion. She also manages to vary the tone of her voice just enough that can differentiate between characters but not so much that she sounds foolish.The only drawback to this audio book is that it is recorded on two tracks. That means you have to listen to each tape twice, setting it either to the full right or full left speaker of your stereo.

The dark tone and twisted love story are all to analogous traits of Emily's Bronte's story, &quot;Wuthering Heights.&quot; Much like Charlotte, Jane is an unattractive girl, who grows up in a school for girls where the accomidations are all but comfortable. She grows to be very inteligent, however, is not the most sought after girl in England. She becomes a governess for a man named Mr. Rochester. Jane is in love with Mr. Rochester, but his dark secrets and overbearing temper are almost too much for Jane to live with. Of all the Bronte books, Jane Eyre is among the finest. The relationship between Jane and Mr. Rochester is interesting and encapturing, but the life of Jane, and her triumphs are far more compelling. Jane Eyre is a classic, that should be read at least once, if not more, by every girl who is searching for a place in this world. The expierences Jane has on her road to becoming a woman are a very interesting reflection of Charlotte Bronte's encounters.

I was assigned to read it for school and am now completely obsessed. I have three different copies of the story, but my first copy was this cover.What makes this book endurable and able to plow through for the first one-hundred-thirty pages and then keep reading for the next three-hundred-forty-one is the characterization. You love Jane, you hate Mr. Brocklehurst, and I don't know about anybody else, but I loved Mr. Rochester, Helen Burns, and Diana and hated St. John Rivers and Mrs. Reed. All characters stir feelings of either love or hate in you. This truly is the first, and the best, soap opera in the world!I was told by some that they thought the ending lacked - ha ha! The ending couldn't have been better in my opinion. I, personally, didn't see it coming. When Jane was actually contemplating marrying St. John Rivers, I openly yelled \\"No! No! You can't marry him! You love Mr. Rochester whether he's married to a lunatic or not! Don't marry the moron! He's forcing you into it!\\"This book evoked emotions from me I've never gotten before while reading a book. It evoked emotions I never even got watching a movie. Well, maybe it did, only they were excrutiatingly amplified. It was painful to read of Jane leaving Thornfield, even more painful to watch this self-respecting woman beg for food, and yet uplifting to read of her scorning St. John's idea of love and Mrs. Fairfax's label of \\"beggar.\\"All in all, whether you're assigned to read it or not, \\"Jane Eyre\\" is overly well worth its 461 pages."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"Dear Anti-Bronte readersI beg you, don't review the books that you read in English class. I noticed that you tend to get to be prejudiced against the book... What do you mean that it's a child's foolery? What do you mean that the author had nothing better to do? Do you know that Bronte was very ill from the beginning of her life and the literature was the only thing that could keep her going up to her short life? Do you know that her beautiful symbolisms and enormous passion for life, let aside the unique plot and attractive characters, reflect her deep understanding of history and literature? She is a thoroughly educated and intelligent author. Her conversations are deliberately yet unconsciously designed. A choice of a word, a sentense is one by one patient, full of love, and &quot;complete beauty, like a Greek statue of Apollo... (quoted from the book)&quot; I can't praise this book enough, I'm usually very tough on literatures... I even think Kafka's Metamorphosis, with its moving plot and unique characters, is 4.5 out 5 stars... So read more and get some real experience, before you do actual reviewing.

I just decided to buy it on impulse really, not knowing what I was getting myself into. I opened the book and was immedeately swept into Jane Eyre's world. My mind played out all of the scenes as I read, only a truly masterful piece of work could create images so strongly right from the start. Charlotte Bronte creates a masterful work of art on the pages of this book.When the book begins, you are taken into Jane's childhood, and given a sense of what it's like to have no love, and no hope of the future. You can actually see the pain on Jane's face. Then at Lowood, you learn with her, and grow with her. Finally, on the night she arrives at Thornfield Hall you are overcome with anticipation for Jane. What is this life going to be like? Then when Edward Rochester appears, you hate him. You can't believe that he talks to her that way. After a while though, things soften, and Miss Bronte introduces a new feeling. Love. The painting seems complete when Jane and Mr. Rochester confess their feelings, and you wonder, what could possibly be better than this? The ending,(which I won't give away)is absolutely breathtaking. I cried for a half an hour when I read it. It was at four in the morning mind you,(the book was so good I could not put it down.)The characters in the novel are whole, they seem like real people. Charlotte Bronte uses her pen to paint a wonderful picture, one can not help but be engulfed in the color. The book has lasted almost 200 years, I see no reason why it could not last forever. If you ever want to read a classic love story that defines the power of women in literature, then Charlotte Bronte's Jane Eyre is it. I'm 16 years old, and if a teenager can be moved to tears while reading, it must be quite a piece of literature. I walked away feeling like I had taken an amazing journey, and found a new friend in Jane Eyre."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"&quot;Jane Eyre&quot; is a classic of English literature and, although it's easy to see why, I do feel the author missed some opportunities to make this very good book even better.The character of Jane Eyre is a very believable and sympathetic protagonist. No, she's not perfect, as a child or as an adult, and this is all to the the good. She is warm and caring with a tremendous capacity for love to which, understandably, she's afraid to give free rein.Jane's years as a child, both with her relatives and at school, are interesting, but only to a point. They seemed to drag and I was so glad when she finally graduated and the story &quot;really began.&quot;It was during the middle section of the book, during Jane's time in Mr. Rochester's employ, that I felt Bronte missed several good opportunities to &quot;up&quot; both the suspense and the reader's interest. For example, we learn too quickly who Mrs. Rochester is and why she does the things she does. I think Bronte should have built this section up more slowly.After Jane leaves the Rochester estate, her meeting with her &quot;new&quot; family is extremely far-fetched. I know, readers weren't as demanding in Bronte's day as they are now, but still, I thought this was the weakest section of the book and the least interesting by far.Overall, I think &quot;Jane Eyre&quot; is a book that clearly showcases the class distinctions of the times. This is particularly evident in the early chapters, when Jane is still a child and in the chapters that take place during her employment in the Rochester household.&quot;Jane Eyre&quot; is a book that's dated, of course. Times change and reading tastes do, too. If one keeps this in mind, &quot;Jane Eyre&quot; should prove to be both a memorable and enjoyable reading experience."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"Have you ever wanted someone to notice your personality instead of focusing on your outer appearance?

Jane is very much in love with Mr. Rochester, as you can see by this quote: &quot;[He] was becoming to me, my whole world; almost my hope of heaven. He stood between me and every thought of religion, as an eclipse intervenes between man and the broad sun. I could not, in those days, see God for His creature: of whom I had made an idol.As you can see, Jane Eyre is a complicated novel, but worth the time it takes to read it. This classic, once published under the pseudonym of Currer Bell, will make an excellent addition to any young reader's personal library."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"I love this book. I probably first read it when I was 15. Since then I read it 3 or 4 times and each time I could't put book away until very late at night. Certainly my favorite love story. I would say that this book is more for younger ladies and I am not expecting too many young man to read it."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"There's no need for me to retell the contents of this book here - it's a classic and most of us have read it before. I'm here to express my admiration and love for this book. I've read it more times than I can possibly remember. It is most definitely one of my favorites. It contains one of the most well-known love stories and one of the most well known coming-of-age stories of all time. Cannot be missed! If you skipped reading this in school or have simply forgotten what the talented miss Bronte wrote then I highly recommend reading this and (re)introducing yourself to the story that has inspired millions."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"I can't believe how long it took me to pick this book up and read it. It was never on any assigned reading lists and it wasn't until a few years after college, when I had more time for pleasure reading, that I started on the unassigned classics that I had missed by having a science-based major. It is one of my top five favorite books and absolutely my favorite classic, topping even Pride and Prejudice (which I also love). It has rich, well-written characters, terrific heroine and hero, and contains both tragedy and ultimately, happiness. Worth the time to read and even re-read it."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"Jane EyreWhile another review on this novel is certainly not required and I doubt that I will say anything that has not already been said I will still forge ahead. While I fancy myself well read this is one of the \\"classics\\" that I had ignored until my high school age daughter performed the role of Grace Pool in the musical. It so interested me that I decided to read the book and once I started I literally could not put it down. What a fascinating story! Themes of abuse, bitterness, friendship, betrayal, disappointment, integrity, forgiveness, love, etc. The story is full of intricate plot lines and wonderful and memorable characters. By the end of the book you know these people and you are rejoicing, empathizing, laughing and weeping with them. If you have not read \\"Jane Eyre\\" do yourself a favor, turn off the TV, and settle down for a enjoyable and poignant reading experience."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"It's hard to imagine a better gothic romance than \\"Jane Eyre\\" -- gloomy vast houses, mysterious secrets, and a brooding haunted man with a dark past.In fact, Charlotte Bronte's classic novel has pretty much everything going for it -- beautiful settings, a passionate romance tempered by iron-clad morals, and a heroine whose poverty and lack of beauty only let her brains and courage shine brighter. And it's all wrapped in the misty, haunting atmosphere of a true gothic story -- madwoman in the attic and all.Jane Eyre was an orphan, abused and neglected first by relatives, then by a boarding school run by a tyrannical, hypocritical minister. But Jane refuses to let anyone shove her down -- even when her saintly best friend dies from the wretched conditions.But many years later, Jane moves on by applying to Thornfield Hall for a governess position, and gets the job. She soon becomes the teacher and friend to the sprightly French girl Adele, but is struck by the dark, almost haunted feeling of her new home.Then she runs into a rather surly horseman -- who turns out to be her employer, Mr. Rochester, a cynical, embittered man who spends little time at Thornfield. They are slowly drawn together into a powerful love, despite their different social stations -- and Rochester's apparent attentions to a shallow, snotty aristocrat who wants his wealth and status.But strange things are happening at Thornfield -- stabbings, fires, and mysterious laughter. Jane and Rochester finally confess their feelings to each other, but their wedding is interrupted when Rochester's dark past comes to light. Jane flees into the arms of long-lost family members, and is offered a new life -- but her love for Rochester is not so easily forgotten...\\"Jane Eyre\\" is one of those books that transcends the labels of genre. Charlotte Bronte spun a haunting gothic romance around her semi-autobiographical heroine and Byronic anti-hero, filling it with brilliant writing and solid plot. It has everything all the other gothic romances of the time had... but Bronte gave it depth and intensity without resorting to melodrama.Bronte wrote in the usual stately prose of the time, but it has a sensual, lush quality, even in the dank early chapters at Lowood. At Thornfield, the book acquires an overhanging atmosphere of foreboding, until the clouds clear near the end. And she wove some tough questions into Jane's perspective -- that of a woman's independence and strength in a man's world, of extreme religion, and of the clash between morals and passion.And Bronte also avoided any tinges of drippy sentimentality (Mrs. Reed dies still spewing venom) while injecting some hauntingly nightmarish moments (\\"She sucked the blood: she said she'd drain my heart\\"). She even manages to include some funny stuff, such as Rochester disguising himself as an old gypsy woman.The story does slow down after the abortive wedding, when Jane flees Thornfield and briefly considers marrying a repressed clergyman who wants to go die preaching in India. It's rather boring to hear the self-consciously saintly St. John prattling about himself, instead of Rochester's barbed wit. But when Jane departs again, the plot speeds up into a nice, mellow little finale.Bronte did a brilliant job of bringing her heroine to life -- as a defiant little girl who is condemned for being \\"passionate,\\" as an independent young lady, and as a woman torn between love and principle. Jane's strong personality and wits overwhelm the basic fact that she's not unusually pretty. And Rochester is a brilliantly sexy Byronic anti-hero with a prickly, mercurial wit.Of Charlotte Bronte's few novels, \\"Jane Eyre\\" is undoubtedly the most brilliant -- passionate, dark and hauntingly eerie. Definitely a must-read."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"I ordered this book along with Pride and Prejudice. They are more beautiful in person that in the pictures. Very well made and durable and the paper is thick and high quality so they will hold up even if you read them over and over as I do with my favorites. Jane Eyre is one of my favorite novels. The story is such a wonderful mix of classic romance but with splashes of the dark and supernatural. I highly recommend these gorgeous penguine classics to everybody and I can't wait to order the rest of them for myself."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"On October 16th, of 1847, \\"Jane Eyre: An Autobiography\\", edited by Currier Bell (pseudonym of Charlotte Bront) was published. It created some controversy at the time, as many believed it was written by a man. The novel was very popular when published, but critical reaction to it varied. Today, it is clearly a classic, the development of a young woman, who does not fit into the stereotype of a nineteenth century woman. She is not submissive, and she struggles to avoid being dependent on others. The original publication was in three volumes, but this Penguin Classics edition is based on the third edition of Jane Eyre, and it is the last edition which Charlotte Bront edited and corrected.The story covers Jane's life from her childhood until her marriage. The childhood chapters can be split into two sections, those where Jane, an orphan, was being raised by her Uncle's family, but her uncle has passed away and her aunt does not like her, but was forced to promise to take care of her. The key parts of this section are Jane's being rejected by the closest thing she has to a family, her morality, and her independence, i.e. her refusal to conform. The second part of her childhood is when she is sent to attend a charity school, called Lowood, where the pupils have to make do with substandard food and clothing. Here Jane finds one teacher who treats her, and the other students, well, Miss Maria Temple. One of the key things in this section is the difference between religion and morality, symbolized by Mr. Brocklehurst a clergyman who is mostly responsible for the appalling conditions at Lowood, and Jane and Miss Temple on the side of morality. Also key is Jane's witnessing her friend, Helen Burns, dying from a typhus epidemic, in spite of her goodness and her submission to the standards imposed by Mr. Brocklehurst and Miss Scatcherd, a teacher as cruel as Miss Temple is kind.The story then picks up many years later, with Jane in position as a teacher at Lowood, but looking to move on. She advertises for a position as a governess and is hired by Mrs. Fairfax. She is to take care of Ad&egrave;le Varens, a girl who is being taken care of by Mr. Rochester, the master of Thornfield Manor where Mrs. Fairfax is the housekeeper. This section has a lot to do with class, as well as morality. There is the difficulty of Jane falling in love with someone of a different class. There is also the looking down on Jane as being of a lower class, by Mr. Rochester's peers. The morality questions are here to, in the comparison of the higher classes verses that of the lower class. Even Mr. Rochester's behavior is in question, in the events leading up to Jane leaving. Jane also finds out that she does have family left, and when it appears that she is to have everything, she sends a letter to her father's brother. It is this attempt to reconnect with family that causes her to lose nearly everything as it destroys what she thought she was about to have.The next section details Jane's life after leaving Thornfield Manor. Here she loses almost everything, and is on death's door when she is on the doorstep of Moor House. The Rivers, St. John, Diana, and Mary. It is from this state of having nothing from which she recovers almost everything she could want. Here she recovers her health, she is employed again and regains much of her independence. St. John is in love with a woman, but he will not ask her because he is driven to devote his life to religion. He does find out Jane's true identity though, and this results in Jane learning she has family, and wealth that she didn't know she had. She is pressured by St. John to marry him and join him in his missionary life, but she knows that he doesn't love her. She rejects St. John, and instead goes to find her one love, Mr. Rochester. She now has wealth and family, and she learns that tragedies in Mr. Rochester's life have made what was once impossible possible.It is a long and winding road which Jane travels in this novel. Probably best classified as a gothic romance, it deals with numerous issues and the strength of Jane's character serves as a good role model for young women, and for that matter anyone. The Penguin Classics edition is filled with supporting documentation as always. There is a wonderful introduction by Stevie Davies, along with a Chronology, suggestions for further reading, notes on the text, opinions of the press, and wonderful textual notes which enhance the reading experience and understanding of the reader."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"Never being a great fan of the Victorian period of English literature, I have always steered clear of the sisters Bronte, Jane Austin, and others of their ilk. It is amazing how much we miss when blinded by prejudice. I not only liked Jane Eyre immensely, but was very impressed by the literary abilities of Charlotte Bronte and regretted that I had not read the novel sooner. Although Bronte did not have the formal education and did not share the literary traditions enjoyed by some of her male colleagues, she grew up in a household in which storytelling was prominent and understood that the first task of any writer is the ability to tell a good story. Jane Eyre is a wonderful creation, a story that keeps the reader's interest from the first, and one in which Bronte introduces to the reading public one of the first truly modern heroines.Charlotte Bronte's novel is a complex and structured work and contains within it elements of romance, picaresque wanderings and a preoccupation for the Gothic themes of mystery and the supernatural. But to describe the work simply as a very good Gothic novel would be to ignore the remarkable characterization that Bronte achieves in the creation of the character of Jane Eyre. Bronte's character is quite unique when compared to other female heroines of the era. Jane is not beautiful and does not enjoy any of the privileges of wealth or social position, and it is clear from the beginning that if Jane is to make her way in the world she will have to do it with a combination of hard work and intelligence, and not be afraid to question accepted social conventions. The decision of Bronte to narrate the tale through the eyes of Jane bonds the reader and the main character together creating an intimacy that is first rate. We share all her hardships and experiences from Gateshead to the final reunion with Mr. Rochester, and sympathize with her moral dilemmas and her indignant stand against religious hypocrisy (a feeling strong enough to have her expound more fully in the preface to the second edition of her novel: \\"[The world] may hate him who dares to scrutinise and expose - to rase the gilding, and show base metal under it - to penetrate the sepulchre, and reveal charnel relics: but, hate as it will, it is indebted to him\\").Although the creation of the character of Jane is Bronte's greatest achievement, she is possessed with the talent to write a story that is exciting, mysterious and ultimately rewarding - in other words, a pure classic. Bronte may not possess in full the literary style of some of her contemporaries, but she writes with assurance and surprises the reader with some extraordinary passages, beautiful examples that combine nostalgia, religious mysticism and poetic rhythm into a wonderful prose. The influence of the book is still alive over a century later. Jean Rhys uses the novel as the point of departure for her Wide Sargasso Sea, and groups as divergent as Marxists, feminists, and Horatio Alger types all use the book as part of their lexicon."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"Let me just be out with it: I love Jane Eyre. It is my mom's favorite novel of all times and definitely in my (constantly changing) top 5. The Dover Thrift Edition is a wonderfully inexpensive way to get wonderful literature into people's hands, so I am pro-Dover, all the way. But to speak to the novel itself, it's a classic that's been remade into films so many times because it is a great story artfully told. Jane is one of my all-time favorite literary characters, and almost definitely my favorite female one. If you hate romance novels which have the prerequisite of a jaw-droppingly beautiful heroine, let me introduce you to Miss Eyre (though if she were alive today, she might insist on Ms.) Jane is described as \\"plain\\" throughout the novel, and this not-terribly-flattering adjective applies to her on several levels (her appearance, her plain-speaking manner, her direct way of dealing with problems). Because of the first-person narration and the abundance of details of her early life, the reader is drawn into a close relationship with Jane, and to know her is to love her. Here is someone I readily admire with her pluck and nerve tempered by a healthy dose of humility. Jane seems like such a real person as we get right inside her thoughts and see her deepest longings, doubts, and fears. To me the most telling scene is (hopefully not too much of a spoiler) when Jane unfavorably compares herself to Mr. Rochester's presumed sweetheart, the beautiful Blanche Ingraham. To cure herself of any flights of romantic fantasy she may be tempted to indulge in over her boss, she forces herself to make two very realistic drawings, one of herself and one of Blanche, and study them closely, hoping to cure herself of the foolish notion that a man might prefer her to gorgeous Blanche. Wow, what a woman! How many of us have the strength of will or character to study our weaknesses in as strong a light as possible in order to disabuse ourselves of notions we fear may be dangerous? Jane certainly doesn't suffer from the too-common (modern?) disease of self-importance, and we see how this, combined with her certain moral compass, guide her to do the right thing(s) even when they are not in any way fun or pleasant. Pick up a copy of Jane Eyre if you haven't read it before and give one of British literature's most interesting creations the chance to win you over."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"Some modern readers may find it hard to believe that this little Gothic novel created quite the scandal in its day. The novel is based on an orphan by the name of Jane Eyre, who is raised by her aunt, the cold-hearted and cruel Mrs Reed. Jane's early childhood is one marked by violence and neglect. Early on, however, the readers learn that little Jane Eyre has a fiery spirit that refuses to become a victim of its oppressive enviroment. She boldly lashes out at those who mean to demean her and constantly remind of her station in life.When Jane fondest wish comes true, she leaves behind her wretched existence at Gateshead House and arrives at Lowood school. Jane's life at the orphan boarding school proves just as trying as her time at Gateshead. Behind the walls of Lowood, Jane suffers many privations and witnesses many acts of cruelty. She remains at Loowood for eight years, first as a pupil then as a teacher. Jane's urgent need for change prompts her to seek a position as a governess. She finds such a position at Thornfield Hall, the home of Edward Rochester, who the narrator falls deeply in love with.The character of Jane Eyre is extremely modern. Readers today will have little problem identifying with her thoughts and wishes. Although of low social standing, Jane speaks her mind to those who mean to subdue her. She reminds her aunt of her promise to look after her when she abuses her as a child. She defies the teachers at Lowood. She refuses to become Mr Rochester's mistress. Jane choses her own happiness over what is expected of her, not a very attractive quality in women in Victorian society, but one modern readers can sympathize withCharlotte Bronte used several personal life experiences as inspiration for this novel. Like Jane, Charlotte attended a boarding school, where she experienced many of the tribulations Jane suffered. The death of Helen Burns at Lowood from tuberculosis was inspired by the death of her sisters Elizabeth and Maria, at The Clergy Daughter's School from the same disease. Jane Eyre is one of the best classics. It's dark and tragic, yet emotional and even amusing at times. Definitely one of my favorites."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"JANE EYRE WAS A BOOK OF WONDERFUL DESCRIPTION.

Needless to say, I never finished it. Then a few years ago I read Jasper Fforde's hilarious book, The Eyre Affair, which uses Jane Eyre as a backdrop, and I decided to pick up the book again.When I began reading, I got frustrated with the excessive description and the unlikable characters at the beginning of the book. But I pushed through, and by the time I was half finished, I couldn't put the book down. On the surface Jane Eyre is a compelling love story, but underneath it is a heavy handed take on the scripture \\"if your right hand causes you to sin, then cut it off. And if your eye causes you to sin, then gouge it out.\\" Despite the excessive description of trees and sunsets, Jane Eyre gives readers much to think about."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"I've read Jane Eyre many times over the years, but this time on my Kindle.

Everyone has gone into the gist of the tale but I will tell you what I find most facinating.Charlotte Bronte wrote this in the first half of the 1800's. It's amazing that a woman in that century would be so bold & outspoken. Not only is Charlotte of this character but so is our heroine, Jane Eyre. In the year 2012 not many would find her personality unique but when reading consider that age in which this was written.

She was a well rounded character...and every page of her story was vivid and interesting...but I just never really adored her as a character.She is not weak...she's more gentle...strong in character...but gentle...delicate and fierce in character. It's a bit hard to explain...but that's the reason I found it hard to relate.It was also tough because she at 18 yrs is so much like a girl and she falls in love with a man. It's well written...believable and I guess romantic...but it's hard to think of it that way because I never felt for Jane or Mr. Rochester or even some of the background characters enough to be enthralled by their stories.I did like little Adele though (partly because she was French and partly because she always spoke her mind.

She met each obstacle in her life as a student and governess with courage and spirit. As a governess, she fell in love with her employer, Mr. Rochester, who had a terrible secret from his past; however, their bond was so strong that it overcame even this obstacle.

The story of three sisters&#34; and took a &#34;time out&#34; from the biography to re-read all of Jane Eyre. I loved it as much as I ever have but this time I knew what parts were autobiographical and where the basic concept for the story came from. Interestingly, I had always thought the part between the time she leaves Thornfield and returns was rather less vivid than the rest. Turns out most contemporary reviewers thought so as well. Still, knowing that the marriage proposal from St. John Rivers has a basis in Charlotte Bronte's life made it more interesting this time around. I highly recommend both books."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"I've deeply enjoyed this classical novel of Charlotte Bront. It is the first book I've read in english,(being spanish my language) since I left school, 52 years ago.I loved the main character, Jane Eyre; her bright intelligence, her moral values, her determination to get the better of life's challenges and the way she loved without expecting anything in return.II find that it answers to the expectations of truth and right of people of any time."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"The novel I read \\"Jane Eyre\\" was very interesting. Jane Eyre was a little orphanage girl, that lived with a family she did not love. Jane didn't feel as if that was her home. Jane says, \\"I was like nobody there. If they did not love me, in fact, as little as I did them.\\" There was to main people that had hurt her the most physically and mentally, Master Reed and Mrs. Reed . Master Reed was a cruel young boy. He liked to criticize, make fun of, and hurt Jane. He thought he was the boss and owned everything in the house. In the book it says that Jane was reading a book and he came along and asked, \\"Why are you touching my stuff? Everything in here will belong to me one day.\\" She responded, \\"I'm only reading a book.\\" He made her look away and threw the book to her head. Master Reed didn't get in trouble at all, because he was Mrs. Reed precious son.Another thing that interested me is that she was a girl that wanted to be different. No matter how people looked down at her, or ridiculed her, she was always determined to be someone in life. Mrs. Reed was very cruel to Jane because she was trying every way possible to put her in school or send her away. Jane began to think that she wasn't good enough for that family. They had downgraded her so much, that Jane began to think bad about herself. Jane began to think to herself, \\" What thought had I been but just conceiving of starving myself to death? She wanted someone to care about her and show her love. This novel would be good for a person looking for motivation or a book that is very inspiring. I recommend this book because it is a very detailed and is a very heartwarming book."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"I do not believe I have read this before and am looking forward to reading it now.Again, I appreciate it being available on Kindle."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"Jane Eyre is the story about a young daughter in England who lost her parents and was taken in by her affluent but abusive relatives. Jane Eyre is a curious, intelligent and emotionally volatile girl, who we witness grow up into a woman, seeking to make connections with the world around her. There are so many great elements to this story that, considering how long ago it was written, seem novel and suggestive of feminism. Jane Eyre does not take crap from anyone, and is very honest, candid and assertive about this. She is devoted to making a life for herself without anyone else's help. She listens to her instincts, and let them guide her through the course of her life, not matter what the perceived cost may be.I found this story compelling. Even though the subject matter wasn't gripping or exhilarating, the manner in which it was written was enough to keep me interested every page of the way. The word choice and flow were so well done that I feel like I'm floating down the stream of consciousness that the author expertly disseminates through her passion and skill. Very rarely do I feel so brought into a story principally through its substance. This book is well worth the read!"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"How many good things can I say about Jane Eyre.

The story of this girl fascinated me. I loved the language and emotion, and the beautiful picture of a life well lived that the author has managed to depict so carefully. As for this edition, there are a few errors, but the narration makes up for it. Even when I first read the book, I was not so completely immersed in the story as I was this time with the narration.

I refer to her descriptions of out door scenes. However I did become bored with her lengthy and imaginary conversations with her admirers which accounts for the low rating.I have seen this book described as an auto biography. That cannot be so.

My sister and I decided a few years ago to read some of the 'classics' we had overlooked. Jane Eyre was our first selection. We are forever grateful we did not pass through this life without reading it. Oh, what we would have missed!"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"Oh how I love this novel! Jane Eyre is one of those novels that I can read over and over again and get something new out of it every time. I consider it to be one of the most readable classics, one I can just pick up and lose myself in it without even thinking about it. To me, that's a testament to how well it holds up, there aren't too many classics I can say that about because I find so many of them to be rather plodding.This time around, I found myself to be much more emotional about the trials that Jane goes through. I've gone through quite a few emotional events since the last time I read this one, and that undoubtedly affected my reading of many of the situations Jane is in. I openly wept when reading about her treatment during early childhood at Gateshead and later at Lowell School.As we get towards the middle section of the book, and Jane finds such happiness at Thornfield, I was so elated to witness her journey again. Yet, because I knew where it was going, I found myself deliberately slowing down, as if I could prevent more pain for her simply by reading the story so slowly. Of course, this didn't work and I was soon crying along with Jane again as another misfortune befell her. At some point, I just want poor Jane to catch a break!I think the thing that struck me most during this reading was how incredibly frustrated I was with St. John. Normally my frustration in this book is directed towards Mr. Rochester, he seems so fickle at times and difficult to read. Speaking of, I wasn't ever sure...is Rochester his actual name, or is that his estate/title? I think Fairfax is his real surname but I could be wrong. Those Brits always confuse me with this stuff!Anyway, back to St. John. He really is a good man, you can see it oozing from him, but he is so incredibly stubborn I wanted to reach into the pages and just slap him! I get that things were different back when this was written, and that what Jane proposed to him really just wasn't feasible. My frustration stems from his inability to just let the whole thing go!Given that he basically knows the entirety of Jane's story, I think it's really manipulative of him to continually try to convince her to do what he wants. He's not a stupid man, he knows that Jane longs to be involved with other people and is eager to please due to her childhood being so grim. And rather than taking a truly Christian path by wishing her the best when she makes her own choice, he continues to try and guilt her into doing things his way, even to the detriment of her own health, without any real concern for what may be best for her personally. Maybe it's my own ambivalent religious beliefs that make this more difficult for me, because I just don't believe that Jane should have to give up the things she believes may make her happy simply because St. John believes she *could* be a good servant to the lord. Needless to say, I agree with the choices Jane makes in the end, as she was finally able to do as she pleased.Because this is a reread for me, I knew all the major plot points ahead of time, and I think that knowledge added to the frustration I felt for St. John. With each reading, I feel like I understand Jane a little more, and feel for her more deeply, so I can almost experience the pain she goes through to the point that her conversations with these important people really affect me on an intimate level. I felt my own happiness being ripped away at the same time that Jane did, and that makes her all the more real to me.I've lost count of how many times I've read this novel, but this one really cemented it as my all time favorite classic, and one of the books I recommend to people when they ask for something new to read."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"It was nice to be able to read this classic for free.

A good book worth a read."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"The novel is a compassionate one in which different feelings and characteristics occur at different times but all show different versions of Jane--which is quite impressive. The language is beautifully woven, showing the character's feelings and giving way to shocking occurrances. The tale is not quite original but it does strike the heart--showing society at the time while weaving the tale--the plots just grasp you harder and harder within each chapter--like glue, if you don't try to get out of it, you can't get out--carefully developing the plot with questions, the language, and subtle events that makes the book--not quite original--but giving it a place of its own in the romance genre, getting better and better every time. It is really quite the satisfying experience. Personally, I--not being a picky person--don't have a problem with the printing. The story is enough to change your life if you can be easily shaken by such fictional romance."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"This is a really great book, however not for young kids. i read this book when i was in 7th grade. Being above my reading level i thought i could handle a book like it. To my dismay this book did not statisfy me. To a girl in 7th grade i found it hard to relate to and very wordy. I reread it this year i am a senior in High school and i found my interest in the book had changed i found ways in which i could relate. bottom line...dont make your kids read it!"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"&quot;To prolong doubt was to prolong hope.&quot; - Jane EyreHow true!

Jane Eyre is a turning point for feminist's all over."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"James Joyce called Ulysses the only &quot;complete&quot; man in literature; if this is the case, then Jane Eyre may be the only complete woman in literature. For once, here is a woman who is intelligent, independent, vulnerable, wise, naive, cold, passionate, practical and creative all at same time. She is not someone who is easily placed in a nice, neat category and labeled, and those who call her \\"depressed\\" really miss the point. Although the language may not be modern the topics that Charlotte Bronte discusses are very relevant. What really surprises me is that so many people feel so threatened by such an \\"old\\" book. Why is the theme that you have to follow your own heart rather than the dictates of society so confrontational a subject to some people? It has nothing to do with either sex or gender, just a very human desire for freedom. Maybe some of the book's critics should wait a few years and re-read it when it isn't a required reading.

If you ignore that advice, you might conclude that a woman&#8217;s ideal role is something akin to slavery: total submission to the other gender.Yuk!The two men Jane involves herself with are certainly egomaniacs. Perhaps I&#8217;ve gone too far&#8212;maybe they&#8217;re just maniacs. Maniacs that Jane is more than willing dedicate her life to. The eccentricities of their personalities don&#8217;t bother her at all. What was Bront thinking of?A comparable near contemporary female character is Lizzie Hexam [Our Mutual Friend (Dickens, 1864-65)]. Like Jane, Lizzie was strong. Like Jane, Lizzie submitted herself to a dominant male, Eugene Wrayburn. Perhaps a significant difference is that the man Lizzie served, if not a perfect human, was worlds more appealing (at least to me) than either Eyre&#8217;s Edward Rochester or St. John Rivers.The last third of this book is all the more disappointing because of the quality of the two thirds that preceded it.

I would speak of the unforgettable love story that by some luck befalls on our main character, but the majic and wonder of a love such as that is one that can only be read and imagined- not described by the ordinary writer such as myself"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"Jane Eyre is a tale of love and hope that is inspiring to everyone who has ever wanted something in life. I loved this book because it told of a governess and her life, and the way she falls in love but cannot be married. The book is a perfect 10 in all aspects. I kept turning pages, wanting constantly to know what happened next. This book seemed to breath a life of it's own, which captured my heart. The classic characters and settings brought to life a wonderful place, both dreary and bright. I suggest whole-heartedly that anyone with a love of true literature should read this book"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"A haunting story; a fairy tale in which an orphan and a rich man are involved; a hidden mistery in a mansion; things seem to be continuously happening to Jane; and she is the narrator in a detailed and careful poetical way of her own story since a little girl until a grown woman.Delineated personalities in the characters; every one of them as well as every chapter and every phrase has a reason to be. Nothing to waste in the philosophical underlain contents of this book."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"This book, is without a doubt, simply wonderful. At every turn of the page, you will be fully enveloped into the life of Jane Eyre, a magical yet ordinary girl whose courage and creative spirit will inspire even the most realistic of hearts. Her life and times, told with brilliant eloquence by Charlotte Bronte, will captivate the heart and mind and the end will have you cheering and crying by turns. True love, deception, greed, and bravery are but a few of the themes of this great novel. I can recommend it to anyone competely without reservation! A must-read! Perfect for cold, rainy afternoons with a blanket wrapped around you, you will not, I repeat, will not want to put this book down"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"I was assigned Jane Eyre for an AP English class. I was happily surprised to find that the book was truly a classic, in a sense larger than that of the &quot;classics&quot; spoken of in the literary world. I found the novel to be fascinating, as well as endearing. Just like Conrad's opinion on forgetting novels, I truly don't fear that I will forget the factual details of Jane Eyre, because it has become a part of me, and it will stay with me forever"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"Prior to tackling this work, I had only read one romance novel that I have every liked - Gone with the Wind. Reading Charlotte Bronte's &quot;Jane Eyre&quot; did not change that statistic. While I can acknowledge the worth and eloquence of this novel, I cannot say that I enjoyed it in the least. It took a determined effort for me to read it through, and I was quite relieved to reach the end.From my experience, I have yet to meet any male who has enjoyed this book, and have yet to meet a female that didn't adore it. I don't know what it is about the books by the Bronte sisters and Austen, but for some reason, the gender gap seems a mile wide.For what it is, I am sure it is a great book worthy of the praise it has received."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"It was still well written and CB is good at keeping her readers interested in the characters and the plotting of the story. The ending was rather a bit too predictable for me and after investing two sleepless nights into this book, I was extreamly disappointed in the ending of this story. It is also a romance novel. I am not a great fan of romance novles without a complicated and intensely created plot so this element of the book did not appeal to me at all. I should've read this book as a young adult, as this is the audience the book is geared to. I would've enjoyed it more then. But if you are a fan of romance novels with many trials and tribulations of course thrown in, this is an elegant tale for you.Now in assessing the art of this book. When I first looked through this book and read it I was not happy, though not disappointed in the artwork. After reading this book and looking at the artwork of other versions of this story, I was a little miffed. The artwork is mostly of Jane Eyre, and none of the artwork really captured her features and personality at all. This cast a darkned element over the book and almost \\"forced\\" a victorian viewpoint of this story. I think the artwork of other versions are much better by comparrison."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"Of all classic female authors (Jane Austin, Mary Shelly, for instance), and of all classic novels with a female protagonist, I find Charlotte Bronte as the most brilliant, and Jane Eyre to be the most memorable. I first read this book when i was a freshman in highschool, and loved it. Now I'm reading it as an upcoming college freshman. I not only still love it as I did then, but I'm deeply moved. I'm touched by how I personally connect with Jane Eyre, who not only has the wit, intelligence, honesty, and flourishing independence that constitutes the spirit of many female characters, like that from Jane Austin, but who stands the test of time as more than just a witty, intelligent female. Jane Eyre is a woman, a woman that all can relate to. Also, I love how the novel itself was written. Charlotte Bronte weaves in all the elements of a good story--suspense, passion, mystery, gothicism-- while entwining emotions like love, hate, death, regret, sadness, rebirth, and forgiveness. This is more than just a gothic novel, more than just a novel with a statement about Victorian society. It's a novel with heart, courage, and a journey that never ends in the heart, mind, and spirit. This is what real literature is all about."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"Don't get me wrong, I love nineteenth century British literature as much as anyone. This book, however, is mediocre at best. The symbolism is blatant and contrived to the point of being distracting. In fact, the whole story is extremely contrived, even for a romance. Neither are Charlotte's characters endearing enough to make the novel worthwhile. Jane, Rochester, and Adele are all a bit annoying rather than charming or good or even evil. And I have no idea why this novel would be considered Gothic, the only thing that qualifies that idea is all the ridiculous magic that's going on. Actually, the second half of the novel reads more like an Austen husband hunt with a little bit of weirdness thrown in.The Lowood section is redeeming, however. The description smacks of Dickens, chiding the English for their treatment of the helpless. The characters of the Brocklehursts are beautifully rendered hypocrites.Emily's Wuthering Heights is by far the better read if you're after a Bronte. All of her characters have depth so that even the villains become loved. Wuthering Heights is also fairly contrived and full of obvious symbolism, but unlike Jane Eyre, the mechanics of the story add to it rather than distracting from it. Above all, the pathos and darkness are delightful, especially coming from a nineteenth century British woman. Charlotte herself wrote in the preface to WH that she didn't understand why Emily had to write something so dark. My opinion is that Charlotte could have used a little bit of that darkness herself. Read WH if you want something really complex to savor; JE just makes a good beach read."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"It seems to me Bronte's schooling of her own mind rather than the schooling depicted in the book (which are the same thing) depend more or less likely on your inclination to the subject of respect.The willingness to let go all sanity and resume mental thought at a moment's whim is the virtue displayed here.Like most books of this type, not much thought is given to plot or to the romance of being in a plot as much as to the figures at play here, right and wrong, moral and honest, truth and lie-sayer. I would probably say this is the best way for a young girl to grow up, having written a work like this. This is more a study in her life than in the life of a person blessed with any gifts. Growing up modest has taught her something: that she made modesty.The gift of the unique insight of creation in each and every line is apparent and is a unique challenge to the reader to contemplate the meaning of suffering she has placed into every line."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"I loved this book. It's one of those books you can read over and over, and never get tired of it. It's a wonderful love story full of exciting twists. The Bronte sisters are a couple of my heros. I would encourage anyone to read this book."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"I had recently been channel surfing and saw that Jane Eyre was going to be on television. I was curious, being an English Lit major and never having read anything by the Bronte sisters, I figured I would watch the movie and see if the story line was anything interesting. I loved it. So, that night I ran to the store and bought the book. The book was ten times more vivid and wonderfully told than the movie (as was expected). I was delighted to revist the characters that I had briefly been introduced to through the movie. C.B. tells the tale wonderfully through the life of Jane. Her trials become your trials. Her love becomes your love. It was very intense and riveting. I can't wait to read it again in a few years!"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"I loved this book because I felt the struggle Jane Eyre went through, being an abused, poor orphan forced to reside all year around at the Lowell School under a harsh headmaster. Then being forced to endure the harshness of her employer, Mr. Rochester.I pitied Mr. Rochester because he was &quot;stuck&quot; with a mad woman he locked on the top floor with Mrs. Pool. In a sense, it was sort of like a living death. As long as she remained alive, he could not remarry or have a family. I loved it when Orson Wells played this role because his large, brilliant, black eyes really showed his torment in the film. Joan Fontaine as Jane Eyre was no slouch either. Her blank stare after ten years at the Lowell school was great. I really felt their emotions in the book too, especially after Jane Eyre's friend at Lowell died of pneumonia and when her wedding ceremony was cancelled after discovering Mr. Rochester was already married.The tense part in the book and film was when Mr. Rochester's bed was set ablaze by his wife. I don't know how a man could let his mentally ill wife remain under the same roof with a child and so many lit candles to be knocked over but Mr. Rochster did it. I mean, the man must be as daft as his wife.I thought this book was a thrilling read because both of the main characters over came their problems. Yes there were consequences, but they were temporary. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"I found Jane Eyre to be a delightful read and a book that can be read again and again. It is the story of a young orphan girl who struggles to find her place in society. The story begins with Jane as child living with her aunt and cousins. Jane is a spirited girl and is disliked by all, especially her aunt, who constantly belittles her, despite the fact that Jane's cousins are horrific. Jane's only friend is the maid, who gives her comfort from time to time.Finally it gets to the point where Jane fights back and her aunt chooses to send her to boarding school. Lowood is a place of discipline and seriousness. The girls are educated in harsh conditions. It is here that Jane makes her first friend and learns much from her. After many years at school, Jane decides she wants to work and make money. There are not many options for a woman of her time who desires a career, but she lands a job as a governess for a young, French girl. Jane enjoys teaching and looking after her, but she also longs for something more in life.After being there for some time, Jane finally meets Mr. Rochester, the master of the house, who spends little time there. He is a short, rather ugly man and Jane piques his interest as a girl with intelligence. After numerous encounters, they profess their mutual affection and plan on getting married. Although Jane loves him, she cannot ignore their obvious class difference.On the day of their wedding it is revealed that Rochester is already married to Bertha; a crazy Jamaican woman living on the top floor of the house. Jane is shocked and decides she cannot marry Rochester despite his pleas. She packs up her things and runs away.Jane spends time homeless and starving until strangers take her in. St. John is a missionary who is later revealed as Jane's cousin. The death of Jane's uncle leaves her with a fortune, turning her into a financially independent woman. Despite the fact that he's her cousin, St. John asks Jane to marry him and accompany him to India to do missionary work. What does Jane decide? Read the book and find out!Jane Eyre is novel filled with passion and symbolism. Fire appears time and time again, symbolizing the heat that exists in Jane's life. I found Jane to be a strong and admirable woman, though there are times when her sensibility gets a bit annoying. Rochester is a little odd as well, but together I find them charming. This story is unique because the heroine is a plain, poor girl who triumphs over class barriers, which is why she is so likable. She is not a beauty queen who is swept off into the horizon by prince charming. Altogether, a passionate story of courage and triumph."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"Jane Eyre has been hailed by many to be the original romance novel and after reading it, I am inclined to agree.Jane is an abused, forgotten child who is sent away to a boarding school after standing up for herself against her cruel cousins and unjust aunt. While at school, Jane learns disicpline and becomes a very religious person.When Jane finally leaves the boarding school, it is for a governess position at the home of Rochester. She teaches the child in his care, Adele.Through the story, she and Rochester face many dilemmas in their search for true love. A true love that is right in front of their noses.If you like romance novels or if you just want to rediscover your hope for love, I recommend this book."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"This book is one of my favourite books ever! I must have read it about a thousand times and I'm still not fed up of it. For those of you who are under the impression that this is a boring, dried up dull book, you could not be more wrong. I have never read a book so rich, so passionate and so moving. The love of Jane and Mr.Rochester is wonderfully depicted by Charlotte Bronte into true love's deepest and richest form. Her language is vivid, descriptive and romantic, and the dialogue (especially between the two protagonists)is poetic and eloquent. This is a book for all tastes, and the characters are so well portayed that they come alive in the imagination and stay there. I actually found myself crying towards the end. And Jane, though she appears meek and mild, is actually resolute and fiery and follows her religious principles dutifully to the extent of losing her only happiness. She is, in short, possessed of a strength and fortitude both reamrkable and admirable. As for Mr.Rochester,he is an archetypal Byronic hero: dark,enigmatic,cynical,sardonic and sternly attractive, suffering from some mysterious sorrow which renders him aloof and forbidding and forms the basis for the 'secret of the attic. This book has everything: romance, tragedy, intrigue and humour and is a classic in the true sense of the word."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"In the novel Jane Eyre, Bronte wants the reader to perceive the main character, Jane Eyre, as an independent young woman trying to make her way through life by herself. Jane is even given a line &quot;I do not think, sir you have the right to command me, merely because you are older than I...&quot;(139) to help understand her independent way of thinking. Bronte tries to give and describe Jane through feminist characteristics. Throughout the novel, however, Bronte uses a literary motif of birds. In this motif everytime Jane is compared to a bird it is a bird such as a turtle dove which can be compared as weak and delicate to that of a raven which is how the main male character is described. This novel is an enjoyable one and I would recommend it to anyone who reads only for pleasure purposes. If you try to find a deeper meaning in this novel you may get confused on how the author really wants the reader to portray the main characters."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"This book is a classic, loved by many, and may be just the book for you. But for me, i found it rather dull, and while i like fiction, historical fiction, i found this to drag on."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"One of the best novels of all time, and a true feminist classic.Of course there were plenty of people in the 19th century who complained that Jane Eyre was too liberated, too Girl-Power. I suppose humanity will never be free of conservatives and their never-ending quest to jail us all in rigid little gender cages."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"When it was first published, people lauded its creation, but after discovering that Currer Bell was actually a woman, Charlotte Bronte, they were horrified with the passion with which she wrote. Oh, what passion! It tells the story of Jane Eyre, an orphan who goes to become a governess and falls in love with her employer, Mr. Rochester. Bronte doesn't idealize their love, for Jane is plain, and Mr. Rochester, is not found handsome either. \\"Jane Eyre\\" has mystery, romance, and adventure, the perfect kind of story.

I can respect the fact that it was a classic but it just was not a book that I enjoyed. It had many unneeded parts and tended to repeat itself.

So....there^^;"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"Jane Eyre may be enjoyed by older adults (with a bigger vocabulary, I should add), but I had to read this sophomore year and absolutely hated it. This book is very hard to read, and I wouldn't recommend it to any young readers who doesn't have a teacher to help explain. Although it may be a classic, it is one tough book!"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"There isn't much to say about this book. Other that I had a group assignment a few months ago to read this, and then present it to our fellow peers. Lets see, how can I put this into words? Well, it was pretty self torturing. Page after page was about fifty billion paragraphs of Charlotte Bronte describing a landscape or the \\"confusing\\" emotions that Miss. Eyre was having towards her boss. Although, it must have been tough writing a book which displays a woman of independence and such, Ms. Bronte is a decent writer... the book would have just been more enjoyable if there was splashes of complete randomness.As for myself, I really do not plan on reading this book, ever again. Unless some Iraqi solider is torturing me with an ablazed iron rod and screaming at me to tell him about the great collections of Charlotte Bronte and her infamous book, \\"Jane Eyre\\"."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"Pride and Prejudice is a classic novel from the 19th century. It is by far one of the best books I have ever read.The conflict that Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy go through is what makes this book such an exciting love story. I would say that the best chapter of this story is chapter 7 volume 1, where Jane goes to Mr. Bingley's on the horse and gets a cold. This is the part of the story were things start to change. One example of this would be the interest that Mr. Darcy starts to show for Elizabeth. This happens because Jane catches a cold on her way to the Bingley's house and Elizabeth goes to the Bingley's house to take care of her sister. As Darcy spends time with Elizabeth, he starts to show interest in Liz.Another important thing about this book is that Jane Austen uses imagery very well to make us get into the book. I must say that there were times when I was caught up in reading since everything was well described. An example of Austen using imagery is when she describes what kind of people the Bennet's mom and dad are. For example, at the beginning of the story, the writer talks about Mr. Bennet and Mrs. Bennet and how different the two people are. In chapter 1 the author describes Mrs. Bennet as a foolish person and a fussy gossiper. Mr. Bennet is quiet and kept to himself. In chapter 4 we have a very good description of personalities in two different important characters, Mr. Darcy and Mr. Bingley. Mr. Bingley is cheerful and sociable while Mr. Darcy is clever but less tactful, and unlike Mr. Bingley he finds the people dull; in other words, he criticizes people way too much.I would recommend this book for high school students because it opens your mind to new and real things. It teaches you, mostly girls, to value the liberties that are given to you. I say this because back then women didn't have many choices or liberties to do what they wanted. Back then women had to do what their husband wanted and now women have many liberties."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"because this book deserves it. I first read it in the 9th grade, and it was literally a struggle to the very end. Summoning all my effort, I laboriously read this book with a lack of interest unsurpassed to this very day. It was useful only when I had trouble falling asleep.Each page of this dull, overly dramatic book felt like an eternity. There are pages upon pages of meaningless and increasingly uninteresting rambling. Plain Jane gains no sympathy from me. Apparently, she enjoys suffering, as evidenced by her constantly changing opinions and the way she strives to make her life more difficult when handed easier options. (Ex: When the guy finally admits his love for her, she goes off into the rain, poor and near-death, upon the advising of some voices she hears.)The plot is long and unbelievable. For example, how can you hide a woman in your house for years, a woman who, by the way, screams, throws fits, and sets things on fire? And nobody notices this? The ending is no better -- sappy and contrived, it left me ill.Absolutely hideous, I would not even recommend this to the worst of my enemies. This book fails to become even briefly captivating. It starts off horribly and, impossible as it may seem, only gets worse throughout."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"I enjoy classic Victorian era romance , and this by far is the worst book I have ever read. I know that Jane's character was suppose to be \\"Plain Jane\\", but I in no way found her endearing. Instead of feeling sorry for all her misfortunes and lack of love, I found myself detesting her character. The plot drags on forever, when really it could be told better in five minutes. It could be romantic, except that the plot is so boring and outlandish, that it overshadows that element. And the supernatural elements of the novel literally made me laugh out loud. I could go on about why I hate this novel, but I don't want to ruin the story for others."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"After reading Jane Eyre, I was glad to be done with this book. Most women enjoy and appreciate Jane Eyre, but since I am 15 I have a different opinion.Jane Eyre is 641 pages of a woman trying to find herself. Jane, the main character, goes to a charitable school for 1/4 of the book. During school, nothing really happens. Yes, Jane and her classmates are treated poorly, but it didn't hold my attention. The book does pick up until after Jane leaves school.From there Jane meets the love of her life, Mr. Rochester. The only thing about their relationship is Jane is 19 or 20 and Mr. Rochester is almost 40. I felt that I could not relate to these characters because today such an age difference is looked down upon by people. Of course Jane and Mr. Rochester plan to get married, but Jane finds out about Mr. Rochester's deepest darkest secret. THEN SHE RUNS AWAY! What a stupid girl. Jane may have been an independent woman, but big deal; so many women today are independent. Is that why so many people love this book? When Jane runs away, this part of Jane Eyre is so unbelievably boring. Jane meets her cousins, but realizes that she still loves Mr. Rochester. Not much happens except Mr. Rochester is blind. Jane and Mr. Rochester get married and live happily ever after.You might love this book, but as I said before I am only 15 and can not appreciate Jane Eyre, the character and the book. If you are a teenager like me do not read Jane Eyre or even waste your time. Maybe if you are older and found your true love, you might love every minute of this book. I recommend if you are young, read a book that takes place during the present, not the past."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"While sloshing through the almost unreadable text of the verbose Charlotte Bronte, one can imagine why she was never married. Don't get us wrong, it's not that we don't understand the underlying themes and the higher level concepts; they just contain absolutely no relevance whatsoever. The plot, dare we call it that, winds slowly through the 400+ pages of this so-called classic. If you must read it for school-don't. You'd be better off guessing on the test than being utterly confused and bored to tears."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"This book should not be placed in the same class with other &quot;classic&quot; authors who deserve their place. This book is a bore, the main character is a whiny cry-baby and the book goes nowhere for a long time. Jane has a very thick skull and all the obvious things fly over her head. This book should not be a classic, and I do not understand why it is one."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"You've probably heard the expression that a million monkeys typing for a million years eventually will reproduce the works of William Shakespeare. I give \\"Jane Eyre\\" one monkey, ten minutes.While recognizing Bronte's derring-do in writing a novel about a homely 17-year-old governess who rejects a virtuous adonis (St. John Rivers) for her much older and unattractive employer, this is a book I cannot see reading again unless it's the only way to save a terminally ill relative.This book is a slow read. And I mean slow. A snail? Greased lightning. Molasses on a cold day? Quicksilver. Eighth-period study hall in high school on a Friday? Over in a flash. We're talking a slow, boring read here, even without the benefit of a high school English teacher's enthusiasm for ruining literature.The novel chronicles the story of Jane Eyre from her childhood as an orphan up until the birth of her first child. Life was hard for orphans in 19th-century England, particularly when their parents' marriage was considered improper. Fair enough, I suppose: that's why Jane's childhood is so rotten, and she is picked on by the cousins she lives with, misliked and mistreated by her aunt and so on. Unfortunately, Bronte's writing is so dry and lifeless that it's hard to care.It just gets worse from there. The book is written in the first person, with the result that we get to hear every self-pitying thought Jane has (and there are plenty of them), about how plain she is, how her employer Mr. Rochester could never love her, how beautiful her imagined rival in love is, and on and on and on for page after tedious page.My standard joke is \\"This is both good and original. Unfortunately, the parts that are good are not original, and the parts that are original are not good.\\" I will give Charlotte Bronte the benefit of the doubt, and will say that \\"Jane Eyre\\" is thoroughly original. Unlike the works of Shakespeare and a number of other classics of English and world literature, I can't say it is particularly good.Jocko Grinn"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"I started this book and found the beginning of it a little dull and I put it down but a friend of mine encouraged me to try again to get through and I read the whole book in less than 3 days.

Two years later, we read it again in English, and I liked it even more.This book portrays it's main character as a strong, outspoken, smart and independent woman, written in a time when it was unconventional to do so. While the book is over 100 years old, it is not outdated because it's message is something that people can relate to today.Because it is wordy and not exactly fast, easy reading, some people disregard the book as being boring. However, if you give it a chance, you will probably find that it is suspenseful and exciting.There are many surprises. Just when you think that something is going to happen, some strange twist of fate changes the course of the story. It's also mysteroius and even funny.Ultimately the book has a positive message. Jane is an incredibly strong character who shows what it means to be true to yourself.Many people have to read this book, whether they want to or not. Other people choose to read it. Even if you don't want to read it, appreciate the writing style and open your mind to it. You might like it. I do."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"Charlotte Bronte's &quot;Jane Eyre&quot; is a classic rags to riches story, with some twists thrown in. Bronte captures the horrors of Jane's family (I use the term loosely) and the physical, as well as emotional, hardships she had to endure throughout the whole of her childhood and ultimatly her life until the end of the novel. The book is much more readable than the indominably beautiful heroine who only briefly suffers and finds superficial happiness in the one she loves. Jane's love for Mr. Rochester goes deeper than the surface for she does not even glance at the startling deformities of his body, but tries to heal the deformities of his soul when she returns to him. To her credit she succeeds and finds a happiness which few ever experience or imagine."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"i normally dont write reviews but felt i had to after a previous reviewer wrote she did know any men who loved this book. it is a classic for any gender and the theme of principle over emotion and the struggle between the two is in my opinion what makes this book so special."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"I read this book a couple of months ago and really enjoyed it.

Don't let me put you off."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"About a year ago, my book group read, &quot;Wide Sargasso Sea,&quot; Jean Rhys' 'pre-quel' to &quot;Jane Eyre.&quot; In book group, we are frequently forced to give notice to the fact that a book varies with the age of the reader and that there are childhood books that belong to childhood while there are other books that grow with you throughout your life. With that in mind, I thought it would be fun to REread Jane Eyre. About half way through the book, I realized that I had never read it before: this was my first read! Interestingly, the woman who led the discussion on Wide Sargasso Sea had the identical experience. So did another. We decided that it was more than the movie in which the still only babyfat Orson Welles wished himself to be the romantic hero: Jane Eyre was so much a part of Western Culture that without actually having read the book, we knew it. Charlotte Bronte, writing at the very beginning of the 19th century, was a much better writer than many who followed her. George Sand's writing is more pretentious and more closely tied to the 18th century. While &quot;Little Women&quot; is a wonderful book to revisit, Louisa May Alcott's potboilers are tiresome. I can not get into Dickens or James Fenimore Cooper. Until you come upon writers who bridge the gap between the 19th and 20th centuries -- Edith Wharton springs to mind -- no one is quite as readable as Charlotte, unless it is one of her sisters.That is not to say that the plot holds up. It is riddled with co-incidence that nearly undermines Bronte's intentions. However, her characters live and have dimension, even if their circumstances do not. So often, the infamous &quot;canon&quot; is criticized as being full of dead white European males. Charlotte is a woman whose work has shaped our thoughts and influenced us for nearly 200 years. I would say that Charlotte Bronte is part of the Western canon."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"Very descriptive, held my attention from first page to the end. I was able to see through Jane Eyre's eyes, her world of living as an orphan in England in the 1800s, the cruel and heartless people in her life, her selfish aunt who didn't keep her promise to her dying brother to rear her as her own. Throughout the novel, Jane was resourceful, nurturous and intelligent. She became a governess for a rich employer who had his insane wife imprisoned. Jane fell in love with him, suffered tragedies of a broken heart, trials of running from her past, a new identity. She discovered loving friends and family, became rich, and marries her former employer. Every time she had a taste of happiness it was taken from her. I cried and got angry."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"I always tell people: \\"ask any girl if they liked Jane Eyre. The answer is sure to be a yes.\\" The story has been outlined through many forms of media, including the stage and the silverscreen. But the experience of reading Bronte's exquisitely detailed, and passionate writing is to be found on the pages.The sexual tension between Jane and Mr. Rochester, the pan-ultimate Byronic hero, is exciting, and Jane's growth as a woman is relational to her position with Mr. Rochester.The gem of the story is its subversiveness, however. Bronte was audacious in Jane's defiance of religious and aristocratic authorities, challenging the traditions that defined British society."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"I read this book on a sort of whim, because I'd been harboring a copy about a hundred years old (cloth cover, and kind of cool in it's own right), and because I had just read 'The Eyre Affair' by Jasper Fforde. In his story, the plot for Jane Eyre gets 're-written' to have a 'newer and more popular ending'. While Jasper Fforde is as loopy as Douglas Adams, that is another review. He seizes on something great though, which is the last section of the book where Jane has gone off from Rochester, and (under terrible pressure) is next to assenting to go off to India with her cousin to work herself to death and bear his children. In the Fforde story, that is how Jayne Eyre ends, until his heroine Thursday Next comes in and sets things on a different path. But enough of that. It's worth mentioning that I was intrigued by the glimpse I got of the story from a single remove. I am very glad I was compelled to read it. I found Jane Eyre very enjoyable, and as I mentioned very modern in many of it's features, from plot movement,to the confidential nature of the narrator's speech, to a certain darker caste, which, while gothic certainly, is also the color of the paper that nearly every screenplay and t.v. script is written on today. The rush & dash of the romance is first rate, and I am sure it was ground breaking when it was written. I look forward to reading a morsel more from each of the Bell (Eyre) sisters."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"I first read Jane Eyre in 8th grade and re-read it this month as I turned 40.

A landmark on the road to my understanding of female authors. Clean type, wide margins easily read, they chose to make the book slightly wider than thicker so it is comfy to hold.Entering the world of the immortal emotion in a setting long past, not being a scholar, does pose problems.Penguin provides valuable auxilliary notes explaining the context quite well.For instance,I had not known that Thackery was struggling with publishing then and that C.B. was taking solace and courage from his battles.Do other publishings of the classics:Norton,Dover, Bantam, etc. relate to the public as well?I whish my fellow customers or Amazon in its info blurb were more sensitive to how the book they review is made,and how the text is supported."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"Of all of the books that I have had to read in high school, I have never enjoyed one as much as \\"Jane Eyre.\\" Charlotte Bronte has created a touching, beautiful heroine: one who finds herself and her one true love.

It is the most overrated book ever.One of the most fundamental things a book has to do is hold the reader's interest, and in this aspect, Jane Eyre fails. To be fair, it is utterly gripping throughout the first ten chapters. After that, the quality of the book falls off sharply. The rapid pace becomes boring repition of having to go through thirty pages of nothing to get to a page or two where something actually happens, then another 30 pages of nothing.It's kind of a shame really, for a book that started out as well as this one to crash and burn the way it does. But it happens, and what we are left with is a dreadfully boring book that continues to have praise heaped on it for reasons I will probably never fathom."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"Jane Eyre by Charlotte Bronte talks about a young lady, Jane that reminds me of Cinderella. Both of her parents died when she was little, so she was raised by her wealthy Aunt Mrs. Reed. Like Cinderella, Mrs. Reed favors her own children rather than Jane. This book shows how the need for Love can cause so many complications in Jane's life.Mrs. Reed decided to send Jane off to a school named Lowood. This gave Jane a chance to be independent and live her own life. She soon made a good friend named Helen, who always encouraged her when she feels down. When Jane found out that Helen is sick from a disease called consumption, she rushes to see her. Helen soon died in Jane's arms, which made her feel sad because she had just lost a good friend. There was no one there to make Jane feel better anymore. This was the first complication in her life.After a couple years at Lowood, she became one of their teachers. After two years of being a teacher at Lowood, she wanted to experience something new, so she arrives at Thornfield to teach an eight-year-old French girl Adele. Mr. Rochester was the owner of Thornfield. Jane saves Mr. Rochester from a fire caused by a servant and secretly falls in love with Mr. Rochester. When Mr. Rochester brought back a beautiful young woman Blanche to his house, Jane developed a huge tub of jealousy towards her. Jane couldn't stop thinking what would happen with Mr. Rochester and Blanche. Jane was forced to attend a party where Blanche and her mom were there also. They didn't treat her very nicely causing her to leave the party. While watching Mr. Rochester and Blanche together, she thinks they would get married soon. This made Jane think that she should maybe let go of the feelings she had for Mr. Rochester. Her love for Mr. Rochester was the second complication in her life.Jane founds out later on that her Aunt Mrs. Reed suffered a stroke. Jane tries to relieve the hatred her aunt has for her, but she didn't want to and soon died. This made Jane sad because she barely had a chance to talk with her aunt and say good-bye. Jane didn't want things to end how it did with her aunt because it's not a good feeling knowing someone still hates you after they die. This is another complication to her life.Mr. Rochester bumps into Jane in the garden, and they started walking together. Mr. Rochester tells Jane that he is thinking about asking Blanche to marry him. This caused Jane to turn into a jealous woman. She quickly tells him how much she loves him and stunned to find out that Mr. Rochester actually wanted to marry her and not Blanche. She didn't believe his words. Mr. Rochester explained that he only said he wanted to marry Blanche to see what her reaction would be. Jane happily accepts and agrees to marry Mr. Rochester. Mrs. Fairfax doesn't agree with the marriage because she views Mr. Rochester as a proud man and too old for her. Jane was very uncomfortable hearing those words from Mrs. Fairfax. Jane began to have weird dreams of her children dying or crying for help which causes her to be more uncomfortable for she doesn't know what is happening and why she is having such dreams. Despite what Mrs. Fairfax said or the dreams she's been having, she still wanted to marry Mr. Rochester because she loved him very much. They were walking down the aisle ready to be announced husband and wife when someone announced a secret that ruined the whole evening.Will Jane ever find happiness and love or will she be lonely with no one to care for her? Read to find out if this will be the end of Jane and Rochester's love for each other."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"Jane EyreI liked the book. i thought it was neat how the author wrote it as an autobiography. it was pretty interessting.like how the girls were treated in lowood school ws upsetting, and how she meets Mr. Rochester...

I don't think that I liked the character of Jane very much. I understand that she was mistreated and that she also lived in the 1700's but I still think that she was rude. She had no confidence and no pride. She would not let people love her and treat her nicely. When Mr. Rochester asks her to marry him and then wanted to take her out and buy her a nice dress and jewlery, she acts so coldly towards him that it makes me sick.

All i said was that the classics are not going to be so appealing to modern &quot;young&quot; readers like myself today because the &quot;novel&quot;(not jane eyre, read this literaly) has suddenly risen so much in content, state and depth. I dunno, perhaps if i was living during that era i would have appreciated the book more, but living in the 90's where you have authors such as atwood there's no competition and you really can't compare novels written before the 20th century to novels written in the 20th century anyway. Like a majority of the classics, the plot is almost always predictable and characters are indeed relatable but hell, boring! charles dickens is probably the most boring writer i've ever come across (no offence to all u dickens fans out there) and jane austen comes pretty close to him,though her books have a longer attention span. And the brontes, they're on the same level. I am not saying that the classics are bad cuz i know that if it weren't for these authors, we'd be nowhere in literature as we are now.

He's bossy, unreasonable and mean. Why'd he pretend to wanna marry Miss Ingram?

Treated like a servant, and not like a member of the family, Jane felt she was all alone in the world, and it doesn't make it better when she's sent away to school. First as a student, and then as a teacher/guverness, but neither is like a dance on roses. Then her skills bring her to a mysterious and quite arrogant Mr.Rochesters house where she becomes the guverness...This book illustrates very well the passionate love from a woman's point of view. No longer is the female character a background character, but becomes independant with feelings, passion, integrety and a strong mind.The book is very realistic, and you can easily identify yourself with the feelings that the main character has. Her devotion for what she loves, and her effort to make the best out of her life.Charlotte Bront, who first published this book under a pseudonym, is probably the most well-known of the Bront sisters who all died very young. Jane Eyre is a brilliant book of a woman who can be a role model for young girls of today. Her determination to make life the best for herself as no one else seems to bother, and her passion for what she loves. One of the first romance novels written. A true classic that I very much enjoyed to read, and I'm certain I will read it many more times. Even my friend, who doesn't like reading very much, totally loved this book.

English teachers may praise it, your girlfriends may gush over Rochester, and others \\"critically acclaim\\" it but I have studied it as a piece of literature as well as an entertaining classic. It is not as fabulous as they say.The protagonist is a quivering (and excuse the term but I am at a lost for another word at the moment) nitwit who yearns to be loved. Jane is an orphan who feels as if she would die if nobody loved her and yes, it sounds simplistic but this is exactly what she says. She comes under the employment of Rochester and becomes a governess to a little girl. Meanwhile, she dreams of flaming beds and hears strange noises from the floor above. The splitting of the oak tree during Jane's engagement to Rochester is just rubbish as a symbol of separation and tragedy. The real tragedy though, is the secret that Rochester keeps and for which, Jane accepts.I am amused by how several people believe that Jane Eyre is a feminist novel. I found Jane to be very comfortable lodged in traditional ideals although she makes an attempt to strike out with her own will. It was a struggle to finish the novel (had to, or I would fail my English exam) and to pretend to my enthusiastic teacher that I loved it. If you want real feminism without archaic English, read Carol Shield's 'Unless'. If you want melodramatic romance with just a hint of literature, read 'Wuthering Heights'. If you think that Jane is a misguided feminist, you certainly have to read Jean Rhy's 'Wide Sargasso Sea' who portrays Rochester's secret as a terrible colonial crime.I can understand that some people love this kind of stuff but there are types of people who hate 'Jane Eyre' - they're usually into contemporary novels, ask for their heroes or heroine to yearn for something more than love and for somebody to love them, and need metaphors that are more subtle that freakin' splittin' oak trees."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"Some say that I'm bias in this, but I have to say that I am not one to read romance novel. I'm just not. But I gave this book a shot.A basic plot summary will give you a plain, unattractive young girl living under an oppressive aunt who sends her to a strict Christian school for the orphans. After years of suffrage at the school, Jane becomes a governess for the brooding Mr. Rochester, which she soon finds she has feelings for. But what about that Grace Poole, what is she hiding in the upstairs attack?What seems like a mystery is over run by a prevailing romance between Jane and Mr. Rochester.I won't divulge anymore of the plot. But I will tell you why I initially liked it.Jane Eyre is the best example of the heroine I am most like. She is plain and simple and so am I. I connected well with the character. Quite often, I feel the heroes are too fake.At its best, this is a story about two conflicting societies, the aristocracy and the middle class. Which is done in a rather blunt and humorous way.But what I find enjoyable is the fact that if you take certain dialogs from the book completely out of context, it is quite funny. My friends and I have many a good joke because of it.What I don't like isn't much, but it is where many books fail. The ending collapses the entire book. It felt pushed and corny. I thought it was the most predictable ending.The entire story felt a bit contrive. But not as bad as Wuthering Heights by her sister, which I didn't even finish.The book is pretty easy read. But read it while you are young like me (I'm in my mid-teens), or else, if you become an avid book reader, you will find nothing but faults."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"Like all great literature JANE EYRE can be read again and again revealing new truths and raising fresh questions. For instance, besides the romance between Jane and Edward there is also the contrast provided by the relationship between Jane and St. John.Imagine what may happen if Jane accepts the marriage proposal of St. John and goes with him to some foreign land as the wife of a missionary? In answering that question while taking a closer look at the unfeeling St. John, we see an anti-Christian message in the book. Add to this mix the despicable Mr. Brocklehurst, the school manager who is also minister of Brocklebridge Church, and you receive a very negative view of Christianity. JANE EYRE is a love story with an anti-Christian bias - but the theme proclaiming that love can conquer all is still the dominant message of the novel.The above represents only one perspective. The book of course can be read and interpreted from many other vantage points. For me that is its greatest strength and enjoyment."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"Definitely Not What I Expected: Jane EyreJane Eyre is a novel set in 1800's England. It is about a young girl, Jane, who wants to escape her horrible life with her aunt and abusive cousins. Her parents died when she was a little girl. She wants to go to school and eventually teach. Jane is a smart girl who loves to read, but is not very fond of her appearance. Jane Eyre tells the tale of a woman's experiences in life, about men, friendship, and hardship. When taking a job as a governess, Jane stumbles upon a love she did not intend, and a mystery she's determined to solve.Although Jane Eyre is not exactly my cup of tea there were some positive points to the book. The character Jane Eyre is a very good role model for young women. She is not some stunningly gorgeous princess in a castle, she's very real in the sense that she has insecurities like everyone else. She may struggle with her appearance, but she is very smart and articulate, and does not rely on men to take care of her. She's very independent and uses her brains, not her looks to get what she wants. Appearance is something almost every adolescent girl has struggled with, despite what time period they've grown up in. Jane Eyre presents a positive message to girls.Unfortunately, the rest of the novel was not quite as inspiring. In general, I found Jane Eyre to be very dull and boring, and far too long. The literature style was very bland. When reading Jane Eyre the voice in my head became monotonous, I was ready to fall asleep! With so much detail when describing the characters or setting, it seems like it takes Charlotte Bronte two or three pages just to describe a chair.Extremely long and boring at times, Jane Eyre captures the time period well, almost too well with the amount of detailed description on every page. The character Jane is very interesting, complex, and well-written, but she needs a different author to put her into a better story."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"These days there are a lot of these 'trashy' romance novels being published.

And it's all wrapped in the misty, haunting atmosphere of a true gothic story -- madwoman in the attic and all.Jane Eyre was an orphan, abused and neglected first by relatives, then by a boarding school run by a tyrannical, hypocritical minister. But Jane refuses to let anyone shove her down -- even when her saintly best friend dies from the wretched conditions.But many years later, Jane moves on by applying to Thornfield Hall for a governess position, and gets the job. She soon becomes the teacher and friend to the sprightly French girl Adele, but is struck by the dark, almost haunted feeling of her new home.Then she runs into a rather surly horseman -- who turns out to be her employer, Mr. Rochester, a cynical, embittered man who spends little time at Thornfield. They are slowly drawn together into a powerful love, despite their different social stations -- and Rochester's apparent attentions to a shallow, snotty aristocrat who wants his wealth and status.But strange things are happening at Thornfield -- stabbings, fires, and mysterious laughter. Jane and Rochester finally confess their feelings to each other, but their wedding is interrupted when Rochester's dark past comes to light. Jane flees into the arms of long-lost family members, and is offered a new life -- but her love for Rochester is not so easily forgotten...\\"Jane Eyre\\" is one of those books that transcends the labels of genre. Charlotte Bronte spun a haunting gothic romance around her semi-autobiographical heroine and Byronic anti-hero, filling it with brilliant writing and solid plot. It has everything all the other gothic romances of the time had... but Bronte gave it depth and intensity without resorting to melodrama.Bronte wrote in the usual stately prose of the time, but it has a sensual, lush quality, even in the dank early chapters at Lowood.

I am sure that our current day Twilight readers (don't get me wrong, I love those books too) might find this book a little difficult because of the speech that is used.

And it's all wrapped in the misty, haunting atmosphere of a true gothic story -- madwoman in the attic and all.Jane Eyre was an orphan, abused and neglected first by relatives, then by a boarding school run by a tyrannical, hypocritical minister. But Jane refuses to let anyone shove her down -- even when her saintly best friend dies from the wretched conditions.But many years later, Jane moves on by applying to Thornfield Hall for a governess position, and gets the job. She soon becomes the teacher and friend to the sprightly French girl Adele, but is struck by the dark, almost haunted feeling of her new home.Then she runs into a rather surly horseman -- who turns out to be her employer, Mr. Rochester, a cynical, embittered man who spends little time at Thornfield. They are slowly drawn together into a powerful love, despite their different social stations -- and Rochester's apparent attentions to a shallow, snotty aristocrat who wants his wealth and status.But strange things are happening at Thornfield -- stabbings, fires, and mysterious laughter. Jane and Rochester finally confess their feelings to each other, but their wedding is interrupted when Rochester's dark past comes to light. Jane flees into the arms of long-lost family members, and is offered a new life -- but her love for Rochester is not so easily forgotten...\\"Jane Eyre\\" is one of those books that transcends the labels of genre. Charlotte Bronte spun a haunting gothic romance around her semi-autobiographical heroine and Byronic anti-hero, filling it with brilliant writing and solid plot. It has everything all the other gothic romances of the time had... but Bronte gave it depth and intensity without resorting to melodrama.Bronte wrote in the usual stately prose of the time, but it has a sensual, lush quality, even in the dank early chapters at Lowood. At Thornfield, the book acquires an overhanging atmosphere of foreboding, until the clouds clear near the end. And she wove some tough questions into Jane's perspective -- that of a woman's independence and strength in a man's world, of extreme religion, and of the clash between morals and passion.And Bronte also avoided any tinges of drippy sentimentality (Mrs. Reed dies still spewing venom) while injecting some hauntingly nightmarish moments (\\"She sucked the blood: she said she'd drain my heart\\").

Minimal (if any) errors and well set up. Next chapter always starts at the top of a page which makes it always a good place to stop.Kindle vs. Hardcopy -- one nice thing is that there are a lot of words considered either purely poetical or old or middle English, so no longer or not commonly used and if you move your cursor to the word on the kindle, it will automatically define it. Always useful, but especially where there are many such words.Well worth the buck!"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"\\"Jane Eyre\\" by Charlotte Bront is an 1847 novel published as \\"Jane Eyre. An Autobiography\\" under the nom de plume of \\"Currer Bell\\". The novel is told in first person narrative and goes through five distinct stages in Jane's life. In spite of many dark elements the novel has strong elements of right vs. wrong as well as morality.The orphan Jane Eyre, brought up by an duty bound aunt by marriage is having a miserable childhood. The family is spoiled and socially fixated, considering the orphan in their mists beneath them and bans Jane from her cousins. After an incident with her cousin John, Jane is sent to a school called Lowood where the moral pillar of her time finds herself subject to the hypocritical minister who runs the place. Jane endures the school even though she has been branded a liar and subject to a starvation diet as well as other miseries - but she remains faithful to standards which would break any other mortal.Reaching adulthood, Jane leaves Lowood to become a governess for Mr. Rocchester at his home called Thornhill. Mr. Rochester wins Jane's love and respect even though she knows he is harboring a secret. Rochester asks for Jane's hand in marriage, even though she keeps remind him what a poor, plain girl she is. At the last moment the marriage is thwarted, Jane flees Thorhill all alone and without a penny to her name. However, Jane finds her way back to society and moves up the social ladder only to make her way back to Mr. Rochester to discover his painful secret.I can certainly see why \\"Jane Eyre\\" is considered a classic. Bront's use of strong language , rhetorical brilliance and lovely narrative are certainly impressive. The author also had the guts to tackle many social issues head on, something that we, at this voyeuristic age, seem to take for granted. Even though this book was not meant to be historical, several decades later I found it captivating to read about the day-to-day living of 1800's England.The book described the fascinating social ladder of the 1800's where governesses (nannies/teachers) were far below their employers, yet often better educated. I felt that Jane's assertions to Rochester that she is his equal was something that was simply frowned upon a society which thrives on ambiguities.I found myself increasingly interested in the outcome of the story, the Rochester secrets, Jane's wit and eventual outcome. The personal story of Jane Eyre is very absorbing and well written. Bront's observations are poignant and engaging, her storytelling, when she's not of on a tangent, is admirable.But,oh the tangents... as much as absorbing as the book was, when the characters start going off on departures about religion and morality I almost felt as if I was being scolded. The huge amount of storytelling which is meant to be nothing but a filler got to be annoying after a hundred pages or so. The only conflict in the book is between Jane and Rochester, the rest of the book is filled with Jane being Jane, preaching to the reader about morality, virtues, temptations which might have some charm, but certainly isn't interesting.My favorite book, Don Quixote is known for its unbalanced structure, but the Quixote chapters are completely separate from the stories within a story parts. In \\"Jane Eyre\\" Bront tells the tale in logical progression which is structured around the protagonist. However, the consistency of the narrative is done at the expense of the overall strength of the whole."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"What can I say about this work that has not already been said in the many reviews that came before? It is truly one of the greats of English literature, and re-reading it as an adult is a pleasure that reaps even more rewards than when I read it as a girl.My only warning is for those who are reading it in the Kindle edition. The good points are that it is nicely formatted and almost free of spelling errors. The negatives are that it has no Table of Contents, linked or otherwise; and although it claims to be illustrated, no illustrations were included in the version I read.For pure reading pleasure, this novel has few equals. For formatting, you might be able to find better."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"Jane Eyre is a masterpiece.I thoroughly enjoyed it. The protagonist, Jane, is narrating her biography, and the chronicle commences when she was ten years old, growing up with her cruel aunt and equally cruel cousins, who make her childhood miserable. She could hardly wait to get out of their grip to a school for orphanages, run by a saintly woman. There she befriends a girl, Amy, a noble and true friend, dying of consumption. Jane thrives in the school, later becoming a teacher for two years.But the real drama unfolds when she gets a job as a tutor for a young girl, Adel, a protege of Mr. Rochester, a wealthy bachelor. They fall in love and Mr. Rochester proposes marriage. But he forgets to tell Jane a minor point that he was already married to a insane woman, locked up in the same manor! Jane bolts home and a new adventure unfolds, meets her long lost cousins, finds enormous fortune and dodges her cousin's advances to marry and go on to India to preach! She wants none of this austere life. She misses her love and returns to her old digs but to her great dismay, discovers that the old house is burned to the ground and Mr. Rochester who is now blind, has left town. She runs to find him.It is a great story, nicely woven with unforgettable characters. The prose is eloquent and flows like well honed poetry. She was a century or so ahead of her time when it came to Women's rights and their place in the society. It is hard to believe that author of this classic novel was a unmarried young woman, who had a sister, who penned \\"Wuthereing Heights\\", another tour de force. Only annoying aspect of the book was the religious righteousness, however, that was de rigueur during Victorian era.It is a MUST read."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"I'll confess I wasn't particularly looking forward to \\"Jane Eyre\\" when I started. I wanted to read it because I should read it, and because it's a travesty I haven't read it - until now. I assumed it would be dry, at times forcefully witty - a hunt for a man and a conquest. That sort of thing.Not a bit of it!Charlotte Bront creates in Jane a character with whom I find much in common: her manner of thought, her silented spirit, her tendency to love fully and passionately - to sketch, to think, to be content within herself.As a child she is abused by her stepmother and detested for her untamed spirit. She's sent away to school where her dear (and first) friend Helen Burns teaches her to stand bravely under reprimand - and to focus her courage.As Jane advances in school she becomes mellowed - but still the passion broods beneath. The story carries into her young adulthood when she becomes a teacher (at the same school where she grew up) and determines to see what there is in life beyond teaching and solitude and walls. So the orphan woman-child advertises for a governess position and is quickly hired at the home of the restless and gruff Edward Rochester - a man who finds Jane's controlled attitude, her level stare, her unfailing honesty and scathing intelligence enchanting. As their love develops, Jane realizes a secret about Edward that cannot be loved away, and she tears herself bodily from him, a terrified, frightened, heartbroken girl-woman once again homeless.I've no wish to spoil it for those who haven't read it, but suffice it to say, this fourth classic in all that I have read in my life surely inspires me to read more of its kind! I had no idea a Victorian woman would create a story with such passion. I feel moved to write, moved to create, and at a level with Bront that far exceeds death or time. She is a writer, a fervent spirit, and I stand here, nearly two centuries after her death, feeling shoulder-to-shoulder with her. She gives that much of herself to the work. I cried both at the last segment where she is a child, and the end of the novel itself (something I can't recall ever doing while reading.)Having read formula fiction all my life, I'm in particular impressed with Bront's power of description.Bront breaks norm often by flipping to the present tense, creating a quickness of spirit that contrasts remarkably with the more doleful passages. I find her writing comfortable - for want of a better word. Reading her tale was a pleasure - at times deep with wisdom, at times amusing with spirit, at times very doleful. She tours the human plane of emotion, twisting the plot quite more feverishly than I'd anticipated. Several times I sat forward in astonishment as the plot twisted and volted.So much symbolism in this novel, and captured so beautifully, like a still life - the virgin moon, the burning, lustful fires that destroy, fade out, then flicker anew atop candles before a fading portrait of love beautified as the novel draws to a close. In particular I'm struck by the irony in the way Jane and Mr. Rochester meet - and the way the story closes.I fell in love with Rochester quickly - I don't know why. He is rude, arrogant, and self-interested. Yet his changeable (nearly childlike) spirit - and his admiration for all that is reprehensible in Jane to everyone else - captured my heart.Bront writes both as a Romantic and a Victorian - challenging the church, female diffidence, and \`the norm' - and presenting her prose as richly as a woman in love and as candidly as a man of her generation before the court. A writer caught between worlds--and isn't that the richest place to be as a writer?5 out of 5 stars for Jane Eyre. I gave to Bront sleepless nights - and that's no embellishment."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"Jane Eyre is one of the few books I can say I absolutely adore.Charlotte Bronte is the one author I have found that can REALLY put passion into a novel.She writes like she has lived it even though she led a secluded life.Jane Eyre is so full of passion &amp; you have to love it. The way the characters speak to one another is unbelievable due to this passion. The romance is beautiful because of the way Jane &amp; Rochester speak to one another &amp; how full of emotions &amp; love for each other , not because of sex, like modern day romance novels .

My Grandmother reads hundreds of those Fabio-plastered, heaving cleavage covered paperbacks...but NOT ME. Don't get me wrong, I loved Gone with the Wind...but as I explored a few more of the more classic romances ie..Emma, Wuthering Heights, or Sense and Sensibility..I found the movies much more appealing. Then along comes Jane Eyre. She is not buxom and airheaded and dashingly beautiful. She is plain, modest, and smart...That's right! a more modern woman!! Jane does not faint at the sight of a handsome man, nor does she swoon over expensive clothes....Let me tell you a little more about Jane Eyre..... As a child, Jane was left an orphan with her brutal aunt and cousins. Treated unfairly and taunted buy the other children she soon developed a quick-witted tongue. After receiving an honest verbal lashing from Jane, her aunt packed her few belongings and pretty much &quot;shipped&quot; the young girl off to a dreadful and gloomy school called &quot;Lowood&quot;. At Lowood, Jane quickly learned to bite her tongue through strict discipline from the Headmaster.(Lowood often reminds me of the discplinary school David Copperfield received some beatings in.) Here at school Jane is educated and cared for but never loved. She stays on at Lowood to become a teacher herself, but soon finds a position in a far away town to be a private counsel and teacher to a young girl Adele. Adele is the young French, beautiful and very spoiled ward to a great man known as Mr. Rochester. Jane soon learns that Mr. Rochester is very mysterious and aloof ..he often leaves her and Adele alone for months at a time on business travel. When he is at home Jane finds herself drawn to him, his strange conversation style and his knowledge of good books. He is by no means a HANDSOME man but attracts a great deal of attention because of his financial means. I Loved this book for many reasons. I loved the contrast between Jane and Adele...Adele is spoiled, loved and beautiful....Jane the opposite. And the MYSTERIES! Where does Mr. Rochester go? WHO is Adele? Why are there screams late in the darkness of the manor? Who could it be? And the best mystery of all? What will become of Mr. Rochester and Jane? Romance? Jane never OUTWARDLY desires to be a distinguished lady like the beautiful women Mr. Rochester frequently entertaines. But as a reader you feel she deserves such a posion. You will find yourself page tuning faster and faster as you secretly wish for modest Jane Eyre to succeed and and achieve status and the love she deserves."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"I recently saw the Broadway musical of Jane Eyre and was inspired to read the book. It is one of the best books I have ever read. Jane seems so real as a character that I wish I could meet her. What an amazing heroine! The reader roots for her success all through the book. Her romance with Mr. Rochester is one of the best in all of literature. In high school the classics I had to read were usually so dull (including Wuthering Heights by Emily Bronte) that I tend to stear clear of classics now, even though I am a voracious reader, but Jane Eyre is so fast paced that it hardly seems like a classic. I couldn't put it down! Don't read this story because its touted as being about female empowermant and don't avoid it for the same reason. Wether you are male or female, read this book, because it is a great story with great characters you will remember for a lifetime!"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"Contrary to the MGM film of the 40's, this book does not begin with, \\"My name is Jane Eyre...\\" Instead, we get an opening chapter about a little girl who is cruelly treated by an abominable family, and her attempts to stay afloat. The Jane Eyre of the novel is a spirited young woman, who yearns to be able to experience life despite the limitations society has placed upon women. This book is a wonderful read. Bronte's 19th century England is not the neo-classical world of manners and balls that permeate Jane Austin's universe; rather, the world of Jane Eyre one of ragged romanticism that plays out against the harsh elements, and the world seems as primitive indoors as it does outside. Bronte writes in a very lucid, revelatory style, and the first person narrative does a lot to help draw you into this story. Even if you know the secret in the attic, there is so much more about this novel that you may not know about.The biggest surprise about this novel once I read it was that Jane's story does not end with the revelation of Rochester's dark gothic secret (even though this was written several years after Austen's Northanger Abbey, it's fun to read the two books in conjunction). I am surprised that most film and stage versions of this novel rarely include the important last third of the book. But I'll let you discover the developments to Jane's character on your own. The ending is a tear-jerker (but in a great way). This is definitely the book to read on the front porch of a summer cottage, or in front of a fire on a winter night. Mystery, romance, intrigue, religion, and feminism... it's all in here. And it's worth the read."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"This was the best book I have ever read and I cried when it was over. I wish Charlotte Bronte had written more books. This is my new favorite book, and my standard for all books I've ever read and ever will read. I sincerely reccommend it to everyone who loves suspensful love stories."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"I am 14 years old, and I really enjoyed reading this book. I read it first four years ago and was particularly impressed with the quality of the writing and the ideas displayed. Charlotte Bronte very cleverly used her book as an outlet for her own feelings and experiences as a woman which, in her day, were not considered or acknowledged. Unfortunately, while reading some of the other reviews on this page and elsewhere, I have noticed that some people are still discriminatory and insensitive towards female writers and believe that their views can simply be dismissed as soppy and foolish. I do not think that this is right. The fact that a person can write about his or her life using such great detail and keeping such an objective view of it as Charlotte Bronte did should not be dismissed as monotonous or boring, but rather should be acknowledged as a talent and as a result of hard work. It also shows that it cannot be easy to analyse your own life in such a way that you can understand and write about every detail of it. Charlotte Bronte's writing of Jane Eyre reflects her own character; that she wanted, like Jane, to be independent and go out into the world, and I think that it is this element of independence in many women that defies the assumed 'authority' and 'superiority' of the opposite gender and therefore they resent feminists speaking out. All in all, I think that Jane Eyre is an excellent novel and that it should not be labelled as some foolish, whimsical piece of writing that is only respected because it was written more than a century ago. The quality and status of a book and its author should not be undermined by the period of time in which it was written."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"an amazing and enthraling tale about love. it tells us to never give up in hope. many twists and turns,and leads to strange places. charlotte bronte has captured love and mystery in one fantastic tale."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"haha im into horror books.. but we had to do an Historical Fiction book report recently and i remember my mom buying me this book saying i should read it in high school, im in 7th grade, I have to say this is probably the best book i have ever read, although after she left mr.Rochester i wanted to stop because i thought it would just be depressing. but im glad i went on.

Eventually she is hired as a governess to a young girl and meets the girl's guardian Mr. Rochester, and of course they fall in love and plan to marry. But, there is a mystery about the house that once it is discovered destroys the wedding plans.A lovely tale, and Bronte has such a wonderful prose that makes you want to slow down and savor it and the story like a fine red wine or chocolate. The version I read isSelected Works of the Bronte Sisters (Wordsworth Special Editions) (Wordsworth Special Editions), so I did not have the distraction of the foot notes to refer to, and I don't feel that I missed much without them.

I have read it dozens of times and I am still not tired of it. Its language is beautiful - refined, fragrant, and surprisingly fresh. The dialogs and descriptions are memorable and visual. Above all, the novel introduces us to two main characters, a young orphan- pale, thin, \\"almost un-earthy\\" but determined, strong-willed, kind and reasonable Jane and Mr. Edward Rochester - sardonic, powerful, passionate, and tormented master of Thornfield. The story of their impossible love has attracted millions of readers not only in the English speaking countries but all over the world. \\"Jane Eyre\\" has been adapted to TV and big screen 18 times.

When I picked it up again a couple of years later, I fell for it. I remember hating Mrs. Reed and her children - especially John - with such a passion, I wished I could reach through the book and wring their necks until they gained some sense. Mr. Brocklehurst, too. And being terrified when she was stuck in the red room. I've reread it at least five times since then, and it always seems that I come across a scene or a character that I've forgotten about in the year or two since I read it last. In college, I wrote a paper on it and came across interpretations that I'd never even began to consider, prompting careful rereading of most of the chapters once again.

Having heard it as a book on tape while on bedrest brought the story to life even more and made the mysterious Bertha and the dark and moody Mr. Rochester that much more intense.

I have read literally hundreds and hundreds of books, some more than once, and still Jane Eyre remains my favorite. It is , in my opinion, a must-read in everyone's lifetime. The best of the Bronte sisters work, let alone Charlotte's, you cannot possibly be disappionted at reading this book."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"This book is about a girl named Jane Eyre, who lives at Gateshead hall, and is abused by her Aunt read, Georgiana,Eliza, and Master John Read.

Yet Jane Eyre transcends the thrilling parts of the book to become one of English's greatest novels.The novel is not without weakness; the entire St. John section is a bit overdramatic and somewhat contrived; yet it is essential to the novel not only for the symmetry but also to contrast a life that would only satisfy the flesh and sacrifice the soul (Mr. Rochester's proposal) versus a life sacrificing the flesh entirely for the sake of the soul (St. John.) Jane Eyre never falters from her conviction that, to be whole and true to oneself, both the spiritual and the carnal sides must be fulfilled. This was a daring proposal in Victorian England, and Jane Eyre was labeled \\"coarse\\" by one critic. Even more daring was that this philosophy was espoused by a woman writer, which is why Charlotte Bronte wrote the book under a gender-neutral pseudonym (Currer Bell.)Why should you read this classic? Initially, Jane Eyre can be enjoyed for its well-told and enjoyable story--very romantic and exciting. What makes Jane Eyre an enduring classic is that you can read it and re-read it many times over for the perfection of its structure. I have a hard time choosing between Jane Eyre and Eliot's Middlemarch as \\"best English novel.\\""},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"Jane Eyre is as perfect as a book can be. It's the wonderful, multi-layered story of a poor orphan who falls in love with a man of the British upper class.Jane Eyre is a fully-fleshed out character who is, in many ways, more modern than her nineteenth century counterparts. She is definitely a character to &quot;fall in love with&quot; and one that is truly unforgettable.Although some of the events in Jane Eyre are more than a little far-fetched, the plot is so enjoyable we can easily forgive Bronte a few minor faults. The pages simply fly by as we want to learn more about Jane and Mr. Rochester and their ultimate fate, both together and apart.Jane Eyre is a classic in every sense of the word and extraordinarily enjoyable as well."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"but definitely for the more educated. If you don't appreciate literature, I would say...don't read it, you won't like it. I love it...it is my favourite book of all time, hands down, but from what I have read and heard from others, it seems that the a person merely looking for a feministic book, or something easy to read that dosn't take much intellect, would not like it at all. As far as the content.... Charlotte Bronte had such a grasp of the wonderful pathos that love can fill a person with, it's incredible. The characters are well-portrayed, and you really get to know Jane and Mr. Rochester, which is more I can say than many works of it's day. I would say that Jane Eyre is one of the ultimate triuphs of literature."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"The search for freedom is a common underlying theme that can be found in many novels. Charlotte Bronte really emphasized this theme in Jane Eyre. This novel illustrates the path a strong young woman takes in her search for contentment. As she travels from place to place it becomes obvious that she is seeking a true home. The repetition of bird motifs throughout the novel is a device that accentuates the theme of freedom. In paying close attention to these motifs one can see that Jane is actually equated with a bird. Like a bird Jane Eyre is constantly in flight in search of her dreams. Her \\"spirit followed on willing wings the flight of Hope up and on to and ideal Heaven\\" (333). The comparison of Jane to a bird, when understood, is very important to the overall meaning of the novel. At the time Charlotte Bronte wrote the novel her ideas were pretty radical, considering that it was unheard of for a woman to be independent and free willed, which are the key aspects of Jane Eyre's character. The romanticism and feminism of this novel is inspirational. I strongly recommend Jane Eyre to any woman who is not afraid to follow her own dreams."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"As an orphan, Jane has no money and no one to care for her. After enduring hardships with an aunt who doesn't love her and struggling at a strict boarding school, Jane has come to a place where she may be able to find happiness and love. This novel starts out slow, but the action picks up, developing the romance and the mystery in the novel. Charlotte Bronte uses imagery and numerous allusions in the novel. The most notable allusion is the bird allusions. This bird motif suggests freedom or independence, specifically, the independence of Jane. This theme, on a broader scheme, suggests women's independence, a subject that is not uncommon, but unorthodox at this time period. Another common allusion is a biblical allusion. These set a religious tone in the novel. Not only does Bronte allude to the Bible, she also uses religion to play a role in the development of Jane, most notably the religious boarding school and St. John Rivers. These things seem to have a negative effect on Jane, which cause her to sometimes stray a bit from religion. Even though she is negatively effected by those two elements, Jane still has religious morals that are found in the novel. Jane is honest and is not afraid to speak her mind to anyone. One can find many elements that make this book enjoyable and well worth reading. Even though starting out slow, the action intensifies with plot twists and suspense that make one rush to finish this novel."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"Don't let the title of this review deceive you. I really enjoyed this book, very much. It does, however, follow a strikingly familiar formula, as do many of the &quot;strong heroine&quot; novels of the nineteenth century.Jane Eyre is a girl orphaned at a young age. She endures a very Dickensian treatment at the all-girls orphanage she is relegated to by her less than sympathetic relations, after being branded a trouble-maker, and having a bad character, and a deceitful dispostion.She survives the orphanage, only to be enlisted in the employ of a Mr. Rochester, as tutor and nanny to his charge, Adela. She is at once intrigued, if not a bit repelled by his brusque nature, and yet finds herself falling in love with him.Jane is caught up in the mystery of the 'tenant' on the third floor, a dangerous, diabolical person who places Jane's life, as well as Rochester's, in jeopardy, as Jane goes about her duties, all the while growing more and more amorous of Rochester.Eventually the identity of the 'tenant' is revealed, and Jane must chose between love and sense of duty. Being the forthright person that she is, she of course chooses duty, much to the heartbreak of both herself and Rochester, who has grown as enamored of this plain, headstrong creature as she has of him.Jane Eyre plays out in a very formulaic manner, much like many novels of the same ilk, but it is a wonderful read. The characters are engaging and entertaining. The story holds a few twists and turns, and delivers a very well-realized conclusion.For anyone who had this book thrust upon them in their teens, give it another try. For those who did not, it is well worth a first look."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"Reviewers may say that as an author, Charlotte Bronte does not quite equal the best classical writers, or that her plot is too contrived, or that her dialogue is too stilted. None of these things matters, because in Jane Eyre, Bronte created a character whom I believe has no equal in fiction.Jane Eyre is a survivor in an age much more merciless than today. Condemned and degraded as a little girl by adults she trusted, she never loses her grip on her self-respect. Although she is reviled by her guardians and boarding school authorities, she retains not only her belief in herself but her innate goodness. Instead of returning harsh treatment with bitterness, she develops a character containing equal parts of toughness and kind benevolence.Her integrity is perceived by an employer whose deepest need is to recapture his own integrity, which he believes lost. Jane's guarded response to him forms much of the book's plot. Jane emerges quietly triumphant in a world in which she encountered hostility and love and ignorance and enlightenment, and met it all head on."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"...and that's saying a lot coming from me. I read about 2 books a week but none has captured me the way &quot;Jane Eyre&quot; has. Many of the reviewers here have said that the vocabulary is difficult but this is what makes Charlotte Bronte such a fabulous writer. She was a poet before a novelist and all of her dialogue is written in prose. I've seen the Orson Welles version of this movie but a movie couldn't possibly do justice to this book. Ms Bronte not only relates us to Jane Eyre but with the prosaic descriptions she allows the reader to feel what Jane Eyre feels. Also, the book is timeless...unrequited love, jealousy, rage, passion..will never go out of style which is why even readers 100 years from now will still be unable to put this book down. I've recommended this book to my daughter as my mother has recommended this book to me and as her mother recommended to her. I know this book will continue being passed from generation to generation and I plan on reading it a second time."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"This was a terrible book to try to follow.

If you are a FEMALE, give it a try. The only reason schools asign this is because a woman wrote it. Email me your comments."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"Alright, I admit that I am a student and was forced to read this book.That said, I still do not understand what would ever bring anyone to consider this work remotely good, much less classic. Ms. Bronte's writing, while properly structured, lacks any ability to move or inspire a reader. Her character-- for there is only one character, the rest are mere background-- is a selfish brat who eternally whines about the unfairness of the world, except of course when that unfairness works in her favor, when she either glories in other's pain or trying to inflict more upon them. ... Bronte strains one's gullibility often throughout the novel, especially in its conclusion where she apparrently runs out of ideas and starts inserting magic and telepathy into an otherwise reality-based novel for the purpose of bringing the characters back together. She clumsily tries to blugeon the reader into the appropriate emotional state by cutting out any scene which is not miserable (including a goodly eight years in which Jane has friends, a good lifestyle, and a promising career-- the author claims they contain \\"no significant interest\\"), and her lack of subtlety has on numerous occasions given me an actual headache.As to the love story- where is it? The plot of the book consists of two things only: a small child growing up to get revenge on all those who she disliked as a child (everyone), and an adolescent sexual fantasy involving breaking a proud spirit and mutilating it at one's pleasure. (\\"Reader, I married him.\\"--of course HE had nothing to do with it.) Oh, yes, and i forgot: hatred of everything and blindness to all that is good. That's three things, i guess. These bleary tales are obviously the product of a small and vicious person, and I sincerely hope that if another Charlotte Bronte comes into being, she becomes a recluce and leaves us normal, relatively happy people alone. (The original did one, it seems, but not the other.)This book, if it has any value at all, is to show the world the darkness of man's nature. If one wishes such a book, read Macbeth or Lord of the Flies, for at least their authors knew how to tell a story.Do not buy this book."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"Irony, in small doses, isn't too bad. In fact, it is sometimes enjoyable. But this book takes irony to the next level. If Dickens' Tale of Two Cities was ironic, then it's met it's match. Mrs. DeFarge also being Little Girl with Bad Past is nothing compared to this. Honestly, what are the chances of stuff like this REALLY happening? The guy you want to marry just happens to have a crazy lady harbored upstairs, who happens to be his wife? The people who save you from starvation and death just so happen to be the nearest and dearest relations you have? Give me a break. Every new twist and turn of the 'unexpected' plot made me sick. Now, if it just so happened that Mr. Rochester was Jane's father, and his wife was her sister...Now that might have sparked a little more interest."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"Alright, this book was god awful. The begining dragged on about how poor and oppressed Jane was it was so cliched that i could've guessed what was going to happen next. Most all of the characters were two demensional and the plot was basic. This was more of a character development novel then a plot based novel. I'm not sexist in the least but this is truely a women's novel. The style was sappy and drawn out, and it was to much of a love story. I'm not trying to be macho but gentlemen don't waste your time."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"Jane Erye is a girl who is adopted by a wealthy and mean step-mother.

That said, I think I'll offer a different perspective than the rest of the reviewers. That perspective is that this book is one of the most boring, bland, lifetime-ish wastes of paper known to (wo)man. To give an example of what I mean, it takes 3 CHAPTERS to lead up to the failed wedding! The author goes into great detail describing every little minute insignificant meaningless thing that happens (such as a chapter for her to say she didn't want Rochester's gifts)-and it takes her 20 frickin pages to say that she's leaving a guy. Somehow, this got to be considered a literary classic about feminine empowerment.

Read this book while dieting, you will appreciate the small portions you have consumed when Jane is grateful for having a whole slice of bread to herself.Jane does not lead an easy life, yet grows to be a charming, well educated, unassuming woman.

When I saw the 2011 Jane Eyre with Mia Wasikowska and Michael Fassbender, I had to read the book because I was hooked.Charlotte Bronte has such talent for words. She brings you to Jane's life, her experiences, her thoughts, her feelings with such clarity that you feel like you are actually there. The narrative proceeds with great pace, just right, not too slow nor too fast. She'll take you to those great houses....those \\" Halls \\" ... Manor ....those big beautiful homes we see only in travel books.... But she has put life in them. So we see what it is like to actually live there. And what a \\" life\\" she has put in those houses!Charlotte narrated a life that is so full of passion! Among others.....grief from death, isolation,, fear, courage, sympathy, faith in the goodness of others, and Love! Mr. Rochester is a very attractive character...full of life.The dynamic between a young 18 year old girl and a 38 year old man is realistic enough. The young inexperienced girl had to earn \\"life out there in the real world\\" before she can actually be on the same level , (somehow) as Mr. Rochester. This is not the typical beautiful underdog being saved by a handsome powerful man. It is more about 2 people completing each other."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"I have read this book a number of times and am always intrigued by the plot.

Even more surprising is that after all this time, I was unaware of how the book ended, so the entire conclusion was unspoiled for me. I am not a huge fan of literature from this period, although I could appreciate the gothic atmosphere and the very puritanical British-ness. Jane is a profound character and it's no wonder she is a favorite literary figure. Her determination is inspiring and I very much enjoyed witnessing her evolution. I don't think I can say much more about this most fundamental novel, other than it was so much better than I expected."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"After reading Jane Eyre 5 times, I learn more and more things.

While all the people associated with Christianity are shown in a negative light, Jane's search for freedom and willingness to forego comfort for truth inspired me."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"This is an age-old book that remains a favourite. There is language and an intriguing plot so the reader is left captivated from beginning to end. Worth a read."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"I have previously reviewed Jasper Fforde's The Eyre Affair and stated that although I had never read Jane Eyre, I enjoyed Fforde's take on it. I had also prided myself on never having read recreationally anything that could be considered literature that wasn't required for school. I started Jane Eyre with the attitude that I'll read it until I get bored, then stop. I didn't get bored. Charlotte Bronte created a masterpiece that kept me enthralled from start to finish. There was crime, passion, mystery and women's rights rolled into one effort. For the era in which it was written, Jane Eyre was an amazing book showing a woman of intelligence and strong character. Now I have to reread The Eyre Affair to really appreciate it."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"The first time I had ever heard about Jane Eyre I was a senior in high school, and no it was not required reading. I feel as though more and more the school systems are moving away from great literary classics. I for one did not read very many, and as an English major in college, I find I have to do a lot of catching up on my classics . . . but that's a totally different topic.I saw very early on in Jane Eyre a sort of Cinderella story unfolding, and it turned out to be very close to the story, however it was by no means exactly like the Disney version everyone knows. I loved her struggle, independence and stop-at-nothing-to-be-happy-and-fulfilled drive to change her life. At first I was angry with her for leaving Rochester, but then I felt respect for her because she was just standing up for her morals and values. Plus, it all turns out happy in the end!The one part of the novel I was unhappy with was when she runs off into the country side and coincidentally discovers her long lost cousins, the Rivers. This part of the book is very dry and dull in my opinion. It also gets creepy when her male cousin St. John tries to marry her. Yuck! But, going through that section makes the ending that much more enjoyable and happy. Some men may not like the end, but it is very beautiful and romantic. Cinderella gets her prince. This is a great feminist novel as well."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"I had never seen any of the movies before I read the book, but I wanted to see what all the fuss was about since the newestJane Eyre [Blu-ray] came out.Jane Eyrehas now become one of my favorite novels. It's great literature, written very beautifully and in which every sentence, every chapter is important to the events in the book. When Jane Eyre begins telling the reader her story, you're immediately drawn in. The book wasn't that difficult for me to read--I occasionally had to look up some words on my Kindle's built in dictionary and I know absolutely no French (some characters speak sentences/words in French, but it's very minor), however this didn't take away from the beauty of the book at all.The whole romance between Jane Eyre and Mr. Rochester is amazing. It's definitely not trashy...it's classy and sophisticated...it's romantic.Charlotte Bronte evens manages to weave in a deep mystery at Thornfield Hall, done VERY successfully. I love mysteries and I had my own hypothesis of \\"who-done-it\\" and why, and was WRONG. I love that.I don't want to give anything away, if you're a new reader like I was. The movies do not even compare to the book (I went to compare as soon as I finished the book); the book is so much better, it's a delicious classic to read. I was very sad to finally put the book down when I was finished. Jane Eyre is a must read, and definitely a re-read. One of my top favorite books now.For Kindle readers: There are little to no errors in the Kindle Edition ofJane Eyre. Reading on the kindle definitely took out the anxiety factor of reading a thick book. No TOC. The only thing that slightly bothered me was instead of having the whole name of a city/town/county that ended in \\"shire\\" it was presented as \\"---shire\\". But not a huge dealbreaker considering it's free. I'm not sure if this is how it was supposed to be presented or not."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"I have to say I am truly surprised. This is the third time I've read Jane Eyre, and yet the first time I've found anything positive about the experience. I read it once as an 11/12 year old because my mother bought me a lovely red leather-bound edition (apparently she loved the book and thought I would too). I hated it- too hard to read, too much philosophical rambling, no action, annoying heroine, etc. I read it for the second time as a freshman in high school because it was required. I no longer found it hard to read, but I still found Jane annoying and unsympathetic, and I still hated the book.Fast forward to this year and my decision to revisit the classics, including giving Jane Eyre one last try before forever consigning it to the \\"I just don't understand how people can like this book\\" pile. All I can say is thank goodness I gave it that one last try because the book is a masterpiece. All the philosophical rambling that bored me before is now a central element to the text, superior in many way to the storyline itself. I see now that there is a lot of action for a book of its time, and Jane is certainly not annoying so much as she is inspirational. I mean, she is still a bit pious for my taste, but even so she rebels strongly against the conventions of her time to try to live a life that she finds both emotionally and spiritually satisfying.All of the things that annoyed me when I read this book as a child are the elements that resonate most strongly with me as an adult. I read this book too early, and was too dismissive of it at the time. Like with Anna Karenina, I saw everything in black and white with the merciless clarity of a teenager; I now understand how wonderfully shaded with grey life (and good literature) often is. If you haven't read Jane Eyre since high school, I highly recommend giving it another try- definitely a 5 star!"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"It's hard to imagine a better gothic romance than \\"Jane Eyre\\" -- gloomy vast houses, mysterious secrets, and a brooding haunted man with a dark past.In fact, Charlotte Bronte's classic novel has pretty much everything going for it -- beautiful settings, a passionate romance tempered by iron-clad morals, and a heroine whose poverty and lack of beauty only let her brains and courage shine brighter. And it's all wrapped in the misty, haunting atmosphere of a true gothic story -- madwoman in the attic and all.Jane Eyre was an orphan, abused and neglected first by relatives, then by a boarding school run by a tyrannical, hypocritical minister. But Jane refuses to let anyone shove her down -- even when her saintly best friend dies from the wretched conditions.But many years later, Jane moves on by applying to Thornfield Hall for a governess position, and gets the job. She soon becomes the teacher and friend to the sprightly French girl Adele, but is struck by the dark, almost haunted feeling of her new home.Then she runs into a rather surly horseman -- who turns out to be her employer, Mr. Rochester, a cynical, embittered man who spends little time at Thornfield. They are slowly drawn together into a powerful love, despite their different social stations -- and Rochester's apparent attentions to a shallow, snotty aristocrat who wants his wealth and status.But strange things are happening at Thornfield -- stabbings, fires, and mysterious laughter. Jane and Rochester finally confess their feelings to each other, but their wedding is interrupted when Rochester's dark past comes to light. Jane flees into the arms of long-lost family members, and is offered a new life -- but her love for Rochester is not so easily forgotten...\\"Jane Eyre\\" is one of those books that transcends the labels of genre. Charlotte Bronte spun a haunting gothic romance around her semi-autobiographical heroine and Byronic anti-hero, filling it with brilliant writing and solid plot. It has everything all the other gothic romances of the time had... but Bronte gave it depth and intensity without resorting to melodrama.Bronte wrote in the usual stately prose of the time, but it has a sensual, lush quality, even in the dank early chapters at Lowood. At Thornfield, the book acquires an overhanging atmosphere of foreboding, until the clouds clear near the end. And she wove some tough questions into Jane's perspective -- that of a woman's independence and strength in a man's world, of extreme religion, and of the clash between morals and passion.And Bronte also avoided any tinges of drippy sentimentality (Mrs. Reed dies still spewing venom) while injecting some hauntingly nightmarish moments (\\"She sucked the blood: she said she'd drain my heart\\"). She even manages to include some funny stuff, such as Rochester disguising himself as an old gypsy woman.The story does slow down after the abortive wedding, when Jane flees Thornfield and briefly considers marrying a repressed clergyman who wants to go die preaching in India. It's rather boring to hear the self-consciously saintly St. John prattling about himself, instead of Rochester's barbed wit. But when Jane departs again, the plot speeds up into a nice, mellow little finale.Bronte did a brilliant job of bringing her heroine to life -- as a defiant little girl who is condemned for being \\"passionate,\\" as an independent young lady, and as a woman torn between love and principle. Jane's strong personality and wits overwhelm the basic fact that she's not unusually pretty. And Rochester is a brilliantly sexy Byronic anti-hero with a prickly, mercurial wit.Of Charlotte Bronte's few novels, \\"Jane Eyre\\" is undoubtedly the most brilliant -- passionate, dark and hauntingly eerie. Definitely a must-read."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"I remember that I read Jane Eyre back in high school... This time, it was completely different!! I can only guess that, as a teen, I was impatient for action, and skipped over large parts, not taking the time to truly read the book.This is a very absorbing tale! Yes, it is clear that it was written from a very non-modern outlook, and that it is not completely timeless. However, it is also clear just how different this character is from the norms of her time. The characters and their personalities are clearly drawn, and it is easy to see that they broke the mold then, and that they still break the mold now.I ended up re-reading the book immediately after finishing it.

Jane develops a relationship with her employer that soon blossoms into a fierce love but Mr. Rochester has a secret that he is keeping from Jane that threatens to rip everything apart leaving Jane utterly homeless and alone.This book has been talked about time and time again and I think one of the main reasons it stands the testament of time is that Charlotte Bronte creates a heroine who is so easy to sympathize with and Jane's connections with her audience is felt throughout the entire book and begins on the first page. This to me is the best thing about the book because we know exactly how Jane thinks, and feels and we come to love and adore her for her plainness, intelligence, and spirit. Of course it also helps that our hero Mr. Rochester is so attractive with his brooding, temperamental personality but he is one of my favorite male characters in all of literature because he is so developed I can picture him perfectly in my mind. Every young woman dreams of meeting their Mr. Rochester because he loves Jane with a passion that is hard to believe could exist. So I highly recommend reading this novel because I think it deserves all of the attention it gets. Charlotte Bronte is a master storyteller and uses such elements of horror to create a timeless gothic romance novel."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"Though it took me a while to find the time to read this lengthy tome, I am so glad I did, because I absolutely adore this novel. I loved the story, the characters, the blend of romance, mystery, and gothic elements--in short, I loved everything about it!The story is a fictional memoir, which narrates the life of Jane Eyre from the age of 10 to about age 19. We follow Jane from her miserable childhood living with an aunt and three cousins to her sojourn in a charitable boarding school for girls, and then to her station as a governess (at age 18) in the country estate of Mr. Rochester. I will not spoil any of the plot twists (if you don't already know them), for there are several and they make the story truly compelling. Jane herself is an immensely likeable protagonist, right from the start. Even at the tender age of 10, she is full of spirited passion, which makes her real and believable. She grows up before her reader's very eyes, and for me, it was a pleasure to watch her development as a person and character.It has been a long while since a \\"classic\\" work has so absorbed my attentions and thoughts. Once I found the time to read it, I raced to reach the book's conclusion, and then I was sad when I finished the final page--which to me is always the mark of a truly great book! I wholeheartedly recommend \\"Jane Eyre\\" to any lover of literature, and to any and all romantic souls...it (and Jane) will not disappoint!"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"Hands down one of the best pieces of literature I've ever read, I mean this book is somewhere in my Top 3 and I've read a lot of books. At first glance, some people might think this is a cheesy love story, but it's not. It is very much a love story but actually a REALLY GOOD one!! I love the main character Jane Eyre and how she's able to be humble and respectful, at the same time growing in the story and speaking her mind when she needs to, standing up for herself. The story flows soooo well and takes you on a journey that is brave, devastating and beautiful all at the same time.Charlotte Bronte, correct me if I'm wrong, hasn't written too many novels, but she didn't even need to. This book stands on its own and I can call her one of my favorite writers of all time, solely based off this one book. Just incredible stuff all around, incredible writing, story, description, imagery - this book has everything you want from a piece of literature. Please get it and you'll be thrilled you did! I can guarantee this book will become one of your favorites of all time :)"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"One of the great gothic romance classics of all time. This novel was written and published in the 1840's, well before women were conceived to be \\"gifted\\" enough to command an audience. In fact, all the Bronte sisters published under male pseundoyms (Currier Bell, Acton Bell, etc.) in order to be considered serious writers.This novel is a story about enduring character and its ability to strive for the unattainable and inconceivable. A poor orphan raised by an aunt and uncle, Jane is schooled in a loveless environment of neglect. She graduates from this dreary environment and is hired by Rochester to tutor his ward, Adele.The employer-employee relationship between Rochester and Jane grows into a solid friendship. From there, it graduates to love. Unfortunately, there is a shadow over this relationship that precludes a happy ending and Rochester's past comes to haunt him. Fortunately, Jane's strength and enduring character help Rochester surmount his painful past. Her love nurtures Rochester in his darkest hours.This book has continued to be one of my favorites over the years. The Kindle version is free, so if anyone is looking for an excellent book to add to their Kindle collection, I heartily recommend this."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"I personally resent both the opinion that teenagers cannot appreciate good literature and the notion that all classics are dull. I read this book for the first time at age thirteen and loved it, and as a huge Bronte fan, cannot fathom why so many people I know cast off classics as boring. My only guess is that they have not read them.I will skip giving a plot overview here. But I will mention that one complaint I have heard frequently is that there is little action in this story. Well, just because our attention spans have decreased drastically because of TV doesn't mean that good books should move just as fast. The beauty of the macabre and ethereal Jane Eyre is not in the plot, though that is also wonderful, but in the descriptions of Jane's own feelings and turmoil and love. She is easy to relate to for women of all ages - who hasn't understood the feeling of wondering where to go with one's life?I have also heard complaints that there are problems with the edition, especially spelling mistakes (i.e. Rochester calling Jane Janet). This is a pet name. It appears in every edition true to the original text - often, it is taken out to avoid confusing people. Overall, Penguin is a wonderful classics publisher, especially the annotations and footnotes. They explain a lot of the dated references or confusing dialect.Though I personally would have preferred a bit darker a novel (i.e. Wuthering Heights), I believe this to be one of the timeless classics of English literature and a must-read for everyone, lit major or not."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"The story of an innocent young woman who falls in love with a mysterious older man with a dark past is tried and true. In the hands of Ms. Bronte, it acquires a depth of feeling and sincerity of emotion that raise the story type above the maudlin. There may have been other gothic romances similar to \\"Jane Eyre\\" before this was written, and there have certainly been many after it, but none have been quite so wonderful.Lord Byron may have supposedly invented the Byronic hero when he wrote about \\"Manfred\\", Mr. Tortured By A Troubled Past... but Bronte's Mr. Rochester is a perfection of the type. He's sensitive, yet abrupt. Demanding, yet tender. Proud, yet remorseful. Every time I read this book, I fall in love with him all over again.Jane Eyre herself is an even more complex character than Mr. Rochester. She's tough and stern, yet playful. She has a firm moral center and does not hesitate to do what she believes is right, even when it hurts herself or those around her. And by being true to herself and what she knows is right, she ultimately triumphs over a variety of people who might do her great injury (intentionally or not). Again, literature has seen many sturdy, spunky heroines come and go, but Jane Eyre is a perfection of the type."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"Last night I finished reading Jane Eyre and I just cannot ever remember being so moved by such a book. Throughout the whole novel, I screamed in shock, in agony, and in suspense. To the very ends of its pages, I would turn each leftlet in fevor, waiting wishing and trying to imagine what would happen. I would not have had the strength to run from the man I loved; I would not have the dignity to turn down St John; I would tremble in the presense of such a strong willed and determined woman as Jane. She set her faith on the One Above and let him guide he no matter what. Her challeges and triumphs are proof of that in itself. I really wonder what Charolette Bronte could have possibly been going through when she sat down to write this book. Every word is delicious and savoring yet some are quite agonizing, so much in fact that I once threw the book down and didn't want to read on, for fear of what Mis Bronte woudl throw on me next. This book will probably be my favorite book of all time. I just dont think I can desribe in words how much it has effected me. I really want to discuss this with someone, but it seems everywhere i talk about it it falls on deaf ears. One day I hope everyone in the world has the pleasure of reading this masterpiece. for that is what it is, a pure work of genius!"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"I enjoyed this book tremendously. I picked it up off our bookshelf after having run out of things to read, and was not expecting much. I think it was left over from one of my children's school assignments. Anyway, it just grabbed me, and never let go. The plot twists are wonderful (although maybe there is one that is a little hard to believe, but that's why they call it fiction!). Jane's character is one that anyone could identify with, not pretty, not special in any way, and low in the self-esteem area. But through the course of the book, she blossoms, and reveals herself to be a woman of great strength, intelligence and integrity. Her relationship with Mr. Rochester is complex and satisfying. It is the kind of book that will cause you to ponder it for some time to come."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"Charlotte Bronte is one of my favorite authors of all time. She is praised not only for her beautiful and eloquent writing but also for her captivating stories that fascinates readers of all generations. In this riveting novel that many considered the most prominent literary work of Charlotte Bronte, the life of a 19th century young English woman, Jane Eyre, is portrayed vividly. It is a life of shocking reality, a combination of misery and at the same intrigue and triumphs. Starting from her youthful years, she is met with great obstacles. As a small girl, Jane lived under the scrutiny of her cold hearted aunt, who not only showed bias but also cruelty. Sent to Logwood School at a young age, Jane is cast aside from the other students. Constantly tortured by her teachers and declared as a definite sign of evil and wickedness, she has grown up through a bitter childhood into a woman of great determination and tremendous courage. Striving in a world meant for the wealthy and fortunate, Jane is granted a job as a governess in the mansion of a rich yet mysteriously shrouded man, Mr. Rochester, who only visits the place years at a time. Handsome and prosperous, Mr. Rochester has had his own life of torment, one complicated by deception and remorse, and a shadowed past of beguilement concealed by intricate lies that haunted him for years. Yet, either by coincidence or fate, he unexpectedly went back to his mansion right after Jane's arrival. Inspired and warmed by Jane's calmness and wisdom, the pair soon becomes entangled in a complicated labyrinth of romance mingled with obscurity and dark secrets. With the greatest chance of happiness inches away, Jane discovers a terrifying truth, one that can ultimately destroy ...or save her.Through the main character, Jane Eyre, Charlotte Bronte graphically woven this book into a world where we, as readers, can all connect to. I highly recommend it to everyone! It is a classic that cannot be put down!"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"The story of Jane Eyre is a classic tale of a search for human compassion. From the tragedies of her orphaned beginnings and a childhood with a hateful aunt who, out of spite, sends Jane to a prison-like life at Lowood Boarding School, Jane's strength of character shines through. Through each ordeal the reader develops a true concern for this \\"plain Jane\\". When she finally begins to find a more content life at Thornfield and as her relationship with Rochester develops into love the reader feels happiness for her, but follows her through the depths of despair at the shocking revelation that prevents her from marrying him. The reader cheers for her as she rebuilds her life as a strong, independent woman who is able to choose her destiny.Jane Eyre is a beautifully written book, although at times Charlotte Bronte's descriptions were very wordy and therefore the reading process was difficult. Understandably, this descriptive style of writing was typical of an era in which the average person did not have the opportunities we now have to envision different people and places."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"Charlotte Bronte takes a plain Jane, and makes her one of the most memorable characters from the likes of Bronte sisters. This novel starts at a boarding school, as we learn of Jane's painful childhood, grows into an exciting love story as governness Jane falls for Mr Rochester, (whose daughter she tutors), and after a lot of twists, drama, separation and engrossing trains of events Jane finds home, love and happiness.I have had read the abridged version at age of 11, and loved it then. Over the years, I have repeatedly reread the novel. Like all classics, everytime I read it, it offers an array of previously unfelt emotions and of course remains as enchanting as ever. To say very least, it is like your favorite soap opera that you watched while growing up, has characters and events you nearly can never forget, and due to its ageless charm, you revisit those times and emotions through all the reruns and remakes. Maybe the weight of my years of association makes this novel unforgettable for me, but trust me, read it and you will definitely feel the romance, the pain, the emotion, the passion: and maybe like me, return to read it again!"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"Jane Eyre, by Charlotte Bronte, is a touching love story from the 19th century. Within the first few pages you will be swept up into a poor orphaned girl's troublesome life. Jane Eyre's sorrows, triumphs, and love are woven together in an almost magical way that keeps you reading until the end. There is mystery, suspense, and drama in this book, and also humor and happiness.Jane is an orphan who was raised by her cruel Aunt Reed. She was sent off to a charity bording school called Lowood. There our 'poor and plain' heroine spends eight years. With sad and happy memories from Lowood, Jane departs to become a governess at Thornfield Hall. Little does she know of the mystery in the attic or the love that awaits her.I reccomend this book to anyone who enjoys reading a good classic. It's really a magical tale that is worth reading over and over again.The reading is moderately hard, it is probably about high school reading level. I loved it, andunderstood it, even though I am in 8th grade.I think that when I finished this book I was slightly changed from what I was when I started this book. I can really relate to Jane Eyre, and that is why I think that girls tend to like this novel more than boys. Also because it is a romance,but who knows, it really depends on what kind of person you are.Jane Eyre is a passionate novel that sketches the way women felt in the 19th century, and what they went through. Jane Eyre's passion pours out of her so strongly, especially in this sentence:\\"...my soul began to expand, to exault, with the strangest sense of freedom, of triumph, I ever felt. It seemed as if an invisible bond had burst, and that I had struggled out into an unhoped-for-liberty\\""},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"I thought I was seeing things, so I enlarged the picture of the cover: does it *really* say Jane Eyre, by Emily Bronte? I know that it's the thrift edition, but was it necessary to be so thrifty that they credited the wrong sister? Maybe I wouldn't have been so \\"up in arms\\" if this weren't my favourite novel of all time... I still remember reading it for the first time... wondering about the mystery and fear surrounding Grace Poole (don't worry: I've given nothing away). Ms *Charlotte* Bronte has written a romantic, mysterious, heartbreaking page-tuner of a novel, and everytime I get to the last page, I'm bereft. Read it, at any cost...I see that the people who've dissed the novel have largely been *forced* to read it at school etc. Shame that they feel this way, because it's one of the most powerful novels with a woman protagonist that has ever been written.Yes, Charlotte has written what feels to our 21st-century eyes like a romantic piece of pap, but consider this in the context of the time: it was written by a woman (albeit under a male pseudonym initially), about a woman character who was in control of her own life, and able to make her own life decisions, rather than being under the male yoke. This was groundbreaking stuff, and actually manages to subvert the apparent genre. Read from this perspective, this novel is revolutionary, and far from pap.(By the way, if you want to read a *real* Emily Bronte novel, then it's probably Wuthering Heights you'd be after)"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"I don't especially know why I picked &quot;Jane Eyre&quot; off my shelves recently. It had been sitting there since I read it when I was younger and whilst perusing said shelves for something to amuse myself with, I came across it. I thank the Lord that I did because it's been the best read I've had since &quot;Girl With a Pearl Earring&quot;. The plot: compelling and captivating. The narrative: descriptive, philosophical, flawless. The charaters: both believable and lovable. I was so engrossed I found myself getting angry when plans went awry and on the verge of tears when they went right. I recommend that you DO NOT read this while you are young, as a previous reviwer suggested... I did so the first time around and in no way shape or form was able to appreciate its subtleties and sheer elegance to a thousandth of the degree I do now. It IS romance; but even if that's &quot;not your bag&quot;, you'll enjoy the pure power of Ms. Bronte's work. READ THIS BOOK: you won't regret it. Definately in my top 5 of all time."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"After her uncle dies, Jane Eyre is grudgingly raised by her aunt (bound unwillingly by a promise made to her husband), in a home where she's constantly reminded of her inferior birth, orphaned state and dependence on her relatives. To top it off, she is of unremarkable appearance and is as poor as a church mouse. Yet there is something in Charlotte Bronte's protagonist that sets her apart from the rest of the world, a sense of self-worth and self-discipline that gives her strength and resilience against the many hardships that she'll face in her lifetime.Charlotte Bronte's story begins with Jane as a young girl, living unloved and neglected amongst the untouchable splendour of Gateshead and the Reed family. Jane's only escape is in her love of books and learning, for her spiteful aunt and cousins have no control over the power of her mind - though reading must be done on the sly as John Reed will stoop so far as to deprive her of books he has no interest in himself. When such an event occurs, Jane summons up the spirit to defend herself against her cousin and is duly punished for it. Estranged from human company, her aunt orders her locked in the red room, the chamber in which her uncle dies and which holds imaginary horrors for Jane. This terrifying experience is the catalyst of her childhood which will be remembered in all frightening and unnatural occurrences henceforth in her life.Relief from her extended family comes only when she is called away to school, and despite the poor living conditions and the zealous religious restrictions of Lowood School's patron Mr Brocklehurst, Jane finds a new outlook on life through her somewhat sentimental friendship with the pious Helen Burns. Amazed at Helen's patience and resilience with teachers that constantly heckle and beat her, Jane discovers Helen's devotion to God which puts to shame her own practice of fighting back at those who wrong her. An important stage in her inner growth, Jane takes upon herself Helen's teachings, survives illness at the school and enters the world as a governess.It is here that the story begins proper (not that the proceedings are unimportant), as Jane takes up a governess position for the young ward of Mr Rochester at Thornfield, stretching her wings for the first time. Here she befriends the elderly housekeeper Fairfax and her young charge Adele, and finally comes to meet her master, the intimidating and elusive Mr Rochester. Sharing a prickly and awkward acquaintance at first, Rochester soon recognises the intelligence and wittiness hiding behind Jane's modesty and plainness. Respect turns to friendship, and from there comes the first inklings of love...But something is amiss in Thornfield in the novel's most overtly Gothic thread. Jane becomes increasingly aware of sinister goings-on in the house: mad laughter rings throughout the halls at night. Mr Rochester's bedchamber is set alight and only Jane's quick action saves him from death. A stranger arrives at the house whose presence upsets Rochester and who is found badly wounded that very night. Jane suspects the quirky housemaid Grace Poole, but ultimately this mystery has a far more devastating answer, which once more upturns Jane's life and ambitions.Charlotte Bronte's heroine is one of literature's most unique and introspective characters; an ever evolving and maturing individual, who constantly searches her soul and conscious for meaning and identity. Jane's self control is remarkable, as his her ability to rationalise problems and follow through with the decisions that she makes. By today's standards, where self-indulgence and reward-systems are the norm, Jane's state of mind is like a bucket of cold water over the head. When the moment of Jane's great choice comes, she reacts exactly as should be expected, not as some overly-virtuous, too-good-to-be-true Victorian girl. Unlike other heroines, who might be repulsed or frightened at Rochester's offer, Jane is very sorely tempted. It is from herself and the knowledge of her own weakness that she flees, not from Rochester and his pleas. In this moment the strength of her conviction and will-power is sure to impress.It is important to know that this is not just a romance novel, though it is certainly the driving force of the latter half of the novel. What is most fascinating about the relationship between Jane and Rochester is the complex power struggle that goes on between them, something that often does away with romantic disillusions and deals with the practical and often uncomfortable components of attachment. Mr Rochester is Jane's employer, her social superior and a man considerably older than our teenage protagonist, yet Jane is constantly attempting to exert a sense of control over him and her feelings for him, knowing the cost that would come in succumbing to the man she describes as nearly taking the place of Almighty God in her estimation. The games they play with each other, the testing and the intrigues formed between them are riveting stuff and explore the darker power-struggles of male and female relationships that are almost always lost in typical romance novels. Bronte creates an astonishing amount of equality between the two lovers, for as the novel progresses Rochester becomes more and more reliant on Jane.Jane Eyre is in many ways a feminist novel, addressing to its contemporary audience the drudgery and monotony of female existence that \\"confine themselves to making puddings and knitting stockings, to playing on the piano and embroidering bags\\". Jane's \`adventures' through school and into the world of employment, her experiences of passionate love and destitution in the wilderness, reflect Charlotte Bronte's own struggles in a man's world. Most (if not all) of the men that Jane meets in her travels attempt to control her in one way or another, and Jane is constantly fighting to walk her own path. As she says at the crucial point in her life: \\"I care for myself. The more solitary, the more friendless, the more unsustained I am, the more I will respect myself.\\" The loneliness apparent in this passage, and the aloneness in which she spends most of her time is what makes the character of Jane so memorable - here is girl that has no one to look out for her but herself, and yet she keeps her kindness, faith and honour without falling into self-pity or bitterness.\\"Jane Eyre\\" is one of those classic books that everyone's heard of - but it's up to you to take the next step and read it for yourself."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"The epic story of Jane Eyre, Charlotte Bronte's 'poor and plain' 19th century heroine, is a rare and wonderful combination of intelligent prose and keen emotion. It's a sweeping masterpiece of a love story, and a book which, even now, remains as accessible and valid as it did upon its first release.Jane, the heroine, is an orphan, being raised by her cruel Aunt Reed. Tired of her troublesome charge, Mrs. Reed sends Jane to board at Lowood Charity School, where she discovers a new way of life, sometimes as cruel as her time at Gateshead, sometimes full of friendship and laughter. Presently, she accepts the job of Governess to the precocious daughter of Mr. Rochester in Thornfield Hall, and falls in love. She discovers inner strength and self-worth through the redemptive power of that love.Unlike the novels of Jane Austen, Bronte's heroine is from an underprivileged class, and the mood of this story is generally sombre. However, compared to 'Shirley', or Emily Bronte's masterpiece 'Wuthering Heights', 'Jane Eyre' takes what is essentially a sorrowful tale and imbues it with vivid, if brief, descriptions of happiness and love. A sense of belonging pervades the latter half of the story, thrown into high relief by several traumatic events, and culminating in Jane achieving her heart's true desire - a family of her own.It's a more straightforward and rewarding book than most 19th century epics, and for that, it's a better way of introducing oneself to 19th century literature. Bronte's acute awareness of the complexities of human emotion is palpable, and her heroine Jane displays a sense of isolation and self-reliance not found in many other novels, contemporary or otherwise. This is the hook, this is what draws the reader to the character of Jane, she is hard and self-sufficient, without resorting to bitterness or introversion. This subtle contrast forces us to empathise with Jane's plight, and we are all the more satisfied by the story's end.Basically a love story played out against the backdrop of harsh, austere 19th century rural England, 'Jane Eyre' is a book you will return to, again and again. It's romantic, gothic, sparse and, conversely, lush, and truly deserving of its status as Classic. Buy it."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"The title character of this novel is unusual, indeed, extremely rare - Marian Halcombe in The Woman in White is the only other such romantic literary heroine I can think of - in that she is not physically attractive. She has neither looks nor fortune. Most romantic heroines have the former but not the latter. It is Jane's character alone that the hero falls in love with. It is clear from the writing that Charlotte herself was unattractive and painfully aware of it. Strangely, the reading public have been unable to accept this, the very element of the book that makes it a perfect romance. The portrait of Charlotte that is most often reproduced is an idealized effort that makes her look beautiful. And whenever a screen adaptation is made of the book, the actress playing Jane is always beautiful. This reduces the theme to that of a rich man falling for a pretty servant girl. As always with classic literature, if you have only seen the movie, you emphatically do not know the book.My first Bronte novel was Emily's Wuthering Heights, which I found very disappointing, with its heavy-breathing masochistic melodrama. But sister Charlotte is a writer of a very different caliber. From the first few pages, the reader knows they are in the hands of a great artist. The heartrending portrait of childhood with which the story opens is based on the author's own experiences, and it shows.The book is not without flaws. The latter stages of the plot are carried along by a series of totally incredible coincidences and there is rather more Victorian melodrama than most modern readers would care for. But it remains, with its Plain-Jane heroine and its unlikely hero (in the end, he satisfies none of the conventional requirements of a romantic hero) the perfect romance. Never was the power of love more satisfyingly expressed."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"I'm sorry and rather shocked that our kids apparently find this marvelous novel a drag.

It is one of those special books which can be read and savored over and over, and seems to improve with each reading. The tale is narrated by Miss Eyre, herself, inviting a special and intimate relationship with the reader. It is through Jane that we meet and grow to care about, or hate, so many of the memorable characters one becomes acquainted with on these pages. And it is through her narrative, first as a little girl, then as a young woman, that Jane's complex persona is revealed. From an early age her morality, wit, determination, sheer grit and romanticism are evident.Published in 1847, the novel, at first glance, appears to be another well written gothic romance, of the kind so popular in the Victorian Age, with its mystery, horror, brooding hero, touch of the melodramatic, and dark castle-like setting. The rise of poor orphaned Jane, who against all odds, redeems her tormented hero through her steadfast love, is really not unique at all. Charlotte Bronte did not, however, write a mere romance, no matter how riveting the read. Throughout, the author makes some serious statements about women's equality, the treatment of children, and of women forced into a dependent state during the Victorian epoch, religious hypocrisy, romantic relationships between men and women, the nature of true love, and the development of self. This is a beautifully written work of fiction which combines a riveting storyline, compelling characters, vivid descriptions along with a powerful testimony about the period in which the book was written.Young Jane, orphaned at an early age, is grudgingly taken-in by her Aunt, Mrs. Reed, who seems to despise the child. The Reed children are spoiled rotten, and the eldest son is somewhat of a sadist who abuses his young cousin terribly. Aunt Reed always finds a reason to blame Jane for the household's ills. When the boy takes his torture too far and Jane attempts to defend herself, her aunt has her locked in the room where her uncle died, terrifying the poor girl into hysteria. Unwilling to care for the girl any longer, Mrs. Reed packs her off to the harsh Lowood School, a miserable charitable institution which is more like a prison than a place of education. Lowood's despicable headmaster, Rev. Brockelhurst, does everything in his power to break Jane's spirit. At one point, when he asks Jane how to avoid going to hell, she defiantly responds, \\"I must stay well and not die.\\"A particularly compassionate teacher recognizes Jane's intelligence and sensitivity and befriends the girl. When Jane graduates she stays to teach at Lowood until her mentor leaves to marry. Jane then decides it is time for a change, and applies for a position as a governess. She is offered a job at the distant Thornfield Manor. Mrs. Fairfax, Thornfield's housekeeper, welcomes her warmly and introduces her to the staff and to little girl who will be her pupil, the precocious Adele. She is not, however, introduced to all the household's inhabitants - especially not to one who inhabits the uppermost floor. Thornfield's owner, Mr. Rochester, (one of my favorite literary heroes), is away when our protagonist arrives, yet it is he who will have a most profound effect on her life - and she on his.If you have not read \\"Jane Eyre\\" yet, why wait any longer? If you have not reread it for a few years, now's the time! My highest recommendations!The Barnes and Noble Classic Edition provides an excellent Introduction and Notes by Susan Ostrov Weisser, a Professor of English at Adelphi University where she specializes in nineteenth-century literature and women's studies. Her research centers on women and romantic love in nineteenth-century literature, as well as on contemporary popular culture. This is a hardcover book. Highly recommended!JANA"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"Reading any Bronte work requires the rare ability to speak in both a refined and musical woman's English accent, and immediately switch to the voice of a commanding and brooding male who likes to throw things.Susan Erickson is up to the challenge.

It captured my imagination as a young teenager and it continues to capture my imagination as a grown woman with a child of my own. I read it probably about once a year and every time I read it, I find more to love. The story is timeless and the themes are relevant even in today's world which is certainly a mark of Bront's prodigious talent and insight.This is a feminist tome in so many ways. Right up front, we are told of Jane's plainness and in an age when being pretty was about the best a woman could hope to be, this is an especially significant detail. It quickly becomes clear that Jane will not make her way in the world thanks to her looks and it immediately frees the author to focus on what is truly important: Jane's heart, soul, and mind.Her grossly abusive childhood is repugnant in all senses of the word and especially so when one considers that there were likely many, many young girls who suffered in exactly the way Jane suffers. This is a great characterization of the concept of heartless charity and false piety. Aunt Reed and Mr. Brocklehurst are textbook examples of Christians who have no real connection or adherence to their beliefs, who are more or less going through the motions in order to make themselves look good in the eyes of others. I find the scene where the sumptuously attired Brocklehurst women visit Lowood to be one of the book's many stellar scenes. With great subtlety and skill, Bront drives home her point that those who excel at making themselves appear superior to others are often those leading the most hypocritical of lifestyles.I am also always struck by the realization of how bleak Jane's prospects are. Ultimately she is fortunate to find a position as a governess in a house with one obedient and affectionate child. Though Ad&egrave;le is nowhere near an intellectual equal to Jane, she is not the wild, spoiled child that many governesses likely had to suffer. What's more, Jane has an employer who may be absentee, taciturn, and mysterious but pays her well, solicits and respects her opinions, and sees her as his intellectual equal. Again, Bront vividly underscores Jane's lot with the scene in which Lady Ingrahm bemoans the \\"martyrdom\\" she has suffered because of her many governesses, at which point her spoiled and gold-digging daughter professes how much she and her siblings enjoyed tormenting the women forced to attempt to educate them.As for the romance, it is one of the very best. There is no scene that can even hold a candle to Mr. Rochester's description of the string that binds him to Jane. The passion between Mr. Rochester and Jane is so vivid that it practically leaps off the page and it is sexy in a way that no tawdry novel could ever hope to replicate.Ultimately, though, it is Jane who makes the story what it is. Though it may break her will or her heart or both, Jane refuses to be anything less than true to herself, a truly revolutionary concept given the era in which the novel was written. Jane is strong-willed, loving, and intelligent and she never seeks more than to be exactly who and what she is. Though she is a kind person, she seeks no one's approval and when she must ultimately make a choice between her own soul and her heart's desire, she refuses to compromise herself in any way. There are few messages stronger than this for women of any age.This is a truly ageless masterpiece that demands repeated readings and that deserves a place of honor on the shelf of anyone who loves literature. I can hardly wait to share it with my daughter when the time comes. In this age of Bratz dolls and Britney Spears, girls need a role model like Jane more than ever."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"It's hard to imagine a better gothic romance than \\"Jane Eyre\\" -- gloomy vast houses, mysterious secrets, and a brooding haunted man with a dark past.In fact, Charlotte Bronte's classic novel has pretty much everything going for it -- beautiful settings, a passionate romance tempered by iron-clad morals, and a heroine whose poverty and lack of beauty only let her brains and courage shine brighter. And it's all wrapped in the misty, haunting atmosphere of a true gothic story -- madwoman in the attic and all.Jane Eyre was an orphan, abused and neglected first by relatives, then by a boarding school run by a tyrannical, hypocritical minister. But Jane refuses to let anyone shove her down -- even when her saintly best friend dies from the wretched conditions.But many years later, Jane moves on by applying to Thornfield Hall for a governess position, and gets the job. She soon becomes the teacher and friend to the sprightly French girl Adele, but is struck by the dark, almost haunted feeling of her new home.Then she runs into a rather surly horseman -- who turns out to be her employer, Mr. Rochester, a cynical, embittered man who spends little time at Thornfield. They are slowly drawn together into a powerful love, despite their different social stations -- and Rochester's apparent attentions to a shallow, snotty aristocrat who wants his wealth and status.But strange things are happening at Thornfield -- stabbings, fires, and mysterious laughter. Jane and Rochester finally confess their feelings to each other, but their wedding is interrupted when Rochester's dark past comes to light. Jane flees into the arms of long-lost family members, and is offered a new life -- but her love for Rochester is not so easily forgotten...\\"Jane Eyre\\" is one of those books that transcends the labels of genre. Charlotte Bronte spun a haunting gothic romance around her semi-autobiographical heroine and Byronic anti-hero, filling it with brilliant writing and solid plot. It has everything all the other gothic romances of the time had... but Bronte gave it depth and intensity without resorting to melodrama.Bronte wrote in the usual stately prose of the time, but it has a sensual, lush quality, even in the dank early chapters at Lowood. At Thornfield, the book acquires an overhanging atmosphere of foreboding, until the clouds clear near the end. And she wove some tough questions into Jane's perspective -- that of a woman's independence and strength in a man's world, of extreme religion, and of the clash between morals and passion.And Bronte also avoided any tinges of drippy sentimentality (Mrs. Reed dies still spewing venom) while injecting some hauntingly nightmarish moments (\\"She sucked the blood: she said she'd drain my heart\\"). She even manages to include some funny stuff, such as Rochester disguising himself as an old gypsy woman.The story does slow down after the abortive wedding, when Jane flees Thornfield and briefly considers marrying a repressed clergyman who wants to go die preaching in India. It's rather boring to hear the self-consciously saintly St. John prattling about himself, instead of Rochester's barbed wit. But when Jane departs again, the plot speeds up into a nice, mellow little finale.Bronte did a brilliant job of bringing her heroine to life -- as a defiant little girl who is condemned for being \\"passionate,\\" as an independent young lady, and as a woman torn between love and principle. Jane's strong personality and wits overwhelm the basic fact that she's not unusually pretty. And Rochester is a brilliantly sexy Byronic anti-hero with a prickly, mercurial wit.Of Charlotte Bronte's few novels, \\"Jane Eyre\\" is undoubtedly the most brilliant -- passionate, dark and hauntingly eerie. Definitely a must-read."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"More than a simple love story, a gothic romance, a Victorian novel, or even a female picaresque work, Jane Eyre is, quite simply, a wonderful book. Written, as it was, in Victorian England by a female author, Jane Eyre has occasionally been pigeonholed as a garden variety gothic romance. It is much more than this, however: not only is it a genuine classic, it epitomizes its genre. There are several factors that set it above the pack. For one, it is extremely well-written: Bronte's characterization is masterful and the plot is well-developed. One comes to identify with the character of Jane, who narrates, and the other characters in the book, most of whom are well-drawn, rounded characters. The book also features other elements which are unusual for a book of its kind and which were genuinely new at the time. For starters, take its protagonist, the title character: she is not beautiful, like Edith Wharton's Lily Bart; she is not rich, like most of Jane Austen's female characters; she is not ambivalent and wish-washy like Kate Chopin's Edna Pontellier; she is not an intellectual. Jane is a well-drawn, rounded, truly believable character -- and a genuinely likable one. The reader comes to empathize and identify with her. Strong-willed, independent, and indefatigable, Jane is not a hard-to-like character like the aforementioned Edna Pontellier from The Awakening; the book could almost be called a female picaresque novel, were she not so practical and solid a character. Also setting the book above its ilk are several dark story details that set the book above the of the typical love story. Bronte also uses the book as a medium to criticize certain aspects of Victorian culture: the inhumane and non-emphatic treatment of the poor by the rich, the denial of the pursuit of happiness, the plight of orphans and other who had no well-defined place in society, the often cruel sternness of church and other authority figures, among much else. Bronte also pauses from time to time to take on spiritual and quasi-philosophical elements, which give the book an added depth and sophistication. With all of this, Bronte succeeds in bringing the book out of the sphere of mere feminist literature: its universal theme and eclectic contents set it above the works of Austen and Chopin, among others. Though many aspects of the novel show it to be a clear product of the Victorian era, the book, with its just-mentioned strengths, is a universal work that will endure for centuries yet to come. In this way, it is much more applicable to our present day than works such as, say, The House of Mirth, which deal primarily with ephemeral concerns. On top of all this, it is a wonderful and delightful read. What we have here is a true classic.This is essential reading for any fan of romances, gothic literature, or Victorian literature in general; readers looking for a truly great and easily-accessible classic need also look no farther."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"Jane Eyre, by Charlotte Bronte, is an enticing Victorian love story of a young woman as she grows and matures. The plot made me want to read so I could find out what happens. The characters have realistic feelings and thoughts, which made me sympathize and feel with them. Even though I thoroughly enjoyed this book, I often found myself re-reading a paragraph so I could fully understand what I had just read. These long paragraphs, however, did not stop me from reading forward and liking the book.I would recommend this novel to late high school and college students. Girls who gravitate toward love stories with sweet sentiments might find the tale of Jane Eyre more enjoyable than others who are not such romantics."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"It's incredible to think or imagine that, of the two most intense, passionate heroines of 19th century literature, both would be written by sisters of the same family. But this is, indeed, the case. With Charlotte Bronte's Jane Eyre, you are drawn into a personal narrative that from the start is compelling and becomes more disturbing and troubling. Many things have been written about Jane Eyre as a character, but to me there is no doubt that her intense character compels you to understand very specific and certain imperatives (nowadays described as feminist - then, Bronte was alone in imaginging it).The 19th century was a deeply moralistic society, at least on the surface, but one within and beneath which women as such had no identity or power beyond certain circumscribed roles (governess, wife, spinster, etc.). With Jane, you have a particular set of codes of behaviour that are radically established and are uncompromising about the male-dominated status quo: to cope with all circumstances without significant protest; not to give in to compromise that will drag your own personality down to nothingness; to speak up in situations involving the most appalling difficulties, when it matters; don't give in to compromise that will drag your own personality down to nothingness; ultimately, remain true to yourself. Such coda are radical not only in 19th century literature, but all literature before.Jane Eyre is a revolution in thinking and morality as far as male and female relationships are concerned. The only other novel that is as passionate, and as determined in thinking of the singular female self as Jane Eyre, is Emily Bronte's novel, Wuthering Heights, and her character, Catherine Earnshaw; yet Jane Eyre remains, through her novel, uncompromised of her own integrity and character, despite her circumstances et al. Catherine, according to Emily's narrative, is never given such a choice, or options of such freedom, i.e. independent female thinking.Charlotte Bronte's Jane Eyre is an astonishing novel: besides Wuthering Heights, by her sister Emily, it is one of the most passionate, intense, uncompromising, painful, and beautifully and intensely emotionally sustained novels of all literature. An astonishing achievement, irrespective of genre, author or century."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"I've watched the movie(s) over and over but have never read the book until now.I knew what was going to happen, and still I couldn't put it down.I will be reading it again."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"I loved this book so much, I have started everyone I know reading it!!

I was fascinated by just about everything Jane Eyre went through.It takes me a while to read books but it didn't take long for me to read \\"Jane Eyre\\" by Charlotte Bronte. My daughter read it in grammar school and she enjoyed it, but I think I enjoyed it better because of the period it was set in and the way the story evolved.Whether you are in high school or an adult, if you like classic stories, I don't think you can go wrong with this classic romance novel.Kindle 3G, Free 3G + Wi-Fi, 3G Works Globally, Graphite, 6\\" Display with New E Ink Pearl Technology"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"Great read!

The book came in wonderful condition (considering its age). Could not be happier with this purchase!!"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"Although classics are largely respected books for their ability to withstand the test of time, in most cases, these classics often seem overly erudite for most students. JANE EYRE seemed to, at first, embody the rather intimidating characteristics of a classic, but I later learned that it was my lack of experience, not my lack of old-English proficiency that hindered my true respect and understanding for the novel.Compared to other classics, such as the novels of Charles Dickinson, JANE EYRE presents itself in a more approachable style of writing. This helps readers of many different English proficiency levels be able to understand Jane Eyre's tragic events and unusual acquaintances.Despite the fact that many can grasp the literal meaning of the story, it takes a lot more experience and wisdom to be able to fully understand the underlying messages. Some themes that were hidden were the limitations of women in society and the conflict that people have to accept themselves.JANE EYRE, quite truthfully, was a rather slow and sometimes dull read for me. Although my first read was disappointing, I'm sure that I will be able to learn more from the novel when reading it in the future when I encountered different events and experiences. This unending learning that can be earned from reading classics is probably what justifies their endurance through continuous changes in culture and language. I highly encourage readers to read JANE EYRE periodically throughout their life because a new side of this book will be revealed every time it is read."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"For me, the book was a little slow getting started. But it was definitely worth the read. I'm glad I finally read this book after all these years."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"The story of Jane Eyre is so moving that I hardly put the book down once I started to read. The passion and surprises are well worth your time."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"I think I like this book for the reasons that make some other people hate it. Jane and Mr. Rochester are not the typical protagonists of this kind of story: Mr. Rochester is not the usual Prince Charming, nor is Jane the usual beautiful princess. He is cold, self-centered and doesn't like children; it is difficult to see at first why she loves him. She is poor, plain and unladylike. A quiet rebel, not a fire-spewing one. She wants Mr. Rochester all right, but under her own terms. All this is narrated with unsurpassed intensity of feeling and beautiful language. The passages in which Jane uses her paintings to reveal her love for Mr. Rochester, are simply exquisite, like when she draws herself as the plain governess that she is, comparing herself with her alleged rival, a gorgeous woman of fashion, or when she draws a portrait of Mr. Rochester in order to have before her &quot;the face of a friend.&quot;A few clumsinesses of the plot can be forgiven considering the times in which the novel was written. For example, Jane receiving a big inheritance coming just from nowhere, or Mrs. Rochester being killed all too timely. At Jane's time, the only way a woman of her condition could be independent was to be independently wealthy, and the only way for her to have that kind of money was to inherit it. Also, if she went back to live with Mr. Rochester (as she clearly intends to do), while his first wife was still alive, most probably the novel would have been considered too scandalous for publication.I have read this lovely book I don't know how many times, and I always find it exhilarating and haunting. Being a fan of Jane Eyre doesn't seem to be considered intellectually glamorous these days, but then, I plead guilty to it. I never get tired of this book, and I don't think I ever will."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"Jane Eyre, is my hands-down favorite novel. Breathtaking in scope, Charlotte Bronte wrote a novel that is gothically romantic (given the popular style of the day), a commentary on Victorian England social mores, and of forbidden love...breaking the barrier between class. Jane was a feminist, controlling her fate, her life, despite whatever constraints (other people, social, financial) she encountered.Anyone who believes in the dismantling of the welfare state, should read this novel (and Charles Dickens for that matter) to get a better idea of the reality of a world in which &quot;unfortunates&quot; are dependent upon the random kindness and/or charity of others."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"It's easy to understand and it starts to get fun when Jane falls in love with Mr. Rochester"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"Jane had to face a tough decision, and she made the decision she thought was right, that makes me love her character even more.

I enjoy the older books better than most of the new ones."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"Numerous movies have been made of this novel, or based in parts on the novel, and there is a reason why: it is a haunting, coming-of-age story, with a dark mystery and love story embedded within. Jane Eyre, who is shunted around due to her &#34;unladylike&#34; intelligence and strong sense of self, discovers love with her employer-the strange and moody Mr. Rochester. He is hiding a secret though, and it will threaten Jane's chance of happiness. Unlike many &#34;love&#34; stories from past and present however, Jane uses her inner-strength to succeed on her own, and sets the example for future &#34;strong women&#34; stories that have developed since this groundbreaking novel was written.The wordy descriptions and redundancy of some of the writing clearly dates this novel as a &#34;classic&#34; but do not let that scare you from reading. Having read this more than once, I like to skim much of it, including descriptions of her early years at the school Jane is sent to, for standing up for herself at the home she were she grew up. The descriptions DO set the mood for everything, but are still overly-wordy, which was the norm for this period of writing. One exception to this, is the novel &#34;Ivanhoe,&#34; set during the time of Robin Hood and written during the time of Queen Victoria's birth. Otherwise, as with the Bronte's works, you will deal with a lot of seemingly-useless descriptive paragraphs. AGain, it does set the mood though, and the writing itself is beautiful, even if it doesn't always forward the purpose of the story.This story is haunting, much like &#34;Wuthering Heights&#34; but I prefer &#34;Jane Eyre&#34; any day for the sheer strength of the heroine, and the surprisingly moving passion of the star-crossed lovers."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"A good classic.

The Penguin Classic differs slightly from the Norton Edition (which was assigned), so I found myself looking in the text for further detail, but it is the same story. The Norton simply gives footnotes to explain certain things, such as translating some of the French phrases. Great if you have a commute and need to read this, or just want to.

However, I started it again a few days ago and completely fell in love. I love the prose, the plot, everything. I just can't keep myself away from it. Bronte's writing style is so poetic and beautiful that the story itself could be absolute trash and I would still love this book.Thankfully, though, the novel is not a load of tosh and the story itself is engaging beyond belief. Jane is left with her uncle's wife when he forces her to care for her when he dies. She's cared for about like Harry is at the Dursleys and escapes to school. Unfortunately for Jane, Hogwarts does not await her, but a rather dreary school. She remains here for 8 years, first as a pupil, then a teacher. She later gains employment for a gentleman who pays her twice her wages at Lowood and there she meets the love of her life. Unfortunate events prevent them from marrying and she continues to seek a happy place and make her way. I won't give away more.If you like Austen you will love this book. It's got the characterization and insight of Austen's books with the adventure of a more modern novel. The average young male probably won't appreciate this particular book, but I advise women at least 16 and older to read it. It is absolutely fascinating and much better than the current pop-literature pumped out today."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"Jane Eyre was long, wordy and old.

Her cousin John, who is the master of the house, always harasses her. Jane leaves to go to school, and then she put an ad in the newspaper. A lady named Mrs. Fairfax comes to take her to where she works so Jane can live with them. Jane is a governess who teaches a little girl named Adele. When the master of the house, Mr. Rochester, comes and Jane starts to like him. Jane is eighteen when she went to live at the house in Thornfield.After Jane has been at the Thornfield house for so long she gets a letter saying that her aunt is dying. So Jane goes to her aunts house before her aunt goes and stays for a little bit until she has to get back to work at Thornfield. After that she leaves Thornfield and found a nun who knew her parents. Jane heads back to Thornfield and falls in love and almost marries. But then she finds her self-alone and penniless, then Jane finds that she is rich. The book is good and exciting until the end because of what happens to Jane in the novel.The book has a lot of mystery like when Jane had to put out a fire in Mr. Rochester's bedroom, and romance. In the book in the beginning there is discrimination against woman's rights when master John hurts Jane with his bare hands, this book does have woman's rights in the beginning and in the middle of the book. This book is interesting because it was very expressive of how a teenage life is through this book. The reason why it is so expressive is that the book drags out a teenager life of how problems come and go around. When they explain what is going on in the story with Jane the author explains the weigh she takes the problem in the novel.This book would be really good for people who like love stories and mysteries all in one.

The musical nor the movie will never ever return the stirring of emotion that I felt for Jane's character while reading it from the creative and romantic mind of Charlotte Bront? I did cry when Jane witnessed the death of her very best friend, Helen Burns, in Lowood School. I felt bitter and angry when Mr. Rochester did not tell Jane about his first wife, but I also felt relieved when Jane and Mr. Rochester rekindled their love to face a new life together.If there is one novel that will ever touch my heart, look at my life as a woman, and respect the heroics that women of past ages have undergone, this is the novel.Jane Eyre: this will be a novel respected for ages to come."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"Humbled Jane Eyre(pronounced air) is turned out of her aunt's house after being accused of throwing a gobblet at her master's 16yr old son, then sent to a boarding school for girls.

(I didn't read much at all for that matter.) And now as an adult I have the fortune of visiting some of the great works of literature for the first time. Jane Eyre was a challenge for me initially because I believed I wouldn't identify with the character much. The more I allowed myself to become immersed in the story, the more I was impressed by Jane's courage of character, even as a young girl.Jane Eyre has an intellectual confidence, noticeable from a young age, which she draws from in order to challenge those seeking to place unnatural limits on her. Her aunt Reed emotionally abused her as a child, and still Jane had enough perspective to fight for her own justice. When she was sent away to a boarding school (with only slightly better conditions than before), Jane suffered further emotional trauma but also learned to thrive in spite of everything. Her negative experiences informed her towards a life of seeking goodness.When Jane finally crosses paths with Mr. Edward Rochester, she faces choices of both heart and mind that few women of that time would be prepared for."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"When we first see Jane as a child in the opening pages, we see her as one who is orphaned and left to the not so tender mercies of an aunt who for want of a better term is just plain mean. Jane is made to feel like an outcast by the very ones, who because of their consanguinity should have blessed her with love and affection. As she matures, she is at first pictured as one who must balance precariously between being an obnoxious little brat and one who deserves our sympathy for her state. In the school to which she is sent, first as a student then a teacher, Jane is seen in terms of such purely perceived sensibility that we do not doubt for a moment her own reality, even if we doubt the validity of her external reality. It is this successful ability to create a sharply defined subjective heroine that paves the way for us to equally accept the existence and credibility of the wild, moody, and totally Byronic Rochester. We do not see him as what he truly is: a flat character whose only purpose in the novel is to dash about on a horse and hide crazy women in his dank castle. We see him as Jane does; that is as Charlotte Bronte does, as a real life man from her own days of fantasizing about a teacher who was, to Charlotte at least, the very personification of manliness and virility.Charlotte Bronte also included a number of sociological subtexts that probably ring just as much true today as they did in her day. She presents in chilling detail the child abuse that was rampant simply because not enough people took the trouble to take notice and petition the government for redress. She addresses the male patriarchal attitude that did not allow a young woman to make her way alone in the world except in the accepted role of governess. She also exposes the unwanted issue of what to do about the rights of the mentally ill. As we read JANY EYRE today, we notice the melodrama and the sociological subtexts, but we do not pay them much attention, which is probably just as well. Instead, what we take away from JANE EYRE is the ability of Charlotte Bronte to make us feel the pain of a cruel world, even if we, or Jane herself, can do little about it except to remain as human as we can."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"4.5 stars on this one! This is almost a 5 star book for me - the only reason it's not, is because it's so long.I know it's a classic and all that, but it's just SO descriptive...I ::heart:: the Jane Eyre character and Mr. Rochester as well. It blows my mind that the horrible school/orphanageJane gets sent to is based on the boarding school Charlotte Bronte went to as a child.

I was just expecting a sort of Gothic romance, but this is so much more. There may be some spoilers in what follows, but I will try to stick to general, thematic terms rather than disclosing specific plot points.Jane Eyre is, above all, a novel about the unity, versus the duality, of mind and body, reason and emotion---or, as Bront puts it, \\"judgment and feeling\\"---particularly as this applies to the Christian religion. Christianity is, of course, committed to dualism, but Bront, though paying lip-service to religion, rejects this, depicting its evil in many of its manifestations. Some of the devout Christian characters she paints as blatant hypocrites, but even those whom Jane respects or even admires, when it comes right down to it, she does not emulate. Jane seeks happiness in this life, here on earth, while even the \\"good\\" Christians are doomed to seek it only in the next, and that by sacrificing it in this one.The basic story idea brilliantly demonstrates Bront's theme: Jane is given the choice of a loveless marriage, or unmarried love. The latter situation may seem a bit contrived to the modern reader, and indeed it seems as though Bront herself feels this on some level, as the passionate appeal of Jane's lover is much more convincing than her reason for refusing him---namely, that the laws forbidding both divorce and adultery must be in place for *some* reason. (That may be generally true, but they clearly don't apply in this case, or make an exception for it.) Even when she is finally able to follow both her heart and her mind, it is only after these Christian principles have resulted in the horrible crippling of her beloved, which damns those principles all the more.In short, Jane Eyre is a book about a woman's struggle to stay true to her whole self---heart and mind---against Christianity's attacks on both fronts. I don't think it was Bront's conscious intention to write a novel condemning Christianity for sundering our hearts from our minds, but only what she viewed as corrupt interpretations of it---yet that is what she did, and it is brilliant. Both her heart and her mind were clearly much more dedicated to this life than the next, as Jane Eyre powerfully demonstrates. This is a novel way ahead of its time, in many, many ways."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"The story Jane Eyre is a classic romance novel. This story was written in in 1847 by Charlotte Bronte. As you can image the story is very influenced by the social norms of that time. But in essence that is what make the story so believable. Jane Eyre is about a young girl who was orphaned and made to stay with her cruel rich aunt. In Jane's younger years she gets verbally and physically abused by her aunt and cousins. One day Jane fights back and is eventually sent to a boarding school for girls. The life style at the school is harsh and dangerous. The girls living their have very little clothing, food, shelter, and people willing to take care of them. Because of these bad circumstances illness strikes. After that occasion the climate in the school changes to one where the girls are provided for. Jane is able to get a wonderful education, and when she graduates she decides to become a governess. She puts an add out in the paper and is contacted by Mrs. Fairfax to become the governess to Adele Varnes. Jane goes to live at Thornfield Manner. She spends many happy months there. Until Mr. Rochester comes to visit. He is Jane's employer and the guardian of Adele. Mr. Rochester confuses Jane in ways that no one every has. Love sparks between the two of them. But this love is tested by secrets from Mr. Rochesters past!I found all of the characters in this story to be believable and realistic. They seemed like people you would meet on the street. Well, minus the fact that they have the mannerism of someone from the 1800s. In particular I love Jane Eyre. She is a strong woman. That any female could relate to. It surprised me when I first read the book that she was so strong, since this book was both written in the 1800s and took place there. Also, the emotions that Jane has are very realistic. While she was at the girls boarding school she lost a friend and it felt really real when it happened. I will admit to shedding a few tears when it happened. I think that the bases for a good book is if the story can touch the reader and for me this book did.I did really like the story. The plot and characters where both interesting and well thought out. At times the book was very slow and my interest was lost. It could get a little boring if you don't have a lot of patience and determination. My favorite part of the book was the ending. The ending was happy and a good solution to both Jane and Mr. Rochester's problems. It left me satisfied and I didn't have anymore questions. My least part of the book was the middle. There wasn't enough change in the story and Jane was too caught up in her own head. There needed to be more action there or even a new character. The middle just didn't do it for me.I would recommend this story to someone else. Probably an adult or a teenager. Like I said before you need a lot of patience and determination to get through the book. So, for anyone under the age of 15 it would be a very difficult read. To really enjoy this book you have to love history and a good romance. To really get this book you have to understand the motivations of people in the mid 1800s. It really wouldn't make to much sense to someone who doesn't have a grasp on history. I would give this book 4.5. The plot and characters in this story are amazing. However the plot sometimes is somewhat slow. Overall I believe that Charlotte Bronte did a wonderful job writing this book."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"Similar in some respects to other Victorian era novels, this one is more exciting than most. Things happen. There is mystery and intreague. Even so, it's difficult at times not to get fed up with the flowery, laborious, self-aware banter that men and women of the day seemed required to engage in. Some of the prose is very clever, and that's always fun to hear. But there are times when you want to just shout: GET TO THE POINT, ALREADY! Nonetheless, there's a few great moments, and it's a fun book."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"When our AP English teacher first informed us we were to read Jane Eyre as an over-the-summer assignment, my first thoughts were not very positive. Fortunately, as I started to read I was pleasantly surprised by how quickly I connected to the story. Jane begins in this bildunsroman as a insecure and naive young girl. She develops into a strong and independant woman, both physically and psychologically. I enjoyed that her relationship with her love, Mr. Rochester, is realistic and not based on the skewed prince charming image that many women project men to be, even during this time period. Jane Eyre is not a book that grips you from start to finish, but it's a very interesting read and a timeless classic that I am sure to read again."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"I cannot say what has not been said by earlier reviewers here. My only contribution is that this character is perhaps one of the early examples of a feminist, a working woman (think Eleanor Roosevelt) despite Jane's eventual wealth.

The writing, shockingly, has held up through the many that have passed since this book was first published."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"Just to correct some other comments, the present book is only \\"Jane Eyre.\\" It is not a collection of books by the Bronte sisters as implied in the spotlight comments above.This is a great read. I bought this Oxford Classic after reading some very negative comments by Virginia Woolf in her polemic \\"A Room of One's Own.\\" There she thought that Charlotte Bronte had gone overboard mixing fiction with her own conservative views of feminism. So, I was eager to see how bad this book was.This is a great read and I read the book almost non-stop for two days. It is hard to put down. This was Charlotte Bronte's first successful book and it is her best. I am reading her next book written after \\"Jane Eyre\\", \\"Shirley,\\" and it is not as clearly structured. The present book is similar in some ways to that great classic \\"Madame Bovary\\" in that it is compact, concise, and consists of a well formulated plot; and, it has one strong central protagonist. It is a clear and compelling read. By the way, the character is almost the complete opposite of Madame Bovary in terms of morals.One can quibble about parts of the story since it relies to some extent on coincidence and luck. Those parts lack realism.The book was attacked by Christians at the time of publication almost 160 years ago and later by feminists. But that is secondary.This Oxford version has a good analysis. It has a biography of Charlotte Bronte and comments on her sisters. The Oxford introduction by Sally Shuttleworth places the book in histrical context. Also, extra notes are included on the text. I read the comments after reading the book, and the less you know about the plot before reading the book better off you will be.This is simply a great read."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"Jane Eyre is a brilliant novel!

Miss Ingram is just as spoiled as Adele, intolerant, shallow, and insensitive. I don't really understand why Jane did not really investigate the strange laughter and Grace Poole.

The book Jane Eyre by Charlotte Bronte tells the story of a strong woman named Jane and her growth from a rejected orphan to a strong and independent woman. After living like a servant in her cruel aunt's home, Jane is sent off to receive an education at a poor institute for orphans. After witnessing the death of her best friend and surviving six more years there, Jane becomes a teacher and eventually a governess at the Thornfield Manor under the master, Edward Rochester.Unlike many stories about love, in this one it is Jane's intellect and passion that is what attracts Edward Rochester. They fall deeply in love, but the discovery of Edward's insane wife causes Jane to run away. Charlotte Bronte uses her talent with words to vividly describe Jane's pain.\\"Jane Eyre, who had been an ardent expectant woman---almost a bride---was a cold, solitary girl again: her life was pale; her prospects were desolate. A Christmas frost had come at midsummer; a white December storm had whirled over June; ice glazed the ripe apples, drifts crushed the blowing roses; on hayfield and cornfield lay a frozen shroud: lanes which last blushed full of flowers, to-day were pathless with untrodden snow...My hopes were all dead---struck with a subtle doom\\" (314).Homeless, penniless, and near death Jane somehow finds work and a place to stay. Her path of self-discovery continues in the finding of her cousins and her inheritance of her uncle's fortune.She finally returns to Edward to find him staying with his servants. The once wealthy businessman had become wifeless, homeless, blind, and crippled from a fire. Jane and Edward's love had not diluted in their time apart but grew stronger. The story ends happily with Jane and Edward's marriage and birth of a son.This book is written with such detail and emotion, you instantly connect with the young woman. The depth and compassion of this book draws the reader in and teaches him/her about determination and self-worth. Her morality and strength, in a time when women were not accepted for their minds, makes Jane stand out from other heroines. When she is at the point of near death from hunger and fatigue, she will not give up.\\"While the rain descends so, must I lay my head on the cold, drenched ground? I fear I cannot do other wise: for who will receive me? But it will be very dreadful, with this feeling of hunger, faintness, chill, and the sense of desolation-this total prostration of hope...And why cannot I reconcile myself to the prospect of death? Why do I struggle to retain a valueless life? Because I know, or believe, Mr. Rochester is living: and then, to die of want and cold is a fate to which nature cannot submit passively. Oh, Providence! Sustain me a little longer!\\" (351).Jane Eyre is a classic book, but the text is quite long and at times can seem to trail off. There are points in the book that don't move and slow down the story. During one conversation between Jane and Edward the story feels like it's dragging on.\\"'Sententious sage! So it is: but I sear by my household god not to abuse it.'\`You are human and fallible.'\`I am: so are you-what then?'\`The human and fallible should not arrogate a power with which the divine and perfect alone can be safely entrusted'\\" (144).Over all, the book is excellent. It is captivating and powerful. It is a long read, but worth the time. I would recommend this book to everyone, not only women. Regardless of the gender of the hero, this book shows what one can accomplish no matter what obstacles life throws your way."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"I first read \\"Jane Eyre\\" shortly after high school and was completely mesmerized by it. I have read it several times since and I come away with a different view point each time. Jane is the ultimate heroine: she's independant, doesn't bow down to what the \\"ideal woman\\" should be and doesn't let anything (or anyone) compromise her principles, even the man she loves. The book appeals to the reader both emotionally and intellectually. The emotional aspect of the book is what I love about it. When Rochester tells Jane of his feelings for her, I can the passion of the characters. And later, when Jane leaves him, the agony of the characters is palpable.\\"Jane Eyre\\" always seems to fall under \\"Wuthering Heights\\" shadow. \\"Jane Eyre,\\" I believe, is the better novel. It has all the atmosphere of \\"Wuthering Heights\\", but the romance of Rochester and Jane is far more romantic and believable than that of Cathy and Heathcliff."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"I read this book when I was 15 for a school English project when a friend recommended it- I'm now 17 and I'm actually in the process of reading the book again. It's just that good. One thing I really like about this book is that Jane isn't pretty, at least not pretty like many other girls around her, and she isn't high class, but she can still have a wonderful life regardless! This is an awesome book and even if you've never read a book like this, try it, and I'm sure you won't regret it."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"I really loved this novel.......a classic that is still great today. It's a lot more plot driven than your average classic making it an easier read than you would think. When the plot is slower, the rich language is enough to keep you engrossed. I'm a big Jane Austen fan; C. Bronte is a really good author for those who've exhausted Austen's works. She is definitely darker, but just as great!"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"Charlote Bronte is a beautiful writer who brings the reader for an emotional ride. You'll cry for Jane and laugh with her. I am only sixteen and I first read this book when I was fourteen. I fell in love with it and since then have read it many times. It is good when you are feeling sad or happy. It is also the kind of book to read on a winter's day while sipping hot cocoa."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"This novel is one of the most expressionistic novels I have ever read. It clearly conveys the love between Jane Eyre and Mr. Rochester as Jane Eyre emerges into womanhood. It is about life strengthening situations and finding a love that clearly does not look at the physical, but a true love that is deep within the heart. Jane Eyre is a great book by Charlotte Bronte and I will treasuer it where I go, and reread and reread it over and over. It's spectacular."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"I will probably read this book again. I borrowed it from a friend and will most likely get my own copy. I liked Jane Eyre as a main character better than Catherine from Wuthering Heights because Jane was more compassionate. I also liked her because of her intriguing personality. From the beginning she sets herself as different from other people, more hardy and thoughtful. Her stay at Lowood is interesting, mainly because of her relationship with Helen and the contrast between the two. Her romance with Mr. Rochester is original. Some of that is due to the fact that Jane falls in love without being made foolish by it. Her stay with the Rivers family was sort of frustrating, because her character was suppressed by St. John. I really didn't like him. The ending was very good except for the last few paragraphs which dwell on St. John. But, that aside, Jane Eyre is a wonderful book, deserving to be read and reread by everyone."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"As a child of the eighties, when reading recently published books and seeing movies, I've grown accustomed to &quot;love&quot; being graphically depicted sexual attraction that eventually turns into romance. How refreshing it is to read Jane Eyre, where the order is reversed! A portrayal of love like this is hard to come by. In Jane Eyre, everything is pure, and the love is passionate without anything you'd be embarrassed to tell your parents about. The characters are likeable - I found myself rooting for the protagonsits, hoping Jane and Mr. Rochester would wind up togther no matter how many obstacles they may come across. Yeah, there are a lot of descriptions, but surprisingly, there was even a little adventure. I enjoyed it!"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"I've noticed a trend in those readers who have disliked this novel; they seem to have been forced to read Jane Eyre. I too read this book for school, but began about six months before it was due. I think it is truly one of the most beautiful books I have ever read, with strong messages about human behavior..Jane, despite difficult beginnings in her life, became the strongest, most loving charcter in the book. Who really cares that she fell in love with an &quot;old guy?&quot; Here's a newsflash..he was only in his thirties or forties, and that isn't so old. Jane found love, and that's a bigger accomplishment than a lot of us can claim. Try Jane Eyre again some other time if you're up against a deadline..details are not evil, description is not boring. If the rest of the world says Jane Eyre is a classic, although you are entitled to your own opinion, there's a good chance it is. And one more thing-&quot;renting the movie&quot; and buying &quot;Cliffs Notes&quot; are not alternative options to reading a novel. To think that taking shortcuts in reading for school assignments is an advantage, is to fool yourself. I had a teacher give a pass/fail test in which the true/false questions relied solely upon the differences between a book and the movie made after it. Something to think about."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"It's moving and is the best love story I've ever read. Bronte vividly draws out Jane's independence and love for Rochester. Her love for him was pure and perfect but when she found out his dark secret this perfection was shattered. Jane's independent spirit guided her through the difficult times she had to face. I've read it so many times afterward I practically know the whole book by heart!!! It always makes me so sad in the end when I'm finished, though; it touched my heart..."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"When I first got this book from the library I checked it out because at the time I was going toward old (girl heroine) novels. The beginning was hard to get though and I put it aside until it was almost due. The middle went through nice enough to what seemed a perfect happy ending, until you get to the wedding. After that it starts getting really good! I gave this only four stars because I'm not big on love stories, but other than that disadvantage-and the boring beginning-this is an excellent book! You have to read it!"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"I thought I'd be sucked into another boring nineteenth century novel when I started this book my freshman year. However, I was drawn to the uncoventional love story of Mr. Rochester and Jane. Jane's strong spirit and self-dignity is very unlike the &quot;damsel in distress&quot; portrayed in most of these romantic novels. This is a novel not to be read, but to be experienced."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"A WOMEN'S MASTREPIECE&quot;Dear Reader&quot;- Charlotte Bronte's Jane Eyre was a milestone for English Literature as we know it. The fact that this captivating novel was written by a 19th century women only enhances it's genius. Charlotte Bronte acted as a trailblazer for all the women authors that would follow her; her unique style of writting and the essence of her characters stimulates the interests of every individual who reads even one line. Jane Eyre is a romantic novel about an innocent girl's voyage through life. The main character,Jane, is a orphan who we are introduced to as she is living in a house full of cruelty. The home belongs to a sour, cold women called Mrs. Reed and her three aggressive children. &quot;He bullied me and punished me ; not two or three times a week, nor once or twice in the day, but continually : every nerve I had feared hom, and every morsel of flesh on my bones shrank when he came near.&quot; Mrs. Reed's son John's treatment of jane caused harsh and long-lasting effects. The family's unjustifiable hatred for Jane results in her being sent to a distant school. Lowood is a cold, and gloomy institution for girls. Its routines are militay, its teachings are restrictive, and its conditions are horrible. She attends this school for eight years during which she excels in her studies as well as in sense. Despite the unsettled environment of Lowood, Jane enjoys her time spent there and more importantly cherishes the friendships made there. This is the place where Jane meets her first true friend Helen Burns. It is through helen's example that jane learns to be patient, diligent and expressive. &quot;Her (Helen) soul sat on her lips and language flowed, from what source I cannot tell.&quot; After eight years, Jane desires to move on in life. jane is now educated, confident and ready for change. After advertising for a teaching position, Jane accepts an offer to be a governess at Thornfield. Thornfield is a grand, old estate surrounded by the lonely moors of England. Her motive for going to Thornfield is to instruct the vibrant, young pupil Adele. The immense events and heart wrenching romance that she encounters there change her intentions quite dramatically. Jane's relationship wiht the dark and tortured owner of Thornfield, Mr. Rochester, forms the foundation of Jane's womanhood. The most unique aspect of this romance is the heroine's response to love. the majority of romance novels present a similar picture of love's hold on womane. they become increasingly more like the men they love and less like themselves. they grow weaker, more compliant and vulnerable. However, this novel's heroine does not conform but rather defies the expected. Jane discovers her love for another through the discovery of the love for herself. &quot;Women feel just as men feel.&quot; It would be pure arrogance and a literary sin if I were to describe what happens within the hidden walls of Thornfield. For this novel's majety lies not only within it's story but in the actual words of Charlotte Bronte. The way she can so vividly depict a scene or how she so clearly desribes love is a wonder. &quot;I looked at my face in the glass, and felt it was no longer plain: there was hope in its aspects, and life in its colour: and my eyes seemed as if they had beheld the front of fruition, and borrowed beams from the lustrous ripple.&quot; Charlotte Bronte had the gift of being able to capture emotion and reflect it on paper; making the image more enticing than the subject. i strongly recommend this book to anyone who has a hunger for passion, a thirst for excitement and a desire for intellect. You are not only given complete enjoyment from this novel, but a life lesson as well. This lesson implies that the only thing that matters is that you are true to yourself and to what you love. This is a lesson that you can carry with you on your own journey through life, as Jane Eyre did."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"I was at first really absorbed in reading the parts that had to do with Jane's childhood. I did not miss a word of it. However, I found the parts after she became a governess a bit boring. I had a hard time with her falling head over heels with Mr. Rochester. He is too cold and self absorbed. Not the chivalrous hero of most fairy tales. His personality doesnt change one iota despite all of the things he has been through. I never ever see a resolve where he loves and accepts Adele. I thought that his indifference toward Adele was one of the things that TURNED JANE OFF about him!! Then she goes weak in the knees over him. I just found that really hard to digest. Yes, I know it's just a fiction, but the inconsistency of the woman who *seemed* to be consistent in her character threw me off."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"I read an abridged version of Jane Eyre when I was 6 years old. I reread it 4-5 times, and finally read the unabridged version when I got to high school and have reread it about 3 times since. Jane Eyre never ceases to amaze and delight me. Having first read the book at such a young and impressionable age, I think Jane Eyre has always been my inspiration. Her courage and spunk are qualities that as a little girl, I most deeply admired and wanted to emulate. It is a wonderful book for young women to read to for its strong willed heroine who nonetheless exhibits all of the compassion and femininity that women must also possess. So much what we teach young women today is, be masculine and ruthless to get ahead in this world. Women should be proud and not afraid to be feminine. That is a power that we possess that men don't."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"The book is written in an interesting way, but it was also very difficult to read.

We usually wanted to know what happened next Sibylle &amp; Priska"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"Ladies and gentlemen, readers of all ages, I express my sheer condolences if I offend anyone from what I am about to write: The novel Jane Eyre, I thought, was boring to the extent that I would often drift asleep while reading it. Although I am not use to a story that does not go straight to the conflict, I believe this story was on going. There is some excellent imagery, and metaphorical aspects in the story, but only that can not save this narrative. If you are a person that loves a romantic setting with certain twists every now and then, this is the book for you."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"While there are wonderful characters and a somewhat clever plot, this book gets very boring! The main thrill of the novel is just a written account of most girls' dream of becoming the wife of a man to whom they are truly in love (OK, so Jane had some hardships along the way too...;-)). Of course, Jane is very independent and has no exceptionally good looks, so the story may be considered an inspiration to the female culture's wish of being respected for what is inside...? I found it an inspiration to go to bed a little sooner."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"Just imagine. You're reading along, you come to a place in the bok that captures your attention. You're completely engulfed by the story, you're not reading it, you're living it! The &quot;real&quot; world is gone. You hear neither phone nor voice. You feel neither hunger nor thirst. You feel only what the author's pen tells you to feel. You are eager to read on. Your eyes cannot read the enthralling story fast enough. In your frenzied haste to know more, you grip the book tighter and bend it back, cracking the binding.Years later when you pick the very same book up again, you can tell the scary, happy, or sad parts of the book by the location of the creases. Jane Eyre is such a book. It is one of three or four books who contentend for the multiple-crack champion.I was assigned to read this book for an AP English class. Although I love to read, class-assigned books had a dubious history with me. Most, I felt, were boring or too pessimistic to find favor with me. I had heard many people talk about the book favorably after having read it in middle school. I put my hope in their past experiences and began to read. Although the first pages did not entirely confirm the praises the book had recieved, the book so far surrpassed my expectations that I finished the book in only a few days time! I would have read non-stop if it had been within my means to do so. When I did get the chance to read, I read as much as I could to the exclusion of food and family sometimes!You may be wondering what about this book could make me such a fanatic. Well, I could give you deep literary criticism about the symbolism, the metaphors, or the imagery, but that doesn't really help you enjoy the story more, it only rounds out the meaning. Instead, let me tell you why you want to read this book.This book combines passion and logic. An odd combination that don't often go together. Jane Eyre starts out in life full of passion and emotions, through torture and schooling, she learns to control her feelings and be ruled by logic. As she moves through life she struggles to find a balance between what her emotions tell her and what logic demands. Logic helps her through times when she feels abandoned and emotions guide her back to love when the tables are turned.This book skillfully combines elements from nearly all genre and is sure to please anyone. It has action, romance, comedy, suspence, even the supernatural! This book is sure to put cracks in YOUR binding"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"---In Charlotte Bronte's classic JANE EYRE, the title character is a strong willed woman who undergoes many hardships and trials, but eventually comes out triumphant. This book is a mixed one for me. I appriciate the classic nature of this story, and I like the heroine, but there is just a self righteous tone to the entire book. ---- Jane Eyre was raised by her terrible and cruel aunt who cares not a wick for her. This was possibly her earliest hardship, yet she persevered the tough childhood years, and becomes even stronger when her aunt puts her in a terrible boarding school. Eventually, she takes a position as a nanny in the house of a rich man where she finds what it is to be loved.------ The problem I had with this story was the &quot;love&quot; between the rich man and Jane Eyre.

However, if you plan on buying it, don't get the Penguin Classics edition. Towards the middle of the novel, there are strange spelling mistakes: half of Jane's name becomes Janet, which is not even a character in the book. It gets very annoying after a while and doesn't occur any of the other editions. I definitely recommend this book, but just not this edition."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"While I enjoyed this book, I was disappointed. I found it to be verbose, going on and on for long passages where nothing much changed or happened - just repetitious. In addition, it is profoundly and deeply Christian, to the point of preachiness. This last may not be a problem for you if you happen to share the author's views.However, if you can live with its faults, it is otherwise well written. Jane Eyre and Edward Rochester are well drawn characters, interesting and unexpected. The plot has sufficient twists and turns to hold your interest. And the ending is satisfying, a big plus for me.In summary, it is more dated than, say, Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice (a personal favorite), but it is still worth reading.(This review is of the unabridged audio version of the book.)"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"This is surely the best book from the Bronte family. Out of any of the books that they have published, this one is by far the closest to being interesting.

The are many other books out there (my favorite: the unabridged version of The Count of Monte Cristo) that deserve a five. I couldn't bring myself to even give this a four.In all I see Jane Eyre as an ok book. However, it does become very dull at times and you won't pick it up and read it again if you make it to the end."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"When I was 12 my aunt gave me a copy of Jane Eyre.

Prayer in addition to other treatments is one thing, but to proclaim that prayer itself is supposed to cure women is scary stuff.Honestly, the first time I attempted to read through this title, I believed that it was a joke. I was concerned when I subsequently learned this was an administration pick for the advisory committee on reproductive health drugs for the Food and Drug Administration. This quack is actually in a prominent position to affect the well-being of myself and many other women in America.I am concerned that the Bush administration takes such an approach to women's health, but (tellingly) feels that conventional medicine is good enough for men. If the faith based perspective in this book was good enough to apply to women's bodies, Hager ought to be applying the same standard to men.Hager's very selective ideas of what is 'good treatment' reveal this doctor ultimately prescribes a bad prescription. Hager pointedly markets himself as a Christian physician, but since most of the Christians I am friends with also strike a balance between their own religious practice and the personal conscience and health of others, I am honestly not sure what to categorize him as.He does not want to acknowledge that his particular brand of Christianity does not work for every person, and could even be medically inappropriate as a treatment itself in some cases which are ironically described in this book.Still, this book does have some redemptive value. Give it to a medical student/doctor to encourage their serious practice of medicine while reminding them of what a good doctor ultimately is NOT."},{"Title":"As Jesus Cared for Women: Restoring Women Then and Now","review":"This quack played an important role in preventing women from being able to buy the morning after pill without a prescription.It turns out that, according to his former wife, he is also an anal rapist.

My only criticism is that some points that the \\"Dr.\\" makes are a little to extreme to be believed.

According to Hager's ex-wife, he is a chronic rapist who tormented her by forcing sodomy on her in her sleep for decades before she finally got the courage to leave him. As outlandish as that sounds, I'm not making this up! Furthermore, when she asked him not to please refrain from putting it THERE, he replied that he couldn't tell the difference between her **beep-beep** and her **boop-boop**. Can a man who claims ignorance of his own wife's anatomy possibly make any credible contribution to the understanding of women's health?

Very disappointing."},{"Title":"Home Orchid Growing","review":"This book does have some valuable information but is too out of date (perhaps that's why it has not been updated for 19 years). The book was published prior to the discovery of the Phragmipedium bessae and way before the discovery of the controversial kovachii. When is the last time you used much less purchased osmunda fiber?The book is a helpful reference (and likely worth buying if you grow cattleyas) but I would have to agree with the reviewer who was disappointed because there are too many black and white photos. Colour photos to help identify diseases and pests would've been helpful. The book has a lot of imformation about growing from seedlings/flask but suspect this information might be out of date as well.This book was recommended by a person who had grown orchids for a long time. Unfortunately I would not consider this the orchid bible anymore, especially if you are relatively new to orchid growing.Understanding Orchids by William Cullina is a good choice."},{"Title":"Home Orchid Growing","review":"This book is really a must: comprehensive, consistent, very simple to understand.

This book had been \\"revised\\" by an employee of the Yosemite National Park who was married to a Central Miwok woman. The cover was changed. The older booklet had a photo of Maggie \\"Taboose\\" Howard who worked tirelessly to preserve the culture of the Yosemite and Mono Lake Paiute people. She was removed in the new revision with a line drawing of a CENTRAL Miwok. Some of the text has been revised to change history of the Yosemite Indians. The actual Indians of Yosemite were Paiutes. Lafayette Bunnell, who met Chief Tenaya, wrote \\"CHIEF TENAYA WAS THE FOUNDER OF THE PAIUTE COLONY OF AHWAHNEE\\" and that \\"CHIEF TENAYA SPOKE A PAIUTE JARGON\\". CHIEF TENAYA WAS BORN AND RAISED AT MONO LAKE. HE MARRIED A PAIUTE WOMAN AND HIS MOTHER WAS PAIUTE. That the Mono Paiutes considered Chief Tenaya one of their own and that the Ahwahneechees were made up PRIMARILY OF MONO PAIUTES with a FEW \\"UNKNOWN\\" OUTLAWS/OUTCASTS FROM THE WESTERN TRIBES. That the Ahwahneechees were taller and lighter then the \\"Diggers\\" of the Western tribes (Miwuks). When the Battalion found the Yosemite Indians abandoned camp site, because they fled before the Battalion caught them, they found Pine Nuts (which only grew in the Paiute area), Mono Lake Brine Fly Larva (found only at Mono Lake), Paiute water baskets, a small drum (Miwuks used clappers sticks), Pandora Moth larvae (Which is only found in Mono Paiute areas), Obsidian (Which only came from Paiute areas) and other items. In other words PAIUTE ITEMS...NO MIWOK STUFF. During that time Paiutes and Miwuks had several battles over resource territories like Hetch Hetchy, Stoddard Springs, and other areas. THEY DID NOT TRADE until years later. So that is falsely written to explain WHY PAIUTE ITEMS WERE FOUND IN \\"SUPPOSED\\" MIWOK AREAS. So this book is NOT CORRECT and worse it has been revised to make it more incorrect. PEOPLE SHOULD READ LAFAYETTE BUNNELL'S BOOK AND THERE ARE SEVERAL MENTIONINGS OF MONO PAIUTES BEING PART OF CHIEF TENAYA'S BAND AND THE INDIANS IN YOSEMITE BEFORE AND EVEN AFTER TENAYA'S DEATH...YET NOT ONE MENTION OF MIWUKS OR MEWOOS."},{"Title":"Yosemite Indians: Yesterday and today (Yosemite Nature Notes)","review":"This small booklet (36 pages) has been revised at least three times since its original publication in 1941. Godfrey does a decent job of giving a brief overview of the history of the Yosemite (Ahwahneechee)Indians, especially around the interaction of Chief Tenaya and the events that led to the submission of his people to life on a reservation. The various chapters on food, shelter, dress, basketry, customs, and legends are all informative and interesting. The photos (black and white) are good. This brief and informative booklet will serve as a great introduction to the Yosemite Indians."},{"Title":"Touring In Wine Country: Bavaria: Including Baden and Wurttemberg","review":"When we scheduled a trip to the Black Forest last year, we rushed to get a copy of this book so we could have a wine- and travel-guide local to the area. (Plus, we really like Pigott's other book on German wine, which is now regrettably out of print.)There's many things to like about this book, even if you aren't a wine snob. (I'm far from knowledgeable -- I simply like German wine, so I want a guide that'll tell me how to use my time and taste buds wisely.)The book is organized into geographies, such as \\"Kaiserstuhl and Tuniberg\\" or \\"Ortenau.\\" Each section describes the overall characteristics of the area. (\\"Whichever the soil type, the Pinot family of grapes accounts for a good two thirds of all plantings.\\") It also provides a list of recommended producers, hotels and restaurants, and places of interest. These descriptions are very short, usually a single paragraph, so don't assume you can get away without a regular guide book as well. The pictures are lovely, too, assuming that you're the kind of person who likes to look at photos of vineyards.The reviews don't pull their punches, and they give a sense of each place's value (\\"Excellent meat dishes and good ocean fish... fairly expensive food; moderately priced rooms\\") so you know what you're getting into. I don't think I happened to visit any of the recommended hotels or restaurants, so I can't tell you how accurate they are.However, the irksome part of the book is its brevity when the details matter. Perhaps I'm used to having my hand held more than they think I need. When we wanted to find a winery that was listed, we had no idea where to look on the regional map. (Germany has a lot of *tiny* towns.) Nor did I have any idea what to expect in regard to wine tasting customs. Accustomed to the well-marked signs in northern California, I was surprised by how much I had to search for the wine tasting room for the recommended co-op I'd chosen. (It was definitely worth the quest, however.)I like this book quite a bit, though I think it's a good title to read before you go rather than to take along."},{"Title":"Touring In Wine Country: Bavaria: Including Baden and Wurttemberg","review":"Very interesting book with a beautiful color photos, good data for wine collectors and wine travelers in europa. rates, sites,winerys and high level restaurants in beautiful and friendly Germany."},{"Title":"The Refuge","review":"The Refuge, the sequel to The Inheritance, is an engaging read. Cresswell's latest romantic suspense novel is refreshingly unique from anything I've read in a while.Marisa Joubert is a single mother in dire need of gainful employment. As a high school dropout with no marketable skills, she feels lucky to find a job making good wages at &quot;The Refuge&quot;, a home for unwed mothers in the Colorado Rockies. It doesn't take long, however, for Marisa to figure out that something is amiss at her new place of employment. For one thing, the majority of the women that live in &quot;The Refuge&quot; are refugees in the truest sense of the word...they herald from war-torn places like Bosnia and the former Soviet states, many of them having endured rape and other horrific atrocities at the hands of the soldiers in their former countries. These young girls speak little English and have no one to turn to in the United States, a land where everyone is a stranger to them. Furthermore, all of these girls are pressured into giving up their babies for adoption, with the option of keeping their children all but removed from them.Shortly after one of the pregnant refugees turns up missing, Marisa discovers something even more shocking, and that's the truth behind &quot;The Refuge's&quot; side business. As it turns out, these young women have survived one nightmare only to be thrown into another. Marisa isn't certain what to do or who she can trust. Is her boss behind all of this, or is he an innocent pawn? And what about Jimmy, the handsome, but mentally retarded janitor who she senses isn't as slow as he leads people to believe?Jimmy Griffin is a former FBI agent who now has his own security firm. He recently lost his sister in a car crash, and although the police ruled it to be an accident, he isn't buying it. Two days before his sister died, she had left a message on Jimmy's answering machine, wanting to speak with him. As it turns out, his sister, an important doctor who had once volunteered her skills in Bosnia following the aftermath of the ethnic cleansing campaign, had found some information concerning a man from &quot;The Refuge&quot; that had taken two of the pregnant women from the camp she had worked in and secreted them back to the United States.Jimmy doesn't have much to go on besides his instincts. Determined to find his sister's killer, he goes undercover and works at &quot;The Refuge&quot;, posing as a mentally retarded janitor. When the office manager Marisa discovers his true identity, Jimmy is forced to tell her everything he suspects is going on. Will Marisa believe him? And just as importantly, will she ever forgive him for deceiving her?Cresswell manages to create a strong romance and a good suspense while simultaneously delivering a poignant commentary on the plight of poor women in America today. She stirs your social conscience, but does it in such a way that you don't really realize it until the book is over. The story and romance don't suffer in the least, which couldn't have been an easy thing to pull off. Very admirably done.-full review originally published in The Romance Reader"},{"Title":"The Refuge","review":"I have to disagree with the other three reviews and simply state, I was really disappointed with this story, it lacked the emotional attatchment with her characters that her previous books have had. The story line was extremely far fetched and really not believable at all. The ending was really really really disappointing. I had a hard time actally reading the end and quite honestly, just skimmed it, I was that disappointed with it. Ms. Creswell, had spent a lot of time building up to a climax that just didn't pan out, it was if she realized she had enough pages and had to wrap it all up. It just wasn't worthy of her other stories. I would suggest reading The Daughter, The Disappearance and The Inheritance rather than this one. I hope she regains the momentum for her next book. I look forward to her stories, especially since she only puts one out per year. I certainly won't be keeping this one, into the donation pile it will go."},{"Title":"The Refuge","review":"In Colorado, Marisa Joubert works at the Wainscott Foundation's Ranch that serves as a refuge for unwed mothers. Marisa is happy to have the job that allows her to raise her son by herself without the illegal money her deceased spouse earned. She also relishes Wainscott's vision to place babies in happy homes and find jobs for the mothers. Marisa works for the enigmatic director Stuart Frieze.However, almost from her first day of her employment, Marisa feels something is not quite right with the Foundation. Her fears escalate when women begin to vanish. Marisa is not sure if its her employer or one of the workers, such as handicapped janitor Jimmy Griffin, who she finds so handsome, who isn't trustworthy. Marisa knows something diabolical and evil is occurring here in the Rocky Mountains and fears for the lives of herself and her son even as she falls in love with Jimmy.THE REFUGE is an intriguing romantic suspense that centers on Marisa's growing suspicion of everyone around her. The story line is fast-paced and ably crafted to provide the audience with a rising sense of foreboding that the heroine and her son might not survive this tale. As expected by long time best selling author Jasmine Cresswell, her fully developed cast with their logical and easy to understand motives turns her latest novel into a strong tale that sub-genre fan will appreciate.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"The Refuge","review":"Ms Cresswell's novels are generally very good to excellent. She ties several features together into readable and enjoyable mysteries with well-developed characters. In this novel, her male protagonist is an ex-FBI agent -- but he totally misses several clues, and harbors no suspicions about the murderer. This is not believeable."},{"Title":"The Refuge","review":"Ms Crsswell does it again.... The Refuge is a story about Marisa. After denying her legacy, Marisa goes out on her own to get a job and take care of her young son. The job at The Refuge sounds too good to be true. She is an asst. to the director of a home for unwed mothers. Soon she discovers that all is not what it seems to be. Throw in the janitor who is mentally handicapped (who she can't help feeling attracted to) and a mother to be missing and previous murders and you find the formula that keeps Ms. Cresswell at the top."},{"Title":"The Refuge","review":"I believe this book is out of print but if you happen to find a used one it's worth a read. The first hundred or so pages are a little slow going but it catches on and leads to a great ending. I've read many other Cresswell books and her other books have been far better reads. Before reading this one you should try one of her other \\"better\\" books (ie. The Conspiracy, Secret Sins, etc.)"},{"Title":"The Refuge","review":"The first almost 300 pages were pretty boring. I kept reading hoping it would get good, and it did. Even with these last 100 pages or so, I had no problem putting it down."},{"Title":"The Refuge","review":"Ignore the detractors. This was my introduction to Cresswell, and, due to it, I have gone back to her. The action, romance and mystery are all very good, and Creswell keeps it interesting from start to finish, as is her wont. Look, women don't write like men--I have come to accept it. They beat around the bush too much, and inject too many goody-goody phrases in their work (while describing other people as &quot;dorky&quot;?!), but with the good ones, like Creswell, it still works. Heck, maybe it is one of the reasons we find them so attractive."},{"Title":"The Refuge","review":"I loved \\"The Inheritance\\" and couldn't wait to read this book. What a bust!The characters were one dimensional, the male and female lead had no chemistry and the book moved along slower than a snail. The conversations were always stiff and uncomfortable.Marissa, while likeable in The Inheritance was just irritating in this one, not to mention not overly bright! It's honorable that she didn't want to keep any of the money from her father and husband. But honor does not support a toddler! To take care of her son she should have kept enough to get her and her son started in her new life. And she didn't just give away the money, she gave away her clothes, furniture, everything. Then she moves to Colorado, not sure why, 2000 miles away from any family who could have helped her and her son out. Pretty darn irresponsible!And Stuart's motivation for the things he did never really made sense. Not to mention Jimmy was very careless, particularly in a small town. Considering his profession you'd think he'd keep a lower profile.I kept waiting for this book to get better but frankly it never did. Most of the action happened in the last ten pages! I bought it used but was still sorry I got it at all. I would recommend \\"The Inheritance\\" but don't waste your time on this one!"},{"Title":"The Refuge","review":"Once again Jasmine Cresswell delivers an outstanding story! Fans of her previous books will recognize Cresswell's ability to present engaging and sympathetic characters in an intriguing and fast-moving story. Although this is the sequel to Cresswell's last book (&quot;The Inheritance&quot;) it can definitely be read on its own. For those of you who haven't yet discovered this fantastic author, I promise you won't be disappointed!"},{"Title":"The Refuge","review":"Jasmine Cresswell has crafted a very suspenseful story with engaging characters. When Marisa Joubert takes a job at the former stately mansion turned home for unwed mothers, she is thrilled. The job comes with free child care for her young son, and an apartment at a bargain rate. However there are sinister forces at work here. The altruistic endeavors of the Wainscott Foundation serve as a cover-up for more nefarious deeds. I loved this story. This was the first Jasmine Cresswell book I've read and I can assure you it won't be the last."},{"Title":"The Refuge","review":"The Refuge is another wonderful story from Jasmine Cresswell!

My five year old does not seem to mind even though we started this book on a library edition with great color plates (that we had to return because of a hold!) Unlike some other classics, though, the illustrations were never the main event with the Hugh Lofting books.Secondly, in terms of the objectionable language, with respect to racist terms we try to avoid using with our kids in the 21st century. The \\"N\\" words have been excised from this one, but the contexts are still racist, with a lot of referrals to Dolittle as White in contrast to somebody else's implicitly inferior otherness. It's quaint and difficult to read without context, so I find myself reading ahead as we read aloud to make on-the-fly changes to keep the really odd stuff out. While I feel for the people who decry censorship of classics, this is a kid's book, and without the context of reading, say, Tom Sawyer, or even Rudyard Kipling, there's no way younger readers aren't going to get a little taste of vinegar if they read an unexpurgated version. The Kindle edition is perfectly adequate on this front, if not optimal.Finally, typos: there's about one every sixth or seventh page, more or less. I don't know whether this was the original etext, original edition, or the kindle-ized version, but they're moderately annoying.

Preposterous situations, ridiculous conversations between animals and people, a talking dog on the witness stand in a courtroom, and a snail whose shell holds enough oxygen for several humans to travel underwater from the South Atlantic to England all combine to create a story too fantastic for me to stomach. There were far fewer books written specifically for children early in the 20th century; the competition must have been nothing compared to today!This book is, however, an easy read and perhaps would interest younger readers who like animals and who can embrace the idea of animals who can talk like--amd with--humans.Synopsis: 10-year-old Tommy Stubbins meets the famed Dr. John Dolittle and begins working for him, then convinces his parents to let him be apprenticed to Dolittle. Tommy then accompanies the naturalist on a two-year research mission to Spidermonkey Island, their intended destination in the South Atlantic Ocean, to investigate the disappearance of Long Arrow, son of Golden Arrow. Their ship the &quot;Curlew&quot; is broken up in a tropical storm, but Tommy, Dr. Dolittle, and Bumpo Kahboo, (crown prince of Jolliginki and old pal of Dolittle's) wash up on Spidermonkey Island. The floating island's inhabitants, the friendly Indian tribe Popsipetels, are attacked by the Bag-jagderags and the Terrible Three defeat the Bag-jagderags and make a peace treaty. Dolittle is crowned King Jong Thinkalot, and the natives' cheers cause a boulder at Whispering Rocks to fall into the Deep Hole, making the island stationary (and therefore safe). The Great Glass Sea-Snail is injured in his escape from the Deep Hole and is nursed back to health by Dolittle. The snail then transports the English party back to Puddlesby-by-the-Marsh by crawling along the ocean floor, thus helping Dolittle escape the Indians and their island. The doctor's parrot Polynesia carefully plans their getaway to be disguised as King Jong's &quot;vacation,&quot; when in reality he just wants off the fantasy island.Man! I would too!! See, doesn't it sound like somebody ate too many raw onions before going to bed one night? What a nightmare!

So, this was a really great way to introduce her.Since she liked this one so much, she's checked out at least 7 other Dolittle books, so I'm quite grateful to Books of Wonder that they re-did this one and the Story of Dr. Dolittle with the Michael Hague illustrations; they opened a whole world to my daughter, and she can read through a couple of pages at a time herself now that she's 8. Also, we read aloud as the bedtime story, and there's plenty to talk about as far as different time, era, animal behavior, friendship etc. I'd never seen any Hague illustrations before and I was bowled over by them myself. I'm ordering off Amazon as a gift bookAs far as the editing/censorship, there's still plenty to talk about in adventures taking place in a different time and place."},{"Title":"The Voyages of Doctor Dolittle","review":"this book was the best book ever to me. I would reccomend it to anyone!"},{"Title":"The Voyages of Doctor Dolittle","review":"I think The Voyages of Doctor Dolittle by Hugh Lofting was a great book. There was a lot of adventure,sometimes in a matter of two chapters you would have gone from a bullfight in Mexico to a floating Island in the Atlantic. Every chapter was a new exciting tale of adventure. All the discribtions of place and people made you feel like you where there. The Voyages of Doctor Dolittle was about a boy who met a natralist. The natralist wanted the boy to come along on one of his adventures. On their adventure they ran into many obsicals which lead to even more different adventure. until finally they came to their destination. The natralist did some good deeds which he was rewarded for. Would they stay at the Island or return home. To find out you will have to read the book."},{"Title":"The Voyages of Doctor Dolittle","review":"I liked The Voyages of Doctor Dolittle because it had a lot of excitement and adventure.I also loved how Doctor Dolittle could talk to animals and humans I also liked the details that the author used to describe characters in the book.The book was really well written so enjoyed it thuroughly.I hope I have a chance to read another book like it.I'm sure people of all ages will like it to!"},{"Title":"The Voyages of Doctor Dolittle","review":"The voyages of Doctor Dolittle is the most interesting book I have ever read. Every time you raed a chapter the book creates a mystery forcing you to read another. This book has between 311-364 and 60 chapters, but there are 5 or 6 pages in every chapter. Trust me this book doesn't seem that long if you just read it. Doctor Dolittle definitely deserved a Newbery award."},{"Title":"The Voyages of Doctor Dolittle","review":"I liked this book because it was just good. I started reading it and couldn't put it down! It is amazing how Dr.Dolittle can talk to animals. I like the many adventures that they take.

It also was funny."},{"Title":"The Voyages of Doctor Dolittle","review":"It's hard to beat this book for all-out imaginative craziness. Oddly enough, other than talking animals, there is very little fantasy in this book, rather, Lofting chose to make Dr. Dolittle and his surroundings a calm place, a place where the animals talk to him, a place where adventures happen, but where there is never any brutal violence, unlike the adventures of Alice in Wonderland or Dorothy in OZ (both of which I like, BTW). What is really nice is that Lofting was able to make this formula WORK!This edition, pink covers with a credit to Christopher Lofting, has been edited from it's original issue to remove some now offensive racial stereotypes and illustrations. I'm glad to say that, while I generally do not support this type of editing, in this case it was well done and did not subtract from the entertainment value of the book.Note: The original Dr. Doolittle books have almost nothing in common with the Eddie Murphy movies, other than talking animals. Don't get them confused!Enjoy!"},{"Title":"The Voyages of Doctor Dolittle","review":"This is the second Newbery Award winner. In an effort to read all the Newbery books in order, I picked this up at my local library. I read this book as a child and it held me captive. Now (age 30) I finished it in two nights instead of one, but that's because I'm a &quot;responsible&quot; adult. I'm going to stop and peruse the rest of the Dr Dolittle books. This is a wild ride of adventure that's so much fun you'll willingly suspend belief that shellfish can talk. My favorite character is Bumpo because he's so well-educated. You'll have to read it as an adult to really appreciate that. Sorry kids."},{"Title":"The Voyages of Doctor Dolittle","review":"I read all the Dr. Dolittle books as a child and LOVED them-- I was captivated by the premise of being able to talk to animals as well as by the exciting adventures. However, I was not prepared for what I found in &lt;The Voyages of Dr. Dolittle&gt; (1951 printing) as I was reading it to my son the other night. In Chapter 5 (p. 36), Polynesia the parrot is catching Dr. Dolittle up on the goings-on back in Africa. She tells him that one of the African kings they know has sent his son to study at Oxford. She further comments that the Prince didn't want to go, fearing that he would be eaten by white cannibals. She then states, &quot;You know what those niggers are--that ignorant!&quot; Judging by the fact that this is not mentioned in the other reviews that I read on this site, I imagine this troubling line has been excised from more recent printings (such as those available on Amazon.com). I suggest that you make sure you purchase a more recent printing of this book, particularly if a child is going to be reading it on his/her own. As I continue reading the book to my son it will be interesting to note whether or not the portrayal of black characters in the book will be problematic as well . . . amz"},{"Title":"The Voyages of Doctor Dolittle","review":"I do agree that books containing racist positions should not be given to children without a strong and fully aware comment. But I simply cannot stand to buy a sanitised version of a book without being aware of it. This is called censorship, and it gives me the creeps. As a parent, I have had enough real life opportunities to prove racism wrong to my children. So to realise that somebody has been cheating on me, trying to do my job so that I did not have to explain how society has evolved, how difficult it has been for minorities to be recognised and respected is just a fraud. this review is about the Harper collins Edition , edited by Patricia C. and Frederick L.

Totally swept up in the new science of Natural Studies, Tommy rises from client (with a wounded squirrel) to apprentice, despite his parents' reluctance. From the moment the boy meets Dr. John Doolittle of Puddleby-on-Marsh Tommy's life will never be the same; he will experience the natural and geologic wonders of the world as he accompanies the learned Dr. Doolittle on voyages of exploration.Respected as an eminent Naturalist this middle-aged bachelor keeps a veritable menagerie in his home and in his private, backyard zoo. Animals truly love this man because of his kindness and compassion, his medical skills, plus his generosity with his time, talents and modest resources. But there is a more compelling reason for his zoological success: this man can actually Talk with most species of the animal kingdom!Eventually Tommy finds himself onboard a newly-purchased ship called THE CURLEW, as the Doctor embarks on a voyage of discovery and rescue across the Atlantic. Seeking a mysterious, floating isle called Spider Monkey Island, and the vanished Long Arrow--an unappreciated naturalist in his own, Native American world. The pair enlist the aid of Bumpo, an African prince who has studied in England. But it is the Dcotor's devoted animal companions who prove invaluable, on both sides of the ocean: Dab Dab the housekeeper Duck; Jip the dog; Chee Chee, the African chimp; Polynesia, the brains of the outfit; and Miranda, the exotic messenger bird of paradise.Tommy faithfully records these incredible experiences for generations of children (of all ages) to enjoy: the trial of a man accused of murder in a Mexican mine; a wager about bull fighting on a Spanish island; stowaways and a shipwreck; rescue of trapped Indians; a war and reconstruction--white man style; Indians buried alive; the dilemma of the white man's burden, and a fantastic submarine, trans-Atlantic crossing. Lofting includes a mild satire on British institutions, food habits and climate. Yet he offers a serious sub-theme of the role/effect of White man upon native cultures: is it morally necessary to \\"Civilize\\" native cultures? This delightful fantasy is easy to read and this 1950's edition offers curious pen and ink sketches typical of the early 20's-a true Kid Klassic!"},{"Title":"The Voyages of Doctor Dolittle","review":"I loved the Dr. Dolitle series as a child and am glad to see some of it is still available.

This is similar to the situation I found when I read Huckleberry Finn many years ago. Also, I found the use of a Jew as the pawnbroker to be offensive (although I haven't read any other comments about that situation). While I didn't read Dr. Dolittle to my children, I am debating reading it to my granddaughter just because it was lots of fun to read and brought me lots of smiles.

This book offers insight into human nature, through the non-threatening commentary on how the animals are acting.The animals in this book are really people... I guess I can understand where people would consider this an animal-rights type of book, but the fact that these are talking animals who make shopping lists, and use reason, and pay the bills... it's a frolic."},{"Title":"The Voyages of Doctor Dolittle","review":"This book was one of the first books I ever read cover to cover in grade school. This book, and the others in the series, made a reader out of me. There is no comparison to the Eddie Murphy movies. I even begged my parents in 1967 to take me to the movie staring Rex Harrison, and was sorely disappointed, even then.

This one is about his travels with the interesting animals who are his friends and companions. Hugh Lofting has managed to capture the human characteristics we sometimes see in animals and turn them into memorable figures. Dr. Dolittle's mode of travel is intriguing; the places he visits are fun and funny and exciting.Continue to read this series.

In this, the sixth book in her Inspector Sloan series, the body of a murdered man is found buried under the rubble of a fallen monument in the bell tower of a church. No one can get into the room because the rubble is blocking the only door.So how was he murdered? The unfolding of the story includes love, lust, religion, science, big business, greed and misunderstandings. All done in a very British way, of course.Poor Inspector Sloan is saddled, as usual, with the young, brash and brainless Constable Crosby, who provides a light touch to Catherine Aird's prose. If you like Ellis Peter's Detective George Felse series, you'll really enjoy Catherine Aird."},{"Title":"His Burial Too","review":"\\"His Burial too\\" is an average read(the two previous Sloan mysteries are slightly better) with a few interesting twists on the locked-room mystery. A man who worked at a patent firm is found dead, crushed by a marble statue that had exiting the room impossible. So Inspector Sloan and his bumbling, eternally young sidekick Constable Crosby try and figure out how the guy was killed. Very rare murder weapon and a few Byzantine twists help save it."},{"Title":"His Burial Too","review":"Ms. Aird's version of a &quot;locked-room&quot; mystery is an intriguing one. Her dry wit and intelligent writing make it an excellent example of thie genre. Not only that, but the book in its entirety takes place during the space of one day. It can't get much tighter than that. It all begins when an arm is seen amongst several tons of broken plaster in a locked church bell tower. This sets Inspector Sloan on the track of a murderer. But its her characters that make the story so special - the enigmatic Sloane, the bumbling Sergeant Crosby and the colourful Superintendent Leeyes. Ms Aird is a master craftsman of the the cozy mystery formula."},{"Title":"His Burial Too","review":"While this wasn't my favorite Inspector Sloan novel, it was still a great addition to my mystery library. It's always fun to see a new twist on the locked-room genre!"},{"Title":"The Whiteness of Bones","review":"Yeah...no. The back of the book was far more compelling than the actual novel. Some well-written scenes and occasionally a lovely sense of time and place, some well-crafted caricatures -- none of it is enough to rescue the self-concious, coming of age tone, despite the author's obvious attempt at something much more noble and searingly insightful. It's as if we get a lot more anatomically involved in \\"Are You There, God, It's Me Margaret\\" when what the author was shooting for was \\"The Vagina Monologues.\\" The book is readable, but only if you've checked it out from the library."},{"Title":"The Whiteness of Bones","review":"I also read this book in college, more like 15 years ago for me. It was part of a Contemporary American Fiction course. Even then I found myself wondering if this was really the representative of the best than contemporary fiction could offer. If so, I was happy to stick with older works. While other reviewers remember lush scenes, I remember a sorid Hawaiian themed bar in NYC and the main character's rape with a plastic tiki. I can stomach rough scenes when they are purposeful. I found little of purpose in this story. I think there are far better uses for your book money than this book."},{"Title":"The Whiteness of Bones","review":"I read this book 7 years ago in college and still think of it frequently.

I have read all of Moore's books and this one is the best."},{"Title":"The Whiteness of Bones","review":"I agree with the other readers, with one caveat: an annoying distraction for me while reading this otherwise excellent book was the author's chronic use of incorrect terminology when referring to female genitalia. There are at least 5 or 6 points in the book where she refers to a woman's vagina, when what she clearly means is vulva. It's just irritating when female writers, especially, don't know the parts of the female body."},{"Title":"The Whiteness of Bones","review":"One of the best contemporary novels I have read.

The story kept me guessing until the end. By reading the book, I learned a great deal about Italy- especially the island of Sardinia- an interesting place I'll probably never get to visit in person. I did not give this book 5 stars because I did not like it as well as Dibdin's book, Blood Rain."},{"Title":"Vendetta","review":"I've been enjoying Italian mysteries lately. Zen is fun, especially since the stories are also now on PBS. Dibdin is a good writer."},{"Title":"Vendetta","review":"This so well written I don't want to stop. the characterisation is excellent as is the structure & continuity. please let us have more Zen on our Kindles!"},{"Title":"Vendetta","review":"Venice, queen of Italy's radiant cities, is the fictional birthplace of two superb detectives: Donna Leon's Commisario Guido Brunetti, of the Venice police; and the late Michael Dibdin's Aurellio Zen, of Rome's central crime bureau.Now, thanks to television series, we have screen versions of both: Brunetti has been played by two German actors in the series shot in Venice (in German, which is amusing; with both Uwe Kockisch and earlier, Joachim Krol, as Commisario Brunnetti); while the BBC is producing a series of Zen mysteries (with Rufus Sewell superb as the Machiavellian Zen).Amazon has several of the BBC's Zen episodes available; they are beautifully filmed on site in Rome.Take care. If you come to the books from screen versions, you will find a far older, jaded, introverted and subtle Zen. Rufus Sewell's Zen is smarter (in our eyes) than the book Zen, and very unlikely to be caught out so often as the protagonist on the page. As a balance, the smooth and slick Zen of the screen is as often undone by fate and chance as the ungainly Zen on the page seemingly escapes punishments only by the hands of the gods.But Zen in both venues has the fine Italian mastery of counter-play and double-play, and makes the art and science of seemingly fixing cases by nabbing the real culprits seem far more devious than the most bent copper's record ever could. When the fix must be in, the politicians seems to believe, Zen is the man to do the fixing. Little do they know.This account, \\"Vendetta\\", is a \\"locked room\\" mystery throughout, but Dibdin leaves abundant clues so we follow Zen's wanderings, and wonder and wait patiently as he slowly he tries to tie up the obvious loose threads. Fortune and Dibdin deliver a truly deus ex machina ending that fashions as tidy a bow as even Zen at his most wishful could ask. And even Zen's paranoid fantasies turn out to have silver linings.Book or screen, Zen will have you smiling, chuckling, and laughing out loud at all the fun these Italians, good, bad, and very bad, all seem to have out of life."},{"Title":"Vendetta","review":"I reviewed Ratking and had to say I wasn't keen on it, but decided to keep at this series and read the second book, Vendetta. It is somewhat better than Ratking. The female characters are still stick figures -- Didbin doesn't show that he has any insight into women with these novels. But he is pretty good at describing the strange world of Italian men of different classes and regions. The odd italicized storyline that allows us to see inside a particular character's mind is fairly well-done, but doesn't come across as a different voice. And Zen is still not a particularly likeable person: he is not very clear-thinking, suspicious, venal, and petty. His one positive characteristic is that he needs to solve puzzles and get at the truth of a crime. But he's not so faithful to the truth that he won't lie when it suits him. I'm still on the fence with this series, and may take a break."},{"Title":"Vendetta","review":"One of the great parts of Dibdin's books are the way he muses as to the cause of the problems of the Italian State. Italy, based on Dibdin, Camelleri and Leon, is a country where everyone has their hand out. Nothing seems to get done unless you grease the wheels and pay-off the right people. Zen (that's Italian?) is a vice-questore (like a lieutenant, one step-up from Inspector) in his late forties who still lives with his mother. Because of his honesty (and naivete) he will probably never get another promotion and be miserable and forced to retired at 65.For now he is working in the Criminalpol (the Criminal Police) in Rome. He hasn't had a relationship for more than a few years since he separated from his wife twelve years ago. He fantasizes about a woman (Tania) who is a secretary in another department. He comes home each night to his Mama who is mesmerized by the TV soaps and hasn't left the apartment in the three years since they moved to Rome.Unpopular in his job and with his colleagues, he is asked to \\"solve\\" the murder of a well connected contractor. The contractor was killed in his vacation villa in Sardinia, and the murder was captured on tape. Unfortunately, we don't see or hear the murderer. The Villa is surrounded by sophisticated alarms and surveillance equipment. But no one has gone in or out of the compound on the day of the murder. There is a 'suspect' being held in jail but the evidence is non-existent. Zen is called to the headquarters of one of the Italian political parties that make up the current government. He is told that it would be looked on with favor if Zen could \\"find\\" another perpetrator.He is also being stalked by two different parties who want him dead. One is a man who he erroneously put in jail twenty years ago for murder (though he didn't commit this one he did twenty or thirty others). He has already killed the prosecuting judge and prime witness, and Zen is next.He goes out to Sardinia disguised as a German-Swiss (even though he speaks not German, why not Italian-Swiss) but is 'made' by the locals in short order. In spite of himself, Zen solved the case and 'frees' the politician. Everyone thinks that Zen made up the story of the killer just to get himself in good with the politicians, though all he did was solve the case. Now that he is 'dirty' he's much more popular with his colleagues.Zeb Kantrowitz"},{"Title":"Vendetta","review":"He can be a wonderful writer, but this time he got off track. Descriptions are great, but action is slow, and the plot wanders. There's too much delving into past cases, which distracts from the present one. And the protagonist doesn't seem real; a \\"voice\\" isn't enough to flesh her out."},{"Title":"Vendetta","review":"In this second installment of Michael Dibdin's Aurelio Zen series, we re-encounter the Weltshmerz detective as he wades through an onion skin layering of vendettas that almost cost him his life. Firstly, we glimpse the case of the brutal murder of Oscar Burolo and his guests in his supposed-fortress-like luxury complex on the Italian island of Sardinia. Then, we are again made painfully aware of the infernally clogged(but precisely groomed and clothed) machinery of the Italian bureaucracy with its syncophants, favor mongers, payoffs, good old boy's club and nefarious double dealings with the less-than-desirable underworld. We realize that wealthy and powerful higher-ups in the Italian Ministry have a vendetta of their own---they hotly desire Burolo's murder avenged as Burolo's corrupt dealings lined their purses with the an ever-pleasant flow of cash. Dissatisfied with the currently held murder suspect,and pleased with little-known Zen's written conclusion that exonerates the said suspect, the Italian Ministry moves Zen to Sardinia to drum up a case against ANYONE who will fit the scapegoat bill. Before he leaves, Zen encounters yet another vendetta, one that may be directed solely at himself. Perturbed, but not scathed, Zen ferries off to the island in what he thinks is a sufficient undercover disguise. When he bungles his dealings with police-shy locals,he finds himself stalked by a killer who serendipidiously aids him in discovering the real murderer as he runs for his life over Sardinia's bleak interior. The luck that held for him in \\"Ratking\\" sticks with him during this foray; he returns to Rome in disheveled glory.As in the first Zen mystery, the actual crime and its solution act as a compelling backdrop and springboard to Zen's real problems. In this case, his mother, his love life and his inability to fare well in the midst of the male society of the Criminalpol provide ample insight to an already enjoyable character of immense depth. The settings of Rome and Sardinia add glamour to the well-heeled image-conscious Italian populace which Dibdin allows us to view through Zen's accomplished and somewhat jaded eyes as he further immerses himself within the complex inner workings of Italian law enforcement.Even thoughI read 'Cabal' and 'Dead Lagoon' before reading 'Ratking' and 'Vendetta', I would recommend reading the books in sequence so that the entire panorama of Zen's difficult life is laid out in front of you as it is intended. Zen's motivation become more understandable. When reading the books out of sequence,the reader has little information about Zen on which to fall back on and there is nothing but the mystery itself to fully engage the reader. Get the whole experience and start from number 1."},{"Title":"Vendetta","review":"No Author will ever replace Mario Puzo; his body of work featuring the Corleone Family is a literary, as well as a cinematic classic. For those readers in search of material that is as excellent in its own way, and takes place entirely in Italy, Michael Dibdin's \\"Aurelio Zen\\" series will take its own place in the genre Mr. Puzo introduced to so many readers years ago.\\"Vendetta\\" is the second book in this series and the setting is Sardinia. A dinner party is interrupted when someone with a shotgun appears, and abruptly ends the evening's festivities. A man who said, \\"If anyone gets in, I will believe in ghosts\\", designed the security system. No ghost handles a shotgun, and after Italy's equivalent of SWAT Teams can find no way in, the enigma is set.I have commented at length on why I find Mr. Dibdin to be such a talented writer when I reviewed his newest book \\"Blood Rain\\" and his first book \\"Ratking\\". I will not be totally repetitive, but I will note that one of the keys to enjoying this Author's work is his ability to sustain your interest with a variety of possible outcomes to the very end. His stories are constructed like a maze, and as Sardinia is a maze both above and below ground, the setting is perfect.A very, very good series!"},{"Title":"Vendetta","review":"The first three books of the Aurelio Zen series (of which this is the second) read as a trilogy.Whilst enjoyable, and as engaging as its predecessor, Ratking, and successor, Cabal, I thought there were some MINOR plotting weaknesses (eg a luxury car whose steering didn't lock when being driven without the engine running).The Sardinian setting was well-evoked.I do recommend reading the Zen series in order, especially the first three, where character development builds."},{"Title":"Vendetta","review":"A riveting crime classic replete with irony and intrigue, this fast-paced thriller will keep you in terrifying suspense, as detective Aurelio Zen, characteristically earnest if somewhat inept, bungles his way around Italy to uncover the identity of a mysterious mass-killer. Readers who enjoy fast-action plot will not be disappointed, as they follow Zen's broken-down mercedes through harrowing chase scenes across the rugged Sardinian landscape. The author's sensitive humanitarian touch offsets the vivid and sometimes shocking portrayal of cruelty and revenge in the underworld of organized crime.This finely-crafted novel ranks among the best of our era. Surpassing in suspense even the popular-market fiction of Michael Crichton or John Case, Dibdin's &quot;Vendetta&quot; reaches the highest stratum of literary excellence."},{"Title":"Vendetta","review":"Vice-Questore Aurelio Zen, officer of the Criminalpol section of the Ministry of Interior in Rome, is entrusted with a video cassette connected to the sensational \\"Burolo Affair\\" about which Zen has to write a report summarising the case to date. Since Oscar Burolo had a mania of recording the highpoints of his life, the video tape shows a dinner party at his extravagant villa in Sardinia, when suddenly Oscar and his party reel away from shotgun blasts apparently coming from nowhere, the murderer having passed through the elaborate electronic defences of the property as if they didn't exist.But when, sometime later, a pickpocket manages to steal the video cassette while Zen is boarding a bus and when Zen is summoned to the Palazzo Sisti and asked by \\"l'onorevole\\" to go to Sardinia and fake some evidence in order to withdraw the charges against the main suspect Renato Favelloni, the inspector is about to start one of the most dangerous investigation in his career.Very good action-packed thriller with breathtaking scenes in Sardinia and an Aurelio Zen in full swing!Michael Tudor Barnes delivers a stunning performance reading \\"Vendetta\\"."},{"Title":"Vendetta","review":"Zen is one of the most interesting characters in crime fiction. Corrupt, sometimes inept, full of human weakness - yet somehow likeable. Didbin has a literary flair invisible in most other writers of the genre. Combined with excitement, humour and deep cultural insight, this novel is a classic."},{"Title":"Vendetta","review":"A very gripping, somewhat dark, mystery. Thankfully, Aurelio Zen has a cat's nine lives. It's a very atmospheric novel, and I plan to read all the Michael Dibdin books I can get my hands on."},{"Title":"Vendetta","review":"Aurelio Zen, a detective in the Criminalpol in Rome, will never be one of the boys in the criminal justice world he inhabits. He feels compelled to solve crimes even though that is not what his bosses and fellow detectives want him to do. Zen learned the hard way in his past that he is expected to find the politically expedient result, even if it means faking evidence. With Italy abounding in corruption, Zen seems put on the spot very frequently, caught between needing to make a case turnout the way very important people want him to and being able to live with himself.In \\"Vendetta,\\" Zen again must \\"solve\\" a crime of horrendous murder to the satisfaction of others, but this time on the wild and frankly scary island of Sardinia, where the rule of law is the rule of the toughest local thugs. However, that is not his only problem, as Zen is being hunted down by a criminal just released from serving many years in prison because of Zen's testimony. How these two plots become intertwined is surprising, and the resolution comes a bit out of nowhere, but it all makes for a good story with Zen ending up looking like he has done what everyone wants.As for the setting, Sardinia's wild country makes a great backdrop for Zen's long escape (perhaps too long) from a pursuer. Dibdin also takes the reader through the ancient ruins of the Palatine Hill as he escapes from a tail in Rome.The reader gets to know Zen much better in this book--his worries about what his life will be like when he retires, his view of his romantic life, his perception of his mother. We see him start up a romance--will that be a wise decision? We see how his mind is somewhat corrupted like his cohorts as he strategizes how to either prove an innocent man a criminal or to find someone else to be viable replacement, whether guilty or not.The writing remains excellent in \\"Vendetta.\\" Dibdin's skill exceeds that of many mystery writers. Perhaps he still provides too much minute detail of scenery and buildings.The only think I do not care for in this book is the insertion of sections from the mind of the murderer. These were not needed in an otherwise well-crafted book."},{"Title":"Vendetta","review":"In the second installment of the Aurelio Zen series, Dibdin sends police detective Zen off to Sardinia to solve the seemingly impossible murder of a wealthy Oscar Burulo, his wife and two dinner companions in his ultra-secure mansion in the mountains of Sardinia. As it turns out, Burulo liked to videotape his dinner parties, so the shooting of the victims is recorded, but the assailant stays out of view. Burulo had recently run over and killed a young member of a Sardinian crime family to get out of an attempted kidnapping. But rich men collect enemies and maybe the killer is one of the guests who departed immediately before the shootings. Or could it be one of the grounds crew at the billionaire's complex?Meanwhile, Zen is working on a new love interest and enjoying his new found status after his \`success' related inRatking, the first book in the Zen story. This being Italy, however, his colleagues assume, with some justification, that his promotion is a payoff for his cooperation with a seriously bent family scion in that tale. Zen did not really do what his benefactor thinks he did to earn this reward, but Zen is not going to correct that misimpression.As a result of his new reputation, another leader of a criminal enterprise dispatches Zen to Sardinia to \`solve' the murder, i.e. frame their chosen victim. Zen travels to the island under the guise of being a Swiss real estate agent looking to buy a large mansion. Zen is trying to figure out a way to avoid framing an innocent man while putting in enough effort to satisfy the crime boss. The action starts there.Vendetta continues the development of Zen as a fully dimensional character with satisfying intrigue and action and a full dose of cynicism. A significant fault, however, is the unexplained motivation for one of the key actor's in the book's climax. (Perhaps I missed it.)"},{"Title":"Vendetta","review":"I was a bit sceptical at first. An Italian detective by a British-American author; sounded like it could be coy or arch. It wasn't. Dibdin writes far beter than most mystery writers. The plot is maybe a tad too too (as my grandmother used to say).Anyway I paln to read more of the Zen books."},{"Title":"Existential psychoanalysis;","review":"This work consists of 2 excerpts from Satre's \\"Being and Nothingness\\". What's new is a 17 page introduction by Rollo May. Although May admires Sartre, he does present key differences he has with Sartre, so this intro has some teeth in it. Even as excerpts, there's about 200 pages of meaty exposition that saves you lugging around \\"Being And Nothingness\\" if this subset is your focus.Sartre builds up a big, abstract, speculative system, apparently as a framework for his belief in human freedom, choice, and responsibility. What does this construction accomplish that simple assertions wouldn't of our freedom, our not being determined, our defining ourself via our yet-to-be-accomplished projects, our responsibility rooted in our unavoidable need to make choices? Perhaps both emphasis (you'll be less likely to forget you are free), elaboration (you'll learn more what being free as well as trying not to be implies), and examples (you'll learn more of the ways in which people try to avoid the weight of their freedom).Even if the experts tell you they have you all figured out, you'll have decide whether to buy that or not. Even if you want to be all figured out and delivered from uncertainty, they (and you) may be wrong. If Sartre only argued for our individual freedoms, he wouldn't be so important. It is in his exploration of the ways in which we cringe from our freedom, of our \\"bad faith\\", that he connects and makes what seems a speculative, abstract system instead a powerful emotional truth."},{"Title":"Existential psychoanalysis;","review":"I read this book in one sitting and found it to be very informative. In outlining the basis for an existentialist psychoanalysis, Sartre gives interesting and riveting existential perspectives on the human situation. I would recommend anyone with an interest in philosophy, psychology, and the human situation in general to give this book a try."},{"Title":"Ithaka: A Daughter's Memoir of Being Found","review":"Read Ithaka!

Well-written and well-edited, ITHAKA brings out not only issues (as best as I, as an outsider to the topic, can understand them) for adoptees, but also insightful thoughts on families in general. Ms. Saffian paces her story effectively and she demonstrates tremendous courage with the telling of it. As well, she provides an inspiring example of independence and thoughtful reflection through the delicate, dynamic balance she appears to ultimately build between the people who love her and her own need for solid ground and security. A tremendous page-turner, and one which I would quickly recommend to anyone interested in better understanding family relationships."},{"Title":"Ithaka: A Daughter's Memoir of Being Found","review":"I loved this book.

Her writing draws you in as if you are a part of her story. Even if you're not an adoptee, you will be able to identify in one way or another with Saffian in reading this book as it explores not only adoption and the questions and issues it raises, but also questions and issues that are raised in one's own pursuit of personal identity."},{"Title":"Ithaka: A Daughter's Memoir of Being Found","review":"Saffian is an eloquent spokesperson for adopted children (and those who question the nature of family, whether adopted or not!) everywhere.

On a whole stories of this kind are generally alike. The feelings are all there right out in the open and sting alot. But the final acceptance is a miracle to behold. I would not expect a reader with no triad participation to be able to really enjoy this book as much as those of us who are a part. I couldn't put it down. It helped me understand what my son must have gone through, in part, as he decided to search for me. I'm pretty convinced that letting the adoptee search is the way to find closure, but if many more years had gone by (30) I'm not sure I wouldn't have begun to search. It takes a very strong person to search out his/her birthparents, but in some cases I believe essential for lasting wellbeing. Thanks Sarah for sharing your journey and adventure with us."},{"Title":"Ithaka: A Daughter's Memoir of Being Found","review":"The story of Sarah Saffian (born Sarah Morgan but given up for adoption) is a story of promise but one that quickly drizzles down into one long whine. Imagine the luck of finding that the parents who had to give you up stuck together against all odds (parents' wishes, lack of money), eventually married, and produced three siblings for you! How often does such a thing even happen???? Is our didactic, deliberating, depressed daughter delighted by her parents' phone call at age 23? No, indeed, and the reader must, it seems, be dragged through all her misery, too. Her parents are alive, healthy,in their mid-40's, married, employed, financially stabled, and educated. They adore their children and are totally welcoming to the daughter that they had to give up in 1969, dark pre-legal-abortion days. Does she accept, jump on the bus and go? Oh, no!Assuming that a reader can stomach a full-novel-length's whining, one has to say, that if it were written in a more engaging style, for example, with more information about her real life, her adopted parents, her schooling, her half-siblings, and general world view, then we could have a better sense of her. WE might even sympathize with her great ambivalence about meeting the real parents, Hannah and Adam. But this reader, for one, cannot get a grip on who Sarah really is. She's a Brown University kid, grew up in a brownstone in NYC, has plenty of money, works in publishing and writes for a living, has had one abortion at age 21, likes to look out at the snow from her apartment window. That's all I could gather. Does she have any real interests, hobbies, all-consuming passions? Does she have problems or conflicts at work? Does she like to cook, or what does she eat, just bagels and coffee? Does she like movies? What kind of books is she reading? Does she hang out somewhere, like bookstores, libraries, cafes, parties? Her birthparents, especially her father Adam, tries to get her to open up and tell about her life, her problems, her views. She is unresponsive to him as she is to the reader.The abortion, did you say? Oh yes, there's a fellow...her boyfriend Chris seems completely peripheral, likes to go to junkshops with her. Gee whiz! Perhaps he's too poor for her to marry him - just like her mother Hannah's problem back at age 21 when Adam, a non-Jew, a dropout, and unemployed fellow, didn't suit her future plans. Otherwise, what's wrong with him, why she is just drifting along with him, well, readers must guess.This poor woman wrote a novel of herself, her disaffected, detached, and depressed view of reality. What she really wants or will ever achieve in her life is hard to say. I'll admit it's possible that the knowledge of being adopted sapped her of any life force from a very young age, from having no mother-love, as she says.This woman needs desperately to open up to others, to see their pain and problems. She's even been to see a psychiatrist already, but it didn't help. The reader feels like bashing the book on the woman's head and shouting, \\"For God's sakes,woman, wake up! You are alive, young, healthy, rich, and you have two sets of parents! GEt a MOVE on!\\"I am not adopted but was well acquainted with a fellow my age (now mid-40's) who tried to find his birth parents in his 30's. He went through heck and high water, only to find that the father was long dead, a disreputable man who'd been married at the time of conceiving my friend, therefore could not marry his mother. The mother was dead only six months, and had died a miserable woman - alcoholic, diabetic and sickly. She'd married later in life, had a couple of kids, and these half-siblings took one look at my friend and essentially said, \\"Scram, man\\". She came from Irish immigrants in Oakland, California, and was forced through the Irish Catholic adoption service nuns to give up the baby, although her father had tried to see about keeping the child somehow and even raising it himself. AMongst Catholics in the late 1950's, that was inconceivable, and \\"it would ruin her chance to marry\\". Sure enough, she found someone,but was sad her whole life, or so he was told.He is STILL Raging about her, against her, with no conception what the Catholic Chuch was like in those years, especially in regard to women. I caught the tale end of it myself, having Irish immigrant parents, and tried to tell how his mother must have felt. He could look in the mirror and see how Irish he looked. He did not know his heritage or faith, adopted by agnostics/Anglicans in Walnut Creek, given a priviledged suburban life, but in the end, drank and smoked himself into poverty, ill health and unemployment. I have cut the friendship because of his terrible attitude towards his dead birthmother and towards almost all women as a result. YOu can't talk to him.I only bring up this side issue of a similar case to show that this woman has nothing to weep about, and indeed, has the insight to realize that the abortion she had at 21 was exactly the same choice,given the circumstances, that her own birthparents made when they were 21: not able to be parents yet.And will she ever be? I wonder? She would now be in late 30's. Poor little rich girl, I hope she turns out okay and doesn't fall into drink, smoking and drugs...."},{"Title":"Ithaka: A Daughter's Memoir of Being Found","review":"I was so excited about this book I left work early the day I bought it just so I could start to read it. I thought it would be a more 90's version of reunion &amp; how it felt at her age to be found. It resembled (sometimes eerily) how I was found. I am sorry to say how disappointed I was. Her writing is amazing, but I couldn't quite get over all the people she was mad at. Where did she develop all her hangups? Her father was a supportive figure all her life, she was close with her step mom (whom she called mom), she was approached cautiously yet carefully by her birthparents, yet she just couldn't stop whining. There are worse fateful situations than hers, how spoiled and selfish she is. Towards the end of the book, I was rooting for the birth parents to pat themselves on their backs, that they found their birthdaughter and were glad she was ok. If I was Hannah or Adam, I would not have wanted to meet her."},{"Title":"Ithaka: A Daughter's Memoir of Being Found","review":"What I don't understand about this book is how it and the Amazon reviewers of it can be so brainwashed by the adoption industry that they do not respect Sarah Saffian's natural parents as being such. The demeaning word \\"birth mother\\" is used not only throughout Sarah's book but also in reviews of it. In addition, Sarah seems to refuse to acknowledge her parents as what they really are: her parents. Sarah's lack of thinking for herself and her inability to understand and respect natural family relationships is sad indeed. May she one day take a few steps away from denial and from the adoption industry, which she obviously supports, and realize how terrible mother and child separation is.

Insightful, honest, funny and heart-rending. I read it in one night and have gone back again and again. I've been giving it to all my friends.

The woman who called, Hannah, is indeed Sarah's birth mother and soon Sarah is corresponding with both Hannah and Adam, Sarah's biological father. Sarah's life is an unusual case: her bio parents stayed together after giving her up and are now married artisans living in New England, raising three children of their own. Sarah is happy with the life she was adopted into and is at first disarmed at Hannah and Adam's urgent and emotional letters.Much of the book details the correspondence over a four year period between Sarah and her birth parents. The author offers moving and valuable insights into the cycle of emotions she goes through. Adam and Hannah emerge as wonderful people: self-aware, honest and passionate. But the author is frank in her waryiness as some of what Adam and Hannah disclose to her. Accepting them, and being willing to meet them, is a long process for her.&quot;Ithaka&quot; is the best book I have read about adoption. It is an honest account of the thoughtful, messy process one must go through to accept a reunion with one's birth parent. However, the book is not limited to its subject. It is an honest examination of the path to identity, and how our family plays a part in it."},{"Title":"Ithaka: A Daughter's Memoir of Being Found","review":"I am not adopted, nor have I adopted, but I found this book absolutely wonderful, heartfelt, painful, aggravating and every other emotion known to man.

For me the book was a pleasure, a retreat, an inspiration, a comfort, an achievement, and a counterpoint. Sarah poignantly gave voice to many of my feelings-- though in fact our experiences were quite different. I am a motherless daughter who was orphaned after my father's death 6 years ago. To witness the careful poise, honesty and sense Sarah maintained in piecing together her story was/is extremely helpful to me in my efforts to define my sense of family and self.

She opens the dark drapes of the closet of adoption secrecy, shedding light on the notion that one can be &quot;related&quot; to other people in many different ways. As a birthmother, this gives me hope that more people involved with adoption will be able to find a place for each other as Sarah found &quot;a place&quot; for her birth family in her life."},{"Title":"Ithaka: A Daughter's Memoir of Being Found","review":"As an adoptee, my adopted mother gave me this book out of compassion and support of my own search. I have to say that the writing style of the book is truly excellent. What amazed me was how emotionally disturbed the writer was throughout the story. I kept thinking, &quot;what a blessing to find your birth parents are normal, wonderful, caring and sensitive people!&quot;. Many adoptees find their parents as drug addicts, in prison, victims of rape or dead. This woman seems to be a fragile glass house, protected and coddled her entire lifetime. I kept thinking, &quot;How would you have reacted with the worst possible situation given your reaction to the best?&quot;. A well told story to be certain, but I was dissapointed by the lack of grace the writer had in coming to know these people. I admit we all blunder through life, but I would expect by your late twenties, a wiser surefootedness and grace."},{"Title":"Ithaka: A Daughter's Memoir of Being Found","review":"I am an adoptee who found both my birthparents.

I read through all the reviews and pretty much all the 4 and 5 stars are right on the money. Unfortunately, those who reviewed with harsh criticism to the book obviously don't realize there are thousands of personalities and situations that make everyones life journey unique to them. I applaud her for being so courageous in writing such intimate details of her life and sharing it with the world. While many will not relate to her story there are countless ones that will. To the author...good luck in all your future endeavors and congratulations on a wonderfully written biography!"},{"Title":"Ithaka: A Daughter's Memoir of Being Found","review":"I finally read Ithaka, after having it sitting on my shelf for months. The subject is difficult for me, as a birthmother who searched for her son and was rejected. Now, I wish I had read it before making any contact, and would advise any birthparents in search to do likewise.Sarah Saffian is a fine and elegant writer, who as many previous reviewers have noted, grew up with money and comfort, and was found by the &quot;perfect&quot; birthparents. It is indeed hard to understand her reluctance to meet them--but the pain she suffered because of the contact is real, and I often cringed as I read what she felt, thinking that my son may have felt similar pain and disorientation at my contact.Search and reunion is not a soap-opera nor a talk show--although much of what passes for wisdom in adoption reform groups and literature would make one think it was! Not all adoptees, nor all birthparents, are eager to be found--and those that are still must make huge adjustments to integrate the lost ones into their lives.I hope that my son will find this book, and read it, and know that he is not alone in his fear and confusion at having &quot;the dead&quot; rise again as I did. I hope that all searching birthparents will read this book, not to be discouraged, but to stretch their minds and hearts with empathy for the adoptee, and the stresses that reunion can bring to some. I have seen many birthparents go into reunion expecting that the adoptee's life has somehow been on hold since the surrender, just waiting for the birthmother to return and pick up emotionally where they left off, as if a whole lifetime of family relationships were irrelevant. Some support groups encourage this kind of thinking, by pandering to what the members want to believe, rather than what is, and taking a very one-sided and one-dimensional view of the whole complex issue of reunion. &quot;Ithaka&quot; makes us look at other possibilites--and that is ultimately better and more healing than unrealistic expectations and cartoon scenarios of reunion bliss. Sarah Saffian had performed a useful service for birthparents by writing her story, even though reading it sometimes hurt, and sometimes frustrated and annoyed."},{"Title":"Ithaka: A Daughter's Memoir of Being Found","review":"As a birth mother AND an adoptive mother,this book let me understand the feelings of the adopted child. I found my daughter 6 years ago and I have not met her at this point. We do write letters and emails, but have never talked on the phone or met in person. This book helped me to see how difficult this process is for the &quot;found&quot; child. She hasn't known anyone but her adoptive family and it is very hard for her to accept me and my family. I am sending her a copy of this book for Christmas. Thank-you, Sarah!"},{"Title":"Ithaka: A Daughter's Memoir of Being Found","review":"I read this book after hearing Sarah Saffian tell her story on television. (The Leeza Show) I have no direct way to relate to what she has gone through. I am not adopted, yet the way she writes this book, anyone can posess the capacity to understand and read with a vaguely familiar sense of our own reality, simply because we all have our own version family. Whatever &quot;family&quot; means to the reader comes to the focus of contemplation and the realization that those who are most dear to us are always there for us. As Sarah endures her own self-discovery through the process of being found by her &quot;other&quot; family, she reveals such insight in the telling of her journey, that any reader, adopted or not, can truly understand."},{"Title":"Ithaka: A Daughter's Memoir of Being Found","review":"While each and every person has a different story, the circumstances are eerily similar when talking to adoptees. Saffian's &quot;Ithaka&quot; is something I turned to when I was contacted by my biomom. From my reaction to the first time I was contacted by my her, to my anticipation of seeing her face for the first time; from hearing friends' stories about their adoptions and reunions, to struggling with the fear that my parents would feel abandoned and betrayed if I sought out my bioparents - this book helps us realize that we are no more alone in our thoughts and fears than we are walking down a crowded avenue. How many others, I wonder, have turned to this book for answers, much as I did? And how unfair it would be to say my reaction is wrong, or the author's reaction is wrong, because the two are not consistent? While some of my reactions have been different from hers, I am amazed by what I read... and how nicely she can relate publicly such an intimate and personal story. I turned every page with anxiety and felt her actual reunion with her bioparents seemed anticlimatic. Upon reflection, her sparse description and the small number of pages she dedicated to the actual reunion, I wonder if it was too personal to commit to print, or if she went through the reunion in a fog, or if she just realized that her adoption was not a colossal event, but a mere fact of life. At any rate, I think it's a must read for anyone trying to find themselves in the process of being found. Likewise, I feel it is a great read for anyone outside the adoption community."},{"Title":"Ithaka: A Daughter's Memoir of Being Found","review":"I just finished this book.

I was also raised in Manhattan by a well-to-do family. I have had access to my birth father's whereabouts for several months but haven't felt right about contacting him yet. It may take me three years to write the letter or make the phone call. But if it does, so be it. There is nothing wrong with waiting until I feel ready, just as there was nothing wrong with her going through her process.&quot;Itaka&quot; is a beautifully written book about the range of emotions Saffian went through before, during and after her reunion. In my opinion, it's a must read for for all members of the adoption triad."},{"Title":"Ithaka: A Daughter's Memoir of Being Found","review":"Recently, I was reunited with my daughter whom I gave up to adoption 34 years ago. I was unprepared for what this reunion would do to my life and the roller-coaster emotions that came to the forefront of our \\"relationship\\". After our \\"honeymoon\\" phase ended after much emotional and verbal conflict (and all contact between us ceased), I began to reach out for help. Many of the \\"other\\" Mom's suggested this book.Though my daughter and I have not renewed our relationship, this book, more than any other (so far) has helped me understand somewhat of what she was/is going through emotionally. Factors I had not considered that Saffian points out have helped me cope with this \\"silence\\".It is not a perfect book. There are questions that remain: why did it take Saffian so long to have a face-face meeting; did the reunion last (are they still reunited); etc.Though I am unlike Sarah's \\"other\\" parents, the book is helpful in that it also shows what they are going through (via personal letters and phone calls) and glimpses into her parents' feelings as well.All in all, a good read that will help all in the adoption triad struggling the initial phases of contact. I wish I had known of the book sooner."},{"Title":"Ithaka: A Daughter's Memoir of Being Found","review":"I am an adoptee (age 34) and found the book to be extraordinarily timely. I met my birthparents two years ago, and the roller coaster of emotions is overwhelming. Sarah Saffian's ability to articulate the things I am feeling is uncanny. I checked this book out of the library, then had to get my own copy so I could underline and highlight.For those who've said she is self-absorbed, that's the point. So many huge pieces of her life and her identity were altered without her consent, before she was even born. How can a person help but question her feelings about each of the parties involved, about her obligation to each, her connection to each, and how each affects her. Given the magnitude of the revelation (Hi - I'm your birthmother, and I married your birth father and you have a set of &quot;full-blooded&quot; siblings.) Sarah deserves the opportunity to wallow around in self-absorbed questions about her identity."},{"Title":"Ithaka: A Daughter's Memoir of Being Found","review":"A well-written and compelling memoir"},{"Title":"Ithaka: A Daughter's Memoir of Being Found","review":"As an adoptee active in adoption politics, I don't like to spend my free time reading adoption books. Especially since so many of them focus on what I find to be nonsensical and ultimately destructive notions of primal wounds, adopted child syndrome, or whining about not feeling whole. This book didn't do that, and I found the story compelling, the writing polished, and the voice refreshing. Unlike another reviewer, I thought the author clearly articulated her belief that adoptees have a constitutional right to their records, and I appreciate and agree with this view.I think this is must reading for an adoptee or birthparent, either going through a search and find, or about to embark on one. My own caveat is that the book seemed to end unsatisfactorily for me. I felt like something was missing. I didn't need anything neat and tidy, but a little more retrospection would have been nice."},{"Title":"Ithaka: A Daughter's Memoir of Being Found","review":"I read Ithaka on the heels of meeting my own birthmother and I must admit, that I was a bit put off by Ms. Saffian's detachment throughout the book. Granted, I too am very grateful for what my adoptive parents have done for me, and I would not trade them for anything in this world, however, I am also grateful for my birthparents for making the choice of giving me up for adoption. I too experienced a myriad of emotions when seeing my birthmother for the first time in 25 years, even though she and I had communicated on and off since I was twelve. However, whenever she expressed any emotion to me I did not feel threatened or overwhelmed, as did Sarah, when Adam, her birthfather expressed his raw emotions to her in his letters. That was a bit of a letdown and it did certainly turn me off. Overall, the book was very good and well written.(Update)June 8, 2007: I reread the book and I can completely understand Sarah Saffian's feelings. I think when I first wrote the review, I was very emotional myself about meeting my birthmother, etc. Now that time has passed and I've gone through several experiences, I can completely understand how Sara felt throuhgout the book. This book s very well written by an insightful woman."},{"Title":"Ithaka: A Daughter's Memoir of Being Found","review":"Sarah Saffian's book is certainly well-written, but she is often cold in her description of the reunion experience. It is almost as if she never considered the fact that she was adopted, as if she only realized that she had a birth mother, and in her case an entire birth family, when she received the phone call from Hannah. As a birth mother recently reunited with a son in his late twenties, I was quite disturbed by her negative reactions. Having read most of the literature on the subject,and based on my own experience, I find it hard to believe that her feelings were so negative for so much of the time. Her reaction to her birth father's letters made me cringe. She does not seem to develop much of an interest in her background, insisting on being a Saffian. Anyone who is a member of the adoption triangle knows that in an experience such as this the pieces come together, and when both the adoptive and birth families are &quot;healthy,&quot; as is the case here, the experience is a rich one for all those involved. The birth family never takes the place of the adoptive family, and the adoptive family is strengthened by its acceptance of the birth family. And the one who gains the most from this interaction, and from being loved by so many people is the adoptee. Although Saffian ends her book with the word &quot;whole,&quot; she does not do much throughout it to convince us of the changes she undergoes as a result of her being found. I had hoped to get a better understanding of the adoptee by reading the book, and was instead quite saddened by the author's attitude."},{"Title":"Ithaka: A Daughter's Memoir of Being Found","review":"I finally picked up a copy of this book, which has been much-touted in the press and elsewhere, but I'm really not sure what all the enthusiasm is about. It seems to be yet another &quot;poor little rich girl gazing at her navel&quot; story, and the writing, while competent, is certainly unexceptional. I do appreciate the author's willingness to probe her psyche in some meaningul way, but the end result is a narrator whom I felt indifferent towards. Adoptees, in and of themselves, are not special people-- so why do we hunger for their stories?"},{"Title":"Ithaka: A Daughter's Memoir of Being Found","review":"Boo-hoo, a very rich girl by birth is adopted by a very rich family. This is a melodramatic book about a very real subject that could have been handled with great depth and sensitivity if the author hadn't been so self-absorbed and sophmoric that she couldn't understand her privelege. This is not to say, of course, that people of money can't be in turmoil or crisis, but to put forth a tone that makes this struggle the equal of people who are adopted into poverty-struck, drug-addled families (and yes I'm talking about white on white adoption here) is both disgusting and shallow. She has skills but veers into self-pity and martyrism much too easily. I hope she is young enough that she can learn to be a better person."},{"Title":"Ithaka: A Daughter's Memoir of Being Found","review":"Unlike many of the other reviewers, adoption is not a part of my personal history. I found the author's intense focus on her thought process to be tedious. Perhaps if adoption were something that I have a strong connection to, I would have found her slow (and I mean SLOW) personal growth to be more compelling. I pretty quickly got the point that it took her a long time to feel ready to meet her birth parents, but she kept on saying it over and over and over...While reading some sections, I really wondered why the author ruined a very good short story/magazine article by turing it into a full length book."},{"Title":"Ithaka: A Daughter's Memoir of Being Found","review":"I began this book with enthusiasm and interest, taken with the story and with the author's writing style. I quickly became dismayed by the fact that should couldn't seem to see outside her own relatively negative feelings about being found by her birth family. The fact that she waited over three years to meet them amazes me. In particular, I found her statement that she owed them nothing well, repulsive. What does any child owe his or her parent? It can easily be said (and often is) that we didn't ask to be born... the conclusion being that we have no responsibility for being here and none to those who brought us into the world. But in fact, if it was not for the Leyders, Ms. Saffian would not have had the family and life she cherishes. I would suggest that if the scales are ever balanced that she does indeed &quot;owe them&quot;.Frankly, I was amazed that the Leyders would have the patience and forebearance to wait what must have been a difficult three years. I was hoping that the epilogue would show the author's worldview had widened to better understand her birth parents and their decision. Instead, the focus seems to remain on her and her very self-indulgent feelings. It made me wonder if the Leyders had ever regretted making their call."},{"Title":"Ithaka: A Daughter's Memoir of Being Found","review":"I have been amazed at the number of early reviewers who judged Ms. Saffian's wariness as cold or self-serving. Though the book IS too drawn-out, I found myself cringing along with the author at each letter from her birth father. His emotional effusiveness presumed an intimacy with her he did not in fact have; his whole tone was, as Saffian points out herself, repulsively self-dramatizing and solipsistic. Why do reviewers consider these the &quot;perfect&quot; birthparents? They come across as relentlessly self-centered in the pressure they put on the narrator, despite the lipservice they pay to patience. Perhaps all readers, adoptive and biological, can take a cue from this memoir; Saffian's twentysomething queasiness in the face of her birthparents' emotionalism and self-absorption is a GREAT example of how many, many gen-xers feel in the face of many, many baby boomers' self-dramatizing narcissism. The generation gap continues..."},{"Title":"Ithaka: A Daughter's Memoir of Being Found","review":"i had really high hopes for this when i started it, but was soon disappointed by the author's tiresome self-absorption. the writing is usually decent, except for the cringeworthy &quot;inside the womb&quot; section. sarah saffian is not a likable woman, sorry to say. i wish she was."},{"Title":"Ithaka: A Daughter's Memoir of Being Found","review":"This book had been recommended to me, so I decided to take a chance and purchase it. But immediately I was turned off by the sacrosanct tone of Ms. Saffian's writing. It is didactic in a way that is very, very distancing. Her experiences as an adopted child are not useful, educational, or compelling to anyone else due to the author's absolute selfishness (there are many incidents of this in the book). Both with regard to her birth parents and her adoptive parents. She seems like a spoiled little rich girl looking to justify her behavior through this book, but that isn't interesting at all. The author would do better going to therapy and recording her feelings privately. It is surprising that both sets of parents were so patient and understanding with this girl. Her writing style is the final straw here. It's pretty awful in parts. Find a better book on the subject of adoption; there are many out there!"},{"Title":"Ithaka: A Daughter's Memoir of Being Found","review":"I think that anyone who has been confronted with sudden, unexpected information about their family will be able to identify with Saffian's account of her search for self-stability, a search which in this case involved dealing with her feelings about her adoptive and biological families. To say that Saffian is &quot;spoiled&quot; or &quot;ungrateful&quot; here is to miss the point: the book is a description of her personal journey and feelings about that journey. Why insist that there is a one &quot;right&quot; way to react to this experience? Some people would react differently were they in the same situation, but the point of a personal memoir is that they're not in that situation: only the experiencing subject can write down his perception of the situation. The world is filled with all kinds of people who have different reactions to different situations, which is what makes life interesting.That said: another thing that Saffian provides her audience with is a sensitive account of how therapy and self-discovery can work, which provides the important additional information that therapy is not only about finding out the truth (say, about how one has been damaged), it is about recognizing difficult truths about yourself. Saffian found out that for various reasons, she felt the need to control every situation (a feature of her personality that contributed to her hesitation to meet her birth family), a trait that had got her ahead in life but that also was interfering with aspects of her happiness. She needed to work on herself in order to make herself able to meet her birth parents. That is the true success story here and the fact that finally shows that she isn't spoiled and ungrateful; in the process of these changes, she learned about herself and tried to improve herself.This book is written very much in a twentysomething conventional style, which is a matter of taste; some people don't care for it, but I like it very much."},{"Title":"Ithaka: A Daughter's Memoir of Being Found","review":"I nearly didn't buy the book because I thought I would find it too difficult to get through. However, it is so rare to hear from our point of view that I couldn't resist. Being an adoptee, I read Ms. Saffian's story with tremendous interest as it carried me through the emotional gammut of anger, fear, acceptance, alienation, hope and, finally, peace of mind. I found myself initially horrified as her story unfolded because I've wondered myself what it would be like if I were &quot;found&quot;. She accurately accounts the emotional rollercoaster she lived through over the course of those three years - a shorter duration might have seemed &quot;rushed&quot;. I am most grateful for her sharing her experience because of what I've learned about myself as a result, I'm reading it again. Thanks Sarah!"},{"Title":"Ithaka: A Daughter's Memoir of Being Found","review":"When I first picked up Sarah Saffian's book, I was unsure about what to expect or what kind of writing I would find. What I sooned learned was that ITHAKA would prove to be one of the most captivating and truthful books I had read in years. Unable to put ITHAKA down, I anticipated each page, each event, with more excitement than the last. Saffian slowly unravelled her story like an old blanket: gentle, familiar, calming. She described her facinating ordeal with a poise and intelligence rarely seen in young authors today. After learning so much about Saffian's life, I felt a kind of sisterhood to her, as her words floated off the page and filled my mind with thoughts and ideas about myself that I had never before considered. A good book will make the reader not only think about the story at hand, but also the story of his or her own life; ITHAKA did just this, with a charm and finesse that made the book nothing less than irrisistable."},{"Title":"Ithaka: A Daughter's Memoir of Being Found","review":"This is simply one of the best books of recent memory. In place of the self-involved, self-centered ramblings of the typical memoir, Saffian gives us a complicated story about people wrestling with elemental problems: family, loyalty, loss. And even though she is at the center of that story, she does a marvelous job of making everyone else in the book as real as she is. The title is well-chosen, since the book is suffused with an almost Greek sense of the way life entails coming to terms with your destiny -- in Saffian's case, the sudden and unexpected appearance of her birth parents. This is a book of uncommon maturity and seriousness. I've read it twice now, even though I have no special interest in adoption, and I thought it even more impressive the second time around."},{"Title":"Ithaka: A Daughter's Memoir of Being Found","review":"I heard Sarah Saffian on NPR and was so impressed with her poise that I decided to pick up the book, even though the topic did not interest me at first. While I occasionally find Saffian's writing style to be a bit overwrought, on the whole I am impressed with her telling of the story. Saffian is exactly my age, and frankly, I can relate to her moments of melodrama--trying to adjust to post-college life was challenging enough without meeting birth parents! In this telling, Saffian and her family members are not &quot;good guys&quot; or &quot;bad guys,&quot; they are just people struggling to make connections. I think ITHAKA offers good insight into human relations in general--Sarah's reaction to being called out of the blue is instructive to (for?) anyone."},{"Title":"Ithaka: A Daughter's Memoir of Being Found","review":"As a reunited adoptee, though under slightly different circumstances, I could relate wholeheartedly to Ms. Saffian's story. She captures the real parts of what one goes through upon being reconnected to their birthfamily, regardless of the outcome, without uneccessary melodrama. I would recommend this book highly to those both inside and outside of the &quot;triad&quot; (birthparents, adoptive parents, adoptees). It can shed much light on the emotionally tumultuous process of reunion for those who struggle to understand what they, themselves, are going through, or for those around them who are confused by the power and origin of their emotions. Real. Raw. Right on, Sarah..."},{"Title":"Ithaka: A Daughter's Memoir of Being Found","review":"Like &quot;Joy Luck Club,&quot; this book takes a special kind of family experience and presents it in a way that is compelling and readable. I'm not adopted, but this isn't just a book for adoptees and birth parents. One other thing seems worth noting. I'm not a devotee of memoirs, and I'm not usually a big fan of &quot;Girl Books.&quot; But this book had me up late every night until it was finished. Ms. Saffian tells her tale in a very compelling way that makes it simply a great read."},{"Title":"Ithaka: A Daughter's Memoir of Being Found","review":"This book perfectly addresses the question we will all (not just those in the adoption triad) spend our lives asking: what has made us who are? Ms Saffian has poetry and great insight on her side as she takes us through her own experience, generously allowing us in and incouraging us to reflect upon our own lives. I was delighted to discover a book about a personal story that is so accessible and so helpful. Everyone should read this book."},{"Title":"Ithaka: A Daughter's Memoir of Being Found","review":"Since I became a birthmother in October, 1976, I never fail to be amazed at how many lives have been affected/touched by the adoption triad, the infinite variety of paths which led us all to the same place. Ithaka was recommended to me several times but I was reluctant to read it because I was so against her birthparents' intrusion on her life, I've always felt that a search was the adoptee's right. As a birthmother, I assumed the birthparents would be the villains from an adoptee's point of view. I was pleasantly suprised to find that Ms. Saffian's perspective toward her birthparents was compassionate, sensitive, and understanding. I'm thankful that she shared her personal story, as it helped me understand what my daughter might be feeling about her own identity and sense of place, and has helped me in my quest for healing and understanding. Highly recommended for all adoption triad members or anyone touched by adoption."},{"Title":"Ithaka: A Daughter's Memoir of Being Found","review":"Sarah Saffian's memoir, ITHAKA is, on the surface, the story of a young woman adopted at birth and later found by her birth parents. With merciless introspection and candor she tells her personal story. On a deeper level, she explores the subtler and much more universal themes of personal identity and finding \\"home\\" and what that means to each of us. Saffian is a master at choosing events from her past life as analogies to explain her current actions. She chooses just the right physical objects to paint a picture of a setting. Descriptions of simple things like subway rides and family dinners come close to poetry.While technically a story about Ms. Saffian, ITHAKA also provides a thought provoking look at some much broader themes and is well worth the read."},{"Title":"Ithaka: A Daughter's Memoir of Being Found","review":"I had no idea how strongly I would relate to Ms. Saffian's experiences, and those of her birth parents, when I bought this book. Having been the non-custodial, summer-visit parent of my daughter since she was 2 years old, the birth parents' letters resonated loudly with my own feelings. Ms. Saffian's reaction to their desire for a relationship reminded me of many of the thoughts and feelings my daughter shared with me over the years. This book isn't just for adoptees and those who have given them up, it is also for non-custodial parents and the children who grew up in a one-parent home."},{"Title":"Ithaka: A Daughter's Memoir of Being Found","review":"I found my self really not able to put this book down from the start to the end. As an adoptee I understood where Saffian was coming from when she was talking about certain feelings, but when she said she had an abortion, I couldn't believe it. As an adoptee I would never have had an abortion, and now help other women in crisis pregnancy situations by volunteering my time as a counselor. I thought it was cool that Saffian's birthparents found her, but can understand why she &quot;freaked&quot; out a bit because she had a good life with her adoptive parents. I didn't have a good life with my adoptive parents but believe they did the best they could. So I needed to find that missing piece to the puzzle, so I searched and found my birth mother. We met last year, and the reunion is moving slow which at times is good, but hard. I really did associate with Saffian having difficulty with relating to her birth parents, because it is like you are related but you don't really know them. Overall I found the book very informative, and would recommend it."},{"Title":"Ithaka: A Daughter's Memoir of Being Found","review":"As an adoptee who searched for and renunited with my birth family, with resulting wonderful relationships, in my teens some 17 years ago, I found Ithaka, although interesting hard to relate to. Although I can understand her ambivalent feelings at times and can sympathize with feeling discombobulated at being found, her underlying current of hostility and extreme negativity towards her birthparents I find a bit disturbing. Personally I have found that a large helping of compassion, understanding, maturity and grace go a long way in dealing with one's family members either birth or adopted. Additionally, I found the cultural contrasts between Ithaka with other Adoptee Memoirs such as \\"A Wealth of Family\\" by Thomas Brooks and \\"A Daughter of the Ganges\\" by Asha Miro who come from cultures where Family whether Birth or Adopted the cultural norm is it is not a question if one shall accept one's blood relatives, people just do as it is culturally expected, to be quite fascinating and enlightening."},{"Title":"Ithaka: A Daughter's Memoir of Being Found","review":"As an adoptee who just found her birth mother's name and address, Sarah provides a accurate and realistic protrayal of the complicated feelings and experiences. I felt like a was reading my own journal when I was reading this book. This book was long overdue."},{"Title":"Ithaka: A Daughter's Memoir of Being Found","review":"I found this book to be drawn-out and the author's views to be slightly presumptuous. The recurring theme of pushing away the birth family gets old quickly, and the book takes on a whiny tone. Certain aspects are over-dramatized. After seeing Saffian at a book fair, I wanted to relate to this book, but found the author's focus on herself to be smothering and alienating. On the positive side, Saffian is successful in not jumping to one side of the fence or the other in the open/closed records debate. While she wasn't sure she wanted her birth parents to find her, she also seemed to be at peace with them by the end of the book."},{"Title":"Ithaka: A Daughter's Memoir of Being Found","review":"I'd have to agree with the reader/reviewer, linda from sarasota, fl. Though well-written, I find this author dreary, selfish and overly affected by her small life. As an adoptee, I've heard every story possible regarding meeting or attempting to meet birth parents. I'm disappointed that the author couldn't have portrayed a stronger, more sensitive and giving person through this ordeal. It's a shame that the story happened the way it did...what a wonderful reunion this could have been for all concerned. Instead, the author portrayed herself as a 'stalkee' and then had to emotionally beat herself up and everybody around her through the entire ordeal...and a ridiculous 3-year ordeal it was! I stuck with this book through the end because she didn't actually reveal the 'reunion' until close to the end; however, I was relieved to finish the book, so I could be done with poor Sarah's journey."},{"Title":"Ithaka: A Daughter's Memoir of Being Found","review":"As an adoptee who found my birthmother in college, I was surprised how little I related to Saffian's experience. &quot;The lady doth protest too much&quot; kept running through my mind as I read the memoir. I found it hard to believe that at age 23, she was as secure as she claims she was before the fateful phone call from her birthmother. While I understand firsthand why finding one's birthparents is disorienting, I can't understand or empathize with the author's bizarrely hostile reaction to her birthparents, especially her father. Her writing is certainly impressive technically, but it didn't impress me as honest. She spent too much time brandishing her credentials and critiquing others, but not enough time asking herself serious questions. I wanted to know why she was so disgusted by her birthfather's emotional nature; was her hostility a means of cloaking a secret wish that her adoptive father had been more emotionally available? Or perhaps that she could be more emotionally open herself? Saffian's aloof, superior voice became progressively off-putting. Although I dove into the book in the beginning, my interest in the narrator--crucial in a memoir--lagged and I started skimming. While her story was at times intriguing, mainly because her reactions were so extreme, ultimately it didn't enlighten or move me. Saffian's book seemed less a memoir about her experience of being found by her birthparents than it did a case study of a self-involved, controlling personality."},{"Title":"Ithaka: A Daughter's Memoir of Being Found","review":"I wanted to love this book and I wanted to give it to some of my friends who are adopted and have had a similar search. To be honest, they all did it better and in less than two years of vascillating! I have faced cancer, divorce, deaths of child, mother, brother and business partner with less pathos than this young woman needed just to pick up a phone and call her parents! I just don't get it! My friends who have gone through it did it better and I'm encouraging them to write about it in a more tangible manner. I felt the author was wimpy and torturous in her journey and also extremely selfish."},{"Title":"Ithaka: A Daughter's Memoir of Being Found","review":"While I imagine this book might be extremely useful to a member of the adoption triad who is looking for insight or validation, it's not for the general reader unless used as a sleep aid. As a general reader, I wouldn't recommend it.Other reviewers have criticized the author's seemingly selfish reaction to her birthparents reaching out to her; I have to give her credit for honesty about reactions that don't show her in the best light. But to be frank, her personal journey just isn't interesting enough to sustain the average reader for more than a few chapters. While she plumbs her feelings endlessly and repetitiously, going so far as to enter therapy, she seems to be lacking the self-awareness to make it a worthwhile read. There's a lot of drama-queen there, but not much personality.A far better book by adoptees is \\"Identical Strangers\\" by Paula Bernstein and Elyse Schein published this year. Perhaps I'd be more sympathetic to Sarah Saffian if I weren't comparing her voice to those of Bernstein and Shein, two eloquent writers who went through far more, and yet write about their experiences beautifully and without a drop of self-pity."},{"Title":"Ithaka: A Daughter's Memoir of Being Found","review":"This is a memoir written, like so many, by a complete narcissist. It should have stayed in the author's diary and not been made public. There are plenty of good books about adoption, but this isn't one of them."},{"Title":"Ithaka: A Daughter's Memoir of Being Found","review":"Being very interested in adoption, I had waited a long time for this book to be delivered. However, it turned out to be a big disappointment. As others have mentioned, I found it to be very well-written, but it did not give me any insight into what the writer was experiencing. Good books, in my opinion, are books which emotionally take hold of me. Make me cry,laugh,mad, sad etc. With this book, I could not help but be fustrated in how little it was able to do so. I was always left totally detached. Bottom line, over-rated."},{"Title":"Ithaka: A Daughter's Memoir of Being Found","review":"As the mother of an adopted child, I was deeply moved by Sarah Saffian's beautifully written book, ITHAKA. Her sensitive and thoughtfully told story opens the reader to the many complicated issues every adopted child faces when confronting the fact that he or she has two families -- whether or not that child ever comes into contact with the birth family, the issue is still there and needs to be addressed. The manner in which the emergence of her birth family in Sarah's life was handled by Sarah, her adoptive parents, and her birth parents is a marvelous example to anyone else who may be in her situation. I highly recommend this book -- not only to adoptive parents and adoptees -- but to anyone who has an interest in understanding what it means to be adopted."},{"Title":"Ithaka: A Daughter's Memoir of Being Found","review":"While many adoption books focus on trying to attain a reunion, &quot;Ithaka&quot; focuses on the personal and emotional impacts after the reconnection.With one sudden phone call, Sarah is thrust into the reunion experience quite unprepared for the questions and issues that come along with it. The story of her personal journey through this roller-coaster experience will give any adoptee insight into what one goes through after the initial reunion event. &quot;Hello! I think I'm your mother,&quot; is only the beginning of a long personal journey. In reading &quot;Ithaka&quot; I was able to reflect on my own journey that continues years after the initial re-connect.Adoptive parents, too, will find this story comforting and reassuring. Even though the adoptee is searching and discovering, the real base of self continues to be with the Mom and Dad who raised you. This comes through clearly in this story within Sarah's inner conflicts.The general reader not involved in the adotion triad would still find this to be an interesting look into the reunion experience without having to go through the &quot;How to's&quot; of reunions.Overall this is an easy read, and a thought-provoking story."},{"Title":"Ithaka: A Daughter's Memoir of Being Found","review":"This book struck such a cord with me as myself and Sarah Saffian are in the same situation - birthparents who ended up married to each other after the adoption.Very well written and interesting to see how another had coped with &quot;being found&quot;. I could see so well where she was coming from."},{"Title":"Ithaka: A Daughter's Memoir of Being Found","review":"Saffian identifies some themes that seem to be pervasive in adoptees being reunited, and gave me insight into issues surrounding my own adoption and meeting of my birth parents during my senior year of college.During the reading, I found myself becoming annoyed with her character at times. She seems to be inordinately hard on her birth parents, and stingy in sharing herself with them at times.However, unlike most other things in life, finding a model for how to behave in being reunited with your birth parents is tricky. As you grow up, you see people die, you see people get married, you see people get divorced, etc. Rarely do you personally see the experience that Saffian and other adoptees have had. Reuniting with people who you do not know that share your genetic similarities is disorienting in many ways.Saffian portrays the disorientation very well, and from many different angles. Having spent ten years building a relationship with my biological parents and siblings, and spending an excessive amount of brainpower thinking about it, I was surprised that Saffian opened up new insights for me."},{"Title":"Ithaka: A Daughter's Memoir of Being Found","review":"I am at a loss for words on how this book affected me. As an adoptee who is still in search of my own elusive birth parents, I have to wonder if I wouldn't react the same way as Sarah. To have my birth mother just call me out of the blue like that would be, for a lack of a better word, shocking. The emotional tidal wave it sent her on was understandable. TO say this wouldn't happen to me would be total denial on my part. I wept, I laughed. I had to put the book down on numerous occations just to regroup. My emotions overcame me at times where I just went outside and screamed in frustration. If I could just be so lucky. Great Book! A must read for any adoptee in search for the truth."},{"Title":"Ithaka: A Daughter's Memoir of Being Found","review":"Ithaka, as the title suggests, is the powerful story of a life journey, in this case Saffian's foray into the uncharted territory of discovering and reshaping her concept of identity. While anyone who has an interest in adoption might naturally gravitate toward the subject matter, this is a book for a more universal audience; that is, anyone who has grappled with the age-old question: Who am I? What makes this book so tremendously effective, however, is Saffian's ability to share her confusion with candor and probing introspection rather than whininess. There is struggle, but no self-pity. Saffian tells her story with indelible clarity and refreshing honesty as she strives for, and ultimately achieves, a sense of hard-won self-awareness. The beauty of this narrative is that the author never loses sight of the subtle value in the lessons she learns along the way. She seems to realize that while there are no easy answers to profound life questions, just asking the questions gets us closer to what we're seeking. An exquisite examination of what makes each of us both unique and part of something larger."},{"Title":"Ithaka: A Daughter's Memoir of Being Found","review":"Also, if you're a birthparent thinking of searching, or an adoptive parent whose (adult) child has been found by a birthparent, you will gain much understanding from the ideas expressed in this book.

This book is a gift to anyone who has faced the dilemna of how to reconcile any long term satisfying relationship (here Sara's relationship with her adoptive family) with new kindred souls who manifest in our lives (here her birth family). Ithaka reads like a novel, and has lasting value for any person commited to explore what it means to be a loving person in a complicated world.

The fourth essay is on the work of a lesser known artist, Harriet Arnow, a reading of her work 'The Dollmaker'.

The book is about adoptees who are searching for their birth mothers, not because of lack of love for their adoptive parents, but because there is an empty spot in their lives which needs filling.Such searches are not easy. The laws of many states have sealed their birth and adoption records. In addition, fires, floods, and natural disasters have certainly destroyed many of these necessary clues. Many such searches have surely failed, but this book is about those which succeeded.All of the stories are about adoptees who began their searches as adults or at least older teenagers. Their searches lead them to their mothers (if still living) as well as to their siblings and even grandparents.The surprising truth brought out by the book is not the fulfillment the adopted people found, but the happiness, the sense of relief, and the release from guilt the birth mothers experienced from the reconnection.Many of these adoptions occurred in the 50's and 60's when &quot;illegitimacy&quot; was a stigma on both mother and child. The birth mothers were usually just children themselves. They were pressured by parents and religiously run homes for unwed mothers into giving up their children to unknown adoptive parents, sometimes without ever having seen or held their babies. As a result, these birth mothers were frequently left with an emptiness and sense of guilt which the book unerringly captures.The emotional impact of the reconnection on the child, the birth mother and on the adoptive parents who feared losing their children is carefully chronicled in words and poignant photographs. Each adoptee's story is a distinct emotional experience, and in no cases do they tend to be mere repetitions.The book deals only with successful searches and happy reconnections, but this is a sufficient task for one book. However, the book clearly illustrates the need for revision of the various states' archaic adoption laws which unduly stress secrecy.Some birth mothers undoubtedly do not want to be found, and they have every right to believe that the secrecy laws under which they gave up their children will be honored. This conflict between the emotional and psychological needs of innocent adoptees to fill in the empty spots in their lives and the desire of SOME birth mothers to remain forever anonymous continues to rage.However, in order to evaluate the pros and cons of opening the records, it is necessary to realize that many birth mothers were coerced into adoptions in states which just happened to have secrecy in adoption laws. They were not given choices, and because so many were children themselves, their decisions were suspect and subject to change with maturity.It seems to me that the states should adopt new national uniform adoption laws as has been done in such matters as child custody. The records could then be opened to ombudsmen who, at the adoptees request, could locate and contact the birth mothers, tell them their children are searching for them and give these birth mothers the opportunity to reconnect.I would strongly recommend that before deciding, these birth mothers be given a copy of &quot;Sacred Connections&quot; to read before deciding so they might gain insights into the needs of their birth children to find them and realize the benefits to the birth mothers of such reconnection.Once started, &quot;Sacred Connections&quot; is hard to put down. I recommend it most highly."},{"Title":"Sacred Connections: Stories of Adoption","review":"Sacred Connections is a gift to anyone in the adoption circle. The stories are insightful, touching and honest. As a adoptive parent I especially appreciate the stories showing adoptive parents as supportive of their children's need to connect with their biological family. Often, the media depicts the adoptive parents as resistant to their child's need to search and this simply isn't accurate. Many adoptive parents have come to recognize that their child's biological roots are not something to be feared but to be celebrated. I recommend Sacred Connections to anyone who has been affected by adoption."},{"Title":"Sacred Connections: Stories of Adoption","review":"I'm a birth mother of a child in an open adoption, and I gave this book to my son's adoptive mother for Mother's Day.

The stories are very moving and brought tears to my eyes. It was nice to see a variety of closed adoption reunion and open adoption stories. I think the book shows people that contrary to current adoption stereotypes...adoptees, adoptive parents, and birth parents can all share a special bond or connection if they are open to it. Everybody has something special to add to the relationship...and having birth parents be a part of that relationship doesn't have to be threatening or confusing for anyone!

Boyle without the doom 'n gloom, a \\"Confederacy of Dunces\\" for the 21st century? Yes, yes, yes! -- it's GULLBOY, a fun, fantastical read. This terrific debut combines all of the above--wacky and memorable characters, page-turning plot twists, and a love affair with language and that near-mythical place known as Coney Island--with a genuine meditation on how we treat those who are different and how they see themselves. Rubinstein's first novel balances humor and pyrotechnic displays of wordsmithing with a beautiful modern fable. The surprising ending will have you reaching for your hankie. I can't wait for his next book."},{"Title":"Gullboy -- The Inconceivable Life of Franco Pajarito Zanpa, A Novel","review":"This ribald romp of a novel combines humor, farce, and tragedy into a rollicking, riotous, and very original coming-of-age story. Rubenstein has a keen ear for the unique rhythms and dialects of Brooklyn's Coney Island. Witty dialogue, weird and wacky characters, and a whimsical plot all contribute a real spark of imagination to this fast-paced story. As a tale of growing-up \\"different\\" in a world filled with absurd circumstances and complicated struggles, \\"Gullboy\\" is as entertaining as it is profound. Definitely a must-read!"},{"Title":"Gullboy -- The Inconceivable Life of Franco Pajarito Zanpa, A Novel","review":"If you like novels that spawn conversation and create intrigue, this is the book for you. Every detail of Gullboy seems carefully chosen to carry a particular meaning (although the members of my reading group didn't always agree as to what that meaning was - but that was the fun of it). I appreciated that no detail seemed arbitrary in the world of this novel, right down to the choice of Coney Island, Brooklyn (famous for it's sideshows and amusement parks, etc.) as a setting where one senses anything might happen -- a place where you go to suspend your disbelief and enjoy the ride on an author's imagination.No one protaganist dominates the narrative. Instead, the story is shared by a character ensemble that seems familiar yet bizarre, dark, and endlessly interesting. The plot skillfully braids these characters' lives, switching back and forth in a way that heightens the story's tension until you find you can't sleep till you've learned how it all turns out.Though I don't think it's literally spelled out anywhere in the book, I found the novel made deft use of the Seven Deadly Sins, with each character representing the embodiment of the classic definition of one of those sins, namely Avarice, Envy, Wrath, Lust, Gluttony, Sloth and Pride (though I should mention not everyone in my group agreed with this point, but as I said, that's part of what makes Gullboy such an interesting read).A satisfying, stimulating novel you'll want to chat about."},{"Title":"Gullboy -- The Inconceivable Life of Franco Pajarito Zanpa, A Novel","review":"Gullboy is a tremendously fun read...but woven through the delightful, imaginative, fanciful, outrageous and sexy fast-turning pages is an insightful tale of how fathers fail their sons, particularly as they grow into manhood.

Ernesto and Franco's father-son relationship is so touching, so demonstrative, it feels so real. It makes sense that Ernesto, like so many fathers, just wants to see his son soar. But can Ernesto really see Franco through his cloak of feathers?

I'm glad I did. What a great read! Entertaining. Funny. Poignant. With memorable characters. And artful writing too.\\"Gullboy\\" tells the story of a young guy living on Coney Island named Ernesto Zanpa. Zanpa is kind of drifting through life as a Brooklyn beach bum when the story begins. He marries a woman named Venus who he knows from \\"dating\\" as a local prostitute, a woman who seems much smarter and more ambitious than he does, but one with the morals of a hungry seagull. When, early in the story, Ernesto begins to raise the gullboy, his love of the easy life is broken by the need to look after the kid.The story then follows what happens to these three: Ernesto, Venus and the gullboy, as their ambitions heat up and fire off in different directions, along with those of the other characters, like a crate of fireworks tossed onto a bonfire.The story seems to be \\"about\\" lots of things, including family, morality, \\"normality,\\" and responsibility for others, but, to me, at least, the biggest theme seems to be Ambition, and how, on the one hand, it can drive people to accomplish great things, but also, when taken too far, how ridiculous ambition can make you look, not to mention selfish, lonely and ruined. Still, for all of that, this is one of the funniest novels I've ever read. Rubinstein obviously loves his characters, the more rotten their hearts are, the more he seems to enjoy them. It's lowbrow. It's highminded. It's a friggin' work of art, full of lines like this one: \\"Beauty may be only skin deep, he thought, but then that's where all the nerve endings are.\\"Give this book to the workaholic in your life, but first you'll want to read it yourself."},{"Title":"Gullboy -- The Inconceivable Life of Franco Pajarito Zanpa, A Novel","review":"A fun and thoughtful book, Gullboy makes great reading for anyone who wants to spend the time getting to know the characters of a novel enough to care (or not) about what happens to them. It's fast paced, crammed with delightfully complex characters, and asks the reader to consider his own capacity (and likely lack thereof) for the kind of unconditional love shown to Franco by his father. As the words on the final pages pass, the author trusts the reader enough to imagine for themselves the consequences of the last tragic incidents of the story. It's easy to do because we already know these characters and the world that they inhabit. When you're done reading, you'll wish to visit Coney Island, wonder at what's going on in posh Trump Tower, and reconsider the way in which you treat the people you know who are living inconceivable lives around you."},{"Title":"Gullboy -- The Inconceivable Life of Franco Pajarito Zanpa, A Novel","review":"Wade Rubenstein's first novel shows off his sense of the zany and the influence of repeated readings of \\"A Confederacy of Dunces.\\" This is, in many ways, a good thing, because \\"Gullboy,\\" like \\"Confederacy,\\" is an entertaining romp through the world of the bizarre.In the barest sense, it is the story of Ernesto Zanpa, a lazy loser who lives on Coney Island in a moldering house he inherited from his parents. God knows, as a marginally employed, uneducated near-bum, with a prostitute wife, he never would have managed to find a home otherwise. Even within the relative safety of his bungalow, he imagines the cardboard box he will one day inhabit under a cement overpass.But destiny comes knocking - or wailing, in this case - at his door in the form of a half-human, half-seagull he finds in a nest in his back yard. He adopts the baby and becomes father to the boy, who he names Franco, after his own father. Parenthood transforms Zanpa into a man with a purpose who works daily and cares for his little gull-babe.It is the other characters who inhabit his world that provide most of the crazy comic fodder. His wife, disgusted with her hubby and his bird boy, becomes an inadvertent online porn star when she has a gastronomical incident in full view of a webcam toilet. His lawyer, a kooky bastard with a successful ambulance-chasing practice, ends up shooting himself in his own penis while running from the Russian Mafia. And, his son, the Gullboy, Franco, is a marvel of unlikely avian growth spurts married to superior human sensitivity, who longs, like the Little Mermaid, to be fully human despite the price he might have to pay.The supporting cast in the story is too long to list, but most contribute to the comedy in a useful manner. Still, one wonders if the number of freaks spread through the story, like icing on an already sweet cake, could have been pared down a bit to focus the action.Not to be a spoiler, but the ending misses the mark emotionally and feels as if the author lost his aim somewhere while contriving the whirlwind of action that comprises the last third of the book.

As most insurances will not cover couples therapy, usually this is an \\"out-of-pocket\\" expense for most client systems. So anything \\"brief\\" is greatly appreciated! Even though couples can spend up to $20,000 (or more) on the wedding, it is sad they won't fork-up $800-$1,000 for counseling to keep the marriage going. Actually, attorneys will cost much more than this and there's no such thing as a \\"pain-free\\" divorce or partnership dissolution. \\"Returns\\" work for clothes, not people.In our agency, we have a three phase model based on Boyd-Franklin & Bry (2000): 1) entire family, 2) the \\"IP\\" (identified patient), and 3) the entire family again. As a family problem may start as an \\"adolescent problem,\\" we have to work with the teenager in phase two initially. However, it isn't uncommon that the IP is really a buffer for the couple sub-system and their failed interactions. So then we need to switch to working on the couple or else the teenager will be trapped in \\"acting out\\" behaviors. This is where Hope-Focused Marriage Counseling (HFMC) comes in. As we've already spent some time with the teenager, we don't have 12-16 sessions for Emotionally Focused Therapy (EFT) - we need something quicker! Enter HFMC, stage left!So HFMC has a lot of good uses. Also, Worthington and fellow supporters (such as myself) are conducting efficacy research on this approach to establish it as an \\"EBT\\" (evidence-based treatment). So look for HFMC to be nuanced and tweaked in light of this work.

His approach to counseling is based on a positive, hope-based alliance with the couple. His strategy is applying faith working through love. He defines love as a willingness to value and avoid devaluing people that springs from a caring, other-focused heart.The areas of change are:central values and beliefscore vision of the marriageconfession and forgivenesscommunicationconflict resolutioncognition about the marriagecloseness (intimacy, coaction, distance)complicating problems (abuse, substance dependence, mental health problems)commitment (including contentment with the marriage and compounding investments in the marriage compared with investments in alternatives to the marriage such as other relationships, jobs, children, hobbies, friends)The last two thirds of the book lists numerous interventions that can be used to address the above areas of change.I think the book is a very good resource for someone who already has experience counseling couples or as a main resource in a class. It may be too technical as a stand alone resource for someone new to counseling.http://calpopa.wordpress.com/2012/01/15/hope-focused-marriage-counseling/"},{"Title":"Hope-Focused Marriage Counseling: A Guide to Brief Therapy","review":"I found this book on Amazon when I was \\"shopping\\"This book is \\"friendly\\" instead of the \\"researched theory\\" books. Though I haven't read the entire book, I've been using some of the \\"suggestions."},{"Title":"Hope-Focused Marriage Counseling: A Guide to Brief Therapy","review":"I only bought this book because it was required reading for a class. I've only gotten a few chapters into it, but it seems pretty repetitive, a lot of the information is sort of common sense or really general stuff, and overall, I wouldn't read it if I didn't have to for a grade."},{"Title":"The Anger Advantage: The Surprising Benefits of Anger and How It Can Change a Woman's Life","review":"I enjoy skimming the psychology section of the store and this book was just glaring at me (probably because of its broad white face and yellow explanation point)... I read the title, and I had previously looked up other books for women and their anger (theres not a lot of them) and nothing looked really organised or updated.I sat down and started reading...All I can say is WOW! When I think of people with anger problems I always envision the male beating his wife, losing his temper and becoming irate. &quot;Those&quot; were anger problems... But as females we handle our anger SO incredibly diffrent. Although some of us can be violent like males... Generally, most of us are not, but handle our anger just as destructively.The book covers an array of myths women believe and how each myth is applied to specific sitations when females become angry. Theres also personal studies and commentary from women having problems with their families, spouse, boyfriend, kids, work, etc.An example of an anger myth...*Women are to remain docile or uppity and not share their anger. Because if they do theres something obviously wrong with them. You are either sick or crazy or definately unfeminine.This myth invalidates our feeling of anger and makes us doubt our own intuition/feelings.Another fairly interesting myth was the one I took to heart...*All or most anger leads to violence.This again isnt true but always made me so anxious when I fought/argued with someone close to me. So eventually I would supress how I felt with this perticular person although they had never hit me.This book is very organised and heart felt. Although it is not condeming it helps you take a closer look at your own responsibilities and how you handle an array of issues when you become angry or upset. It comfronts the consequences and unrealistic expectations we have been tought as children or by society to uphold.In conclusion, this is a book worth buying! It offers many answers and solutions. Men could also learn A LOT from this book even though it is applied to women specificly.Another book I suggest is &quot;Beyond Anger: A guide for Men&quot; by Harbin. Although tailored for men, women can learn from this to!If your thirst for better understanding and communication in relationships still isnt quenched try...&quot;Getting the Love You Want: A guide for couples&quot; (Hendrix)and...&quot;Nonviolent Communication: A Language of Compassion&quot; (Rosenberg)"},{"Title":"The Anger Advantage: The Surprising Benefits of Anger and How It Can Change a Woman's Life","review":"Common sense backed by sound research.

Professor Heineman challenges the assumption that the development of women &quot;standing alone&quot; in the East paralleled their development in the West. Her analysis goes beyond the battle for recognition of their social/sexual lives in the era of the &quot;surplus women&quot; (There were nearly seven million more women than men in Germany in 1946), and considers the effect on marriage of German reunification in 1990. Although married women in both Germanies, within the traditional locus for sexual expression, had eaiser availability to creature comforts, such as homes and apartments, the Christian coalition in power in the West made special efforts to defend the traditional nuclear family. Thus, women in the East grew up believing that women must integrate motherhood with their careers, but in the West the two livestyles were viewed as mutually exclusive. Heineman suggests that the generation of separation has created fundamental difference where sameness is expected, and that the equality created in the East may now be superimposed on the West."},{"Title":"Creatures Small and Furry","review":"Young children are naturally curious about animals. Creatures Small and Furry uses photography and a simple text to present the smallest of animals in a pleasurable way for children. The author points out to his readers that small, furry animals are all around us and in far off places. Most of the animals near us, we never see. Many are nocturnal. As the child turns each page, another small animal is introduced with information presented about that particular animal and all mammals in general. One new general idea is added as the pages are turned until all of the characteristics of mammmals unfold for the young reader. This wonderful book will be enjoyed time and time again by young children."},{"Title":"The everything book;: A treasury of things for children to make and do","review":"My mom and I used to do projects out of this book when I was a little girl and I did a lot of projects on my own. I made my first mother's day gift of bath salts using a recipe from this book (and my lifelong obsession with making bath products started!). Who remembers how to make newspaper hats and trees? This book will help remind you of that and more. You can learn nursery rhymes to recipes for making your own playdough. Highly recommended if you can find it."},{"Title":"A Distant Dawn (Westward Dreams, Book 4)","review":"Jane Peart's books are ideal for curling up with in a knitted coverlet and a cup of tea. I've also found them great for reading aloud to the elderly.Of course, sex and violence are never troublesome, and a current of quiet Christian faith underlies every story. The heroines turn to the Bible at a crisis, but the books are never preachy.These novels are engaging for several reasons: (1) The heroine is characterized immediately, without lots of history and detail, so the audience can sympathize and identify with her right away. (2) The action of the plot begins so quickly that an audience more interested in action and romance than in character is also captured without delay. (3) Generally, the swift opening is fulfilled by an equally swift progress so that Peart's books, like any good page-turners, can provide hours of uninterrupted entertainment.A Distant Dawn is fourth in the Westward Dreams series and not nearly so good as the others. There is the usual conflict between one love interest with impeccable clothes and manners and another with rough ways--but the attraction to either one isn't very strong in this novel. The story drags, and the most exciting scene doesn't happen until chapter 22 of the 23-chapter book. The heroine's character is never fully developed, and her negative attitude persists for too long throughout the story. One 98-year-old listener called her \\"hateful\\"!Jane Peart's Westward Dreams series captivates the reader with spirited heroines who find adventure, challenge and possible love in a fascinating (and rather historically accurate) time of U.S. history. To enjoy them at their best, however, you should start with another title, perhaps Promise of the Valley. Others in the series include Runaway Heart, Where Tomorrow Waits and Undaunted Sprirt."},{"Title":"A Distant Dawn (Westward Dreams, Book 4)","review":"Sunny Lyndall has dreamed for years of traveling west to California - and with her parents dead, there's nothing to stop Sunny from selling the family home and making her dream come true. She and her brother travel as far as Missouri before they're robbed and left nearly penniless by an unscrupulous fellow who promises to help them shop for supplies. Sunny and her brother have no choice but to stay in Missouri until they've saved up enough money to resume their trip. Against Sunny's wishes, her brother gets a job as a Pony Express rider, and Sunny agrees to work with him as station manager. As time passes and she gets to know the folks in town, Sunny finds herself wondering if perhaps the disastrous interruption of her own plans was part of some higher purpose, especially when she finds herself falling in love.It's a sweet story, and if a gentle tale of romance set on the western frontier in the mid-1800's appeals to you, you're sure to enjoy it. However, there's nothing at all about this novel that sets it apart or makes it special. The plot is overdone and predictable, though it's pleasant to watch the story unfold. The characters are stock types (the perfect gentleman with a mysterious past, the rough and ready frontiersman with a heart of gold), and the protagonist is so persistently negative it's hard to have much sympathy for her, especially when she takes out her frustrations on other people. Honestly, I can't imagine why two fine and worthy men would both find themselves so taken with her, especially when she treats at least one of them like something she found on the bottom of her shoe.I did enjoy this novel. It was a pleasant way to pass a couple of hours. It won't be going on my keeper shelf, though."},{"Title":"Never One Nation: Freaks, Savages, and Whiteness in U.S. Popular Culture, 1850-1877","review":"Linda Frost's work is painful to read, and yet is something that needs to be told.

This book is, I think, the original screenplay of Jim Henson's Storyteller series because it follows *very* closely to the stories and dialogue seen on TV. The illustrations are also taken from the show and are very nice. The written word is different from television, however, and these stories take on a different light often in one versus the other, and there are some expansions here that didn't make the final editing cuts.My kid and I love \\"The Storyteller\\" series, and this book is a pleasant addition for bedtime reading."},{"Title":"Jim Henson's \\"The Storyteller\\"","review":"Perfection is the TV series that preceded this book. Of course, I must gloat and say that I knew all those many years ago that Anthony Minghella was the most exquisite writer I had ever heard/read. His words coupled with the genius of Jim Henson and company made for the best (no exaggeration) thing ever to be broadcast on television. To be able to read the words from these shows and have them readily available on your bookshelf is heaven. I've been recommending the TV series and this book for years. I still recommend it today."},{"Title":"Jim Henson's \\"The Storyteller\\"","review":"Many years ago my family sat around the television, wide eyed and filled with magic; we were watching the Jim Henson Storyteller series. We waited and waited for it to reappear one day- to no avail. But FINALLY, a book! To be able to relive the &quot;hugs and snoodles&quot; of Hans My Hedghog, the stone soup tale of a &quot;Story Short&quot;- all of it beautifully, and creatively written, with illustrations to match- will take you back to your childhood. I find it hard to believe this has yet to be discovered. Don't miss the videos that are now out, at long last!"},{"Title":"Jim Henson's \\"The Storyteller\\"","review":"This book is an enchanting, beautifully-illustrated collection of fairy tales by the same author who wrote the screenplay to &quot;The English Patient.&quot; The stories are all based on ancient European folklore, but Minghelli's lush and vivid language ('...while his mother felt a crack faulting her heart, like a tiny pencil line. And with each hour the pencil line grew thicker and thicker until one day, not long after, her heart split in half and she died.') makes each story new and unique, and definitely full of surprises. Nearly every page is enhanced with gorgeous full-color illustrations by Darcy May. Definitely not just for kids, and, no, there's not a single Muppet in it!"},{"Title":"Jim Henson's \\"The Storyteller\\"","review":"This is one of those books which I hope to hand down to my children, and my children's children.

(the book is writen by the shows writer) I enjoyed being introduced to the old european folktales that were unlike any I had heard before. This book is a wonderful translation of these stories from the show's scripts into storybook format. It is easy to read and beautifully illustrated. The pictures are very well done and look so much like the Jim Henson creatures. I highly recomend this book for both children and adults. It is a great addition to any collection and fun to read over and over again."},{"Title":"Jim Henson's \\"The Storyteller\\"","review":"This book is fabulous. I grew up watching these stories come to like on the Jim Henson Hour, and I love having these stories at my finger tips. The stories are very intersting and original.

I am so glad that I am able to read and share these stories with my friends and family!"},{"Title":"Jim Henson's \\"The Storyteller\\"","review":"The television series was one of the best things ever to be shown on TV, but it's more than worthwhile to pick up this book just to be able to focus on Anthony Minghella's (yep, he of &quot;The English Patient&quot;) way with words. Minghella doesn't just write good narration, he writes good, old-fashioned *story-telling* Like, say, Kipling's &quot;Just-So Stories,&quot; Minghella's &quot;The Storyteller&quot; captures the language of the very best tale tellers."},{"Title":"Lie down in darkness","review":"Styron captures the reader with superb characterization of flawed, damaged people confronting life as they want it to be contrasted with life as it is. An engrossing yet sad story. Despite its depressing nature, I couldn't put it down. Truly captures the essence of an Southern gentility from an earlier time."},{"Title":"Lie down in darkness","review":"Maybe Styron is not so famous outside the US, but he undoubtedly deserves more attention. His poetic realism is deeply touching, in this book he portrays the dark side of a southern family and the tragedies brought along. If you love authors like Yates and Bukowski, you definitely have to read this book."},{"Title":"Lie down in darkness","review":"Early in William Styron's novel Lie Down in Darkness the reader is introduced to a man, Milton Loftis, at the train station. Milton is a good allusion; whatever paradise this man has hoped for in life, it has been lost. How?There, I think, is the essential question that drives this novel. How do we bring ourselves to lose things we charish? How does this happen?It's a deep and heartbreaking question, and it may leave many people unable to read this book. This is understandable, but reading this novel, though the author's first novel and somewhat experimental, allows one to view the depths of human suffering, and perhaps provides ways to avoid it."},{"Title":"Lie down in darkness","review":"It should come as no surprise that Lie Down in Darkness is beautifully written, given who wrote it. It's a slow read at the beginning, gradually picking up steam as the story progresses. At its best, Styron manages to capture the electrical emotions of his deeply-troubled family. Yet for some reason he does not provide us with a reason, or some explanation for the parents' many flaws: why did Helen Loftis grow up hating men so much?; why did Milton Loftis feel the need to drown his sorrows in alcohol? Answers, or at least, a casual addressing of these questions would have improved the readers understanding of these complex individuals. The novel builds to a lyrical and almost dream-like conclusion ... but I could have done without the fifty-page interlude into Peyton's stream of conscious."},{"Title":"Lie down in darkness","review":"This book is a lot of things: arduous, painstaking, sad, disgusting, loving, enchanting, sweeping, graphic, and vague. As a southerner, it is the quintessential representation of growing up in guilt. It took me awhile to get into this book: more than a couple LLLOOONNNGG chapters; but I was adamant about seeing this through to the end, and I am so glad I did. I don't want to summarize a plot since so many other readers already have, so I'll just say that this book is in the same genre as Cat on a Hot Tin Roof or A Streetcar Named Desire, both by Tennessee Williams. You will probably either love it or hate it, and also will most likely never want to read it again, regardless. It is a very specific plot with incredibly well-developed characters and a story that leaves you in shock by the end. Neo-tragic and beautiful, Styron's writing is unparalleled."},{"Title":"Lie down in darkness","review":"Yes this is beautifully written, \\"masterful prose\\". I wholeheartedly agree. Enjoyable reading? Definately not. I didn't find it depressing. I would sum it up as bad things happening to bad people. Not one major character had any redeeming quality at all. That's not the problem, though, for me anyway. I don't know the right word, long winded? rambling? For example, in one of the final sections of the book Peyton is speaking in about a hundred page long, all one paragraph, stream of consciousness. It's the culmination of the whole book, leading up to her suicide. It would be the most interesting reading yet, I thought, but it felt like it would never end. For me reading shouldn't be work and this was a lot of work to get through and I didn't feel like it was worth the effort."},{"Title":"Lie down in darkness","review":"It is not a spoiler to state that William Styron's intense 1951 novel \\"Lie Down in Darkness\\" begins with a young woman's suicide, because that tragedy is made clear in the opening pages, as a distraught Milton Loftis prepares himself for his daughter's funeral. Peyton Loftis would seem to be the perfect Virginia belle, beautiful and affluent, but she must deal with a disabled older sister (Maudie's affliction is never named, but it seems to be Down's Syndrome), an increasingly hostile mother, and a doting father whose admiration goes far beyond the paternal. The novel's time scheme is the stormy (in every sense of the word) day of Peyton's funeral, the bulk of the story told in flashbacks, as her father, driving to the cemetery with his tiresome mistress, and her mother, supported by their fatuous pastor, recall their unhappy family life: the father's escalating alcoholism and the mother's deepening neurosis. As a child Peyton has been hopelessly spoiled and as a woman she becomes less and less able to deal with life's demands. Her marriage to a nice Jewish boy is a disaster from day one, her father getting sloppy drunk at the wedding and her mother going into hysterics. Peyton and her husband move to New York, where he hopes to succeed as a painter, while his wife goes into a tailspin of drinking and adultery. Her last day on Earth (which, incidentally, is the day the first atomic bomb was dropped) becomes a 50-page Joycean stream of conscious and unconscious madness with no paragraph indentations and, trust me, not ending with Molly's ecstatic \\"Yes!\\" As many readers have pointed out, this is not exactly a feel-good affirmation of life type of story, but it is powerfully written and holds a serious reader's interest to the very last page."},{"Title":"Lie down in darkness","review":"The writer is really outstanding in describing settings - nature, weather, etc. The negative is that this is a VERY depressing book."},{"Title":"Lie down in darkness","review":"I checked out a public library copy of this book after reading Kristen Stewart and Jennifer Lawrence wanted the part of Peyton in an upcoming movie. I enjoyed it so much I bought a copy from Amazon and read it again and will read it again soon. It is now one of my top 3 books. It was depressing, but it was also a great book. The author's details of the characters made me understand them more fully. Thanks to Amazon for coming through again for me (having the product and getting it to me so quickly and easily)."},{"Title":"Lie down in darkness","review":"If you love reading about the how the old South tried valiantly to cling to the old grand traditions of womanhood and gallantry, this is your book. My favorite line from the book is \\"She had wanted the future to be like a nice, long congenial tea party, where everyone talked a little, danced a little, and had polite manners. She had come to the party and it had been ghastly; everone misbehaved and nobody had a good time.\\"This perfectly demonstrates the expectations of a southern belle, but the reality was quite different. Also, because it's by Styron, it is full of depression and madness. A really good read."},{"Title":"Lie down in darkness","review":"This 400-page novel begins on a train on a morning in August 1945. The train is traveling from New York City to Port Richmond, Virginia, carrying the coffin and body of suicide victim Peyton, the recently married daughter of Milton Loftis. Waiting at the train station are her father, his mistress, the undertaker and his assistant. The local minister has gone to the Loftis home to retrieve the unforgiving mother and wife, Helen Loftis. The book ends about eight hours later after the burial. In between these pages, the characters rant and rave as they reminisce about their dysfunctional lives, separations, alcoholism, prejudices, and all other acts of unkindness toward each other. It is a book of flashbacks and Peyton sums it all up by stating the overriding causes of their mis-spent lives: \\"It's time and remembrance, that's what it is.\\" In other words, people with too much time on their hands and too much dwelling in the past. At another point, Peyton exclaims to her forever-complaining husband, \\"I've sinned only in order to lie down in darkness and find, somewhere in the net of dreams, a new father, a new home.\\" One can only hope that she found that peace in her death. I thoroughly enjoyed this character study of deeply troubled people. One intriguing section of the book tells the history of New York City's Potter Fields. I have lived in the Big Apple for years and was not aware that there was even such a place. It's an amazing tale to the point that I couldn't believe what Styron was telling me. However, I checked my copy of The Encyclopedia of New York City, and what he says is totally true. That segment alone made reading the book worthwhile."}]`),A={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:J},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:S,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(i=>setTimeout(i,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},R={class:"card-container"},B=["disabled"],M={key:0},x={key:1};function j(i,a,s,u,r,n){const c=y("PoemCard");return e(),t("section",null,[a[1]||(a[1]=o("div",{class:"top-banner"},[o("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[o("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),o("div",R,[(e(!0),t(g,null,f(n.visiblePoems,(h,m)=>(e(),w(c,{key:m,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),n.hasMorePoems?(e(),t("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:a[0]||(a[0]=(...h)=>n.loadMore&&n.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(e(),t("span",x,"Loading...")):(e(),t("span",M,"See more"))],8,B)):p("",!0)])}const H=d(A,[["render",j],["__scopeId","data-v-273ef390"]]),W=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"quotes/66.md","filePath":"quotes/66.md"}'),q={name:"quotes/66.md"},O=Object.assign(q,{setup(i){return(a,s)=>(e(),t("div",null,[b(H)]))}});export{W as __pageData,O as default};
