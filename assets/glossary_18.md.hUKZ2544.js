This volume, a source book for the study of traditional Chinese fiction criticism from the late sixteenth to the early twentieth centuries, presents translations of writings taken from the commentary editions of six of the most important novels of pre-modern China. These translations consist mainly of tu-fa, or \\"how-to-read\\" essays, which demonstrate sensitivity and depth of analysis both in the treatment of general problems concerning the reading of any work of fiction and in more focused discussions of particular compositional details in individual novels. The translations were produced by pioneers in the study of this form of fiction criticism in the West: Shuen-fu Lin, Andrew H. Plaks, David T. Roy, John C. Y. Wang, and Anthony C. Yu. Four introductory essays by Andrew H. Plaks and the editor address the historical background for this type of criticism, its early development, its formal features, recurrent terminology, and major interpretive strategies. A goal of this volume is to aid in the rediscovery of this traditional Chinese poetics of fiction and help eliminate some of the distortions encountered in the past by the imposition of Western theories of fiction on Chinese novels. Originally published in 1990. The Princeton Legacy Library uses the latest print-on-demand technology to again make available previously out-of-print books from the distinguished backlist of Princeton University Press. These editions preserve the original texts of these important books while presenting them in durable paperback and hardcover editions. The goal of the Princeton Legacy Library is to vastly increase access to the rich scholarly heritage found in the thousands of books published by Princeton University Press since its founding in 1905.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=xREABAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Blues For Mister Charlie","description":"In a small Southern town, a white man murders a black man, then throws his body in the weeds. With this act of violence--which is loosely based on the notorious 1955 killing of Emmett Till--James Baldwin launches an unsparing and at times agonizing probe of the wounds of race. For where once a white storekeeper could have shot a \\"boy\\" like Richard Henry with impunity, times have changed. And centuries of brutality and fear, patronage and contempt, are about to erupt in a moment of truth as devastating as a shotgun blast. In his award-winning play, Baldwin turns a murder and its aftermath into an inquest in which even the most well-intentioned whites are implicated--and in which even a killer receives his share of compassion.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=tcxWAAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Windows Client Administration 24seven","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=J6uBtAEACAAJ&dq=Windows+Client+Administration+24seven&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Specters","description":"Prodigiously influential, Jacques Derrida gave rise to a comprehensive rethinking of the basic concepts and categories of Western philosophy in the latter part of the twentieth century, with writings central to our understanding of language, meaning, identity, ethics and values.

Even at the age of six, lively, inquisitive Elizabeth Grace senses she s a child of privilege,  a lucky fish.  Soothing her worries by raiding the sugar box, she scampers up into the sheltering arms of the lilac-blooming syringa tree growing behind the family  s suburban Johannesburg home. Lizzie s closest ally and greatest love is her Xhosa nanny, Salamina. Deeper and more elemental than any traditional friendship, their fierce devotion to each other is charged and complicated by Lizzie s mother, who suffers from creeping melancholy, by the stresses of her father s medical practice, which is segregated by law, and by the violence, injustice, and intoxicating beauty of their country. In the social and racial upheavals of the 1960s, Lizzie s eyes open to the terror and inhumanity that paralyze all the nation s culturesXhosa, Zulu, Jew, English, Boer. Pass laws requiring blacks to carry permission papers for white areas and stringent curfews have briefly created an orderly statebut an anxious one. Yet Lizzie s home harbors its own set of rules, with hushed midnight gatherings, clandestine transactions, and the girl s special task of protecting Salamina s newborn childa secret that, because of the new rules, must never be mentioned outside the walls of the house. As the months pass, the contagious spirit of change sends those once underground into the streets to challenge the ruling authority. And when this unrest reaches a social and personal climax, the unthinkable will happen and forever change Lizzie s view of the world. When The Syringa Tree opened off-Broadway in 2001, theater critics and audiences alike embraced the play, and it won many awards. Pamela Gien has superbly deepened the story in this new novel, giving a personal voice to the horrors and hopes of her homeland. Written with lyricism, passion, and life-affirming redemption, this compelling story shows the healing of the heart of a young woman and the soul of a sundered nation.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=n9rkjRRC-3IC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Barry Lyndon","description":"First published in 1844, this is Thackeray's earliest substantial work of fiction and perhaps his most original.

He saw life as a spiritualjourney and healing as the total alignment withthat journey.Dr. Stone's understanding of the healing artsbegan with the study of Western medicine whichincluded structural manipulation, nutrition, andnatural therapies. He then journeyed throughoutEurope and the Far East studying different healingmodalities. In the Far East, he studied Ayurveda,(the traditional healing system of India), acupuncture,yoga, and meditation. In Europe, he studiedhomeopathy and Hermetic philosophy and visitedmany nature cure spas.Polarity Therapy is based on the premise thatwe are fields of pulsating life energy made up ofspecific frequencies known as the five elements:Ether, Air, Fire, Water, and Earth. Each elementrelates and flows in a balance of positive and negativeattractions arising from a neutral center. Whenour thoughts, emotions, and physical body are outof alignment with the energy necessary to meet alife challenge, an energy imbalance results. Theseimbalances may appear as physical, mental, andemotional discomfort or pain. Polarity teaches usthat this pain and discomfort is a signal for us tolearn, change, and realign our lives.An ongoing and dynamic balance of lifeenergy is our foundation for health and well-being.Polarity Therapy helps us to develop thisbalance by promoting the flexibility, spontaneity,creativity, and clarity necessary to meet the challengesof everyday life. Dr. Stone says, \\"Obstaclesare God's design to make man with a spine.\\"We must have challenges to grow spiritually.Meeting these challenges is a life-long processin which we learn to increase the depth of ourunderstanding and awareness and apply this toevery moment of our lives.A Polarity practitioner utilizes the tools ofbodywork, exercise, nutrition, and verbal guidanceto evaluate and balance life energy. Polarity bodyworkinvolves gentle rocking, stretching, and pressure-sensitive touch based on energy flow. Polarityexercises are easy stretching postures combiningsound, breath, and self-massage. Polarity nutritionviews food as energy and develops an ongoing,ever-changing, and creative nutritional awarenessrather than a rigid set of rules. Polarity verbalguidance is based on the assumption that \\"rightthinking\\" is the cornerstone of good health. Verbalprocesses involve understanding and feeling ouremotions, taking responsibility for our lives, andcreating life-enhancing thoughts.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=QWVivgAACAAJ&dq=Polarity+Therapy+Workbook&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Little City by the Lake (Little House)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=KDYBPwAACAAJ&dq=Little+City+by+the+Lake+(Little+House)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Origins of Islamic Jurisprudence: Meccan Fiqh Before the Classical Schools (Islamic History and Civilization)","description":"Based on a new source, this study reconstructs for the first time the early development of Islamic jurisprudence at Mecca and challenges the current view of scholarship concerning the origins of Islamic jurisprudence.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=aNDSwh9ftREC&dq=The+Origins+of+Islamic+Jurisprudence:+Meccan+Fiqh+Before+the+Classical+Schools+(Islamic+History+and+Civilization)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Spirit Sickness","description":"The brutal slaying of a Navajo cop and his wife stirs talk of supernatural beings and human passions as BIA officer Emmett Parker and FBI Special Agent Anna Turnipseed investigate the crime.

How much of human behavior and development can be attributed to biology and how much to the environment? Can either be said to \\"determine\\" human development? And what are the implications of each view for society? In this important study, a noted developmental psychologist contributes to this debate by confronting the difficult issue of \\"doctrines\\" of human development and the consequences for society of deriving political programs and public policy from them. Beginning with the premise that scientific ideas are not neutral but can be used for either good or evil, Richard Lerner considers the recent history of one such idea, biological determinism, which at times has had the backing of respected scientists, intellectuals, and political leaders. During this century, biological determinism has been coupled with political philosophies that hold that some people are inherently better than others. This has meant that certain groups of people--Jews, Blacks, Native Americans, women--have been stigmatized because of supposedly innate, even \\"biological,\\" differences, with sometimes disastrous consequences. The most notorious instance was Nazi Germany, where \\"racial science,\\" given legitimacy by the scientific community, became a cornerstone of the Nazi \\"Final Solution.\\" Meanwhile, theories of biological determinism continue to find adherents within the scientific community. Konrad Lorenz, who was awarded a Nobel Prize in 1973, was a critical figure in the development of the most recent manifestation of biological determinism--sociobiology. Lerner examines the work of Lorenz and current sociobiologists and the implications of their claims for modern society. He fears that biological determinism may again be co-opted to serve the political agenda of today's reactionary politicians. In fact, Lerner notes, sociobiologists have had to face the fact that organizations such as the fascist National Front party in Britain and its counterparts in France and the United States have selectively seized upon sociobiology to fuel their notions of genetically superior and inferior races.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=GMh-swEACAAJ&dq=Final+Solutions:+Biology,+Prejudice,+and+Genocide&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The California Coven Project","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=WjRhAAAACAAJ&dq=The+California+Coven+Project&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Underground Woman: My Four Years as a New York City Subway Conductor (Labor And Social Change)","description":"A white woman in a mostly minority male workplace, Swerdlow helped edit a newsletter, Hell on Wheels, and tried to organize for better working conditions, confronting the Kafkaesque Transit Authority bureaucracy and complacent union leadership.

Living energy is personal and within our conscious control, and by learning about it, we can use it to transform our life into vibrant and meaningful expressions of who we really are. Consciousness is purely energetic and therefore difficult to quantify in mechanistic terms. It is the characteristic of living energy and is the foundation of awareness. Consciousness is the thread running through all life. Living Energy is an introduction to the process of mystic spirituality. The reader is encouraged to attain a deep and meaningful connection to the divine with expanded awareness. The principles given in this book are equally relevant to the novice and the advanced practitioner. Robert explains how we may reveal our hidden potential by shifting our perception away from what is customary and comfortable to open the doors to greater spiritual awareness.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=L8PSoAEACAAJ&dq=Get+the+Edge+:+A+7+Day+Program+to+Transform+Your+Life+-+A+Video+Introduction&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Squantum, in the State of Massachusetts","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=RFtmPQAACAAJ&dq=Squantum,+in+the+State+of+Massachusetts&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Ice Bear: In the Steps of the Polar Bear","description":"Follow the path of the magnificent polar bear as it strives to survive in an age-old Arctic habitat threatened by global warming.

But when Danny's family falls on hard times, moving from their comfortable home in Brooklyn to Manhattan's squalid Lower East Side, he is forced to leave his carefree childhood behind. Facing poverty and daily encounters with his violent, anti-Semitic neighbors, Danny must fight both inside and outside the ring just to survive. As his boxing becomes legendary in the city's seedy underworld, packed with wiseguys and loose women, everyone seems to want a hand in Danny's success. Robbins's colorful, fast-talking characters evoke the rough streets of Depression-era New York City. Ronnie, a prostitute ashamed of how far she's fallen and desperately in need of friendship; Sam, a slick bookie who wants to profit from Danny's boxing talent; and Nellie, a beautiful but lonely girl who refuses to believe Danny is beyond redemption -- each of whom has a different vision of Danny's future -- will help steer his rocky course.

Although traditional theology and church practice concentrate on providing forgiveness for shameful behavior, recent scholarship has discovered the crucial relevance of social shame evoked by mental status, adversity, slavery, abuse, illness, grief and defeat. Anthropologists, sociologists, and psychologists have discovered that unresolved social shame is related to racial and social prejudice, to bullying, crime, genocide, narcissism, post-traumatic stress and other forms of toxic behavior. Eleven leaders in this research participated in a conference on The Shame Factor, sponsored by St. Mark's United Methodist Church in Lincoln, NE in October 2010.

More than any other anthropological subdiscipline, economic anthropology constantly questions and debates the practical motives of people as they go about their daily lives. Tracing the history of the dialogue between anthropology and economics, Richard Wilk and Lisa Cliggett move economic anthropology beyond the narrow concerns of earlier debates and place the field directly at the center of current issues in the social sciences. They focus on the unique strengths of economic anthropology as a meeting place for symbolic and materialist approaches and for understanding human beings as both practical and cultural. In so doing, the authors argue for the wider relevance of economic anthropology to applied anthropology and identify other avenues for interaction with economics, sociology, and other social and behavioral sciences. The second edition of Economies and Cultures contains an entirely new chapter on gifts and exchange that critically approaches the new literature in this area, as well as a thoroughly updated bibliography and guide for students for finding case studies in economic anthropology.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=73jQswEACAAJ&dq=Economies+And+Cultures:+Foundations+Of+Economic+Anthropology&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Martin Buber","description":"From the prizewinning Jewish Lives series, the first major biography in English in over thirty years of the seminal modern Jewish thinker Martin Buber An authority on the twentieth-century philosopher Martin Buber (1878-1965), Paul Mendes-Flohr offers the first major biography in English in thirty years of this seminal modern Jewish thinker. The book is organized around several key moments, such as his sudden abandonment by his mother when he was a child of three, a foundational trauma that, Mendes-Flohr shows, left an enduring mark on Buber's inner life, attuning him to the fragility of human relations and the need to nurture them with what he would call a \\"dialogical attentiveness.\\" Buber's philosophical and theological writings, most famously I and Thou, made significant contributions to religious and Jewish thought, philosophical anthropology, biblical studies, political theory, and Zionism. In this accessible new biography, Mendes-Flohr situates Buber's life and legacy in the intellectual and cultural life of German Jewry as well as in the broader European intellectual life of the first half of the twentieth century.

Patterson and Colonel Jim Corbett, who stalked legendary man-eaters through the silent darkness on opposite sides of the world; men like Karamojo Bell, acknowledged as the greatest elephant hunter of all time; men like the valiant Sasha Siemel, who tracked killer jaguars though the Matto Grosso armed only with a spear. With an authenticity gained by having shared the experiences he writes of, Capstick eloquently recreates the acrid taste of terror in the mouth of a man whose gun has jammed as a lion begins his charge, the exhilaration of tracking and finding a long-sought prey, the bravery and even nobility of performing under circumstances of primitive and savage stress, with death all around in the silent places of the wilderness.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=QwLqP0cjh3QC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Making Bread at Midnight","description":"Winner of the Booker prize and twice winner of the Booker of Bookers, Midnight's Children is \\"one of the most important books to come out of the English-speaking world in this generation\\" (New York Review of Books). Reissued for the 40th anniversary of the original publication--with a new introduction from the author--Salman Rushdie's widely acclaimed novel is a masterpiece in literature. Saleem Sinai is born at the stroke of midnight on August 15, 1947, the very moment of India s independence. Greeted by fireworks displays, cheering crowds, and Prime Minister Nehru himself, Saleem grows up to learn the ominous consequences of this coincidence. His every act is mirrored and magnified in events that sway the course of national affairs; his health and well-being are inextricably bound to those of his nation; his life is inseparable, at times indistinguishable, from the history of his country. Perhaps most remarkable are the telepathic powers linking him with India s 1,000 other  midnight s children,  all born in that initial hour and endowed with magical gifts. This novel is at once a fascinating family saga and an astonishing evocation of a vast land and its peoplea brilliant incarnation of the universal human comedy. Midnight s Children stands apart as both an epochal work of fiction and a brilliant performance by one of the great literary voices of our time.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=NKzepmTUipEC&dq=Making+Bread+at+Midnight&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Cases in Contemporary Strategy Analysis 2e","description":"Robert M.

It is only in this present moment, Sufi teachings reveal, that we can connect with the Divine, and the Divine can live through us. Kabir Helminski is one of the world's most recognized teachers of Sufism. Named one of the \\"500 Most Influential Muslims\\" in the world by Georgetown University and the Royal Strategic Studies Center, Helminski and his teachings are touchstones for the growth in interest in Sufism, and his books have been translated around the world. In Living Presence, Helminski lays out the basic principles of Sufism, and how these ideas can lead to the experience of presence. In this inspiring work, readers will learn how to cultivate presence in their lives through: * Finding a balance between the outer stimuli of the world and our inner reactions to them * Harnessing faithfulness and gracefulness * Learning about the parallels between ancient spiritual wisdom and modern psychological knowledge * Meditation and contemplation to discover more meaning in daily life With unique clarity, this book describes how presence can be developed to vastly improve our lives. Drawing on the work of the beloved Sufi poet, Rumi, as well as traditional material and personal experience, this book integrates the ancient wisdom of Sufism with the needs of contemporary life. Completely revised and updated for its 25th anniversary, this edition of Living Presence offers a wisdom that is both universal and practical.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ndrEDgAAQBAJ&dq=Living+Presence&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Cocaine: Effects on the Developing Brain (Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=MAXZzQEACAAJ&dq=Cocaine:+Effects+on+the+Developing+Brain+(Annals+of+the+New+York+Academy+of+Sciences)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"StarCraft (Alternity Sci-Fi Roleplaying, StarCraft Edition)","description":"Understand Video Games as Works of Science Fiction and Interactive Stories Science Fiction Video Games focuses on games that are part of the science fiction genre, rather than set in magical milieux or exaggerated versions of our own world.

David Van Heemst contends that school choice will give every parent, including poor ones, a voucher to select schools. Poor children will have the opportunity to attend the finest schools, and will have a major hurdle in their path, a poor education, removed. Building on a twenty-year tradition of jurisprudence, the U.S. Supreme Court decided in July 2002 that there is no Establishment Clause violation in a well-designed system of school choice. The evidence from the small scale choice programs in Milwaukee and Cleveland suggests that not only do poor children benefit by maintaining or increasing their standardized test scores but also that families become empowered. Many polls demonstrate that not only poor parents favor school choice but that many middle and upper class Americans do too. As more parents get the opportunity to select their children's schools, other parents will demand the same opportunity. Poor children will be the primary beneficiaries in a system of school choice. Schools and teachers will have the freedom to design curricula and methods targeted to meet the needs of every child. Not one child will be required to attend a substandard school merely due to economic status. Justice requires that we evaluate systems and societies based upon how the least of us is treated. Justice demands that our K-12 system be transformed to make it similar to our university system so that a child's parent may select any accredited school with a voucher. The educational challenges of poor children have been well-documented in this book and Van Heemst offers a tangible solution.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=wC7xwAEACAAJ&dq=Empowering+the+Poor:+Why+Justice+Requires+School+Choice&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Michel Foucault","description":"Study of the intersection of history and philosophy as it relates to recent French political change, evidenced in essays concerning popular justice, power struggles, and the history of sexuality","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Aqf309sk_EsC&dq=Michel+Foucault&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Brain Tumors (Diseases and Disorders)","description":"In cancer, cells grow and divide without normal controls, causing abnormal growths called tumors.

THE ORIGINAL VERSION WAS PUBLISHED IN 1972. THIS VERSION DOES NOT CONTAIN ADDITIONAL OR NEW INFORMATION. The author of this eye-opening expose is a scheduled jet airline captain, as well as a fighter pilot in the Air Force Reserve, with twenty years of professional flying experience. Writing from the standpoint of a view of a pilot, he covers every aspect of commercial aviation and brings the reader to the conclusion that it is a much more perilous means of transportation than generally suspected. You will learn how poorly equipped most of our airports are; how the airlines write their own safety regulations and then succeed in evading even those requirements. You will find out what goes on on the flight deck and the dangers inherent in even the most routine shuttle flights. The author examines crash investigations, he take you on spine-tingling reconstructions of disasters you probably read about, and he reveals the often shocking truth of what really went wrong as opposed to what you may have read in the papers. ********** \\"Safety Last by Captain Brian Power-Waters courageously describes real life in the airline industry and sounds the alarm for urgently needed reforms. It documents the abysmal performance of the Federal Aviation Administration in enforcing air safety standards and the shocking insensitivity of many airline officials. This book should be read by any airline passenger, executive, regulator or legislator who is concerned about protecting human life and safety in air travel.\\" Reuben Robertson III, Director of the Aviation Consumer Action Project and Aide to Ralph Nader ********** \\"Captain Power-Waters unloads his list of complaints against commercial aviation without hedging and draws a frightening picture of chaos, carelessness and petty internecine warfare within the industry.

Captain Power-Waters hits with authority.\\" Publishers Weekly ********** \\"Fortunately, most of the flying public is unaware that many in airline management place a greater emphasis on making profits than on adhering to safety regulations. I compliment you on providing us with a damn fine insight into many of the problems which have been either overlooked or purposely evaded. I strongly concur in your book's closing observation that the real key to airline safety must be through a better utilization of the expertise of the pilot and the controller, who know flying best. These men are indebted to you for your daring to buck the tide, and call it as you see it.\\" From a letter to Captain Power-Waters from John F. Leyden, President, Professional Air Traffic Controllers Organization ********** \\"Safety Last is a fascinating and sobering journey into the realities of commercial aviation. It vividly describes the hazards of non-professionalism in our industry. The reader will also see the critical importance of professional aircraft maintenance along with the need for a more imaginative and aggressive FAA establishment. . . .

A novel of life and survival across the ages\\" PHILIPPE SANDS, author of East West Street Amid the turbulence of 20th century Lviv, meet four generations of women from the same fractious family, living beneath one roof and each striving to find their way across the decades of upheaval in an ever-shifting city. First there is Great-Granma, tiny and terrifying, shaped by a life of exile, hardship and doomed love, now fighting to keep her iron grip on the lives of her daughter, granddaughter and great-granddaughter. Then there is Aba, arthritic but devoted; cowed and despised by her mother, her one chance of happiness thwarted and her hopes of studying painting crushed. Thirdly, Marianna, the brilliant opera star: bold, beautiful and a fearless crusader for Ukrainian independence, who is shot during a demonstration and whose life and martyrdom casts a shadow upon the young life of the fourth and final woman, her daughter. More important even than these four women though is the character of the city of Lviv (or Lw w, or Lvov, depending on the point in history).

When politics catches up with the global whirlwind of shifting economic capabilities, the international system will look very different than it does today. This book explores how the momentous dislocations of economic power in the world--the burgeoning might of Asia, the unification of Europe, the relative decline of the United States--will reshape global security issues. The authors believe that the United States is especially unprepared for a 21st century in which the control of markets and technology is a principal battleground. They demonstrate how America's loss of industrial leadership is slowly but surely eroding its influence abroad, and how America will soon have to accept the kinds of constraints it has been so accustomed to imposing on others. Representing over six years of research by seven scholars, this timely analysis also goes beyond the discussion of America's decline to examine how the emergence of regional trading blocs may carve out new international security arrangements. The authors warn that a natural extension of the postwar security system is only one possibility. The emerging distribution of economic capabilities suggests at least two others, each of which would reconceive the very character of security, redefine the international power game, and re-situate the players.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=dxLociyZLjYC&dq=The+Highest+Stakes:+The+Economic+Foundations+of+the+Next+Security+System+(Berkeley+Roundtable+on+the+International+Economy)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The New Teen Titans: The Judas Contract","description":"\\"New Teen Titans created by Marv Wolfman and George Paerez; Raven created by Marv Wolfman and George Paerez; Brother Blood created by Marv Wolfman and George Paerez.\\"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=prbTAQAACAAJ&dq=The+New+Teen+Titans:+The+Judas+Contract&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Kite in the Park: My Cloth Book (My Cloth Books)","description":"A wordless picture book on cloth pages featuring objects found in the park, including a tree, dog, and ball.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=bpf7AQAACAAJ&dq=Kite+in+the+Park:+My+Cloth+Book+(My+Cloth+Books)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Ford Model A album;: A pictorial history of the fabulous Model A Ford, from beginning to end","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=3MMRnwEACAAJ&dq=Ford+Model+A+album%3B:+A+pictorial+history+of+the+fabulous+Model+A+Ford,+from+beginning+to+end&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"How to Take Great Photographs With Any Camera","description":"Now refreshed with current technologies and terms, and more than 25 percent new images and an all-new chapter, this bestselling guide shows readers how to shoot great photographs with any type of camera.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=drQOfkvxSd8C&dq=How+to+Take+Great+Photographs+With+Any+Camera&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Gift of A.D.D.: Secrets for Transforming Liabilities Into Possibilities For Parents and Teachers","description":"The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists is the premier public resource on scientific and technological developments that impact global security.

Governments no longer see themselves as sole suppliers of social services, frequently opting for partnerships with the private sector. Efficiency and choice have entered the language of the planning and implementation units of Africa's line ministries, while privatization is no longer the controversial subject it was a decade ago. There have also been moves towards more open and democratic governments. Reforming Africa's Institutions looks at the extent to which reforms undertaken in Sub-Saharan Africa in recent years have enhanced institutional capacities across the breadth of government. To what extent have reforms been internalized and defended by governments? The authors also look specifically at the impact of public sector reforms on these economies and pose the question whether 'ownership can be attained when countries continue to be heavily dependent on external support. The volume is presented in three parts. The first focuses on the issue of reform ownership; on the issues of governance, the political economy of reform ownership, and the contradictions inherent in using aid as an instrument for enhancing domestic reform ownership. Part two examines the nature of incentives in the African civil service and the reforms undertaken in recent years to raise public sector efficiency in Africa. The third part discusses issues related to institutional capabilities in Africa and how they have been affected by the reforms undertaken in the 1990s, including privatization and movement towards political pluralism.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=wBPaA7alTPUC&dq=Reforming+Africa%27s+Institutions:+Ownership,+Incentives,+and+Capabilities&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Economic Value of Information","description":"The Scope of This Book Popular culture often refers to current times as the Information Age, classifying many of the technological, economic, and social changes of the past four deca:les under the rubric of the Information Revolution. But similar to the Iron Age be fore it, the description \\"Information Age\\" suggests the idea that information is a commodity in the marketplace, one that can be bought and sold as an item of value. When people seek to acquire information yet complain about information overload, and when organizations invest millions in information systems yet are unable to pinpoint the benefits, perhaps this reflects a difficulty with the as sessment of the value of this commodity relative to its cost, an inability to dis cern the useless from the useful from the wasteful. The Information Age requires us to assess the value, cost, and gain from information, and to do it from several different viewpoints. At the most elementary level is the individual who perceives a need for in formation-her current state of knowledge is insufficient and something needs to be understood, or clarified, or updated, or forecast. There is a universe of al ternative information sources from which to choose, some more informative than others, some more costly than others. The individual's problem is to evalu ate the alternatives and choose which sources to access. An organization comprising many information-seeking employees and agents must take a somewhat broader viewpoint.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=XgBNzh6cXD0C&dq=The+Economic+Value+of+Information&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Institutes of Elenctic Theology Vol. 2","description":"Francis Turretin's 17th century classic contrasts Reformed understandings of Scripture with conflicting theological perspectives, particularly Roman Catholic, Arminian, and Socinian.

In this biographical dictionary, research devoted specifically to the reading habits of 19th century individuals who shaped Western culture is brought together for the first time. While giving prominent coverage to literary and political figures, the volume's 270 entries also include musicians, painters, educators, and explorers. Each entry includes brief biographical information, a concise summary of literary influences on the subject, and clear direction for further research. The book provides a practical tool for scholars wishing to trace the reading experience of important Western cultural figures. Subjects were selected from the people most responsible for the cultural development of Europe, Britain and the British Empire, and the Americas between 1800 and 1914. Although selective, the sample of 270 figures is substantial enough to suggest broad, cross-cultural habits and effects, enabling scholars to better understand the relationship between reading and culture. In an introductory essay, Powell explores the patterns and relationships that can be discerned from the entries. The first of three anticipated volumes, the book is an important step forward in researching the role of reading in cultural development.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=3N3uj_wo-_kC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Nineteenth-Century English","description":"Traces the transformation of the English language through the nineteenth-century economic and cultural landscape.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=1S4KWR61q28C&dq=Nineteenth-Century+English&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Christmas Fairy Things To Make And Do","description":"Offers twenty-eight craft projects for budding sewers who want to make their own fairies and fairy accessories.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=x4qGNE1AdJQC&dq=Christmas+Fairy+Things+To+Make+And+Do&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Creative Curriculum for Infants & Toddlers","description":"The Creative Curriculum comes alive!

The Washington Post Book World One rainy morning in 1871 in lower Manhattan, Martin Pemberton a freelance writer, sees in a passing stagecoach several elderly men, one of whom he recognizes as his supposedly dead and buried father. While trying to unravel the mystery, Pemberton disappears, sending McIlvaine, his employer, the editor of an evening paper, in pursuit of the truth behind his freelancer s fate. Layer by layer, McIlvaine reveals a modern metropolis surging with primordial urges and sins, where the Tweed Ring operates the city for its own profit and a conspicuously self-satisfied nouveau-riche ignores the poverty and squalor that surrounds them.

One of his most interesting chapters gives a practical-minded consideration to the probable future of Tibet.' New York Times Paul Brunton was one of a very small number of his generation to travel in India and Tibet so extensively at a time when very few were doing so with such insight and discernment. His journalistic skills produced magnificent descriptions of the snowy peaks and high-desert landscapes of the Himalayan region, but it was the lessons he learned from the holy men he met on his journey that transformed him into one of the great interpreters of the East. In this magnificent spirituality classic, he explains that we all need 'oases of calm in a world of storm', no matter what era we are living in, and that to retreat from our everyday lives for a while is not weakness but strength. By taking the trouble to discover the deep silence within us we will find the benefits of being linked to an 'infinite power, an infinite wisdom, an infinite goodness'. A Hermit In The Himalayas is a fascinating blend of travel writing and profound spiritual experience.

Instead, it does something that virtually no other Elements book has ever done it tells you flat-out which settings to use, when to use them, and why. If you re looking for one of those  tell-me-everything-about-the-Unsharp-Mask-filter  books, this isn t it. You can grab any other Elements book on the shelf, because they all do that. Instead, this book gives you the inside tips and tricks of the trade for organizing, correcting, editing, sharpening, retouching, and printing your photos like a pro. You ll be absolutely amazed at how easy and effective these techniques are once you know the secrets. LEARN HOW THE PROS DO IT Each year we train thousands of digital photographers and, almost without exception, they have the same questions and face the same problems that s exactly what we cover in this book. You ll learn: The real secrets of how the pros retouch portraits How to color correct any photo without breaking a sweat (you ll be amazed at how the pros do it!) How to use Camera Raw for processing not only RAW photos, but JPEGs and TIFFs, too! (And you ll learn why so many pros like it best because it s faster and easier) The sharpening techniques the pros really use (there s an entire chapter just on this!) How to deal with common digital camera image problems, including removing noise and avoiding halos The most requested photographic special effects, and much more!

The Junkers Ju 188 was the epitome of mid-war German twin-engined aircraft design, representing the enhancement of an earlier type and incorporating increased performance and technological sophistication. As part of the 1939 'Bomber B' programme, it was intended as a replacement for the Ju 88 and He 111 medium bombers, taking advantage of uprated Jumo and BMW engines and incorporating a radically redesigned cockpit area with all-round visibility for high-speed bombing, torpedo-bomber carrying, FuG 200 radar, and camera-equipped reconnaissance operations. What emerged, from the autumn of 1943, was a sophisticated bomber and reconnaissance aircraftand intended nightfighter. After operational trials, the Ju 188 equipped three bomber Geschwader and several long-range reconnaissance Staffeln in the East and Italy, conducting operations over Britain and the Western Front as well as Russia and the Mediterranean. This comprehensive study charts the design, development, and deployment of an advanced aircraft which was ultimately overshadowed by improvements to the aeroplane it was designed to replace. Supported by specially commissioned illustrations and contemporary photography, this is the essential guide to the Junkers Ju 188.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=v_NfEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Hutchinson Factfinder","description":"Presents information on science, technology, history, religion, the arts, sports, the countries of the world, and other subjects","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=RTkOAQAAMAAJ&dq=Hutchinson+Factfinder&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"An explorer's adventures in Tibet,","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=2mYdAAAAMAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Evidence Under the Rules: Text, Cases, and Problems","description":"Buy a new version of this Connected Casebook and receive access to the online e-book, practice questions from your favorite study aids, and an outline tool on CasebookConnect, the all in one learning solution for law school students.

Mormons and evangelicals don't often get along very well, at least not once they begin to discuss their religious beliefs. They often set about trying to convert one another, considering the faith the other holds as defective in some critical way. Unfortunately, much of what they say about one another simply isn't true. False stereotypes abound on both sides, preventing genuine and helpful communication. Having discovered this sad state of affairs, Craig Blomberg, a committed evangelical scholar, and Stephen Robinson, a committed Mormon scholar, set out to listen to one another and to ferret out the real agreements and disagreements between them. In the conversation that develops, you will read what each believes about key theological issues--the nature and bounds of Scripture, the nature of God and deification, the person of Christ and the Trinity, and the essentials of salvation--and see how they interact with one another. What they agree on may surprise you. Though this book does not sweep differences under the rug, it is meant to help Mormons and evangelicals know and tell the truth about one another. It does not expect to end evangelistic efforts from either side. In fact, it may help to promote more effective communication because it can help to get rid of misrepresentations from both sides. In the end, however, you will be able to judge for yourself just how wide the divide between them is.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=v78HDTHd9nwC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Blue Tyson","description":"The sequel to 'Rynosseros', this collection of science-fiction short stories set in Australia's distant future concerns the exploits of Tom Tyson, legendary captain of the sand ship 'Rynosseros'.

Indeed, new research continues to reveal previously unsuspected aspects of his life and career; while at the same time hoary old myths, like his wearing a piratical style eye-patch, doggedly persist. In this book an author who is a master of the subject sets out to answer any question about Nelson likely to be raised, either by a casual reference or in a more detailed study of the navy, the wars, or the social history of the period. Entries cover people, ships, places and events associated with the man, and extend to contemporary issues like changing interpretations of his actions and motivation. Arranged alphabetically and fully cross-referenced, every subject is accorded enough length for proper discussion, and each is followed by a suggested reading list for those wanting to pursue the topic further. The book concludes with appendices devoted to a full bibliography, a chronology of Nelson's life and times, and a selection of significant documents, some previously unpublished. Not only an unrivalled companion to every aspect of his career, The Nelson Encyclopedia is also an ideal introduction to the world of the Royal Navy at the pinnacle of its success. Already a success in hardback, this new paperback edition will coincide with the well-publicized events to celebrate the Trafalgar bicentenary.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=zX8gPwAACAAJ&dq=The+Nelson+Encyclopedia:+People,+Places,+Battles,+Ships,+Myths,+Mistresses,+Memorials&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Star Wars: The Ultimate Visual Guide","description":"A guide to the \\"Star Wars\\" saga provides an explanation of the characters and how they relate to each other and details the movies' storylines.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=lxJYtEWx9IUC&dq=Star+Wars:+The+Ultimate+Visual+Guide&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Winning the War Within","description":"Using his own story as a poignant, evocative illustration of God's grace and healing, Jason Vallotton--with a contribution from his father, bestselling author Kris Vallotton--invites you to reframe your understanding of pain in terms of redemption.

Piece by piece she reveals the story of her ancestor the indomitable Susannah Watson who, trapped in the crowded filthy slums of Nottingham, stole because she could not bear to see her children starving'. Separated forever from her husband and four children, she was transported to Australia for 14 years. She endured the convict system at its worst, yet emerged triumphant to die in her bed aged 83 singing Rock of Ages'. Babette Smith reconstructs the lives of the women from the Princess Royal from fragments of information in shipping lists, official records, newspapers and court transcripts. Her research overturns stereotypes of women convicts as drunken whores and criminals. Caught in an England convulsed by change, they become the unwitting and unwilling pioneers of a new land. Many proved to be resourceful and resilient, taking advantage of the opportunities offered by a new society. First published two decades ago, A Cargo of Women became a bestseller and remains one of the most valuable accounts of convict life in Australia.

Penguin Books is proud to now be the sole publisher of Oil!, the classic 1927 novel by Upton Sinclair. After writing The Jungle, his scathing indictment of the meatpacking industry, Sinclair turned his sights on the early days of the California oil industry in a highly entertaining story featuring a cavalcade of characters including senators, oil magnets, Hollywood film starlets, and a crusading evangelist. This lively and panoramic book, which was recently cited by David Denby in the New Yorker as being Sinclair s  most readable  novel, is now the inspiration for the Paramount Vantage major motion picture, There Will Be Blood. It is the long-awaited film from Paul Thomas Anderson, one of the most admired filmmakers working today whose previous movies, Boogie Nights and Magnolia were both multiple Academy Award nominees. The movie stars Oscar-winner Daniel Day-Lewis (Gangs of New York, My Left Foot) and Paul Dano (Little Miss Sunshine). Paramount Vantage will be releasing the film in New York and Los Angeles on December 26, 2007 and go nationwide in January. This is the same company responsible for Babel and A Mighty Heart and the current releases, Into the Wild, Margot at the Wedding, and The Kite Runner.

In this beautifully illustrated and lively work, Auerbach surveys two centuries of editing, censoring, and distorting Austen s life and writings. Auerbach samples Austen s flamboyant, risqu  adolescent works featuring heroines who get drunk, lie, steal, raise armies, and throw rivals out of windows. She demonstrates that Austen constantly tested and improved her skills by setting herself a new challenge in each of her six novels. In addition, Auerbach considers Austen s final irreverent writings, discusses her tragic death at the age of forty-one, and ferrets out ridiculous modern adaptations and illustrations, including ads, cartoons, book jackets, newspaper articles, plays, and films from our own time. An appendix reprints a ground-breaking article that introduced Mark Twain s \\"Jane Austen,\\" an unfinished and unforgettable essay in which Twain and Austen enter into mortal combat.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ainXQ5ljQcEC&dq=Searching+for+Jane+Austen&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Yesterday's Warrior","description":"In a memoir both heartbreaking and disturbing, Heather Harrison gives us the account of her teenage years with grit and unflinching honesty.

P. Lovecraft had no idea that he would one day be celebrated as the godfather of modern horror. A dark visionary, his work would influence an entire generation of writers, including Stephen King, Clive Barker, Neil Gaiman, and Anne Rice. Now, the most important tales of this distinctive American storyteller have been collected in a single volume by National Book Award-winning author Joyce Carol Oates. In tales that combine the nineteenth-century gothic sensibility of Edgar Allan Poe with a uniquely daring internal vision, Lovecraft fuses the supernatural and mundane into a terrifying, complex, and exquisitely realized vision, foretelling a psychically troubled century to come. Set in a meticulously described New England landscape, here are harrowing stories that explore the total collapse of sanity beneath the weight of chaotic events stories of myth and madness that release monsters into our world. Lovecraft's universe is a frightening shadow world where reality and nightmare intertwine, and redemption can come only from below.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ab2OkGJYrJQC&dq=The+Library+of+America+Collection:+2012+Edition&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Teaching Language Arts: A Student- and Response-Centered Classroom (Book Alone) (5th Edition)","description":"The best selling language arts text in the market, Language Arts: Patterns of Practice continues to ground language arts instruction in the contemporary classroom.

Inscribe in your hearts what anthroposophy should be: a preparation for the great epoch of humanity which lies ahead of us.  Rudolf Steiner s teachings of Christ  and in particular what he refers to as the  Christ impulse   are unique. Christ, he says, is an objective universal force, existing independently of Christian churches and confessions, and working for the whole of humanity. The impulse that Christ brought to earth acts for the advancement of all people, irrespective of religion, creed or race. Speaking in Berlin whilst still a representative of the largely eastern-oriented Theosophical Society, Rudolf Steiner presents multifaceted perspectives on the Christ impulse, based on his independent spiritual research: from the vast cycles of time preceding Christ s incarnation and the preparation for his coming, to the actual physical embodiment of Christ in Palestine, in Jesus of Nazareth, some two thousand years ago. Steiner also describes how Christ will influence the future development of the earth and humanity. In his opening lecture, Rudolf Steiner discusses the nature of the Bodhisattvas and their role in relation to Christ and human evolution. The Bodhisattvas are the great teachers of humanity, incarnating in human form during their passage through the various cycles of cultural development, and are intimately involved in preparing the work of the Christ impulse. In other lectures Steiner addresses subjects as diverse as the Sermon on the Mount in relation to the development of the faculty of conscience, and the current duality of male and female (microcosm) and its correspondence in the cosmos (macrocosm). The latter phenomenon is related to initiation within the Germanic and Egyptian mysteries, which reach their higher unity in Christian initiation. Among the myriad other themes that emerge here are: the introduction of the  I  (or self) in human development and its essential connection to Christ; the preparation of the Christ impulse through the Jahveh religion and the law of Moses; the meaning of the Ten Commandments; and the new clairvoyance in relation to the appearance of Christ in the etheric.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=lg_OBAAAQBAJ&dq=The+Christ+impulse+and+the+development+of+the+ego-consciousness:+A+course+of+seven+lectures--&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Architecture and Politics in Germany, 1918-1945 (Revised Edition)","description":"The fascinating history of the twentieth century's most successful experiment in mass housing While the work of Frank Lloyd Wright, Richard Neutra, and their contemporaries frequently influences our ideas about house design at the midcentury, most Americans during this period lived in homes built by little-known builders who also served as developers of the communities. Often dismissed as \\"little boxes, made of ticky-tacky,\\" the tract houses of America's postwar suburbs represent the twentieth century s most successful experiment in mass housing. Houses for a New World is the first comprehensive history of this uniquely American form of domestic architecture and urbanism. Between 1945 and 1965, more than thirteen million houses most of them in new ranch and split-level styles were constructed on large expanses of land outside city centers, providing homes for the country s rapidly expanding population. Focusing on twelve developments in the suburbs of Boston, Philadelphia, Chicago, and Los Angeles, Barbara Miller Lane tells the story of the collaborations between builders and buyers, showing how both wanted houses and communities that espoused a modern way of life informal, democratic, multiethnic, and devoted to improving the lives of their children. The resulting houses differed dramatically from both the European International Style and older forms of American domestic architecture. Based on a decade of original research, and accompanied by hundreds of historical images, plans, and maps, this book presents an entirely new interpretation of the American suburb. The result is a fascinating history of houses and developments that continue to shape how tens of millions of Americans live.

Mutiny, the recent disastrous losses in South Carolina at Camden and Charleston, and Benedict Arnold's betrayal called General George Washington's leadership into question. Faced with the possibility of either a crushing defeat or a brilliant victory, Washington's loyalty to the fledgling United States compelled him to make a bold, offensive stroke in the late summer of 1781. In less than a month, he marched the combined American and French armies to Yorktown, Virginia-nearly 450 miles south of their encampment at New York-to face the might of the British army. Through a riveting mixture of fact and dialogue, noted author Donald T. Phillips chronicles the remarkable events of the Siege of Yorktown. From dramatic artillery assaults to the celebrated American and French attacks and, finally, to the incredible British surrender, \\"On the Wing of Speed\\" delivers a thrilling tale of courage, strength, and devotion. \\"Extraordinary. Brilliant. Don Phillips does more than take the reader to the scene; he renders us participants in the experience. \\"On the Wing of Speed\\" is a compelling read for all Americans who want to understand how the United States was born.\\" -Admiral James M.

Hindenburg Line)","description":"The Hindenburg Line, or Siegfriedstellung, achieved almost mythical status in the minds of the British public: the strongest defence system the world had then seen, scientifically designed by fortification experts with only one aim, to keep at bay the British Army. So pleased and delighted were the British that church bells were rung when the Line was pierced at Cambrai in November 1917. The new wonder-weapon, the Tank, had shown itself to be capable of great deeds and British Generals were seen to be capable of showing the Germans what Tommy could do when properly organised. The initial elation was followed by disappointment as the Germans fought back and the Hindenburg defences were retaken when the Germans used \\"defence-in-depth\\" and \\"elastic-defence\\", both new concepts to the British who were to learn from their mistakes. The British were to witness triumph and joy again, when, towards the end of the Great War, the Hindenburg Line was to be broken by men from the Midlands. This book examines the reasons for the German's decision to fall back to a strong defence line while their Navy starved Britain into submission, and the \\"burnt earth\\" policy of devastation in the area evacuated. The design and layout of the Hindenburg Line, and the Battles for its possession in 1917 and 1918, are given: with numerous maps covering different sectors and the struggles for each village and farm, together with the part played by many British Regiments. The maps contain information on how to find all remaining vestiges of both German and British defences in the region, most of which are rarely visited and many of which have not been seen by British eyes for many years. No book since the Great War has examined this area in such detail, nor has any single account contained so much for the battlefield visitor to see. The sites of individual acts of bravery, including the winning of many Victoria Crosses are featured, and existing locations of battle lines, headquarters, artillery observation and machine gun posts are also included, together with an absorbing narrative which also guides the armchair reader.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=m9CkAwAAQBAJ&dq=Cambrai:+Hindenburg+Line+(Battleground+Europe.+Hindenburg+Line)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Louis Armstrong: The Offstage Story of Satchmo","description":"One of the most well-known and loved musicians of all time, Louis \\"Satchmo\\" Armstrong is an American jazz legend.

In this study, Edward King demonstrates how twins are a means of exploring the social implications of hyper-connectivity and the compromising relationship between humans and digital information, their environment and their genetics. As King demonstrates, twins tell us about the changing forms of connectivity and power in contemporary culture and what new conceptions of the human they present us with. Taking account of a broad range of literary, cultural and scientific practices, Entwined Being probes discussions surrounding twins such as: - The way in which they appear in behavioral genetics as a way of identifying inherited predispositions to social media - How their faces interrupt biometric interfaces such as facial recognition software and undermine advances in neo-liberal surveillance systems - How they represent the uncanny and the weird in the horror genre and how this questions ideologies of communications media and the connectivity it enables - Their association with telepathy and cybernetics in science fiction - Their construction as models for entangled being in ecological thought Drawing upon the literary and filmic works of Ken Follet, Edgar Allan Poe, H. P. Lovecraft, Bruce Chatwin, Shelley Jackson, Brian de Palma, Peter Greenway and David Cronenberg, as well as science fiction literature and the television series Orphan Black, King illuminates how twins are employed across a range of disciplines to envision a critical re-conception of the human in times of digital integration and ecological crisis.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=hDdiEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The twelve days of Christmas","description":"Tells the story behind the popular English folk song, which was used to teach children Christian doctrine during times of religious persecution in sixteenth-century England","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=UBiHBB7ayGUC&dq=The+twelve+days+of+Christmas&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Dark Thicket","description":"Returning home to Texas near the close of the Civil War, Confederate soldier Owen Danforth finds his state torn by its own near civil war as the supporters of Sam Houston and the murderous Home Guards struggle for power.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=1mukPT3NQqsC&dq=Dark+Thicket&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Linux on the Mainframe","description":"This is the comprehensive guide to Linux on the mainframe straight from the IBM Linux experts.

I did not know if this sense was due to my immersion in Bland s face and mind and world, or to my fear of his threatening presence. Or both . . .

Now, forensic artist Annie Kingston has agreed to draw the updated face of Bill Bland for the popular television show American Fugitive. To do so, Annie must immerse herself in Bland s traits and personality. A single habitual expression could alter the way his face has aged.

William Gladstone was, with Tennyson, Newman, Dickens, Carlyle, and Darwin, one of the stars of nineteenth-century British life. He spent sixty-three of his eighty-nine years in the House of Commons and was prime minister four times, a unique accomplishment. From his critical role in the formation of the Liberal Party to his preoccupation with the cause of Irish Home Rule, he was a commanding politician and statesman nonpareil. But Gladstone the man was much more: a classical scholar, a wide-ranging author, a vociferous participant in all the great theological debates of the day, a voracious reader, and an avid walker who chopped down trees for recreation. He was also a man obsessed with the idea of his own sinfulness, prone to self-flagellation and persistent in the practice of accosting prostitutes on the street and attempting to persuade them of the errors of their ways. This full and deep portrait of a complicated man offers a sweeping picture of a tumultuous century in British history, and is also a brilliant example of the biographer s art.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=IGEHAAAACAAJ&dq=Gladstone:+A+Biography&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"What Is a Man?","description":"Collects works on manhood, including excerpts from Homer, Sir Thomas Malory, Aristotle, Shakespeare, and John Cheever, to present an anthology that is a resource on the essential virtues of man.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=AjK9QCqI9V4C&dq=What+Is+a+Man%3F&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Complete Estate Planning Guide, Revised Edition","description":"A guide to estate planning discusses such topics as wills, the probate process, selecting an executor, living trusts, naming a guardian for young children, living wills, and setting up a power of attorney.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=hBHCUphDaq8C&dq=The+Complete+Estate+Planning+Guide,+Revised+Edition&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"See My Brightness Face to Face: A Celebration of the Ruchira Buddha, Avatar Adi Da Samraj, and the First 25 Years of His Divine Revelation Work","description":"Contains key talks and essays by Adi Da Samraj from 1972-1997, along with stories and testimonials from His devotees.

In The Plague of Fantasies Zizek approaches another enormous subject with characteristic brio and provocativeness. The current epoch is plagued by fantasms: there is an ever intensifying antagonism between the process of ever greater abstraction of our lives whether in the form of digitalization or market relations and the deluge of pseudo-concrete images which surround us. Traditional critical thought would have sought to trace the roots of abstract notions in concrete social reality; but today, the correct procedure is the inverse from pseudo-concrete imagery to the abstract process which structures our lives. Ranging in his examples from national differences in toilet design to cybersex, and from intellectuals' responses to the Bosnian war to Robert Schumann's music, Zizek explores the relations between fantasy and ideology, the way in which fantasy animates enjoy-ment while protecting against its excesses, the associations of the notion of fetishism with fantasized seduction, and the ways in which digitalization and cyberspace affect the status of subjectivity. To the already initiated, The Plague of Fantasies will be a welcome reminder of why they enjoy Zizek's writing so much. For new readers, it will be the beginning of a long and meaningful relationship.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=NM5PqgKd2dsC&dq=The+Plague+of+Fantasies+(Wo+Es+War)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Designer Evolution: a Transhumanist Manifesto","description":"... A rare and uplifting vision of the biological future we can and should create for ourselves.-Dr. Gregory Fahy, Chief Scientific Officer, Vice President of 21st Century MedicineThe debate about the ethics of human biotechnology or genetic engineering is one of the most important cultural issues of our time. Transhumanism is the philosophy that most of all supports genetic science and biotechnology, yet the public knows little about this emerging philosophy. Transhumanism declares unequivocal support for the attempt to eliminate disease, defeat death, and enhance the body and mind beyond the limitations of the age-old human condition.In Designer Evolution Simon Young presents a polemical espousal of transhumanist philosophy and a trenchant attack on its critics, the Bio-Luddites. The author calls for a rejection of premodern superstition and postmodern nihilism in favor of a renewed belief in human progress through scientific rationality.In an age when cynicism, fatalism, and nihilism are rife, Designer Evolution will rekindle a feeling of optimism about the future of our species. This is a concise, reader-friendly introduction to a vitally important philosophy that will become difficult to ignore as advances in biotechnology increasingly claim the headlines in the coming decades.Simon Young (Brighton, East Sussex, UK), the son of pioneering cybernetician and science writer J.

If these practices are so effective, why do returns for the overwhelming majority of investors lag well behind the market indices year after year? In Wealth Without Worry, authors James Whiddon and Lance Alston expose Wall Street's flawed system and offer a proven alternative to chasing returns. While Wall Street firms claim they can help investors pick winning securities and time the market's ups and downs, Whiddon and Alston clearly demonstrate how market returns can be harnessed simply and consistently through a properly diversified portfolio. Wealth Without Worry is based on Nobel Prize-winning research in economics what has become known as Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT). The investing principles outlined in this book have been tested and refined for decades in both academia and the real world. Wealth Without Worry shows readers how to apply these principles using a super-diversified Market Return Portfolio (MRP). By not succumbing to Wall Street shell games, all investors can have long-term success. Wealth Without Worry gives readers a map to the last investment strategy they'll ever need.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=nPIbU-UgIMUC&dq=Wealth+Without+Worry:+The+Methods+of+Wall+Street+Exposed&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Michi: Hedda Hopper's Houseboy \\"Who Helped Make My House Heaven on Earth\\"","description":"In the first full biography of actor Sidney Poitier, Aram Goudsouzian analyzes the life and career of a Hollywood legend, from his childhood in the Bahamas to his 2002 Oscar for lifetime achievement. Poitier is a gifted actor, a great American success story, an intriguing personality, and a political symbol; his life and career illuminate America's racial history. In such films as Lilies of the Field, In the Heat of the Night, and Guess Who's Coming to Dinner, Poitier's middle-class, mannered, virtuous screen persona contradicted prevailing film stereotypes of blacks as half-wits, comic servants, or oversexed threats. His screen image and public support of nonviolent integration assuaged the fears of a broad political center, and by 1968, Poitier was voted America's favorite movie star. Through careful readings of every Poitier film, Goudsouzian shows that Poitier's characters often made sacrifices for the good of whites and rarely displayed sexuality. As the only black leading man during the civil rights era, Poitier chose roles and public positions that negotiated the struggle for dignity. By 1970, times had changed and Poitier was the target of a backlash from film critics and black radicals, as the new heroes of \\"blaxploitation\\" movies reversed the Poitier model. In the 1970s, Poitier shifted his considerable talents toward directing, starring in, and producing popular movies that employed many African Americans, both on and off screen. After a long hiatus, he returned to starring roles in the late 1980s. More recently, the film industry has reappraised his career, and Poitier has received numerous honors recognizing his multi-faceted work for black equality in Hollywood. As this biography affirms, Poitier remains one of American popular culture's foremost symbols of the possibilities for and limits of racial equality.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=MrXqCQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"God's plan for financial prosperity","description":"The subject of finances is mainly either neglected or abused in the church today. There are many believers who are living in financial bondage because they have been taught it is God's will for His people to be poor. Many proclaim it was God's will for them to be poor and if they tried to better themselves they would be going against God's will for their lives. This position is untrue and unbiblical, as we will soon see. At the same time there are believers living in bondage because they have been taught prosperity is a sign of faith. Thus, if you do not have an abundance of things then you are not spiritual. Consequently, people live above their means, often by going into debt, trying to keep up the appearance of prosperity. Even though they look prosperous to the outsider they are in financial bondage. These are the two extremes when dealing with finances. The truth is in the middle. It is the purpose of this book to bring a balanced Biblical view, leading to Financial Integrity. 3 John 2:2 Beloved, I pray that you may prosper in all things and be in health, just as your soul prospers. God is truly interested in our finances. The Lord is as interested in our financial prosperity and physical health as He is in our spiritual prosperity. Our financial situation hinges on the condition of our spiritual life and renewed mind. The flow of the blessings of God in our lives is in direct proportion to the health and prosperity of our soul (mind, emotions, will and heart). If you notice God's blessings are no longer flowing, as they once did, give yourself a spiritual checkup.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=iIjLDAEACAAJ&dq=God%27s+plan+for+financial+prosperity&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Your way to God","description":"I have embodied in The Way to God and How to Find It a considerable part of several addresses which have been delivered in different cities, both of Great Britain and my own country.

This book is different. It is a book for mothers.

The JU288 was a medium bomber which first flew in June 1941. It came out of the Luftwaffe's biggest development program of the war. This was known as Bomber B and was set up to produce a new strategic bomber. Several variants of the JU288 offering different speeds, ranges and bomb loads were envisaged, but only 22 aircraft were produced. The development project that resulted in the JU388 began in September 1943. This was to be a multi-purpose type that could be used as a bomber, a night fighter or a reconnaissance aircraft. The night fighter variant had distinctive radar antennae on the nose.The final type examined in the book, the JU488, was first proposed in early 1944. This was for a four-engined heavy bomber. In order to accelerate the development program, parts from the JU88, 188 and 288 were used in its construction. Two prototypes were assembled in France but were destroyed by the French resistance before they could be shipped to Germany for evaluation leading to the abandonment of the program in November 1944.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=dU93NAAACAAJ&dq=Black+Cross+Volume+2:+Junkers+288/388/488&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"ABC Boeing 747-400 (ABC Airliner)","description":"When it first rolled off the assembly line in the 1960s, the Boeing 747 took on the mantle of the largest commercial airliner in the world, a position it has still to relinquish after more than 30 years.

At times it moves deep below the surface of things, a stealth mode of being all but invisible to the dominant paradigm; at other times it s in plain sight, challenging the status quo; and at still other times it erupts in a fiery burst of creativeor destructiveenergy to change the world forever. But until now the countercultural phenomenon has been one of history s great blind spots. Individual countercultures have been explored, but never before has a book set out to demonstrate the recurring nature of counterculturalism across all times and societies, and to illustrate its dynamic role in the continuous evolution of human values and cultures. Countercultural pundit and cyberguru R. U. Sirius brilliantly sets the record straight in this colorful, anecdotal, and wide-ranging study based on ideas developed by the late Timothy Leary with Dan Joy. With a distinctive mix of scholarly erudition and gonzo passion, Sirius and Joy identify the distinguishing characteristics of countercultures, delving into history and myth to establish beyond doubt that, for all their surface differences, countercultures share important underlying principles: individualism, anti-authoritarianism, and a belief in the possibility of personal and social transformation. Ranging from the Socratic counterculture of ancient Athens and the outsider movements of Judaism, which left indelible marks on Western culture, to the Taoist, Sufi, and Zen Buddhist countercultures, which were equally influential in the East, to the famous countercultural moments of the last centuryParis in the twenties, Haight-Ashbury in the sixties, Tropicalismo, women s liberation, punk rockto the cutting-edge countercultures of the twenty-first century, which combine science, art, music, technology, politics, and religion in astonishing (and sometimes disturbing) new ways, Counterculture Through the Ages is an indispensable guidebook to where we ve been . . . and where we re going.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=18Ne-WflDjMC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Gathering Storm (Valley of the Peacemaker, Book 1)","description":"Main entries by author, then series.

Professor Crowther traces the history of the workhouse system from the Poor Law Amendment Act of 1834 to the Local Government Act of 1929. At their outset the large residential institutions were seen by the Poor Law Commissioners as a cure for nearly all social ills. In fact these formidable, impersonal, prison-like buildings  housing all paupers under one roof  became institutionalised: places where routine came to be an end in itself. In the early twentieth century some of the workhouses became hospitals or homes for the old or handicapped but many continued to form a residual service for those who needed long-term care. Crowther pays attention not only to the administrators but also to the inmates and their daily life. She illustrates that the workhouse system was not simply a nineteenth-century phenomenon but a forerunner of many of today s social institutions.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Dh1qDAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Essential Idioms in English: Phrasal Verbs and Collocations","description":"Essential Idioms is organized by level for beginners, intermediate learners, and advanced learners, and includes a vast treasury of over 600 idioms, phrasal verbs, and collocations.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=YEIJAAAACAAJ&dq=Essential+Idioms+in+English:+Phrasal+Verbs+and+Collocations&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Jack and Jim: Picture Book","description":"Jack the blackbird and Jim the seagull become friends, but Jack is sad that the other seagulls do not seem to like him.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ccNaAAAAYAAJ&dq=Jack+and+Jim:+Picture+Book&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Colloquial Japanese: The Complete Course for Beginners (Colloquial Series)","description":"Colloquial Japanese provides a step-by-step course in Japanese as it is written and spoken today.

Drawing on the techniques of modern social science, psychology, and market research, its practitioners seek to remake the way we pursue justice in the United States. Trial consultants help lawyers to pick - some would say, stack   juries predisposed to render the \\"right\\" verdict. And consultants apply sophisticated research methods to predict how jurors are likely to respond to arguments, witnesses, and evidence. Based on the results of the research, they craft case strategies, help to prepare witnesses, and test and retest arguments   all before a single word is uttered in open court. For fees that sometimes approach six, or even seven, figures, the new jury experts offer attorneys and their clients what they most desire   a way to remove uncertainty.What are we to make of this new industry? Do the techniques work? Is this, as some critics have argued, a new form of high-tech jury-rigging, not much more acceptable than cruder forms of jury tampering? Or do the methods of jury consultants amount to little more than an extension of what attorneys have always done? One thing is clear. The profession is growing steadily. Jury consultants have already made their mark in big-money civil cases. And they have played key roles in prominent criminal trials. After hearing jurors acquit in the O. J. Simpson case, the first person thanked by defense attorney Johnnie Cochran was his jury expert. The burgeoning of the trial consulting industry seems destined to continue. During the past few years, firms have started to offer low-cost consultations, sometimes conducting research for as little as 2000 per case. For better or worse, the wares of the trial consultant are now within the reach of many who previously deemed them too expensive. When a new trade roams the halls of our legal system, aspiring to change America's road to justice, we had all best pay attention. This book will reveal the \\"tricks of the trade\\" and explore the many ways in which trial consultants have infiltrated the courtroom. The authors   a social psychologist and an attorney   present cases where consultants arguably have been responsible for huge jury awards and controversial criminal verdicts. However, it is not their purpose to launch an all-out attack on this growing industry. Instead, they aim to pull back the curtains, allowing a fair and balanced assessment of a new phenomenon in American justice.To achieve this objective, the authors must address issues that lie at the very heart of the American jury system. Are juries fickle? Are they easily swayed? Are jurors influenced   as many have charged   by their age, gender, race, ethnicity, occupation, intellect, personality, or politics? Here, the authors sort through the work of many jury researchers, arriving at conclusions that are balanced and credible. They conclude with sensible and far-reaching proposals for change.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=jlvRswEACAAJ&dq=Stack+And+Sway:+The+New+Science+Of+Jury+Consulting&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Numerical Analysis and Graphics Visualization With Matlab","description":"Leverage the power of MATLAB 6 in all your technical computation and measurement applications Now, there is a complete introduction to numerical methods and visualization with the latest, most powerful version of MATLAB, Version 6.0.

Sandy  Boyd is a proud middle westerner. His decades of service to the university began in 1954, when he arrived as a law professor. He later became president of the University of Iowa from 1969 to 1981, and led the school through times that were fraught not just for the university but for the country. During the intense polarization of the late sixties and early seventies, Sandy s compassion and steady leadership ensured that dissent on campus would be honored and would not stop the university s educational mission. He quickly became admired, not simply for his professional achievements but also for his personal integrity. His memoir, interspersed with personal wisdom gleaned over more than six decades of service and leadership, encapsulates Sandy s shrewd yet optimistic view of the public university as an institution. At every stage in his life in the U.S. Navy during World War II, while practicing law or teaching, and in leadership positions at Chicago s Field Museum and the University of Iowa  Sandy relied on his principles of open disclosure, inclusiveness, and respect for differences to guide him on issues that matter. This chronicle of Sandy s experiences throughout his life shows us the evolution both of the University of Iowa and of the nation writ large. More importantly, this book gives us a lens through which to examine our present situation, whether debating free speech on campus, the role of the arts and humanities in civil society, or the importance of funding for educational and cultural institutions.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=mm-cDwAAQBAJ&dq=The+West+That+Never+Was&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Encyclopedia of Herbs, Spices & Flavorings","description":"Includes information on more than two hundred herbs, spices, essences, edible flowers and leaves, aromatics, vinegars, oils, teas, and coffees","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=P2WKQgAACAAJ&dq=The+Encyclopedia+of+Herbs,+Spices&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Doctrines of the Bible,: A brief discussion of the teachings of God's Word,","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=-kc3AAAAMAAJ&dq=Doctrines+of+the+Bible,:+A+brief+discussion+of+the+teachings+of+God%27s+Word,&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Living in Castle Times (First History)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=VgQ8PgAACAAJ&dq=Living+in+Castle+Times+(First+History)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Feynman Lectures on Physics Volume III (HARDCOVER)","description":"New edition features improved typography, figures and tables, expanded indexes, and 885 new corrections.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=KsnbNL_rh04C&dq=The+Feynman+Lectures+on+Physics+Volume+III+(HARDCOVER)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"This Haunted Land","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Amelia Mixed the Mustard and Other Poems","description":"Women and girls of all types and dispositions are the heroines of twenty children's poems and limericks","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=IH7hAAAAMAAJ&dq=Amelia+Mixed+the+Mustard+and+Other+Poems&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Peacock Emporium","description":"The 2004 novel The Peacock Emporium by Jojo Moyes, the bestselling author of Me Before You and two-time winner of the RNA Novel of the Year award.

Laney Book Prize Winner of an Army Historical Foundation Distinguished Writing Award  A superb account  (The Wall Street Journal) of the longest and most decisive military campaign of the Civil War in Vicksburg, Mississippi, which opened the Mississippi River, split the Confederacy, freed tens of thousands of slaves, and made Ulysses S. Grant the most important general of the war. Vicksburg, Mississippi, was the last stronghold of the Confederacy on the Mississippi River. It prevented the Union from using the river for shipping between the Union-controlled Midwest and New Orleans and the Gulf of Mexico. The Union navy tried to take Vicksburg, which sat on a high bluff overlooking the river, but couldn t do it. It took Grant s army and Admiral David Porter s navy to successfully invade Mississippi and lay siege to Vicksburg, forcing the city to surrender. In this  elegant enlightening well-researched and well-told  (Publishers Weekly) work, Donald L. Miller tells the full story of this year-long campaign to win the city  with probing intelligence and irresistible passion  (Booklist). He brings to life all the drama, characters, and significance of Vicksburg, a historic moment that rivals any war story in history. In the course of the campaign, tens of thousands of slaves fled to the Union lines, where more than twenty thousand became soldiers, while others seized the plantations they had been forced to work on, destroying the economy of a large part of Mississippi and creating a social revolution. With Vicksburg  Miller has produced a model work that ties together military and social history  (Civil War Times). Vicksburg solidified Grant s reputation as the Union s most capable general. Today no general would ever be permitted to fail as often as Grant did, but ultimately he succeeded in what he himself called the most important battle of the war the one that all but sealed the fate of the Confederacy.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=wxyzDwAAQBAJ&dq=Vicksburg&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Dead of Night (Hidden Faces Series #3)","description":"All words fell away.

Though fiercely independent, Celestial finds herself bereft and unmoored, taking comfort in Andre, her childhood friend, and best man at their wedding. As Roy s time in prison passes, she is unable to hold on to the love that has been her center. After five years, Roy s conviction is suddenly overturned, and he returns to Atlanta ready to resume their life together. This stirring love story is a profoundly insightful look into the hearts and minds of three people who are at once bound and separated by forces beyond their control. An American Marriage is a masterpiece of storytelling, an intimate look deep into the souls of people who must reckon with the past while moving forward with hope and pain into the future.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=fc8PDgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Love Among the Haystacks and Other Stories (The Cambridge Edition of the Works of D.

Perhaps you wake to check your baby is breathing, or the sight of a rash sends you down an internet search rabbit hole. Whatever your level of anxiety, however much it impacts your life, this book is for you. Anxiety is making motherhood a less pleasant, more fraught and pressured experience, and we do not have to accept joy-sapping worry and energy-draining overthinking as part of the motherhood job description. In Mind Over Mother, Anna Mathur, psychotherapist and mum of three, explains how to: * Understand anxiety, why it affects you and what to do about it * Make your mind a kinder, calmer, happier place to be * Transform your motherhood experience by addressing your thinking The most powerful tool Anna has to communicate this isn't the letters after her name, it is the fact that she is open about her own experience of maternal anxiety. By sharing her journey, she gives you the confidence to reframe yours. Mind Over Mother is full of light bulb moments of realisation. It will have you learning, laughing and loving yourself through the journey of motherhood. You will learn to address the most important conversation you'll ever have - the one inside your head, because investing in your mental health is the best gift you can offer yourself and your child.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=69QnEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Making History: Interviews with Four Generals of Cuba's Revolutionary Armed Forces","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=0xYqAQAAMAAJ&dq=Making+History:+Interviews+with+Four+Generals+of+Cuba%27s+Revolutionary+Armed+Forces&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Sex Chronicles: Shattering the Myth","description":"From a bold and captivating voice comes a collection of stories that probes women's darkest passions and pushes the boundaries of erotic fiction.

Although private financing grew briskly during the 1990s, it represents only a small share of all infrastructure investment in the region (between 12 and 18 percent). This monograph draws on experience in a number of countries in East Asia, as well as Australia, Chile, and India, to analyze the impediments to and prospects for private financing of infrastructure. The chapters discuss the choices available to policymakers and the strategies that governments have followed. An overview chapter describes recent trends in international financing of infrastructure projects in the region, discusses the key policy and institutional impediments to greater private participation, and assesses the role of domestic capital markets and finance. It also outlines a national and regional strategy for stimulating private investment in infrastructure. The case studies from countries outside East Asia illustrate the payoffs of increased integration and concerted moves toward private provision of infrastructure.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=XSUS234DhEsC&dq=Chrysler+Front-Wheel+Drive+Cars,+6+Cylinder,+1988-95+(Chilton%27s+Total+Car+Care+Repair+Manuals)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Developments in Boundary Element Methods : Industrial Applications","description":"Nine detailed survey chapters by different authors present a number of applications of BEMs.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=6m8DIl0n_dcC&dq=Developments+in+Boundary+Element+Methods+:+Industrial+Applications&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Future Schools & How to Get There from Here: A Primer for Evolutionaries","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"New Perspectives In Music Theory","description":"Building on the insights of the first volume on Music and Gesture (Gritten and King, Ashgate 2006), the rationale for this sequel volume is twofold: first, to clarify the way in which the subject is continuing to take shape by highlighting both central and developing trends, as well as popular and less frequent areas of investigation; second, to provide alternative and complementary insights into the particular areas of the subject articulated in the first volume.

In his seminal essay,  The Modern Janus,  Nairn argued for the democratic necessity of nationalism in the modern world. Here, in this strikingly original and timely new work, he addresses the subsequent upheavals caused by nationalism. In Faces of Nationalism Tom Nairn argues that nation-building movements from 1750 to 1990 have saved the world from imperial barbarism. Contrary to many gloomy prognoses following the Soviet and Yugoslav collapses, Nairn argues that the chaos feared by so many observers is neither endless nor one-sidedly destructive. While insisting that nationalism is as inescapable as ever, Nairn shows how its forms and content are shifting. The ethnic definition of the national is giving way to the civic, the  natural  to the designed. Nairn believes that today s more civic and secular nationalism is a key feature of modernity and not an archaic reaction against it. Tom Nairn s wide-ranging discussion takes in Ireland and Palestine, Bosnia and the Czech and Slovak republics, Cambodia and Rwanda, South Africa and Scotland. Faces of Nationalism is a work that demands to be read by anyone wanting to understand one of the central features of politics in the modern world.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=6OtOEAAAQBAJ&dq=Faces+of+Nationalism:+Janus+Revisited&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Let's Read the Arabic Newspapers","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=C3HqjgEACAAJ&dq=Let%27s+Read+the+Arabic+Newspapers&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Gifts of the Heart: A Little Book About The Treasures of Thoughtfulness","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=AsY-AQAAMAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Musgraves","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Naked Chef Takes Off","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Fabulous Maestro: A Remembrance of Alfredo Salmaggi and His Legacy (Spanish Edition)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=-IniAAAAMAAJ&dq=The+Fabulous+Maestro:+A+Remembrance+of+Alfredo+Salmaggi+and+His+Legacy+(Spanish+Edition)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Cultural Politics of English as an International Language (Language in Social Life)","description":"Covering a wide range of areas including international politics, colonial history, critical pedagogy, postcolonial literature and applied linguitics, this book examines ways to understand the cultural and political implications of the global spread of English. Firstly, it explores how a particular view of English as an international language has come into being by examining its colonial origins, its connections to linguistics and applied linguistics, and its relationships to the global spread of teaching practices. It then offers an alternative, critical understanding through the concept of the 'worldliness' of English. This concept suggests that English can never be removed from the social, cultural, economic or political contexts in which it is used.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=XcO3AwAAQBAJ&dq=The+Cultural+Politics+of+English+as+an+International+Language+(Language+in+Social+Life)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Heretics' Power","description":"The United Pentecostal Church-sponsored Conquerors Bible College was founded in Portland, Oregon in 1953. It closed abruptly in 1983. The denomination attributed the failure of the college to financial causes. Heretics and Politics argues that the financial crisis at CBC was rooted in theological controversy, church politics, conflicting models of education, and sustained suspicions of heresy. In seeking to delineate the several factors which destroyed CBC, historian Thomas A. Fudge has looked closely at the context, critically assessed a wide range of surviving documents, and taken into account the diversity of oral history. The narrative is neither an institutional history nor a biographical account. Instead, it explores the challenge of formal education within the UPC and evaluates the politics of change within that denomination in the Pacific Northwest. Both issues are assessed through the prism of CBC. The story of the last days of CBC illuminates important developments in the Pacific Northwest. The story is told against the broader canvas of events transpiring within American religious history. Heretics and Politics is the first book to deal with any aspect of the history of CBC. Its probing narrative chronicles both institutional upheaval and personal tragedy.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=wJr8oAEACAAJ&dq=The+Heretics%27+Power&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Club de la buena estrella (Debolsillo, 338/1) (Spanish Edition)","description":"First published in 2003.

The Tarot, a powerful spiritual and divinatory tool, also works with the subconscious and conscious minds. It was only natural that the two should be combined. That is exactly what Anna-Marie Ferguson has done with her beautiful deck, Legend: The Arthurian Tarot. The cards are meticulously painted in beautiful watercolor and framed by Celtic knotwork with jewels. The deck follows the traditional Tarot structure of 22 Major Arcana cards and 56 Minor Arcana cards. The traditional Tarot card name, such as the Seven of Swords, appears at the top of the card, while the Arthurian scene depicted (in this case the Sword in the Stone) appears at the bottom. The beauty of these designs will thrill you with their depth and add new layers of meaning and interpretation to your Tarot readings. Included is a 72-page booklet which describes the mythic image on each card along with the divinatory meanings. The Horned One (formerly The Devil) is here named Cernunnos. You will learn who this deity is and his history. The Universe becomes The Giant's Dance, which relates to the mythic construction of Stonehenge. The Three of Swords is Palomides, the Saracen Knight who laments for his lost love, Isolt. The Nine of Cups is the Healing of the Maimed King, which describes how the Wasteland is renewed with the healing of its King on the sacred isle of Avalon. The booklet also includes instructions for two spreads. If you work with the Tarot, you will find that the myths illustrated on these cards will allow you to glean new interpretations and ideas from the cards. If you collect Tarot decks, the beauty and meaning of this deck will make you want to add this deck to your collection. If you love the Arthurian myths, you will want this deck for its beautiful depictions of the events in the Arthurian legends. And if you want to learn the legends of Camelot, these cards can even function as \\"flash cards,\\" allowing you to easily learn and recall the adventures of the Arthurian knights. Let this deck, with its exquisitely rendered water color paintings, draw you into a compelling world of characters, places, and tales from all four branches of the ancient Arthurian legend.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=dA4FAAAACAAJ&dq=Legend:+The+Arthurian+Tarot&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Small Avalanches and Other Stories","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"An Indexed Guide Book of Silver Art Bars - Fifth Edition","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=QKD3nFSWbQAC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A bad case of moosepox","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=hEPdGwAACAAJ&dq=A+bad+case+of+moosepox&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"General Besserley's second puzzle box: A series of stories","description":"The author has chosen seventeen of the most important or representative British spy novelists to write about.

Where is it leading-and where will it all end? The past two decades have seen swift and radical changes in the way literature is perceived and taught in this country and abroad. The emergence of a myriad of new schools of literary theory is perplexing-perhaps even disturbing-but Howard Felperin offers guidance to the bemused in this balanced and lively overview of all the major schools of contemporary literary theory. Steering clear of technicalities as he explains, explores, and occasionally takes issue, Felperin surveys the large movements in critical thought that have succeeded \\"new\\" and practical criticism, and focuses on the major schools and figures of structuralism, marxism, and deconstruction. While in sympathy with the far-reaching critique of institutional practices that these movements represent, he also shows us that we must separate the purist and imperialist tendencies of the new theory from the genuine gains in critical self-consciousness that it has made possible. This new potential for textual and cultural understanding is strikingly illustrated through a fresh reading of Shakespeare's sonnets in the light of post structuralist thought. Responsive to developments on both sides of the Atlantic and to relations and differences between them, Beyond Deconstruction is a comprehensive, incisive introduction to a burgeoning field.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=G3bGAAhRcTIC&dq=Beyond+Deconstruction:+The+Uses+and+Abuses+of+Literary+Theory&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Beyond the Horizon: Visions of the New Millennium","description":"Popular, charismatic, Spanish-speaking astrologer Walter Mercado presents an embracing, optimistic forecast for the new millennium.

For instance, in November 1978 an offer was made to him in his Paris exile to return to Iran with international guarantees of freedom of speech and action. He refused and demanded the departure of the Shah. Americans put pressure on the monarch to leave the country. Khomeini arrived in Tehran in early February 1979, and he immediately demanded the return of the Shah and his trial before an Islamic tribunal! No one could give a valid explanation of this contradiction in Khomeini's conduct and demands. Many other mysteries in the unfolding of the revolution and the policies of the Islamic republic which replaced the monarchy have gone unexplained up to now. Scholars and experts in the West have offered the usual explanations for the Islamic revolution-corruption, deepening gaps between the rich and the poor, rapid industrialization, sky-rocketing inflation, westernizing policies that offended traditions, lack of democratic institutions, authoritarian rule, and on and on. But such characteristics which exist in other Muslim countries, especially in the Arab world, fail to clairify the particularities of the Iranian revolution. Indeed, as Ambassador Hoveyda points out, Iran is not an Arab country. It has kept alive its ancient mythological heritage which is not Islamic. It is an Indo-European nation with a recorded history of three thousand years! To understand the real causes of the 1979 revolution one must refer to the deep-rooted beliefs of Iranians and to their very rich mythology. One must also take into account the kind of Islam-shiism-Iranians have created and nurtured. In fact, Iran is a powerful example of how mythologies remain alive and can account for the conduct of a whole nation. Hoveyda shows the influence of myths in history-in-the-making. Indeed, he has found in the Iranian revolution many points that can be clarified only by the impact of old mythology and mindsets. He provides a very original explanation of the events that led to the fall of the Shah and the ascent of Khomeini, changing the political and diplomatic situation in the Middle East, the Persian Gulf, and the Caspian Sea region. As such it will be of great interest to scholars, students, researchers, and foreign policy makers involved with the Middle East and Islamic fundamentalism.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=QbMgb9pHKIkC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Black bourgeoisie (Collier books)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=BAUSwQEACAAJ&dq=Black+bourgeoisie+(Collier+books)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Be Your Own Home Decorator: Creating the Look You Love Without Spending a Fortune","description":"Offers advice on color schemes, window treatments, floors, furnishings and accessories, storage, and woodworking","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Ev0EAAAACAAJ&dq=Be+Your+Own+Home+Decorator:+Creating+the+Look+You+Love+Without+Spending+a+Fortune&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Admiral David Dixon Porter: The Civil War Years","description":"\\"Nearly forgotten because his career and accomplishments have often been misinterpreted, David Dixon Porter takes his rightful place among the foremost naval heroes of the Civil War in this richly detailed, entertaining history. Porter rose faster through the ranks, commanded more men and ships, won more victories, and was awarded more congressional votes of thanks than any other officer in the U.S. Navy. His own postwar writings, however, were so flawed by an unquenchable ego, a thin skin, and a burning desire to vindicate his father, David Porter, a controversial naval hero in the War of 1812, that historians have neglected him.\\" \\"Drawing on the correspondence and journals of Porter's allies and enemies, both military and political, as well as official documents and the admiral's own volume of papers, the noted naval writer Chester Hearn sets the record straight. This account brings to life the firebrand hero of New Orleans, Arkansas Post, Vicksburg, and Fort Fisher, whose unique tactics and techniques rank among the most imaginative and successful in naval history.

Author Kenneth Richard Samples faced a profound test of his own belief system during a personal life-and-death crisis. In A World of Difference, he uses nine distinct tests to compare the Christian worldview with current religious and philosophical competitors, including Islam, postmodernism, naturalism, and pantheistic monism. Samples tackles tough issues through this in-depth study of Christianity's history, creed, and philosophical basis.

As such, the text gives a comprehensive overview of theoretical sociology of law. It deals with the broad expanse of the field and covers a vast amount of intellectual terrain. This volume is intended to fill a gap in the literature. Most textbooks in the sociology of law are insufficiently theoretical or else do not provide a paradigmatic analysis of sociological theories. The content of this text consists of discussions of the works of scholars who have contributed the most to the cumulative development of the sociology of law. It surveys the major traditions of legal sociology but is not wedded to any one particular theoretical approach. Both the \\"classical,\\" or nineteenth-century, and \\"contemporary,\\" or twentieth-century, perspectives are covered. The reader will see that nineteenth-century thought has directly influenced the emergence of twentieth-century theory. One unique feature of this book is that key sociological and legal concepts, presented in bold print and italics, are defined, described, and illustrated throughout. Although the nature of the subject matter is highly theoretical and, at times, quite complex, Trevino values every effort to present the material in the most straightforward and intelligible form possible without compromising the integrity of the theories themselves. In short, this book aims to accomplish three objectives: inform about the progressive advancement of sociological theory, teach the reader to analyze the law as a social phenomenon, and develop in the reader a critical mode of thinking about issues relevant to the relationship between law and society.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=8yAuDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"East of the Jordan: A record of travel and observation in the countries of Moab, Gilead and Bashan during the years, 1875-1877","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=17w5VkLWDroC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Generation Ecstasy: Into the World of Techno and Rave Culture","description":"In Generation Ecstasy, Simon Reynolds takes the reader on a guided tour of this end-of-the-millenium phenomenon, telling the story of rave culture and techno music as an insider who has dosed up and blissed out.

In The Great Pyramid Decoded, historical theorist, researcher, and best-selling author Peter Lemesurier shares observations based on a simple numeric code which reveals illuminating perspectives on the past as well as prophetic visions of the future. Does the Great Pyramid hearken back to another civilization much older than ancient Egypt? Is it the Old Testament writ in stone? Is it an ancient observatory? A treasure house? A tomb? Is there a message in the geometric ratios? Lemesurier carefully explores these theories and draws some enlightening and meaningful conclusions. Translating the wisdom of this ancient monument, the author presents recommendations for the future which are consistent with the advice of Saint Malachy, Nostradamus, and Edgar Cayce, among others. Making connections to several religious traditions, Lemesurier uses the Great Pyramid to illustrate humankind's place in the universe. Read what this archaic wonder of the world has to say about where we came from and where we may be heading. Learn how this one ancient wonder can teach us that we have the potential to reawaken to an enlightened path forward.

Finkielkraut asserts that the ostensibly progressive cast of third world anticolonial and anti-Western sentiment, paradoxically, has its antecedent in Eurocentric sources - chiefly the German romantic concept of the Volksgeist, or spirit of the people. Straightforward and succinct, Finkielkraut draws a line between the idea of culture as an expression of the life of the mind and culture as an expression of national spirit. He deplores the appropriation of the concept of the Volksgeist by ethnic nationalists, who employ the notion in justification of such horrors as the Final Solution in Nazi Germany and the current waves of \\"ethnic cleansing.\\" Equally worrying, he claims, are the seemingly harmless infusions of the Volksgeist into campaigns for ethnic diversity espoused by some social scientists and third world intellectuals. The Defeat of the Mind questions notions of cultural relativism espoused by such intellectual and political leaders as Claude Levi-Strauss and Frantz Fanon. Finkielkraut points to the United Nations and UNESCO - founded to propagate the universalist ideals of Enlightenment Europe, these organizations have co-opted the notion of cultural relativism to a fault, now speaking on behalf of every ethnic prejudice. \\"The objective remained the same,\\" Finkielkraut maintains of this shift in ideology, \\"but to achieve its goal, it was no longer a matter of opening others to reason, but of opening ourselves to the reason of others.\\" Defending values that seem absent from many contemporary frames of reference, the book concludes with a chapter challenging post-modernist thought, for Finkielkraut claims that it equates the value of novels by Flaubert with television movies and lacks concern for the survival of culture and reason.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Ysx97q8zWF8C&dq=The+Defeat+of+the+Mind+(European+Perspectives)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Readings in Czech (Ucla Slavic Studies)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Breakfast at Tiffany's","description":"Holly Golightly knows that nothing bad can ever happen to you at Tiffany's.

Its purpose is to provide the reader--whether artilleryman or not--with hitherto unavailable insights on the role that artillery plays in the larger battle and how that has helped shape the world that we live in today. Unique aspects of the book include the treatment of technical issues in non-technical language, the extensive use of German and French sources generally unavailable to the English-speaking reader, the shattering of some long-cherished myths, and the discussion of issues that are often papered over in the literature of field artillery--losses from friendly fire, the frequent impotence of counter-battery fire, and the French origins of current American doctrine. The bulk of the literature on field artillery can be fairly described as gunner propaganda. Gudmundsson, with his emphasis on the way artillery interacts with other arms and the dynamics of the battle as a whole, takes a more balanced and a more critical view, dealing with the failures as well as the achievements of field artillery. This study provides a thorough overview of field artillery in non-technical language that will be of interest to military professionals, military historians, and wargamers.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=O_-0w2WUDd0C&dq=On+Artillery&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Best Restaurants in Paris","description":"If you re passionate about eating well, you couldn t ask for a better travel companion than Alexander Lobrano s charming, friendly, and authoritative Hungry for Paris, the fully revised and updated guide to this renowned culinary scene.

Thinkers have been fascinated by paradox since long before Aristotle grappled with Zeno's. In this volume in The MIT Press Essential Knowledge series, Margaret Cuonzo explores paradoxes and the strategies used to solve them. She finds that paradoxes are more than mere puzzles but can prompt new ways of thinking. A paradox can be defined as a set of mutually inconsistent claims, each of which seems true. Paradoxes emerge not just in salons and ivory towers but in everyday life. (An Internet search for  paradox  brings forth a picture of an ashtray with a  no smoking  symbol inscribed on it.) Proposing solutions, Cuonzo writes, is a natural response to paradoxes. She invites us to rethink paradoxes by focusing on strategies for solving them, arguing that there is much to be learned from this, regardless of whether any of the more powerful paradoxes is even capable of solution. Cuonzo offers a catalog of paradox-solving strategies including the Preemptive-Strike (questioning the paradox itself), the Odd-Guy-Out (calling one of the assumptions into question), and the You-Can't-Get-There-from-Here (denying the validity of the reasoning). She argues that certain types of solutions work better in some contexts than others, and that as paradoxicality increases, the success of certain strategies grows more unlikely. Cuonzo shows that the processes of paradox generation and solution proposal are interesting and important ones. Discovering a paradox leads to advances in knowledge: new science often stems from attempts to solve paradoxes, and the concepts used in the new sciences lead to new paradoxes. As Niels Bohr wrote,  How wonderful that we have met with a paradox. Now we have some hope of making progress.

The same is true for fathering. In Covering Home, author Jack Petrash combines a love for children with his love for the game of baseball to give fathers, or fathers-to-be, a new perspective on raising children. The Baltimore Orioles had a unique outfielder once named Ken Singleton, and he had an unusual habit: whenever he stepped up to bat, he would reach down and pick up three pebbles. These pebbles were a reminder that each time he batted he was entitled to three good pitches. This act heightened his awareness, and increased his patience and discipline as a hitter. I think fathers need a similar ritual. We should stop before our front door when we are about to make the transition to our children's world and imagine that we are about to pick up three stones. At this moment we should remind ourselves that we are going to spend these three hours with the most important people in the world.  from Covering Home . . . Quotes on the hardcover edition: \\"Will immediately become the kind of book passed on from friend to friend, from father to father, and from father to son or daughter. . . . There are many more detailed books on fatherhood that are essential for a dad's -library, but none so precious as this small wonder.\\" Publishers Weekly \\"Petrash delivers more than just tips about patience and preparation, timing and tolerance.

Groups allow them space and opportunity for peer support with other young men, to gain confidence and skills, and to positively develop their fatherhood identities. They offer young fathers opportunities to encounter new role models and can therefore help to reimagine young men who are fathers, challenging stereotypes and offering support for young men and their families.

Beginning with a critical examination of American cognitivism and French structuralism, Descombes launches a more general critique of all philosophies that view the mind in strictly causal terms and suppose that the brain--and not the person--thinks. Providing a broad historical perspective, Descombes draws surprising links between cognitivism and earlier anthropological projects, such as Levi-Strauss's work on the symbolic status of myths. He identifies as incoherent both the belief that mental states are detached from the world and the idea that states of mind are brain states; these assumptions beg the question of the relation between mind and brain. In place of cognitivism, Descombes offers an anthropologically based theory of mind that emphasizes the mind's collective nature. Drawing on Wittgenstein, he maintains that mental acts are properly attributed to the person, not the brain, and that states of mind, far from being detached from the world, require a historical and cultural context for their very intelligibility. Available in English for the first time, this is the most outstanding work of one of France's finest contemporary philosophers. It provides a much-needed link between the continental and Anglo-American traditions, and its impact will extend beyond philosophy to anthropology, psychology, critical theory, and French studies.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=gV6pguhIJz0C&dq=Kaplan+The+No+Stress+Guide+To+The+New+York+State+8th+Grade+Tests&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Dawn of Conscience.","description":"Presents historical evidence which reveals the origins of man's moral values and social responsibility in primitive religions and life experiences of the ancient Egyptians of 5000 B.C","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=osRZAAAAYAAJ&dq=The+Dawn+of+Conscience.&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"How to Buy a House in California","description":"In this new edition of How to Buy a House in California, readers will find effective strategies for buying a house in California's changing market.

Using an interdisciplinary and comparative approach, the book analyzes China by introducing theories and concepts from historical and political sociology, economic development, and political science. It also explores China from two comparative perspectives: developing countries (including the newly industrializing countries of East Asia) and historical state socialist regimes. China Against the Tides, 3rd Edition seeks to combine both the internal perspectives of the actors themselves with the external standpoint of the social scientist. China is, of course, unique; but so are all countries. But, like other countries, its distinctiveness can best be grasped by observing it from outside as well as from within. Every chapter in the third edition as well as the end bibliography has been updated. In addition, a new section examines China's international relations, and new coverage has been added throughout the chapters. For example, the third edition discusses: the Hu-Wen leadership that came to power in 2002, China's economic growth and social development, internet technology, the continued drumbeat of protests of various kinds, the situation in Tibet, the Olympic Games, the May 2008 earthquake, plus smaller but still notable events, such as the 2003 SARS outbreak, the Three Gorges Dam, and the 2005 pollution episode on the Songhua River","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=XpcyEAAAQBAJ&dq=China+Against+the+Tides:+Restructuring+Through+Revolution,+Radicalism+and+Reform&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Hot WACKS Book: Supplement 6","description":"Hot Wacks Books are bootleg CD and record rating guides and discographies that can save you money!

However, the phrase 'natural disaster' suggests an uncritical acceptance of a deeply engrained ideological and cultural myth. At Risk questions this myth and argues that extreme natural events are not disasters until a vulnerable group of people is exposed. The updated new edition confronts a further ten years of ever more expensive and deadly disasters and discusses disaster not as an aberration, but as a signal failure of mainstream 'development'. Two analytical models are provided as tools for understanding vulnerability. One links remote and distant 'root causes' to 'unsafe conditions' in a 'progression of vulnerability'. The other uses the concepts of 'access' and 'livelihood' to understand why some households are more vulnerable than others. Examining key natural events and incorporating strategies to create a safer world, this revised edition is an important resource for those involved in the fields of environment and development studies.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=4M6AAgAAQBAJ&dq=At+Risk:+Natural+Hazards,+People%27s+Vulnerability+and+Disasters&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Las Placitas: Historical Facts and Legends","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=EbBdYgEACAAJ&dq=Las+Placitas:+Historical+Facts+and+Legends&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"There's Something About Harry: A Catholic Analysis of the Harry Potter Phenomenon","description":"Everyone knows the story of Harry Potter and the \\"rags-to-riches\\" success of its author J.K.

Under this mandate, the UN was empowered to coordinate reconstruction, maintain law and order, protect human rights, and create democratic institutions. Six years later, the UN's special envoy to Kosovo, Kai Eide, described the state of Kosovo: \\"The current economic situation remains bleak.... respect for rule of law is inadequately entrenched and the mechanisms to enforce it are not sufficiently developed.... with regard to the foundation of a multiethnic society, the situation is grim.\\" In Peace at Any Price, Iain King and Whit Mason describe why, despite an unprecedented commitment of resources, the UN Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK), supported militarily by NATO, has failed to achieve its goals. Their in-depth account is personal and passionate yet analytical and tightly argued. Both authors served with UNMIK and believe that the international community has a duty to intervene in regional conflicts, but they suggest that Kosovo reveals the difficult challenges inherent in such interventions. They also identify avoidable mistakes made at nearly every juncture by the UN and NATO. We can be sure that the international community will be called on to intervene again to restore the peace of shattered countries. The lessons of Kosovo, cogently presented in Peace at Any Price, will be critically important to those charged with future missions.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=4jD2yGTgxyoC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Contemporary Relationships between Wood & Finish: A Step-By-Step Guidebook and Design Planner for the Layperson and Professional","description":"Written primarily for the layperson, Wood & Finish is an entertaining, engaging & comprehensive primer drawn from the author's direct experience.

Since its publication in 1980, the immigrant groups it discusses in depth have matured and new ones have been added to the mix. The present work tracks the course of these changes over the past twenty years, constructing a historical understanding of each group as it evolved from race to ethnicity to culture. Individual chapters begin with an overview of one of fifteen groups. Following the development of its unique ethnocultural identity, distinctive character traits such as temperament and emotional expression are explored as well as ethnic stereotypes. Also discussed are modifications to the group s ethnocultural identity over time and generational change which traits may have changed over generations and which are more hardwired or enduring. An important feature of each chapter is the focus on the group s family social structure, generational and gender roles, power distribution, and central values and life goals. Readers will also find a description of the group s own internal social class structure, social and political strategies, and occupational and educational patterns. Finally, contributors consider how a particular ethnic group has blended into Hawai i s culturally sensitive society.

Yet the decision to undertake this enterprise can seem so formidable that many deny themselves an extraordinary experience. This book makes that decision admittedly a complex one better informed, clearer, and easier. It provides seven detailed case reports, easy to read and free of technical jargon, in which the patients' lives in their own judgements were transformed. This is not meant to imply that psychoanalysis always or even usually yields transformative results. These case studies are intriguing in their own right and help the reader think knowledgeably about psychoanalysis and assess its potential as a life-changing enterprise.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=qLHibNqJRwQC&dq=Transforming+Lives:+Analyst+and+Patient+View+the+Power+of+Psychoanalytic+Treatment&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Ninja - The True Story of Japan's Secret Warrior Cult","description":"This is a true and revealing account of the Ninja, the Japanese clandestine warrior cult of assassins and spies that has acquired a legendary status among martial arts enthusiasts and military historians.

You may wonder what an old man like me could teach? I wonder as well. I certainly don't claim to know all the answers. I'm barely figuring out the questions....Life has a strange way of repeating itself and I want my experience to help you. I want to make a difference. My hope is that you'll consider my words and remember my heart. Harry Whitney is dying. And in the process, he's losing his mind. Afflicted with Alzheimer's disease, he knows his \\"good\\" time is dwindling. Wishing to be remembered as more than an ailing old man, Harry realizes the greatest gift he can pass on is the wisdom of his years, the jumbled mix of experiences and emotions that add up to a life. And so he compiles a book of his poems for his favorite granddaughter, Emily, in the hope that his words might somehow heal the tenuous relationships in a family that is falling apart. But Harry's poems contain much more than meets the eye....As Emily and her family discover, intricate messages are hidden in them, clues and riddles that lead to an extraordinary cache of letters, and even a promise of hidden gold. Are they the ramblings of a man losing touch with reality? Or has Harry given them a gift more valuable than any of them could have guessed? As Harry's secrets are uncovered one by one, his family learns about romance, compassion, and hope -- and together they set out to search for something priceless, a shining prize to treasure forever.

X. Cronin became a Catholic, many of his friends challenged him, claiming not only that the Catholic Faith is untrue but also that truth itself does not exist. In this warm response to such enduring claims, Cronin takes skeptics and believers alike on a delightful tour of reality, starting with proofs for the existence of truth itself. Thereafter, Cronin considers \\"\\" and refutes \\"\\" step by step, most of our culture's common relativistic beliefs, demonstrating not only the existence of God but also the truth of Christianity, and in particular of the Catholic Faith. Doubters will be won over by Cronin's gracious exhortations to lay aside for a moment their often reflexive assumptions in order to ponder with him the evidence he brings forth. Believers will be surprised by his piercing insights into realities that, if truth be told, most of us have insufficiently pondered ourselves. All will be delighted by his lyrical appeals to mind and heart, both of which must be engaged by anyone who would grasp in its entirety our remarkable world and its abundant evidence for the reality and glory of God. Among the dozens of topics Cronin explores here are: -Knowledge: How we can know for certain the right answers about life and living -Materialism: Why faith isn't blind \\"\\" but materialism and moral relativism are -Science: How, in too many ways, modern science has actually become anti-scientific -Miracles: Why God's nature requires that He answer prayers and even perform miracles -Morality: How it's not just a list of prohibitions, but the very gateway to love and peace -And much more to immerse you in the whole world according to God and guide you through its wonders!","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Q2mazQEACAAJ&dq=The+World+According+to+God:+Selections+from+the+Book+of+Books&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Report from Part Two (English and English Edition)","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Jjdh8-8e3ZEC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Eddie and Louella","description":"Serie om drengen Eddie, den yngste i en s?skendeflok p? fire, og hans mange morsomme oplevelser","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=p3ryxAEACAAJ&dq=Eddie+and+Louella&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Hammer Comes Down: The Nasty, Brutish, and Shortened Political Life of Tom DeLay","description":"The New Indictment Tie-In Edition!","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ZzB3AAAAMAAJ&dq=The+Hammer+Comes+Down:+The+Nasty,+Brutish,+and+Shortened+Political+Life+of+Tom+DeLay&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Midwest Gardener's Handbook","description":"Meant for the more experienced gardener, Midwest Gardener's Handbook is an all-inclusive resource guide featuring hundreds of proven plants that are optimal for Midwestern gardeners.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=c_X6CwAAQBAJ&dq=Midwest+Gardener%27s+Handbook&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Moments of Magic","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=9iOJJU-J580C&dq=Moments+of+Magic&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Ashes of Aries","description":"I closed my eyes, intent on quieting my thoughts, the necessary first step in opening up psychically.

The nervousness I'd been feeling all morning turned to fear.... \\"Something's burning,\\" I warned. When Matthew Fielding, the four-year-old son of a San Diego telecommunications mogul, turns up missing, the psychic skills of P.I. Elizabeth Chase are requested. The stakes are raised soon after Elizabeth begins her investigation when a wildfire breaks out in Rancho Santa Fe, the secluded community where Matthew and his family and Elizabeth's own parents live. Aided and abetted by the Santa Ana winds, flames rage out of control, consuming thousands of acres and dozens of homes. Before the ashes can be cleared away, another fire blazes through everything in its path. Are the kidnapper and arsonist one and the same? Will Elizabeth be able to find the clues she needs in the dying embers around her? It's a race against time as man and nature combine to wreak destruction on Elizabeth's community and keep a little boy lost forever.

Regarded by many as the finest, and funniest, comic novel of the twentieth century, Lucky Jim remains as trenchant, withering, and eloquently misanthropic as when it first scandalized readers in 1954. This is the story of Jim Dixon, a hapless lecturer in medieval history at a provincial university who knows better than most that  there was no end to the ways in which nice things are nicer than nasty ones.  Kingsley Amis s scabrous debut leads the reader through a gallery of emphatically English bores, cranks, frauds, and neurotics with whom Dixon must contend in one way or another in order to hold on to his cushy academic perch and win the girl of his fancy. More than just a merciless satire of cloistered college life and stuffy postwar manners, Lucky Jim is an attack on the forces of boredom, whatever form they may take, and a work of art that at once distills and extends an entire tradition of English comic writing, from Fielding and Dickens through Wodehouse and Waugh. As Christopher Hitchens has written,  If you can picture Bertie or Jeeves being capable of actual malice, and simultaneously imagine Evelyn Waugh forgetting about original sin, you have the combination of innocence and experience that makes this short romp so imperishable.

Ogilvie brings together a team of skilled and exceptional communicators to blend sound scholarship with life-related illustrations. The design for the Preacher's Commentary gives the reader an overall outline of each book of the Bible. Following the introduction, which reveals the author's approach and salient background on the book, each chapter of the commentary provides the Scripture to be exposited. The New King James Bible has been chosen for the Preacher's Commentary because it combines with integrity the beauty of language, underlying Hebrew and Greek textual basis, and thought-flow of the 1611 King James Version, while replacing obsolete verb forms and other archaisms with their everyday contemporary counterparts for greater readability. Reverence for God is preserved in the capitalization of all pronouns referring to the Father, Son, or Holy Spirit. Readers who are more comfortable with another translation can readily find the parallel passage by means of the chapter and verse reference at the end of each passage being exposited. The paragraphs of exposition combine fresh insights to the Scripture, application, rich illustrative material, and innovative ways of utilizing the vibrant truth for his or her own life and for the challenge of communicating it with vigor and vitality.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=jKfpGpCfO50C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Yo mato / I Kill (Nov.Intrig) (Spanish Edition)","description":"A dark, engrossing, blood-drenched tale of the familiar threats to female power and one girl s journey to regain it.

Heron edition","description":"Three thrilling treasure hunts from the author of The Wreck of the Mary Deare and  Great Britain s leading adventure novelist  (Financial Times). British novelist Hammond Innes was perhaps best known for his nautical mystery, The Wreck of the Mary Deare, which was made into a film starring Gary Cooper and Charlton Heston. But the prolific writer, World War II veteran, and dedicated yachtsman wrote over thirty novels of adventure and suspense over his long career. The three novels collected here offer death-defying adventure set against harsh and exotic landscapes, from the Italian Alps to the Canadian Rockies and the Norwegian glaciers. As always,  the art of writing thoroughly well-documented and ably-written thrillers is perfectly understood by Innes, whose work stands in a class by itself  (V. S. Pritchett). The Lonely Skier: High among the Dolomite Mountains, a film crew led by halfcon man half-genius director Derek Engles is ostensibly making a skiing picture. But beneath the mountain ice is a fortune in Nazi gold, which the filmmaker will find or die trying. Only Neil Blair, an old army buddy hired on as a scriptwriter for the fake film, can stop things from going downhill fast, in Innes s literal cliffhanger, made into the 1948 film Snowbound.  A superbly constructed and atmospheric thriller.   The Independent Campbell s Kingdom: A London insurance clerk who s just received a devastating diagnosis, Bruce Wetheral learns he s the sole heir to his grandfather s land in the Canadian Rockies. Stuart Campbell froze to death in a shack on the edge of a mountain, where he lived his final years in a feverish hunt for oil.

In recent decades, income declines, crime increases, and tax base erosion have affected many suburbs to an extent previously seen only in central cities.In Confronting Suburban Decline, William H. Lucy and David L. Phillips examine conditions and trends in cities and suburbs since 1960, arguing that beginning in the 1980s, the United States entered a \\"post-suburban\\" era of declining suburbs with maturation of communities accompanied by large-scale deterioration. The authors examine: why suburban decline has become widespread how the \\"tyranny of easy development decisions\\" often results in new housing being built outside of areas that people prefer how strategic planning can help assess dangers how some suburbs have stabilized or revived how interactions between residential mobility and the age, size, and location of housing can help policy makers anticipate dangers and opportunities facing neighborhoods and jurisdictions Making the case that a high quality natural and built environment is key to achieving economic stability, the authors set forth a series of policy recommendations with federal, state, regional, and local dimensions that can help contribute to that goal.In-depth case studies are provided of Richmond, Virginia and Washington, D.C., along with examples from Minnesota, Oregon, Maryland, Tennessee, and other locations. In addition, the book offers information and statistics on income, population, and racial transitions in 554 suburbs in the nation's twenty-four largest metropolitan areas.Confronting Suburban Decline provides a detailed look at the causes of and responses to urban and suburban decline. Planners and policymakers as well as students and researchers involved with issues of land use, economic development, regional planning, community development, or intergovernmental relations will find it a valuable resource.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=m1NPAAAAMAAJ&dq=Confronting+Suburban+Decline:+Strategic+Planning+For+Metropolitan+Renewal&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Driving Me Crazy (Harlequin Next)","description":"*","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=LcKfhmrBkYcC&dq=Driving+Me+Crazy+(Harlequin+Next)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Cadillac Desert: The American West and Its Disappearing Water, Revised Edition","description":"\\"The definitive work on the West's water crisis.\\" --Newsweek The story of the American West is the story of a relentless quest for a precious resource: water. It is a tale of rivers diverted and dammed, of political corruption and intrigue, of billion-dollar battles over water rights, of ecological and economic disaster. In his landmark book, Cadillac Desert, Marc Reisner writes of the earliest settlers, lured by the promise of paradise, and of the ruthless tactics employed by Los Angeles politicians and business interests to ensure the city's growth. He documents the bitter rivalry between two government giants, the Bureau of Reclamation and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, in the competition to transform the West. Based on more than a decade of research, Cadillac Desert is a stunning expose and a dramatic, intriguing history of the creation of an Eden--an Eden that may only be a mirage. This edition includes a new postscript by Lawrie Mott, a former staff scientist at the Natural Resources Defense Council, that updates Western water issues over the last two decades, including the long-term impact of climate change and how the region can prepare for the future.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=g7NDDwAAQBAJ&dq=Cadillac+Desert:+The+American+West+and+Its+Disappearing+Water,+Revised+Edition&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Crepe Cookery (H.P.

This book illuminates the work of the poet Lucan, a contemporary of the emperor Nero who as nephew of the imperial adviser Seneca moved in the upper echelons of Neronian society. This young and maverick poet, whom Nero commanded to commit suicide at the age of 26, left an epic poem on the civil war between Caesar and Pompey that epitomizes the exuberance and stylistic experimentation of Neronian culture. This study focuses on Lucan's epic technique and traces his influence through the Middle Ages and the Renaissance. Martin T. Dinter's newest volume engages with Lucan's use of body imagery, sententiae, Fama (rumor), and open-endedness throughout his civil war epic. Although Lucan's Bellum Civile is frequently decried as a fragmented as well as fragmentary epic, this study demonstrates how Lucan uses devices other than teleology and cohesive narrative structure to bind together the many parts of his epic body. Anatomizing Civil War places at center stage characteristics of Lucan's work that have so far been interpreted as excessive, or as symptoms of an overly rhetorical culture indicating a lack of substance. By demonstrating that they all contribute to Lucan's poetic technique, Martin T. Dinter shows how they play a fundamental role in shaping and connecting the many episodes of the Bellum Civile that constitute Lucan's epic body. This important volume will be of interest to students of classics and comparative literature as well as literary scholars. All Greek and Latin passages have been translated.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=H5wiEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Breakfast at Tiffany's;","description":"Holly Golightly knows that nothing bad can ever happen to you at Tiffany's.

From the city's beloved, world-famous bouillabaisse to enticing  migr  flavors to venerable street treats to classic and contemporary Provencal bistro fare, this culinary crossroads, the Paris of Provence, offers an exciting array of tempting foods that, while global in scope, have a folksy, made-in-Marseille personality. Join Daniel Young, author of The Paris Caf  Cookbook, as he explores the authentic flavors of France's oldest city, its great southern gateway, extending from the Marseille of antiquity, found intact in the limestone cliffs of the rocky coastline, to the Marseille of romantic intrigue, still apparent in the labyrinthine passageways of the historic Panier quarter, to its storied center, the Vieux Port. Of course there's bouillabaisse: an entire chapter on this legendary fish stew-soup, including rustic, home-style Marseille recipes adapted so they can successfully be made with North American fish not entirely authentic but wholeheartedly delicious. There are many other definitive fish recipes from this seafood lovers' paradise as well, including the legendary pan-fried calamari with parsley and garlic from Chez Etienne and the foolproof formula for grilling fish from the Restaurant L'Escale. In addition, there are aromatic appetizers, traditional and newfangled desserts, savory pastries, meat and chicken dishes, and hearty vegetable stews, all prepared with the building blocks of the healthful, French-Mediterranean diet: olive oil, garlic, tomatoes, zucchini, fennel, eggplant, artichokes, olives, basil, thyme, rosemary, bay leaves, almonds, figs, and honey.

They realize the management models and organizational paradigms of the Industrial Era are giving way to a fresh appreciation of virtualization, strategic alliances, empowerment of individuals, and a new understanding that plentitude creates wealth. What is really new is that Global Entrepreneurs frequently use virtual organizations, virtual products, and micro-virtual manufacturing processes to develop efficient global ventures. They are strongly motivated towards creating a global enterprise for generating substantial personal wealth. WHO SHOULD BUY THIS BOOK?

Joe Ehrmann, a former NFL football star and volunteer coach for the Gilman high school football team, teaches his players the keys to successful defense: penetrate, pursue, punish, love. Love? A former captain of the Baltimore Colts and now an ordained minister, Ehrmann is serious about the game of football but even more serious about the purpose of life. Season of Life is his inspirational story as told by Pulitzer Prizewinning journalist Jeffrey Marx, who was a ballboy for the Colts when he first met Ehrmann. Ehrmann now devotes his life to teaching young men a whole new meaning of masculinity. He teaches the boys at Gilman the precepts of his Building Men for Others program: Being a man means emphasizing relationships and having a cause bigger than yourself. It means accepting responsibility and leading courageously. It means that empathy, integrity, and living a life of service to others are more important than points on a scoreboard. Decades after he first met Ehrmann, Jeffrey Marx renewed their friendship and watched his childhood hero putting his principles into action. While chronicling a season with the Gilman Greyhounds, Marx witnessed the most extraordinary sports program he d ever seen, where players say  I love you  to each other and coaches profess their love for their players. Off the field Marx sat with Ehrmann and absorbed life lessons that led him to reexamine his own unresolved relationship with his father. Season of Life is a book about what it means to be a man of substance and impact. It is a moving story that will resonate with athletes, coaches, parents anyone struggling to make the right choices in life.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=8Mio7eU4AYUC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"English Romanticism: The Human Context","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Bridge on the Drina","description":"Portrays the dramatic lives of the people living in a small town near a huge stone bridge in the Balkans","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=xpmamLIjt_AC&dq=The+Bridge+on+the+Drina&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Stephen King: Three Complete Novels: Carrie; Salems Lot; The Shining","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Anxiety Cure","description":"Panic Anxiety is the number one mental health problem for women and second only to drug abuse among men.

Originally published in 1967, Meagher s masterful dissection of the Warren Report, based on the Warren Commission s own evidence, has stood the test of time. In some cases, declassifications of government records have corroborated the author s suspicions and analyses, such as her amazing assertion that Oswald had never actually been charged with Kennedy s murder, despite sworn testimony to the contrary. Meagher s book raises serious questions not only about Oswald s guilt in the JFK assassination and related crimes, such as the Tippit murder and the Walker shooting, but also about the methods and honesty of the Warren Commission, the FBI, and various Dallas police and other officials. When the Church Committee first began to re-examine the Warren Commission and its relationship with intelligence agencies in 1975, investigators were shocked by what they discovered. In Accessories After the Fact, Sylvia Meagher delivers a blistering blow to the credibility of the Warren Report, and decades after its original publication, researchers and readers are still discovering what made her work so important.  By far the most meticulous and compelling indictment of the Warren Commission Report ever made. The significance of this book cannot be overstated.   Former Sen. Richard S.

Finkielkraut asserts that the ostensibly progressive cast of third world anticolonial and anti-Western sentiment, paradoxically, has its antecedent in Eurocentric sources - chiefly the German romantic concept of the Volksgeist, or spirit of the people. Straightforward and succinct, Finkielkraut draws a line between the idea of culture as an expression of the life of the mind and culture as an expression of national spirit. He deplores the appropriation of the concept of the Volksgeist by ethnic nationalists, who employ the notion in justification of such horrors as the Final Solution in Nazi Germany and the current waves of \\"ethnic cleansing.\\" Equally worrying, he claims, are the seemingly harmless infusions of the Volksgeist into campaigns for ethnic diversity espoused by some social scientists and third world intellectuals. The Defeat of the Mind questions notions of cultural relativism espoused by such intellectual and political leaders as Claude Levi-Strauss and Frantz Fanon. Finkielkraut points to the United Nations and UNESCO - founded to propagate the universalist ideals of Enlightenment Europe, these organizations have co-opted the notion of cultural relativism to a fault, now speaking on behalf of every ethnic prejudice. \\"The objective remained the same,\\" Finkielkraut maintains of this shift in ideology, \\"but to achieve its goal, it was no longer a matter of opening others to reason, but of opening ourselves to the reason of others.\\" Defending values that seem absent from many contemporary frames of reference, the book concludes with a chapter challenging post-modernist thought, for Finkielkraut claims that it equates the value of novels by Flaubert with television movies and lacks concern for the survival of culture and reason.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Ysx97q8zWF8C&dq=The+Defeat+of+the+Mind&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Bescherelle : La Grammaire Pour Tous (French Edition)","description":"A French-English dictionary with French-Canadian terms and essential French vocabulary.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=XP4ana3LqK4C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Character","description":"What is  character ? Since at least Aristotle s time, philosophers, theologians, moralists, artists, and scientists have pondered the enigma of human character. In its oldest usage,  character  derives from a word for engraving or stamping, yet over time, it has come to mean a moral idea, a type, a literary persona, and a physical or physiological manifestation observable in works of art and scientific experiments. It is an essential term in drama and the focus of self-help books. In Character: The History of a Cultural Obsession, Marjorie Garber points out that character seems more relevant than ever today, omnipresent in discussions of politics, ethics, gender, morality, and the psyche. References to character flaws, character issues, and character assassination and allegations of  bad  and  good  character are inescapable in the media and in contemporary political debates. What connection does  character  in this moral or ethical sense have with the concept of a character in a novel or a play? Do our notions about fictional characters catalyze our ideas about moral character? Can character be  formed  or taught in schools, in scouting, in the home? From Plutarch to John Stuart Mill, from Shakespeare to Darwin, from Theophrastus to Freud, from nineteenth-century phrenology to twenty-first-century brain scans, the search for the sources and components of human character still preoccupies us. Today, with the meaning and the value of this term in question, no issue is more important, and no topic more vital, surprising, and fascinating. With her distinctive verve, humor, and vast erudition, Marjorie Garber explores the stakes of these conflations, confusions, and heritages, from ancient Greece to the present day.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=3_ywDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Kink Phobia: Journey Through a Black Woman's Hair","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=4CYKAAAACAAJ&dq=Kink+Phobia:+Journey+Through+a+Black+Woman%27s+Hair&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Monumental Propaganda","description":"From Vladimir Voinovich, one of the great satirists of contemporary Russian literature, comes a new comic novel about the absurdity of politics and the place of the individual in the sweep of human events. Monumental Propaganda, Voinovich s first novel in twelve years, centers on Aglaya Stepanovna Revkina, a true believer in Stalin, who finds herself bewildered and beleaguered in the relative openness of the Khrushchev era. She believes her greatest achievement was to have browbeaten her community into building an iron statue of the supreme leader, which she moves into her apartment after his death. And despite the ebb and flow of political ideology in her provincial town, she stubbornly, and at all costs, centers her life on her private icon. Voinovich s humanely comic vision has never been sharper than it is in this hilarious but deeply moving taleequally all-seeing about Stalinism, the era of Khrushchev, and glasnost in the final years of Soviet rule. The New York Times Book Review called his classic work, The Life & Extraordinary Adventures of Private Ivan Chonkin,  a masterpiece of a new formsocialist surrealism . . . the Soviet Catch-22 written by a latter-day Gogol.\\" In Monumental Propaganda we have the welcome return of a truly singular voice in world literature.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=UzsCylmHcuUC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The dear Old Gentleman","description":"This book examines Protestant loss of power and self-confidence in Ireland since 1795.

Its theological perspectives and historical profiles of early man are unique. It is important not because it is old-other collections antedate it by many years-but because it completely transcends the primitive mythology of the ancient world. Reading and studying Genesis are not burdensome tasks. Its themes are varied and its personal portraits unparalleled. It immediately tackles on of man's most basic questions: What is the origin of all things? Its answer is as credible as it is captivating. From the origin of man the writer shifts attention to the fall of man and the human dilemma. The problem of evil is rarely discussed in such a manner by other ancient writers. From this point the writer concentrates on the spiritual, moral, and practical consequences of sin. Great catastrophes, such as the flood and the confusion of tongues at Babel, demonstrate God's response to human rebellion. Where in the annals of history can we find more imaginative and frank portraits than those of Abraham and his descendants? Abraham's moments of great triumph and ecstasy are not reported to the exclusion of his hours of humility and disgrace; this balanced description is quite distinct from the idealism of ancient Near Eastern historiography. The detailed descriptions of Abraham's failures, therefore, constitute a remarkable proof for the inspiration of this book. The sensitive reader cannot help but be struck by this book's great contrasting emphases: on one hand majestic, cosmological truth; on the other hand personal, intimate, and individualistic narratives of a man, a wife, and their family. While theological abstractions are common, they do not exclude personal warmth and historical objectivity. There are also great contrasts between personalities; the most significant is between God and Satan, and based on this contrast is the one between good and evil and their practical effects. The book of Genesis, therefore, is of utmost value to the scientist, the historian, and the theologian: to the scientist for its cosmology, to the historian for its early history of Israel, and to the theologian for its basic philosophical implications. But one must approach the book properly; only then can one hope to understand it, not to mention the rest of the Bible and Jesus Himself . Jesus told his hostile contemporaries that \\"had ye believed Moses, ye would have believed me: for he wrote of me. But if ye believe not his writings, how shall ye believe my words?\\" (John 5:46,47)","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=fUJGDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"2000 TriBeCa Guide","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=mmwgzgEACAAJ&dq=2000+TriBeCa+Guide&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The River of the West: The Adventures of Joe Meek","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=lr3EwwEACAAJ&dq=The+River+of+the+West:+The+Adventures+of+Joe+Meek&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Persuasion Engineering","description":"Explains how we use our communicating processes to generate behaviours which unconsciously stand out on their own and speak for themselves.

Covering the whole development of the Christian Church from St. Paul to the present century, the author illustrates the differing backgrounds and approach of many of the great mystics such as St. Augustine of Hippo, whose writings helped to create the Church's understanding of its mystical character; and St. Francis of Assisi, whose example proved an inspiration to many. The book gives much more than an opportunity to meet the great mystics: it also provides a framework for the analysis of true mysticism and false, contrasting Catherine of Sienna, a girl of the people whose transcendental mysticism benefited many in an age of ecclesiastical degradation, with the well-born and beautiful Madame Guyon, whose excesses brought mysticism into disrepute. Evelyn Underhill illuminates the whole of her subject by drawing attention to the differences of approach that can bring mortals along the road to the divine, from the zealous militancy of a Loyola to the passivity of the Quietists. This absorbing study by one of the great writers on mysticism covers every aspect of the subject and gives a clear understanding of the mystics' world in writing that is both informative and stimulating.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=QoJKAwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Grow your own peppers (Extension circular / Oregon State University Extension Service)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=RcH5NwAACAAJ&dq=Grow+your+own+peppers+(Extension+circular+/+Oregon+State+University+Extension+Service)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Bookends: A Novel","description":"The world of four lifelong friends--best friends Catherine and Simon, both unlucky in love, and Josh and Lucy, happily married to each other--is thrown into turmoil by the arrival of Portia, a beautiful college friend with a reputation for breaking hearts.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=h528EAIYcmEC&dq=Bookends:+A+Novel&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Teaching Adult Second Language Learners (Cambridge Handbooks for Language Teachers)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=sRnvzgEACAAJ&dq=Teaching+Adult+Second+Language+Learners+(Cambridge+Handbooks+for+Language+Teachers)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Manual of Dermatological Therapeutics (Little, Brown Spiral Manual)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Ro5TPgAACAAJ&dq=Manual+of+Dermatological+Therapeutics+(Little,+Brown+Spiral+Manual)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The New Revelations: A Conversation with God","description":"The human race has reached a Time of Choosing.

Along the way he was nominated five times for an Academy Award and won the coveted statuette twice. He had an equally distinguished career as a stage actor appearing in such acclaimed Broadway productions as The Skin of Our Teeth and Long Day s Journey Into Night winning two Tony Awards including the very first presented to an actor. Despite this great record of success, Fredric March isn t as well remembered today as some of his peers (Gary Cooper, Cary Grant, James Stewart) because unlike them he never developed a recognizable screen persona that followed him from film to film. He was always characterizing always hiding his own personality behind that of the character he was portraying. He was the consummate actor who richly deserves to be rediscovered.

Boudicca had her kingdom cruelly taken from her by the occupying Roman forces, when her husband died. We have a few paragraphs, written by a Roman, named  Tacitus  which tells us how Boudicca was invited to a meeting with the Romans, which she thought was to welcome her as the Queen of the Iceni. She did not receive the hospitality she expected, and the treatment that she, and her daughters received, are believed to be the trigger for what happened next. The Romans under-estimated the strength and grit of Boudicca and the fanatical support of her people, and came to regret their actions. The book tells the story of Boudicca s campaign to reclaim her kingdom. Written to inform the reader about the way of life of the ancient Britons, it tells how the occupying Roman forces ruled them.

Palynology was for a long time rarely practised in arid lands due to both technical and conceptual difficulties, mainly centered around poverty in pollen grains and different approaches necessary for treating the spectra, as compared with forested regions. However, recent developments in extraction techniques, along with new concepts applied for analysis of data, show the great potential lying in reconstructing past arid environments, along with a variety of ensuing ramifications. The book provides an update of the state of the art in this branch of science. Firstly, it deals with natural agents relevant to palynology in arid lands, from pollen release by parent plants through transportation, deposition and preservation in various types of rocks. Then it describes sampling strategies, various treatments for extracting microfossils from host rocks, identifying, counting and presenting the results. Concepts and ways for interpretations of results are discussed. There are several case studies, to demonstrate prospects and possibilities in reconstructing late Cenozoic vegetation, climate, transport, environments of deposition, structure, stratigraphy, regional paleogeography and human settlement of past arid environments. A discussion of pre-late Cenozoic arid lands palynology is also included, with examples from the late Paleozoic and early Mesozoic deserts. Each topic is accompanied by photographs and line-drawings. There is an extensive bibliography and subject and author indexes. The book is intended for students and scientists, mainly in palynology, Quaternary sciences, geology, climatology, environmental sciences, paleoclimatology, evolution, biology, geomorphology of arid lands, botany, anthropology and archeology.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=VrizAAAAIAAJ&dq=Palynology+of+Arid+Lands&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"LDAP Directories Explained: An Introduction and Analysis","description":"Presents an overview of LDAP, discussing such topics as how the technology works, how directories differ from databases, the LDAP namespace, the LDAP scheme, and directory management.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=BsSDvXr9d68C&dq=LDAP+Directories+Explained:+An+Introduction+and+Analysis&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Resource Allocation in the Public Sector: Values, Priorities and Markets in the Management of Public Services","description":"In the public sector at the moment resources are scarce - or at the very least finite and limited - how they are allocated is therefore of crucial importance.

It was without precedent in the history of theater. Brook and his international troupe of actors left their base in Paris and disappeared into the heart of the Sahara desert. From there, they began their astonishing journey in search of the miraculous that took them 8,500 miles through the remote villages of Africa until the exhausted expedition came full circle, ending in the desert where it began. Part theater expedition and experiment, part spiritual search and comedy of errors, Brook's adventure was in essence a search for a new beginning and a completely new form of theater. The actors performed at each village they came to improvising before stunned villagers with whom they shared no common language. The outcome was to have far-reaching implications for the future of theater and a seminal impact on all of Brook's groundbreaking work thereafter - from his ninety-minute Carmen to his seven-hour epic, The Mahabharata. This classic book is the most penetrating account written about the ideas and personality of the man described as the world's greatest theater director.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=A8sXBqrvvA8C&dq=Conference+of+the+Birds:+The+Story+of+Peter+Brook+in+Africa+(Theatre+Arts+(Routledge+Paperback))&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"His Victorious Indwelling","description":"Have you truly grasped the remarkable heritage that is yours in Christ?

Brother Lucas, a venal but moderately trustworthy monk, is put in charge of an exorcism. His former fellow acolyte, the brooding and magnetic aristocrat Francisco Montcada, has returned from the Crusades possessed by demons. If Brother Lucas can drive out the demons, his monastery will be enriched by the Montcada patriarch and he himself will be made a bishop. Gradually, Francisco comes out of his possession and begins to spin the tale of his Crusade: How he set out to free the soul of his dead brother lost at sea before he could reach the Holy Land; his fierce friendship with his cousin Andres, a mighty warrior with an honest heart; his intense love for Andres s feisty sister, Isabel; the high ideals of his battle-hardened commander Ramon; and the amoral cruelty of the perfidious Don Fernando, a noble who delights in executing Muslim women and children. The Crusaders win a great battle at Toron, taking it back from the Infidel, but at the gigantic fortress Krak des Chevaliers, the key to the Christian position in the Holy Land, the Saracens have laid siege. In the fierce battle to defend the fortress, Francisco will lose everything: including, unless the dodgy Brother Lucas succeeds, his immortal soul.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=2xRQiwWjU1sC&dq=The+Crusader&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Work Excellence: A Biblical Perspective of Work","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=DU2HIczEKZIC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Boulder: Evolution of a City","description":"Updated with ninety new photographs and revised text, this lively history of Boulder, Colorado, discusses key people and events and traces culture, architecture, urban development, industry, and more over a century.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=IdsRAQAAIAAJ&dq=Boulder:+Evolution+of+a+City&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Yonnondio: From the Thirties","description":"Yonnondio follows the heartbreaking path of the Holbrook family in the late 1920s and the Great Depression as they move from the coal mines of Wyoming to a tenant farm in western Nebraska, ending up finally on the kill floors of the slaughterhouses and in the wretched neighborhoods of the poor in Omaha, Nebraska.

Before stage fright, impostor syndrome, emotional baggage, and the other dubious gifts of adulthood, everyone pretended to be a superhero, a favorite athlete, an inspiring entertainer, a nurse, a firefighter, a lion, or whatever else captured our imaginations. And yet, that natural creativity is slowly squeezed out of us because we think it s childish or it s  time to grow up.  Now Todd Herman backed by scientific research and countless stories from the real world will show us how to tap into the human imagination to unleash new versions of ourselves, ready-made to kick ass. Herman has been coaching champions in every field for over twenty years, and he s helped them bring out their Heroic Self to transcend the forces pulling them into the Ordinary World.

However, they are often constrained by lack of adequate resources, sound policies, and national support. It is clear that change and advancements, both systematic and scientific, are needed in a number of forensic science disciplines to ensure the reliability of work, establish enforceable standards, and promote best practices with consistent application. Strengthening Forensic Science in the United States: A Path Forward provides a detailed plan for addressing these needs and suggests the creation of a new government entity, the National Institute of Forensic Science, to establish and enforce standards within the forensic science community. The benefits of improving and regulating the forensic science disciplines are clear: assisting law enforcement officials, enhancing homeland security, and reducing the risk of wrongful conviction and exoneration. Strengthening Forensic Science in the United States gives a full account of what is needed to advance the forensic science disciplines, including upgrading of systems and organizational structures, better training, widespread adoption of uniform and enforceable best practices, and mandatory certification and accreditation programs. While this book provides an essential call-to-action for congress and policy makers, it also serves as a vital tool for law enforcement agencies, criminal prosecutors and attorneys, and forensic science educators.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=4VH5FhgTXxoC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"England in the eighteenth century (The Pelican history of England)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=x_iVoAEACAAJ&dq=England+in+the+eighteenth+century+(The+Pelican+history+of+England)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Bridget Jones's Diary","description":"Chronicles a year in the life of Bridget Jones, a single, thirtysomething woman on a perpetual quest for self-improvement, as she struggles to cope with relationships, weight control, and the other baffling complexities of modern life.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=LtNSdRFFRbAC&dq=Bridget+Jones%27s+Diary&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"At Her Service (Warner Forever)","description":"A widow who's survived the deaths of two of her three children, Lady Joanna is determined to keep her one remaining daughter safe.

To tell the story in human rather than abstract terms, the Pulitzer Prize-winning writer David K. Shipler bypasses both extremists and celebrities and takes us among ordinary Americans as they encounter one another across racial lines. We learn how blacks and whites see each other, how they interpret each other's behavior, and how certain damaging images and assumptions seep into the actions of even the most unbiased. We penetrate into dimensions of stereotyping and discrimination that are usually invisible, and discover the unseen prejudices and privileges of white Americans, and what black Americans make of them. We explore the competing impulses of integration and separation: the reference points by which the races navigate as they venture out and then withdraw; the biculturalism that many blacks perfect as they move back and forth between the white and black worlds, and the homesickness some blacks feel for the comfort of all-black separateness. There are portrayals of interracial families and their multiracial children--expert guides through the clashes created by racial blending in America. We see how whites and blacks each carry the burden of our history. Black-white stereotypes are dissected: the physical bodies that we see, the mental qualities we imagine, the moral character we attribute to others and to ourselves, the violence we fear, the power we seek or are loath to relinquish. The book makes clear that we have the ability to shape our racial landscape--to reconstruct, even if not perfectly, the texture of our relationships. There is an assessment of the complexity confronting blacks and whites alike as they struggle to recognize and define the racial motivations that may or may not be present in a thought, a word, a deed. The book does not prescribe, but it documents the silences that prevail, the listening that doesn't happen, the conversations that don't take place. It looks at relations between minorities, including blacks and Jews, and blacks and Koreans. It explores the human dimensions of affirmative action, the intricate contacts and misunderstandings across racial lines among coworkers and neighbors. It is unstinting in its criticism of our society's failure to come to grips with bigotry; but it is also, happily, crowded with black people and white people who struggle in their daily lives to do just that. A remarkable book that will stimulate each of us to reexamine and better understand our own deepest attitudes in regard to race in America.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=UYO7CwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Return to the One: Plotinus's Guide to God-Realization","description":"In the Enneads, 3rd century mystic philosopher Plotinus synthesized a thousand years of accumulated Greek wisdom with his own profound mystical experiences.

(page 102) -- How to keep your potatoes from sprouting? (page 114) -- Why you don't add tomatoes or salt to dried beans until after they're cooked? (page 84) Each section begins with such a wealth of information about the topic that you will find yourself saying things like, So that's why, or I didn't know that, or no wonder mine never came out right. It's a delightful, delicious read and the answer to questions you didn't even know to ask. Irene Buckman is a treasure and so is her book.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=cOhPPQAACAAJ&dq=Keepsake+Recipes+and+Fascinating+Food+Facts&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The big four;: The story of Huntington, Stanford, Hopkins, and Crocker, and of the building of the Central Pacific,","description":"Here for the first time is told in a single volume one of the most remarkable stories in American history. An Eastener is never long in California without hearing something of  the big four : four Sacramento shopkeepers Collis P. Huntington, Lelan Stanford, Mark Hopkins, and Charles Crocker who got control of the newly organized Central Pacific Railroad property. These men are portrayed in Mr. Lewis s volume vividly and with a great wealth or pertinent anecdote. Thus their true characters are revealed and the grandiose era in which they lived and operated is re-created as well. Huntington, the shrewd manipulator and lobbyist in Washington, founded the great fortune which is responsible for the magnificent library at San Marino; Leland Stanford, Governor of California and United States Senator, created Leland Stanford Junior University; Hopkins, the cold, quiet watchdog of the railroad s treasury, kept himself out of the limelight, out of politics and scandal, yet, like the others, died enormously wealthy; while Crocker founded a dynasty of bankers still important in the affairs of California and the nation. Oscar Lewis, a longtime authority on Californiana and secretary of the Book Club of California, spent six years gathering the material for The Big Four and writing it. The result is a definitive telling of a story that is ever fresh and ever fascinating.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=_lhIf5WBKnkC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Gentle Art of Making Enemies","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=7FEAAAAAMAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Study Skills for Learning Power","description":"Easy-to-use self-teaching manual teaches students from elementary to medical school develope vital skills that help in every stage of learning.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=qU4kAQAAMAAJ&dq=Study+Skills+for+Learning+Power&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"In the teeth of the evidence","description":"Dorothy L Sayers' amateur sleuth Lord Peter Wimsey returns in this collection of mysteries, introduced by crime writer Elizabeth George.

Anne Boleyn was Queen of England from 1533-1536 as the second wife of King Henry VIII. Their marriage, and her subsequent execution, made her a key figure in the political and religious upheaval that marked the start of the English Reformation. Anne refused to become Henry's mistress so, in order to marry her, he soon focused his efforts on annulling his marriage to his first wife, Catherine of Aragon. Yet, Pope Clement VII of Rome would not annul the marriage. So, Henry broke with the Roman Catholic Church and established the Church of England. The newly appointed Archbishop of Canterbury Thomas Cranmer declared Henry and Catherine's marriage null and void. Five days later he validated Henry and Anne's marriage. Four days later, Anne was crowned Queen of England. Anne gave birth to the future Queen Elizabeth I but, after three miscarriages, she failed to bear the son that Henry desired. Henry began courting Jane Seymore but, in order to marry her, he had to find reasons to end his marriage to Anne. Anne was arrested, held in the Tower of London, tried before a jury on charges of treason and adultery, and beheaded. However, after her daughter, Elizabeth I, became Queen of England in 1558, Anne was venerated as a martyr and heroine of the English Reformation, and some contemporaries consider Anne to be the most influential and important queen consort England has ever had. This short book tells the intensely human story of a woman who has changed the world in a way that no one else could.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=hZyazQEACAAJ&dq=Anne+Boleyn:+A+Biography&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Savoy Male and Female College, 1876-1890: Its organization, administration, history, and tradition","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=fNajngEACAAJ&dq=The+Savoy+Male+and+Female+College,+1876-1890:+Its+organization,+administration,+history,+and+tradition&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Her Scoundrel (Bad Luck Brides)","description":"Cursed when it comes to love, Kat McBride, betrayed by her fianc , succumbs to temptation when notorious and irresistible scoundrel Jake Kimball offers her a once-in-a-lifetime chance to change her luck.

A child chases a loving parent until, suddenly, the strong arms of the father enfold the chaser. The pursuer becomes the captive; the pursued the captor. Paul put it this way: \\"I chase after that I may catch that which apprehended me\\" (Phil. 3:12). Job was a God chaser. He said, \\"Oh that I knew where I might find Him!\\" David was one; he said, \\"My soul followeth hard after Thee.\\" Paul was one too: \\"That I may know Him...\\" The passionate paths of God chasers can be traced across the pages of history from Moses the stutterer, David the singer, and Paul the itinerant preacher, to contemporaries like A.W. Tozer, Leonard Ravenhill, and countless others who share one common bond: an insatiable hunger to know their Lord. These are people whose relentless, passionate pursuit of Christ often made them appear foolish in the eyes of others. Yet, having tasted His goodness and glimpsed the invisible, they could be satisfied with nothing less. Add your name to the list...become a God chaser. Who know?

Polt presents the questions Heidegger grappled with and the positions he adopted, and also analyzes persistent points of difference between competing schools of interpretation. The book begins by exploring Heidegger's central concern, the question of Being, and his way of doing philosophy. After considering his environment, personality, and early thought, it carefully takes readers through his best-known work, Being and Time. Heidegger concludes with highlights of its subject's later thought, providing guidelines for understanding Contributions to Philosophy and other important texts. It gives special attention to the philosopher's political involvement with the Nazis in the 1930s, indicating the strengths and weaknesses of the reactions to his politics, reactions ranging from exculpation to complete condemnation.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=-CXZN12gHioC&dq=Heidegger&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Yakov and the Seven Thieves","description":"The third book in the illustrated series by Madonna.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=4JqcAAAACAAJ&dq=Yakov+and+the+Seven+Thieves&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Battle Station","description":"Recounts the story of the \\"U.S.S.

But inside companies, managers struggle to quantify the value of growth initiatives and to align internal valuations with those in the financial markets. Value Sweep is the first book to lay out a simple and transparent valuation method that works for the varied growth opportunities facing the modern corporation. Based on extensive research and years of frontline work within corporations, valuation and strategy expert Martha Amram takes readers beyond the numbers, providing a new lens and a better vocabulary for envisioning, understanding, and valuing growth across a wide sweep of assets-from mature businesses to those being reshaped by intellectual property and e-commerce. Rigorous, yet easy to use, this innovative approach allows managers to place diverse growth projects on a single \\"map\\" of value. This comparison enables them to better direct resources and attention to the most valuable projects. Value Sweep tackles the hard valuation issues and shows: When to use traditional valuation methods, such as Discounted Cash Flow, and when to use more innovative methods such as decision analysis or real options How to quickly value growth opportunities and compare the result to sensible valuation benchmarks Why venture capital valuations are so sensitive to fluctuations in the stock market Why it is difficult to value intellectual property and how to use approximate valuation results in negotiations Why the simplest valuation methods work best for investments in information technology How to roll up project-level valuations into a corporate growth engine AUTHORBIO: Martha Amram is an independent consultant and adviser to Fortune 500 companies and start-ups, and the author of Real Options (ISBN 0875848451, HBS Press, 1998).

The book descri bes how experts worked closely with the power elite in shaping the plansfor a post-World War II world economic order, in good part realized during the past 30 years.

However, it is not clear whether the religious practices attested at these sites were a reflection of localised customs or were common rituals for peoples of Cisjordan and we do not know their extent. An isolated shrine site at Wadi ath-Thamad Site WT-13 in northern Moab which contained numerous finds of Iron Age figurines and statues has been the subject of detailed excavation. The rich harvest of figurines, ceramic statues, beads, miniature ceramic vessels, architectural models, faunal remains and shells and fossils constitutes the evidence for repeated cultic activities. Although dating to the Iron Age at the time of the consolidation of the kingdom of Moab, there is insufficient evidence at present to determine the full range of cultic practices and deities venerated by the peoples of the lands within ancient Moab and by those visitors to the shrine. The links between WT-13 and the surrounding town sites is only now coming to light with excavation at Atarus and Khirbat al-Mudayna, as well as at the Ammonite site of Tall Damiyah in the Jordan Valley, where a comparable shrine has recently been uncovered. WT-13 clearly serves as a link between the Jordan Valley and the Negev, adding to our knowledge of local and foreign influences in the region during the Iron Age.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=fso4DwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Call Center Savvy: How to Position Your Call Center for the Business Challenges of the 21st Century","description":"It's not just the technology, the people, or the customers.

The Architectural Uncanny presents an engaging and original series of meditations on issues and figures that are at the heart of the most pressing debates surrounding architecture today. Anthony Vidler interprets contemporary buildings and projects in light of the resurgent interest in the uncanny as a metaphor for a fundamentally \\"unhomely\\" modern condition. The essays are at once historical serving to situate contemporary discourse in its own intellectual tradition and theoretical opening up the complex and difficult relationships between politics, social thought, and architectural design in an era when the reality of homelessness and the idealism of the neo-avant-garde have never seemed so far apart. Vidler, one of the deftest and surest critics of the contemporary scene, explores aspects of architecture through notions of the uncanny as they have been developed in literature, philosophy, and psychology from the beginning of the nineteenth century to the present. He interprets the unsettling qualities of today's architecture its fragmented neo-constructivist forms reminiscent of dismembered bodies, its \\"seeing walls\\" replicating the passive gaze of domestic cyborgs, its historical monuments indistinguishable from glossy reproductions - in the light of modern reflection on questions of social and individual estrangement, alienation, exile, and homelessness. Focusing on the work of architects such as Bernard Tschumi, Rem Koolhaas, Peter Eisenman, Coop Himmelblau, John Hejduk, Elizabeth Diller, and Ricardo Scofidio, as well as theorists of the urban condition, Vidler delineates the problems and paradoxes associated with the subject of domesticity.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=kVKxBIB-En4C&dq=The+Architectural+Uncanny:+Essays+in+the+Modern+Unhomely&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Acting With an Accent: Chicago","description":"A step-by-step instruction and practice in learning to speak English in Yiddish dialect.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=BM_rMQEACAAJ&dq=Acting+With+an+Accent:+Chicago&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Mutual Favor","description":"Two good friends, two thorny problems.

Book One, completed in 1941, covers the years 1874-1917 and Book Two covers the years 1918-1948. Weizmann describes the Russian shtetl where he was born in 1874, his schooling in Pinsk and his university studies in Berlin, Geneva and Freiburg (Switzerland) where he received his PhD in chemistry in 1899 before moving to Manchester in 1904. He portrays many leading Zionists such as Theodor Herzl, Achad Ha-am, Max Nordau, Shmarya Levin, Ussishkin, Jabotinsky, Ruppin. He describes the opposition by assimilationist Jews (like Edwin Montagu) to Zionism, and internal debates within the Zionist movement, such as the defeat of Herzl s Uganda plan   bitterly opposed by Weizmann   at the 6th Zionist Congress (1903) and his frictions with the American Zionists led by Brandeis. Weizmann describes how, during World War I, his work on acetone brought him into contact with British political leaders such as Lloyd George, Arthur Balfour and Winston Churchill and facilitated the Balfour Declaration which, in 1917, paved the way for  the establishment in Palestine of a national home for the Jewish people . Weizmann recounts his role in the creation of what would become Israel s leading scientific institutions, the Hebrew University, the Weizmann Institute of Science and the Technion, including his fundraising efforts in Europe and in the United States on their behalf and for other Zionist initiatives. He became the first President of Israel, and died in office in 1952.  ... one of the important historical documents of our time.    Orville Prescott, The New York Times (January 19, 1949)  [Trial and Error] is likely to be read for many years to come as an authoritative exposition of the Zionist movement ... records eye-witness accounts of so many crucial events and reflects so many deep insights that it is certain to become of permanent value to the scholar and a delight to the general reader.    Salo Baron, The New York Times (January 23, 1949)  There are four angles from which one can approach this book. One can take it as a history of Zionism during the last seventy years... a record of personal endeavour triumphant over obstacles and dissension... a sad commentary upon human achievement, when eventual triumph comes at a date, and in circumstances, which rob it of its full savour... the self-portrait of a most remarkable man.    Harold Nicolson, The Observer (March 27, 1949)  Notable in this intellectually candid record is the fact that [Weizmann] embraced and propagated Jewish nationalism because he regarded it as a positive good, not merely a negative escape from gentile persecution. This intensely human book, which in a sense is the story of modern Zionism, constitutes one of the indispensable sources for the history of our times.    Robert Gale Woolbert, Foreign Affairs (July 1949)  [Weizmann s] autobiography ... is an astonishingly objective and life-like narrative, without a trace of dramatization, exaggeration, vanity, self-pity, self-justification; it conveys his authentic, richly and evenly developed, autonomous, proud, firmly built, somewhat ironical nature, free from inner conflict, in deep, instinctive harmony with the forces of nature and society, and therefore possessed of natural wisdom, dignity and authority.    Sir Isaiah Berlin, Chichele Professor of Social and Political Theory, Oxford University (November 19, 1957)  Ranks between Churchill s war memoirs and those of Nehru, Masaryk and Trotzky, among the founders  own stories ... above all a human book, the record of the experiences and reactions of a man who fought over issues that were important    Congress Bulletin (April 1949)","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=el2mDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Phantom","description":"A journey through a land where Milo learns the importance of words and numbers provides a cure for his boredom.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=87UWNi83IrIC&dq=Phantom&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"World Guide to Tropical Drift Seeds and Fruits","description":"The majority of this work is devoted to a catalogue (with descriptions and illustrations) of sea-beans, tropical seeds and fruits that are distributed by river and ocean currents to shires around the world.

But if you were born after the baby boom, chances are the Bible seems more like an item of passing interest than a book of depth and meaning for the twenty-first century. If you're not familiar with the Bible, it can be difficult to put into perspective the puzzle of kings and prophets, giants and seven-headed dragons, shepherd boys and itinerant preachers, Old Testament law and New Testament grace. Meet the Bible introduces you to the full, epic sweep of the Bible -- the characters, the places, the times, the stories, and the meanings of this Book of books -- and shows you that even the most obscure passage can hold relevance for your life once you understand what to look for. Award-winning writer Philip Yancey and author Brenda Quinn are your guides on this one-year reading tour of the Bible. Each day's reading includes Scripture, contemporary commentary, and questions for contemplation -- all designed to offer insight into how the passage fits into the overall story of the Bible, and how it can speak to your life today. Meet the Bible takes you through the twists and turns of the Bible's many narratives, the high points and the low points, the good characters and the bad, as well as the eternal thoughts and descriptions of God and his Son, Jesus Christ. Here are stories to remember, images of real people and circumstances closer to your own life than you've ever imagined. By the time you've finished the year's worth of reading, you'll have gained a panoramic view of the whole Bible and a firm understanding of its ideas and teachings. If you've never read the Bible, or hardly know the Bible, or would just like to read the Bible in a fresh new way, Meet the Bible offers an inspiring mix of timeless wisdom and contemporary insight that will cause faith to ignite within you. Direct excerpts from Scripture give readers a panoramic tour of the Bible s key passages, personalities, events, and ideas as the Old Testament sweeps into the New Testament.

This program began with the attempt to analyze experimentally the simpler reproductive processes, but it at once became evident that the whole problem of the organic individual, its origin, development, physiological character, and limiting factors, was involved. In the study of the organic individual the importance of the physio logical age changes soon became apparent and it was found neces sary to devote considerable time to their analysis, for the origin of new individuals by reproduction is in many cases very closely associated with physiological aging. And since the conclusions reached concerning the age cycle finally attained a definite, positive form, differing to some extent from commonly accepted views, but seeming to throw some light upon various other biological problems, it has seemed desirable to attempt a general considera tion and synthesis of the subject of age changes from the point of view which has grown out of the research program mentioned above. It will appear clearly in the following pages that the problems of individuation, reproduction, and age are all closely connected. For that reason it has been necessary to devote a chapter - chap. Ix - to the problem of individuation and reproduction. This chapter is merely a brief statement of some Of the more important evidence and the conclusions reached concerning the nature of the organic individual, a full consideration of the subject being left to another time.

Farmers saw it as a \\"devil wagon\\" but later adopted it for use as an all-around device and power source. What makes a social group change its position about a particular artifact? How did the devil wagon overcome its notoriety to become a prosaic mainstream device? These questions direct the research in this book. While they may have been asked before, author Imes Chiu (PhD, Cornell University) brings a different and refreshing approach to the problem of newness. Preexisting practices and work routines used as explanatory devices have something interesting to say about diffusion strategies and localization measures. This innovative study examines the conversion of users. To understand the motivating factors in mass adoption, the study focuses on perceptions and practices associated with horses and motorcars in three different settings during three different periods. All three cases begin with the motorcar in the periphery: all three end with it achieving ubiquity. This multiple-case design is used for the purpose of theoretical replication. Results in all three cases show that a contrived likeness to its competitor-the horse-contributed to the motorcar's success.

He's got the ambitious and all-encompassing task of running St. Hilary's Parish, dealing with his busybody housekeeper, Mrs. Murkin, and counseling his flock with his characteristic blend of faith and compassion. He's not complaining, but it's no surprise that even a superior priest like Father Dowling needs a break now and again. So off he heads for a week-long retreat in Indiana on the quiet grounds of an old Catholic religious order, where he can meditate, reflect, and pray for a quick recharge of his waning energy. Unfortunately, Father Dowling's spiritual retreat turns into a baffling murder investigation when a dead man is found in a grotto on the grounds with the handle of an axe protruding from his back. Complicating matters is a long-running real-estate dispute that has pitted the brothers of the order against the previous owners of the huge and valuable piece of land on which their sanctuary sits. Who could have killed the man and why, and does it have something to do with the high-stakes mind games being played out between the parties vying for the land? No one's too sure, but what is clear is that Father Dowling is once again at the center of it all in another winning entry in a mystery series that's become an institution.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=FhBBe7fKBJMC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"PAST MASTER","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Peasants in the Pacific: Study of Fiji Rural Society (International Library of Society)","description":"This volume contains a comprehensive corpus-based study of prepositional constructions in written Fiji English. It explores the endo- and exonormative dynamics of norm-giving and norm-developing varieties and contributes to our understanding of structural nativization and variety formation in a multi-ethnic setting. The book provides an account of the sociolinguistic development of English in Fiji against the backdrop of the country's colonial and post-independence history, with special focus on the Indo-Fijian part of the population. Drawing on the written sections of the Indian, Great Britain, New Zealand and preliminary Fiji components of the International Corpus of English, quantitative and qualitative analyses of prepositional phenomena are conducted on the word level (frequency, semantic effects and stylistic variation), phrase level (productivity in verb-particle combinations), and pattern level (prepositions and -ing clauses).

Combining passages from Wittgenstein's writings with detailed interpretation and commentary, Hacker leads us into a world of philosophical investigation in which 'to smell a rat is ever so much easier than to trap it.' Wittgenstein claimed that the role of philosophy is to dissolve conceptual confusions, to untie the knots in our understanding that result from entanglement in the web of language. He overturned centuries of philosophical reflection on the nature of 'the inner', of our subjective experience and of our knowledge of self and others. Traditional conceptions of 'the outer', of human behaviour, were equally distorted and so too was the relation between the inner and the outer. Hacker shows how Wittgenstein's examination of our use of words clarifies our notions of mind, body and behaviour.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=xgw6AgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Midwife Challenge (Issues in Women's Health series)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Beauty of Horses","description":"Fritz, a pony excluded from the group of beautiful horses within the walled city, becomes a hero when he rescues the children of the city. \\"Brett has created magnificent paintings that glorify her simple but engaging story\\".--Publishers Weekly.

One of the most famous philosophers to teach in this school is now known as Philo of Alexandria or Philo the Jew. According to many biblical scholars, Philo's essays on the allegorical interpretation of scripture may be the most valuable legacy he left behind. It was the allegorical rather than the literal interpretation that Philo considered most important. He taught that it was the meaning behind the story that conveyed the deeper \\"Truths.\\" Philo left examples of the \\"allegorical messages\\" that could be found in the Torah, and he encouraged his students and followers to seek to find these higher meanings in scripture and myth. But the church leaders who ultimately gave birth to today's Christianity were split over this issue of \\"allegory\\" versus \\"literal.\\" When Constantine claimed conversion in the fourth century and joined forces with the church fathers struggling for control over the masses, it was the literal rather than the allegorical interpretation that won out. With Constantine's help, the \\"Literalists\\" gained control and the \\"Allegorists\\" found themselves thrown into the \\"Heretic\\" pile. They were denigrated as Satanists, hunted down, tortured, and murdered - often roasted over open fires and their bodies eventually burned. Their \\"heretical\\" manuscripts which attempted to teach the allegorical meaning of scripture were also burned, and the libraries that held them usually went up in the same smoke. But a few copies of Philo's \\"Rules for the Allegorical Interpretation of Scripture\\" survived. And a modern biblical investigator has set about using them to interpret Luke-Acts allegorically. Luke, it seems, used a clever technique that virtually assured the intact transmission of his message. All that was needed was someone to apply Philo's rules to the two texts to uncover an amazing story that totally redefines who Jesus was and what happened to him and his message two thousand years ago. In addition to the story unearthed beneath allusions to the classics, the Old Testament, ancient myths, and code-names and words, is Luke's true identity. He was not \\"Paul's beloved physician,\\" as has been claimed during the past two millennia. His identity is almost as unexpected as the \\"good news\\" about Jesus that Luke buried behind references to the prophet Isaiah and the opening lines of Phaenomena by Aratus, a Greek poet of Cilicia. Portions of the introduction to Anna's Angel, a novel based on Plutarch's Parable, explain: Fact: Apollonius of Tyana was born circa 4 BCE to a very wealthy family. He received a Pythagorean education, adopted the Pythagorean lifestyle, and traveled extensively throughout the Roman Empire, teaching and establishing congregations wherever he went. He made several trips to Alexandria, Egypt, where he described the Therapeuts living near Lake Mareotis. He lived and taught his philosophy until circa 96 ACE. Fact: Philo of Alexandria's date of birth is uncertain. Estimates are based on the things about which he wrote and when he ceased writing. His writing began circa 30 and ceased, circa 50 ACE; therefore, his estimated date of birth ranges from 2 to 30 BCE. Little is known about him other than what he, himself, reported. He, too, wrote about the group of Therapeuts that resided at Lake Mareotis, near Alexandria. Fact: Thanks to Josephus, more is known about Philo's brother, Alexander, but what is known about him should also apply to Philo in some ways. According to Josephus Alexander was a wealthy and prominent Roman government official, a customs agent responsible for collecting dues on all goods imported into Egypt from the East.

His patients and their families know him simply as Dr. Fred, the \\"miracle man\\" who has extended them both a healing hand and an open heart. \\"I simply can't accept the idea of kids dying,\\" is how Epstein explains his commitment to saving patients. As a child, he had to overcome severe learning disabilities to realize his dream of becoming a doctor. Later, as the world's leading pediatric neurosurgeon, he did whatever it took to rescue children that other doctors had given up on. Epstein credits his young patients as his most important teachers. \\"We tend to think of children as fragile, little people,\\" he writes. \\"To me, they're giants.\\" If I Get to Five relates the unforgettable experiences he's shared with children-lessons in courage, compassion, love, and hope-that we can all draw on to overcome adversity at any stage of life. In If I Get to Five, Epstein meditates on these lessons at a time when they parallel his own experiences, as he recovers from a near-fatal head injury.

Such a man was Richard Halliburton - Dreamer -Traveler - Poet - Bon Vivant and doomed to die. \\"Seven League Boots\\" was his fifth and last book, and details his epic adventures in a variety of remote places. \\"I had been commissioned to go anywhere in the world I wished and write whatever pleased me. My only orders were to move fast, visit strange places, to meet whomever was interesting - and to start at once,\\" Halliburton wrote. His subsequent book illustrates how he followed these orders with passion and abandon. America's favorite adventure writer dined with Emperor Haile Selassie in Ethiopia, interviewed the infamous assassin of Czar Nicholas II in Russia, tried to sneak into the forbidden city of Mecca, and finally, rode an elephant over the Alps in the tracks of Hannibal. It is Halliburton at his best, reckless and romantic, and it is the last chapter of a life grown tragic. Incapable of writing a dull page, Halliburton nevertheless was a captive of his own press. His insatiable readers demanded ever more death-defying accounts. Nearing forty, physically exhausted, and in financial trouble, Halliburton thought to roll the dice once again, hoping that the charm which had always saved him in the past would materialize one more time. It didn't! Soon after finishing this book, the intrepid traveler ignored the warnings of seasoned sailors and set sail on the ship that would take him away from his book-hungry public and into the arms of a watery death.

The recent surge of interest in artificial life has pushed a whole range of engineering traditions, such as control theory and robotics, beyond classical notions of goal and planning into biologically inspired notions of viability and adaptation, situatedness and operational closure. These proceedings serve two important functions: they address bottom-up theories of artificial intelligence and explore what can be learned from simple models such as insects about the cognitive processes and characteristic autonomy of living organisms, while also engaging researchers and philosophers in an exciting examination of the epistemological basis of this new trend.

In everyday life people mourn the loss of valued landscapes and urban spaces. Underlying these problems are conflicting priorities and values. Yet dominant approaches to policy-making seem ill-equipped to capture the various ways in which the environment matters to us. Environmental Values introduces readers to these issues by presenting, and then challenging, two dominant approaches to environmental decision-making, one from environmental economics, the other from environmental philosophy. The authors present a sustained case for questioning the underlying ethical theories of both of these traditions. They defend a pluralistic alternative rooted in the rich everyday relations of humans to the environments they inhabit, providing a path for integrating human needs with environmental protection through an understanding of the narrative and history of particular places. The book examines the implications of this approach for policy issues such as biodiversity conservation and sustainability. Written in a clear and accessible style for an interdisciplinary audience, this volume will be ideal for student use in environmental courses in geography, economics, philosophy, politics and sociology.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=cbuGAgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Passtrak Series 7 Premier Set","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=cDBcAAAACAAJ&dq=Passtrak+Series+7+Premier+Set&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"MARIA CALLAS: Sacred Monster","description":"An inquiry into the life and career of one of this century's most celebrated opera singers reveals her personal thoughts and provides a view of each of her roles","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=5xU6AQAAIAAJ&dq=MARIA+CALLAS:+Sacred+Monster&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Daughter by Spirit","description":"A revised and expanded edition of the bestselling Explorations of a Cosmic Soul.

The great bulk of research in this field has occurred during the last half century, yet no comprehensive attempt has been made to record it. Recognizing the need for an up-to-date guide to such investigations, G. Thomas Tanselle has compiled a listing of the principal material dealing with printing and publishing in this country. In his introduction Mr. Tanselle surveys the research which has attempted to trace the history of printing and publishing in America from its inception to the present and explains how this material can be utilized effectively. In nine carefully arranged categories he covers bibliographies of imprints of particular localities; bibliographies of works in particular genres; listings of all editions and printings of works by individual writers; copyright records; catalogues of auction houses, book dealers, exhibitions, institutional libraries, and private collections; retrospective book-trade directories; studies of individual printers and publishers; general studies of printing and publishing; and checklists of secondary material. From the mass of material, an appendix selects 250 titles. Although the work is arranged so that the reader may easily locate relevant sections, a comprehensive index provides further aid in finding individual items. \\"A successful checklist,\\" writes the author, \\"is not merely a work to be consulted for information but also a nucleus around which additional information can be gathered in a meaningful way; it provides a framework into which the community of workers in a field can place further references in an organized fashion.\\" Guide to the Study of United States Imprints is a reference tool designed to serve both as a guide to research and as a practical manual for use in identifying, cataloguing, and recording printed matter.

Now, drawing on new interviews, previously unpublished letters and archives on both sides of the Atlantic, literary gumshoe Tom Williams casts light on this most mysterious of writers. The Chandler revealed is a man troubled by loneliness and desertion from an early age  experiences that fuelled his writing as much as they scarred his life. Born in Chicago in 1888, his childhood was overshadowed by the cruel collapse of his parents  marriage and his father s alcohol-fuelled violence. After his mother fled America, Chandler was schooled in London, but felt constrained by the stuffy English class system, eventually returning to the land of his birth, where  in corruption-ridden Los Angeles  he met his one great love: Cissy Pascal, a married woman 18 years his senior. It was only during middle age, after his own alcoholism wrecked a lucrative career as an oilman, that Chandler seriously turned to crime fiction, although his success was to prove bittersweet. An obsessive attitude towards his craft, unrealised literary ambitions and a suicidal turn after Cissy s death combined to prevent him from recapturing the verve of his earlier writing. But his legacy  the lonely, ambiguous world of Philip Marlowe  endures, compelling generation after generation of crime writers to go down mean streets. In this long-awaited new biography, the most thorough and comprehensive yet written, Tom Williams shadows one of the twentieth century s true literary giants and considers how crime was raised to the level of art.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=hDfLAgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Gentle Pirate","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=cMvhKAAACAAJ&dq=Gentle+Pirate&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Indian Side of the Whitman Massacre","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=PCYPAAAACAAJ&dq=The+Indian+Side+of+the+Whitman+Massacre&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Motorcyclist BMW Files: Selected Road Tests 1971-1995","description":"Many areas of knowledge converge in the building industry and therefore research in this field necessarily involves an interdisciplinary approach.

Impossible, says Kevin Trudeau, the world's foremost authority on memory improvement training. There are no bad memories, only untrained memories. In order to release our natural memory, Trudeau says, we just need to learn to retrieve what we already know. As founder of the American Memory Institute, Kevin Trudeau has already helped more than one million people do just that. Each Mega Memory lesson in this book takes no more than thirty minutes per day and uses pictures, rather than the laborious word-association techniques of other memory systems, to activate our inborn memory. With this easy-to-follow system, you'll be able to instantly remember names, phone numbers, addresses, financial data, speeches, and schoolwork. Even better, Trudeau's system ensures instant recall and long-term Mega Memory. All you need is the desire to unleash your Mega Memory, and you can reap all these incredible rewards! Labeled with a learning disability at an early age, Kevin Trudeau was convinced his problem was an inability to recall information. He read everything he could on memory improvement. Eventually, he developed his own program for memory retrieval and formed the American Memory Institute. His Mega Memory home study system is the most utilized self-improvement series of all time.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=nI4pXULkI6UC&dq=Kevin+Trudeau%27s+Mega+Memory+(8+audio+cassettes)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Technical Guide to IPSec Virtual Private Networks","description":"What is IPSec?

At some point all of us have been mystified or terrified or delighted by a vivid dream, and we all wonder -- what do our dreams mean? In her inspiring book, Dream Power, Los Angeles Times dream columnist Cynthia Richmond draws on her experience as a therapist and dream counselor to show us how to harness the power of our dreams and make our life goals come true. Understanding our dreams can give us a huge advantage in all facets of life, Richmond demonstrates -- in work, love, health, and spirituality. \\"By listening to what your subconscious mind and your spirit tell you through your dreams,\\" she predicts, \\"you will have all the tools you need to achieve the life you want.\\" But before we can interpret our dreams -- and change our lives -- we need to learn how to remember them, and so Dream Power begins with a simple tutorial in the art of recall. After providing us with practical, step-by-step techniques for gaining access to our dream lives, Richmond then charts the landscape of dream themes and their rich, perplexing meanings. Most of us have dreams that fall into certain important categories -- dreams of departed loved ones, schools and tests, flying, water, public nudity, and sex. Analyzing more than 200 real-life dreams (some from celebrities such as Jane Seymour and Kelsey Grammer), Richmond reveals the common themes, symbols, and meanings that run throughout them. Our dreams express universal hopes and fears, and these Richmond explores with warmth and insight. But she also takes traditional dream interpretation an important step further, showing us how to transform our insights into life-changing opportunities. To understand our dreams fully, she insists, we must look deep into our hearts and souls and ask: What do we want out of our lives? What are we afraid of and what do we love? Who are we? The answers to these questions will come to us in our sleep, if we recognize the wisdom and truth of the dream world. \\"Every one of us has a lesson to learn and a gift to offer to the world,\\" Richmond declares. The wisdom of those lessons can help us make powerful changes in our spiritual, social, professional, and romantic lives. As Cynthia Richmond shows us with authority and inspiration, the path to a better life is only a dream away.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=xjc8KnR5f4oC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Fires of Zatal (Advanced Dungeons & Dragons, 2nd Edition)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=i05LPQAACAAJ&dq=Fires+of+Zatal+(Advanced+Dungeons&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Time Out Of Joint","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Inside France's Dgse: The General Directorate for External Security (Inside the World's Most Famous Intelligence Agencies)","description":"An introduction to the history, functions, and current goals of France's intelligence agency, the DGSE or Direction gaenaerale de la saecuritae extaerieure.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=R4Hh6DoWv1sC&dq=Inside+France%27s+Dgse:+The+General+Directorate+for+External+Security+(Inside+the+World%27s+Most+Famous+Intelligence+Agencies)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Women And The Family In Rural Taiwan","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=8Rex6A_QI5wC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Just a Matter of Time","description":"An old lady's will seems to be causing quite a stir.

More than 50 years later, war rages on, with America giving $3 billion annually in aid to Israel. Has America's one-sided policy led to terrorism on all sides? Liza Elliott, Ph.D explains here the ways the truth about the Middle East has been covered up--and runs contrary to everything Americans have learned. This book examines what politicians don't want you to know about U.S. foreign policy in the Middle East and the reason Palestinian children find martyrdom attractive. She also discusses ways America has derailed the Palestinian statehood and supported ethnic and religious cleansing--while sidestepping the Geneva Convention. Dr. Elliott describes what life is like inside the occupied territories where America spends $10 million a day to push Palestinians off their land.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=WJ-d4zu7BQ8C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"That ye might have","description":"A reasonably priced, quality black hardcover pew and ministry Bible featuring a large 12-point font.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=rbQ4MAEACAAJ&dq=That+ye+might+have&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Ceramics","description":"This studio reference captures all the popular techniques available for embellishing clay, as well as a wealth of practical information and detailed images that lead readers through every phase of the design and decorating process.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=vSw_fU0LbooC&dq=Ceramics&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Park Is Mine","description":"A crazed Vietnam veteran, armed with a Vietcong AK-47 assault rifle, takes possession of Central Park, enclosing it with concertina wire and boobytrapping it with mines, and initiates a guerrilla-style battle","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=-dwOAQAAMAAJ&dq=The+Park+Is+Mine&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"State of War","description":"From the #1 New York Times bestselling creators of Op-Center comes a different kind of law enforcement.

His dialogue--abrasive, rhythmic--illuminates a modern aesthetic evocative of Samuel Beckett. His plots--surprising, comic, topical--have evoked comparisons to masters from Alfred Hitchcock to Arthur Miller. Here are two screenplays demonstrating the astounding range of Mamet's talents. The Spanish Prisoner, a neo-noir thriller about a research-and-development cog hoodwinked out of his own brilliant discovery, demonstrates Mamet's incomparable use of character in a dizzying tale of twists and mistaken identity. The Winslow Boy, Mamet's revisitation of Terence Rattigan's classic 1946 play, tells of a thirteen-year-old boy accused of stealing a five-shilling postal order and the tug of war for truth that ensues between his middle-class family and the Royal Navy. Crackling with wit, intelligent and surprising, The Spanish Prisoner and The Winslow Boy celebrate Mamet's unique genius and our eternal fascination with the extraordinary predicaments of the common man.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=oEMwY9kGHREC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"VW Passat 1998-2001 & Audi A4 1996-2001 (Chilton's Total Car Care Repair Manuals)","description":"A guide to buying a used car or minivan features information on the strengths and weaknesses of each model, a safety summary, recalls, warranties, and service tips.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=QEL3UGeukCUC&dq=VW+Passat+1998-2001&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Foxprints","description":"There's merry mischief in the London suburbs...but isn't murder taking the fun too far?","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=KmW8Ui4saMUC&dq=Foxprints&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Veil Will Be Lifted","description":"This is the most accurate book on Bible prophecy ever published.

Later, near Garrison, New York, Montoya acquired land and built his place of solace, his own La Formentera. He fulfilled his dream of a property that could evoke the same majesty of that island s rocky terrain, without the Mediterranean climate. The retreat is made up of an elegantly simple Japanese-style house and 100 acres of pristine landscape, shaped by Montoya himself. Setting out on the paths, one encounters massive stone sculptures, an inviting pool complex, and rustic shelters made of rough stone. A rushing brook runs through the property, and empties into a lake with a small island where thousands of daffodils bloom in the spring. La Formentera is the perfect refuge for Montoya, whose credo is,  I want to be surrounded by beauty and creativity.  Photographer Eric Piasecki has captured that beauty and creativity inherent to this unique place in all seasons from the deep greens of summer, to the golden leaves of fall, to the pristine snow drifts of winter, to the first blush of spring. Karen Bloch's engaging text tells the remarkable story of the property, as well as the great pleasure it gives Juan Montoya and all who visit there.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ybdvDwAAQBAJ&dq=Juan+Montoya&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Vietnamese for Everyone: Mastering Vietnamese Through English","description":"'Vietnamense for everyone' is a comprehensive and definitive guide to the Vietnamese language.

The original Volume Three (Fighters and Bombers 1935 to 1950) has now been split into separate volumes with this book covering fighters and a new Volume Four in preparation solely devoted to bomber designs. This split has allowed space for the inclusion of much new information and many new photographs. This book describes the design and development of the British fighter from the end of the biplane fighter to the start of the jet era. The projects and programs which feature in its pages begin with those prepared in the mid-1930s in the knowledge that war was coming and go through to some which appeared after the war had ended. During this period the art of fighter design took some big and important steps forward and here can be found fixed-gun fighters and turret fighters, in both single and twin-engine form, plus the first generation of jet fighters. Types such as the Folland Fo.118 and the Westland P.13 and many more which were designed to meet the requirements of both the Royal Air Force and the Fleet Air Arm are included. As with the companion volumes, the author has undertaken extensive research and made full use of primary source material. Three-view drawings plus photographs of models or original artist's impressions combine to show how these unbuilt designs would have appeared. Data and appendices summarize the projects, contracts and specifications and provide a detailed insight into many fascinating aircraft.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=2qaPtAEACAAJ&dq=British+Secret+Projects+3:+Fighters+and+Bombers+1935-1950&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Winter Pleasures","description":"Sienne, a sex slave from Sudhra, is delivered to the neighboring country of Nordan and presented to Lord Marken's hedonistic court as a diplomatic gift to entertain him over the long, harsh Nordan winter.

Morrison's national bestsellers Never Again Once More and He's Just a Friend, readers met playboy heir Darius Jones and reckless-in-love Fancy Taylor. Now, in this achingly poignant, deliciously sensual erotic novel, she takes Darius's relationships further and explores the ways men and women surrender themselves in order to gain the love they're desperately seeking. . . \\"The only time a woman should be on top is during sex. . .\\" So says Darius Jones. At just twenty-two, the baby boy has grown--bigger, taller, sexier, hotter--but he hasn't necessarily grown up. Maybe he isn't messing with the women on his mama's staff anymore, but he's still messing with people's lives and messing up his own. For Darius, \\"If it doesn't make money, it doesn't make sense.\\" And that goes for women, too. Women are there to give him what he wants, the way he wants it. Not that he doesn't know how to pleasure a sister; he just doesn't want them telling him the way it's going to be. On anything. Ever. Including his mother. If his mother was a liar, then every other woman was, too. That's why he relocates from Washington, D.C. to Los Angeles, near his mama's business, where he sets up his own company, Somebody's Gotta Be on Top Enterprises. And it's no secret who that somebody's got to be. Now that Darius is all about the control--getting it, keeping it, and taking it away, if need be--he's sure he can apply that principle to finding \\"the one.\\" But trying to be on top all the time only gets him into trouble with the women in his life, women like. . . Ciara Monroe, president of a rival company. She's earned power and respect the hard way, but Darius isn't about to be outsmarted by her. . .not in bed and not in business. He's going after Ciara on a personal level, digging up the dirt on her past. It's a move that will cost him, and Ciara's not leaving before she confronts him about his feelings for Ashlee. . . Ashlee Anderson is the stepsister who's more than just his friend. She's also the woman he loves and desires. When Darius convinces Ashlee to live with him and manage his finance department, he never expects her to fall for his half-brother, Kevin Williams. Darius will do anything to split them apart, even if it means risking his business. But there's one woman who's got Darius's number. . . Fancy Taylor. With skin like brown sugar, and the bearing of a fine queen, Fancy definitely intrigues Darius. If he didn't have his heart set on conquering Ashlee no matter what, he'd enjoy sampling what the lady has to offer, but that's all. Fancy's a woman with a past that precludes her from being serious relationship material. But fate has a way of stepping in and putting the wrong people on the right path, if they're not too foolish to see it. . . Still harboring the wounds of his mother's deception and a childhood without his biological father, caught between an all-consuming pride and the call of his own untrusting heart, Darius has a lot to learn: about life, women, and what it takes to find and nurture real love. And if he's not careful, he might just end up on the bottom of everything.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=PpGWBgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Associated Press Stylebook and Libel Manual: Including Guidelines on Photo Captions, Filing the Wire, Proofreaders' Marks, Copyright","description":"In this style manual, more than 5,000 entries clarify the AP's rules on grammar, spelling, punctuation and usage, with extra sections about reporting business and sports.

Designed as a portable resource, the book provides typical dictations to guide the resident. Comprised of 226 procedures, this new edition comprises the majority of procedures commonly performed by general and vascular surgeons. For each procedure, a list of common indications is given. This list covers 95% of the situations in which a particular procedure will be used. A list of essential steps follows. These can be used to mentally rehearse the procedure before it is performed. The next heading, Note these technical variations, introduces a list that is intended to prompt the surgeon for particular things to note and dictate within the template. A list of possible complications that are typically associated with that particular surgical procedure follows. Finally, a template operative dictation is provided. Common opening and terminating sequences (for example, how to enter and close the abdomen) in all laparotomy dictations are included. The volume has two primary objectives. First, it is designed to serve as a source of model operative dictations that may be individualized and used as templates. Second, it is intended as an aide-memoir, giving the surgeon a short list of pertinent information about each procedure. Ample space is provided to allow each surgeon to add notes. By reviewing this introductory material before scrubbing on a procedure, the trainee surgeon will enter the operating room better prepared to participate actively and to learn as much as possible. At the end of training, this book, with the notes accumulated by the resident, will serve as an invaluable review resource analogous to the individualized notebooks many surgeons keep. Operative Dictations in General and Vascular Surgery, Second Edition is intended for practicing surgeons, who may modify each template to reflect their own individual practice. It also serves as a concise reminder of essential steps in those operations that may be only rarely performed.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Bzlg0Z4v91UC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Having the Bachelor's Baby (Silhouette Special Edition #1658)","description":"Bachelor's Baby Promise by Barbara McMahon released on Sep 22, 2000 is available now for purchase.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=DBzPECoArhgC&dq=Having+the+Bachelor%27s+Baby+(Silhouette+Special+Edition&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Mind Set!","description":"The updated edition of the bestselling book that has changed millions of lives with its insights into the growth mindset  Through clever research studies and engaging writing, Dweck illuminates how our beliefs about our capabilities exert tremendous influence on how we learn and which paths we take in life.  Bill Gates, GatesNotes After decades of research, world-renowned Stanford University psychologist Carol S. Dweck, Ph.D., discovered a simple but groundbreaking idea: the power of mindset. In this brilliant book, she shows how success in school, work, sports, the arts, and almost every area of human endeavor can be dramatically influenced by how we think about our talents and abilities. People with a fixed mindset those who believe that abilities are fixed are less likely to flourish than those with a growth mindset those who believe that abilities can be developed. Mindset reveals how great parents, teachers, managers, and athletes can put this idea to use to foster outstanding accomplishment. In this edition, Dweck offers new insights into her now famous and broadly embraced concept. She introduces a phenomenon she calls false growth mindset and guides people toward adopting a deeper, truer growth mindset. She also expands the mindset concept beyond the individual, applying it to the cultures of groups and organizations. With the right mindset, you can motivate those you lead, teach, and love to transform their lives and your own.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=fdjqz0TPL2wC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Where's the rest of me?","description":"President Reagan recounts his childhood, education, acting career, two marriages, and the events that shaped his political philosophy","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=VIbDQgAACAAJ&dq=Where%27s+the+rest+of+me%3F&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Writing Contracts in Plain English","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=McQ8AQAAIAAJ&dq=Writing+Contracts+in+Plain+English&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Wild Woman's Guide to Etiquette: Saving the World One Handshake at a Time","description":"A guide to etiquette in various social settings.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=RoZ1AgAAQBAJ&dq=Wild+Woman%27s+Guide+to+Etiquette:+Saving+the+World+One+Handshake+at+a+Time&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Realm of Measure: from the yardstick to the Theory of Relativity","description":"Measuring things has become so much a part of daily life that most people take it for granted.

His Westerns, including The Searchers, Stagecoach, and The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance, have had an enormous influence on contemporary U.S. filmmakers, and on everything from Star Wars to Taxi Driver.In nine majors essays from some of the most prominent scholars of Hollywood film, John Ford Made Westerns: Filming The Legend in The Sound Era situates the sound era westerns of John Ford within contemporary critical contexts and regards them from fresh perspectives. These range from examining Ford's relation to other art forms (most notably literature, painting and music) to exploring the development of the director's public reputation as a director of Westerns. Articles also address the intricacies of Ford's shifting approach to storytelling and the subtle techniques whereby Ford's films guide spectator interpretation and emotional engagement.While giving attention to film style and structure, the volume also explores the ways in which these much loved films engage with notions of masculinity and gender roles, capitalism and community, as well as racial and sexual identity. Authors also examine how Ford's sound-era Westerns create a complex relationship to the genre's traditional project of \\"defining an American nation\\" and how they uphold up but also question popular culture depictions of history and nationhood, to offer a commentary that engages with both the past, the present and the future.In addition to new scholarship, the volume also offers a dossier section of out of the way magazine articles that illuminate the issues raised by essays, including the director's tribute to John Wayne as well as a moving posthumous appraisal of the director published by the Director's Guild of America.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=nItcRD7se7sC&dq=John+Ford+Made+Westerns:+Filming+the+Legend+in+the+Sound+Era&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Nappy Hair 101","description":"To many, hair care is finding the least expensive shampoo and a $10 haircut.

This guide breaks down by system the routine maintenance procedures every boat owner should know, presenting in more digestible chunks the upkeep of any modern boat, whether it's 16 or 60 feet, inboard or outboard, open-hulled or cabin-equipped.
