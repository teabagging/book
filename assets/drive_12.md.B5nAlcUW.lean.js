Combining humour with strong argument, Nick Page analyses how worship song writers have bought into a disposable, 'pop-song' model; how they have filled their songs with a kind of semi-Biblical code and how songs suffer from poor technique and a lack of specialist lyric writers. Above all it encourages writers to really think about the words of their songs and whether they really communicate truth about God - truth which should lead to worship.

Arguing that there was a common foundation beneath the diverse strands of thought of this period, he shows how Enlightenment philosophers drew upon the ideas of the preceding centuries even while radically transforming them to fit the modern world. In Cassirer's view, the Enlightenment liberated philosophy from the realm of pure thought and restored it to its true place as an active and creative force through which knowledge of the world is achieved. In a new foreword, Peter Gay considers The Philosophy of the Enlightenment in the context in which it was written--Germany in 1932, on the precipice of the Nazi seizure of power and one of the greatest assaults on the ideals of the Enlightenment. He also argues that Cassirer's work remains a trenchant defense against enemies of the Enlightenment in the twenty-first century.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=OPmPDwAAQBAJ&dq=The+philosophy+of+the+enlightenment&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Moscow Madness: Crime, Corruption, and One Man's Pursuit of Profit in the New Russia","description":"Journalist Tim Harper reports on American entrepreneur Rick Grajirena's attempts to develop a market in the New Russia for Miller Beer.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=VZS4AAAAIAAJ&dq=Moscow+Madness:+Crime,+Corruption,+and+One+Man%27s+Pursuit+of+Profit+in+the+New+Russia&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Rabbinic Literature: an Essential Guide","description":"An insightful and illuminating guide to Judaism's basic tenets and practices.

In his absorbing new book, Robert Irwin, Arabist and novelist, examines its history and allure. The Alhambra is the only Muslim palace to have survived since the Middle Ages. Built by a threatened dynasty of Muslim Spain, it was preserved as a monument to the triumph of Christianity. Every day thousands of tourists enter this magnificent site to be awestruck by its towers and courts, its fountained gardens, its honeycombed ceilings and intricate tile work. It is a complex full of mysteries--even its purpose is unclear. Its sophisticated ornamentation is not indiscriminate but full of hidden meaning. Its most impressive buildings were designed not by architects, but by philosophers and poets. The Alhambra, which resembles a fairy-tale palace, was constructed by slave labor in an era of economic decline, plague, and political violence. Its sumptuously appointed halls have lain witness to murder and mayhem. Yet its influence on art and on literature--including Orientalist painting and the architecture of cinemas, Washington Irving and Jorge Luis Borges--has been lasting and significant. As our guide to this architectural masterpiece, Robert Irwin allows us to fully understand the impact of the Alhambra.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=1XpJEAAAQBAJ&dq=The+Alhambra&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"King Kelson's Bride","description":" Kurtz s strengths lie in her patient accumulation of telling detail, well-articulated plots, and believable magics.

Based on twenty years of research and recently unearthed evidence, this true crime and legal history is the  definitive account to date of one of America s most notorious and enduring murder mysteries  (Publishers Weekly, starred review). When Andrew and Abby Borden were brutally hacked to death in Fall River, Massachusetts, in August 1892, the arrest of the couple s younger daughter Lizzie turned the case into international news and her murder trial into a spectacle unparalleled in American history. Reporters flocked to the scene. Well-known columnists took up conspicuous seats in the courtroom. The defendant was relentlessly scrutinized for signs of guilt or innocence. Everyone rich and poor, suffragists and social conservatives, legal scholars and laypeople had an opinion about Lizzie Borden s guilt or innocence. Was she a cold-blooded murderess or an unjustly persecuted lady? Did she or didn t she? An essential piece of American mythology, the popular fascination with the Borden murders has endured for more than one hundred years. Told and retold in every conceivable genre, the murders have secured a place in the American pantheon of mythic horror. In contrast,  Cara Robertson presents the story with the thoroughness one expects from an attorney Fans of crime novels will love it  (Kirkus Reviews). Based on transcripts of the Borden legal proceedings, contemporary newspaper accounts, unpublished local accounts, and recently unearthed letters from Lizzie herself, The Trial of Lizzie Borden is  a fast-paced, page-turning read  (Booklist, starred review) that offers a window into America in the Gilded Age.

It deals with a number of key topics that are central to the understanding and appreciation of this major seventeenth-century writer. These include his debt to the hermetic philosophy espoused by his twin brother (the alchemist, Thomas Vaughan); his royalist allegiance in the Civil War; his loyalty to the outlawed Church of England during the Interregnum; the unusual degree of intertextuality in his poetry (especially with the Scriptures and the devotional lyrics of George Herbert); and his literary treatment of the natural world (which has been variously interpreted from Christian, proto-Romantic, and ecological perspectives). Each of the chapters is self-contained and places its topic in relation to past and current critical debates, but the book is organized so that the biographical, intellectual, and political focus of Part One informs the discussion of poetic craftsmanship in Part Two. A wealth of historical information and close critical readings provide an accessible introduction to the poet and his period for students and general readers alike.

Although it did not directly involve itself in European affairs, the United States did engage regularly in dangerous struggles with other states and with colonial powers with territory on the American periphery. Aside from the War of 1812, the Oregon Crisis, and the Mexican War, other \\"near misses\\" included here disputes of 1807 and 1809 with Britain, with Spain over East Florida in 181113, with Mexico in 1853, and disputes with Spain over Cuba in 185355 and with Mexico in 18581860 have been ignored in the democratic peace literature. Scott A. Silverstone finds these cases particularly useful for testing alternative explanations of constraints on armed conflict, because the United States backed down each time, allowing each crisis to pass short of its full potential for violence. Silverstone builds on a nascent theory of institutional constraints on the use of force presented in the Federalist Papers to explain American attitudes toward participation in conflicts. He argues that the federal character of American democracy that emerged from the founding and the large size of the new American republic provide the keys to understanding its decision-making processes. Divided Union shows how the institutional features of federal union and the diverse social, economic, and security interests within this geographically extended republic created political conditions that impeded the use of force by the United States before the Civil War.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=F6JhDwAAQBAJ&dq=Divided+Union:+The+Politics+of+War+in+the+Early+American+Republic+(Cornell+Studies+in+Security+Affairs)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Dubuque on the Mississippi, 1788-1988","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=dXwcPQAACAAJ&dq=Dubuque+on+the+Mississippi,+1788-1988&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Manga Mania: Chibi and Furry Characters: How to Draw the Adorable Mini-characters and Cool Cat-girls of Japanese Comics","description":"A best-selling author of cartoon and drawing titles shows readers exactly how to draw chibis, infusing them with personality and creating authentic costumes for them, in crystal clear, step-by-step drawings.

It is one of many fruits of the civilization which combined and transformed the classical Greek and Christian traditions. Justinian was completing the process begun by Constantine the Great (who died in A.D. 337) of forming a new state, a new society, and a new culture to replace the disrupted Roman Empire. As the chief center of the new civilization, Constantinople was the place in which the government, literature, art, and architecture of the new epoch found their fullest expression. With Justinian's own creation, the magnificent church of Sancta Sophia, as its center, Christianity can here be seen transforming the whole Near Eastern world according to its principles. And not the least important part of this masterfully drawn picture is the piety, the daily working of faith, in a society at last dedicated to one God. -- Dust jacket flaps.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=vJhZAAAAYAAJ&dq=Constantinople+in+the+Age+of+Justinian&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Casanova's Homecoming","description":"Casanova was in his fifty-third year.

His yearning for Venice, the city of his birth, grew so intense that, like a wounded bird slowly circling downwards in its death flight, he began to move in ever-narrowing circles. Again and again, during the last ten years of his exile, he had implored the Supreme Council for leave to return home. Erstwhile, in the drafting of these petitions - a work in which he was a past master - a defiant, wilful spirit seemed to have guided his pen; at times even he appeared to take a grim delight in his forwardness. But of late his requests had been couched in humble, beseeching words which displayed, ever more plainly, the ache of homesickness and genuine repentance.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=3kb0LP9wKvQC&dq=Casanova%27s+Homecoming&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Beckett Baseball Card Price Guide","description":"\\"The #1 authority on collectibles\\"--Cover.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=jfcAzgEACAAJ&dq=Beckett+Baseball+Card+Price+Guide&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Child's Book of Wisdom, A","description":"Drawing from the wisdom of Proverbs, this book can help children apply the positive traits and qualities therein.

Which of them is still human, and which a perfect alien facsimile? John Carpenter's The Thing, the second adaptation of John W. Campbell's 1938 novella Who Goes There?, received overwhelmingly negative reviews on its release in 1982, but has since been acknowledged as a classic fusion of the science fiction and horror genres. Now a regular fixture in lists of the greatest movies of all time, it is acclaimed for its inspired and still shocking practical special effects, its deftly sketched characters brought to life by a superb cast, elegant widescreen cinematography, ominous score, and a uniquely tense narrative packed with appropriately ever-changing metaphors about the human condition. Anne Billson's elegant and trenchant study, first published in 1997, was one of the first publications to give the film its due as a modern classic, hailing it as a landmark movie that brilliantly redefined horror and science fiction conventions, and combined them with sly humour, Lewis Carroll logic and disturbingly prescient metaphors for many of the sociopolitical, scientific and medical upheavals of the past three decades. In her foreword to this new edition, Anne Billson reflects upon The Thing's changing fortunes in the years since its release, its influence on film-makers including Tarantino and del Toro, and its topicality in an era of melting ice caps and with humanity besieged by a deadly organism.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=mAU0EAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Engineering for Steel Construction: A Source Book on Connections","description":"The book introduces all the aspects needed for the safe and economic design and analysis of connections using bolted joints in steel structures.

A battle test of that doctrine's effectiveness occurred from June through August 1939 along the Outer Mongolian-Manchurian border, This essay follows the daily combat operations of the lJA's 2d Battalion, 28th Infantry Regiment, 7th Infantry Division, for a two-month period. During that time, the 2/28th Infantry was in constant contact with Soviet combined arms forces. In July the battalion participated in offensive operations against Soviet units commanded by General Georgi K. Zhukov. When Japanese tactical doctrine failed against a Soviet combined arms force, the Japanese went on the defensive. Japanese officers, however, regarded defensive doctrine as transitional in nature and adopted it only to gain time to prepare for a counterattack. Defensive doctrine dictated that terrain be held until the resumption of offensive operations that would destroy the enemy.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=a2TpAAAAIAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Malcontents","description":"Author Reginald Keith, in his novel \\"The Malcontents,\\" paints a portrait of war-torn Germany, the lives of those ravaged by violence and betrayal within the Third Reich. Enter into the society and culture of post-war Germany still populated by those who believed and supported the philosophy of The Malcontents, a group of former officials in the Nazi regime, whose plan was to convert prestigious works of art into cash as recompense, ultimately financing a resurrection of Aryan Supremacy through political power. Andre Von Kunst, owner of Von Kunst Gallery, Berlin, finds himself fascinated by Katya Preznoski, first violinist with the Polish State Orchestra. Determined to meet her in person, he follows the orchestra across Germany, as his partner, Hannelore Hassenfeld, a friend since childhood, manages the gallery. Unbeknownst to Andre, she continues to perpetuate an illicit plan set up by her father with a group of former Nazi government officials, known as the Kreis, to funnel stolen artworks to the gallery for eventual sale in the U.S. An unlikely turn of events sheds light on personal betrayals, blatant prejudices, unrequited love, and conflicting loyalties, as this intense journey into the German society of the sixties proffers that things are not often what they appear to be.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=l23tq88uxHUC&dq=The+Malcontents&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Unhinged World of Glen Baxter: Collected Works (Collected Works (Pomegranate))","description":"Baxter's drawings and text are reminiscent of the 1930's adventure story illustrations and the \\"See Jane run\\" books, which is why you may feel like coloring them in when you look at them.

However, when at last all appeared to be under control, a catastrophe erupted that claimed the lives of 10,000 legionnaires and laid Romes imperial ambitions for Germania into the dust. In late September of 9 AD, three Roman legions, while marching to suppress a distant tribal rebellion, were attacked in a four-day battle with the Germanic barbarians. The Romans, under the leadership of the provinces governor, Publius Quinctilius Varus, were taken completely by surprise, betrayed by a member of their own ranks: the German officer and secret rebel leader, Arminius. The defeat was a heavy blow to both Romes military and its pride. Though the disaster was ruthlessly avenged soon afterwards, later attempts at conquering the Germans were half-hearted at best. Four days in September thoroughly examines the ancient sources and challenges the hypotheses of modern scholars to present a clear picture of the prelude to the battle, the fighting itself and its aftermath.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=bNwHDAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Britney Spears -- In the Zone: Piano/Vocal/Chords","description":"Britney Spears has demonstrated her evolution from a teen rebel into a provocative young woman in her latest album In the Zone.

Integrating the insights of earlier care theorists with the concerns of traditional justice theorists, Engster forges a new synthesis between care and justice, and further argues that the institutional and policy commitments of care theory must be recognized as central to any adequate theory of justice. Engster begins by offering a practice-based account of caring and a theory of obligation that explains why individuals should care for others. He then systematically demonstrates the implications of this account of caring for domestic politics, economics, international relations, and culture. In each of these areas, he reviews the contributions of earlier care theorists and then extends their arguments to provide a more complete description of the institutions and policies of a caring society. Care ethics is further put in dialogue with diverse cultural and religious traditions and used to address the challenges of multicultural justice, cultural relativism, and international human rights. More fully than other works on care theory, this book provides an over-arching account of the institutions and policies of a caring society. The Heart of Justice provides the first full account of a theory of justice based upon care ethics, and should be of interest to anyone interested in thinking about the nature of our moral obligations and the institutions of a just society.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=vwtREAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Understanding Freshwater Fish (Interpet Handbooks)","description":"Keeping freshwater fish is the perfect choice for the new fish enthusiast.

It is also mysterious, powerful, and controversial, involving thousands of players worldwide from suppliers and producers to government and military procurers to shadowy figures that trade in the black market. This comprehensive, two-volume reference will explore, on a global scale, the various issues, concepts, problems, and controversies surrounding the rise of the modern defense industry. Unparalleled in its scope and insight, The Modern Defense Industry will prove invaluable to the industry's critics and champions alike. The phenomenon of a more-or-less permanent defense industry especially one so wide in scale, breadth (air, sea, land, and space), technology, and geography is still relatively new. Until now, its implications for politics, economics, and technology have not been adequately discussed in an authoritative, accessible format for scholars and researchers, business people, journalists, policymakers, and interested laymen. The Modern Defense Industry addresses the period from 1945 to the present, covering the United States, Europe, Russia, China, Israel, and other important arms-producing and arms-procuring countries. Including essays by experts from around the world, a glossary, data on firms and governments, laws and policies, primary documents, case studies, and a host of other elements, this set will be a unique resource for anyone interested in the arms industry. It will also offer penetrating insights into topics like international relations and diplomacy, arms proliferation, and contemporary politics. Volume I comprises chapters by experts in the field on topics like the relationship between the industry, military, and government; how new modes of warfare are changing the industry; the implications of globalization on the industry; the black and gray areas of the arms trade; and much more. Volume II features an extensive A-Z glossary of terms, lists of defense firms and government agencies, annotated primary documents, lists of leading defense contractors and key weapons systems, an analysis of key legislation, and professional organizations. The Modern Defense Industry sets the standard for state of the art overviews of an industry that has, for better or worse, come to infuse nearly every aspect of world affairs in the early twenty-first century.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=4n5oyaPnqm0C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Pleasures of Children's Literature (2nd Edition)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=QA8cAAAACAAJ&dq=The+Pleasures+of+Children%27s+Literature+(2nd+Edition)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Urban Web Tales","description":"Provides alphabetically arranged entries on folk and fairy tales from around the world, including information on authors, subjects, themes, characters, and national traditions.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=-sj5cJz0_OsC&dq=Urban+Web+Tales&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Double Love","description":"I was desperate for cash, and meeting the handsome twins was the answer to my prayers.

My mother agrees with you, but unfortunately Genius just doesn t have the same ring. Let s get something straight right away. I may be an idiot, but I ve tried to do more in this book than just revisit the Red Sox s Miracle Season. I want to give you a sense of what it s like to grow up with baseball dreams, to spend long years climbing the ladder, and then over the course of three years to see the building blocks of those dreams fall into place. In this book, you ll be reading about the son of an Army staff sergeant a thrill-seeking Orlando kid who at age thirteen was gifted with a man s body, including rare speed and reflexes. It was some straight talk from my brother that kept me from abandoning that talent, which led to my eventually catching on with the Kansas City Royals and later the Oakland A s. Starting in 2002 with the Red Sox, I got to see what can happen when a determined front office decides to roll the dice and acquire players who, like me, leave the thinking out of it who trust their instincts and play team baseball. Forget what you ve read about the posse of long-haired rebels who eventually made up the 2004 Red Sox. I'll give you the straight dope, including who's got the biggest mouth (hint: his first name is Kevin); what Pedro Martinez was doing all those times when you couldn t find him on the bench; what game David Ortiz should never play; and why I sometimes question Curt Schilling s sanity. Memo to Curt: the statue of you is being erected. What s it like being responsible for the hopes of millions? In the fall of 2004 my teammates and I got to find out. What I ve tried to do in these pages is bring you inside, show you the black humor that erupted when it seemed we could do nothing right, and the immense joy that followed when 25 guys took turns picking each other up, and by sheer force of will reached baseball s summit.

First published in German in 1981 as volume 33 of Heidegger's Collected Works, this book translates a lecture course he presented at the University of Freiburg in 1931. Heidegger's careful translation and his probing commentary on the first three chapters of Book IX of Metaphysics show the close correlation between his phenomenological interpretation of the Greeks (especially of Aristotle) and his critique of metaphysics. Additionally, Heidegger's confrontation with Aristotle's Greek text makes a significant contribution to contemporary scholarship on Aristotle, particularly the understanding of potentiality in Aristotle's thought. Finally, the book exemplifies Heidegger's gift for teaching students how to read a philosophical text and how to question that text in a philosophical way.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=u3jGa6XERAoC&dq=Aristotle%27s+Metaphysics&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Professional Secrets of Nature Photography: Essential Skills for Photographing the Outdoors","description":"Outdoor photography presents a unique set of challenges for photographers.

Drawing from the great folklorists of the past while expanding African American lore with dozens of tales rarely seen before, The Annotated African American Folktales revolutionizes the canon like no other volume. Following in the tradition of such classics as Arthur Huff Fauset s  Negro Folk Tales from the South  (1927), Zora Neale Hurston s Mules and Men (1935), and Virginia Hamilton s The People Could Fly (1985), acclaimed scholars Henry Louis Gates Jr. and Maria Tatar assemble a groundbreaking collection of folktales, myths, and legends that revitalizes a vibrant African American past to produce the most comprehensive and ambitious collection of African American folktales ever published in American literary history. Arguing for the value of these deceptively simple stories as part of a sophisticated, complex, and heterogeneous cultural heritage, Gates and Tatar show how these remarkable stories deserve a place alongside the classic works of African American literature, and American literature more broadly. Opening with two introductory essays and twenty seminal African tales as historical background, Gates and Tatar present nearly 150 African American stories, among them familiar Brer Rabbit classics, but also stories like  The Talking Skull  and  Witches Who Ride,  as well as out-of-print tales from the 1890s  Southern Workman. Beginning with the figure of Anansi, the African trickster, master of improvisation a spider who plots and weaves in scandalous ways The Annotated African American Folktales then goes on to draw Caribbean and Creole tales into the orbit of the folkloric canon. It retrieves stories not seen since the Harlem Renaissance and brings back archival tales of  Negro folklore  that Booker T. Washington proclaimed had emanated from a  grapevine  that existed even before the American Revolution, stories brought over by slaves who had survived the Middle Passage. Furthermore, Gates and Tatar s volume not only defines a new canon but reveals how these folktales were hijacked and misappropriated in previous incarnations, egregiously by Joel Chandler Harris, a Southern newspaperman, as well as by Walt Disney, who cannibalized and capitalized on Harris s volumes by creating cartoon characters drawn from this African American lore. Presenting these tales with illuminating annotations and hundreds of revelatory illustrations, The Annotated African American Folktales reminds us that stories not only move, entertain, and instruct but, more fundamentally, inspire and keep hope alive. The Annotated African American Folktales includes: Introductory essays, nearly 150 African American stories, and 20 seminal African tales as historical background The familiar Brer Rabbit classics, as well as news-making vernacular tales from the 1890s  Southern Workman An entire section of Caribbean and Latin American folktales that finally become incorporated into the canon Approximately 200 full-color, museum-quality images","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ITtbDgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Blood in the Sea: HMS Dunedin and the Enigma Code","description":"This harrowing tale of survival pays moving tribute to the courageous British sailors of World War II, and offers entrance into the ultra-secret world of British code-breaking.

Jesus didn't \\"become flesh\\" so we could feel different. He came to this world so we will be different. Often our spirituality seems invisible and mute to a hurting world. Many of us simply internalize faith out of fear, feelings of inadequacy, or choice. A faithful response to discipleship's call, however, is both inward and outward. Through Howell's study, you'll find ways to apply faith to your daily life and make evident your commitment to Christ. By considering all that Jesus did with his hands as a teacher, a healer, and a compassionate servant, Howell challenges readers to be the hands and feet and love of Christ in the world. \\"Christianity must become something real, tangible, something that pervades all that we are,\\" writes Howell. \\"It must become something we do. In our culture, for Christianity to have any meaningful future, we must get serious about a genuine lifestyle that is holy without being elitist, engaged with the world without being jaded or self-righteous, active and busy yet prepared to cope with failure.\\" Howell's inspiration for this work comes from a poetic meditation written by Teresa of Avila, a Spanish nun who lived in the 16th century. The poem begins: \\"Christ has no body now on earth but yours, no hands but yours, no feet but yours.\\" Howell connects these words with the apostle Paul, who wrote in 1 Corinthians 12: \\"Now you are the body of Christ.\\" Express your faith through action. Be the hands of Christ today to a hurting world.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=nuPIcs8OSwgC&dq=YOURS+ARE+THE+HANDS+OF+CHRIST+THE+PRACTICE+OF+FAITH&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Early Kings of Norway","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=i9EeAAAAMAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"WORKS OF WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE","description":"Includes the complete text of Shakespeare's plays, poems, and sonnets","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=CfmCnQEACAAJ&dq=WORKS+OF+WILLIAM+SHAKESPEARE&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Santa Shop","description":"A homeless man's journey from despair back to life and Christmas.

Recent exhibitions of his early works reveal an artist very different from the serene landscapist we thought we knew. What was it that made these disturbingly dark and troubled paintings, with their violence and psychological truth, as important to him as, later, his huge series of bathers, an obsession with the nude that continued to the end? With the last full-length biography written more than a quarter century ago, the demand for a new life of C zanne has never been greater. In Lost Earth, Philip Callow delivers it brilliantly. Using contemporary sources, exceptional biographical skills, and a poetic prose, Callow finds beneath an outwardly uneventful life a wealth of anguish and bitter struggle to overcome personal inadequacies and the insults of the critical community. For all of C zanne's weakness and despair, Lost Earth is the story of a transcendent artist who was passionately committed to a tradition he would one day transform. Callow examines with fresh insights C zanne's profound friendship with  mile Zola, his ingrained fear of women, his love of the outdoors that enabled him to paint the universe in an apple. Lost Earth gets to the heart of the great painter.

My bat-like thought-wings would beat painfully in that sudden searchlight,  H.D. writes in Tribute to Freud, her moving memoir. Compelled by historical as well as personal crises, H.D. underwent therapy with Freud during 193334, as the streets of Vienna were littered with tokens dropped like confetti on the city stating  Hitler gives work,   Hitler gives bread.  Having endured World War I, she was now gathering her resources to face the cataclysm she knew was approaching. The first part of the book,  Writing on the Wall,  was composed some ten years after H.D. s stay in Vienna; the second part,  Advent,  is a journal she kept during her analysis. Revealed here in the poet s crystal shard-like words and in Freud s own letters (which comprise an appendix) is a remarkably tender and human portrait of the legendary Doctor in the twilight of his life.

They never did find the fabled Northwest Passage, but over twenty-eight months, the Corps of Discovery traveled more than eight thousand miles through eleven future states, named scores of places and rivers, met with many Native American tribes, and wrote the first descriptions of heretofore unknown plants and animals. By the end of their trip, Lewis and Clark had navigated and named two thirds of the American continent. They may have had undaunted courage, but the sheer volume of information related to their expedition can be more than a little daunting to the armchair historian. Written by two highly regarded Lewis and Clark experts, this book contains over five hundred lively and fascinating entries on everything from the members of the expedition and the places they went to the weapons and tools, trade goods, and medicines they carried, along with the food and amusements that sustained them. Highly readable and informative, it's the perfect introduction for the Lewis and Clark novice, and the comprehensive guide no buff will want to be without. \\"This handy volume, timed for publication as the bicentennial of the Lewis and Clark expedition opens, has the virtue of teaching the student while helpfully reminding the scholar. \\" - Publishers Weekly","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=IQdpCAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Cleopatra (Penguin Classic Biography)","description":"The Signet Classics edition of the tragedy that features one of Shakespeare's greatest female characters.

It features exclusive content pulled from the Lucasfilm archives by author J. W. Rinzler: ? 26 minutes of rare behind-the-scenes video* ? 29 minutes of rare audio interviews with the cast and crew ? New bonus photos and artwork not found in the print edition After the 1973 success of American Graffiti, filmmaker George Lucas made the fateful decision to pursue a longtime dream project: a space fantasy movie unlike any ever produced. Lucas envisioned a swashbuckling SF saga inspired by the Flash Gordon serials, classic American westerns, the epic cinema of Japanese auteur Akira Kurosawa, and mythological heroes. Its original title: The Star Wars. The rest is history, and how it was made is a story as entertaining and exciting as the movie that has enthralled millions for more than thirty years a story that has never been told as it was meant to be. Until now. Using his unprecedented access to the Lucasfilm Archives and its trove of  lost  interviews, photos, production notes, factoids, and anecdotes, Star Wars scholar J. W. Rinzler hurtles readers back in time for a one-of-a-kind behind-the-scenes look at the nearly decade-long quest of George Lucas and his key collaborators to make the  little  movie that became a phenomenon. It s all here: ? the evolution of the now-classic story and characters including  Annikin Starkiller  and  a huge green-skinned monster with no nose and large gills  named Han Solo ? excerpts from George Lucas s numerous, ever-morphing script drafts ? the birth of Industrial Light & Magic, the special-effects company that revolutionized Hollywood filmmaking ? the studio-hopping and budget battles that nearly scuttled the entire project ? the director s early casting saga, which might have led to a film spoken mostly in Japanese including the intensive auditions that won the cast members their roles and made them legends ? the grueling, nearly catastrophic location shoot in Tunisia and the subsequent breakneck dash at Elstree Studios in London ? the who s who of young film rebels who pitched in to help including Francis Ford Coppola, Steven Spielberg, and Brian DePalma But perhaps most exciting, and rarest of all, are the interviews conducted before and during production and immediately after the release of Star Wars in which George Lucas, Mark Hamill, Harrison Ford, Carrie Fisher, Sir Alec Guinness, Anthony Daniels, composer John Williams, effects masters Dennis Muren, Richard Edlund, and John Dykstra, Phil Tippett, Rick Baker, legendary production designer John Barry, and a host of others share their fascinating tales from the trenches and candid opinions of the film that would ultimately change their lives. No matter how you view the spectrum of this phenomenon, The Making of Star Wars stands as a crucial document rich in fascination and revelation of a genuine cinematic and cultural touchstone. *Video may not play on all readers.

But Martin Scorsese, a champion of directors Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger, considers it a masterpiece. It's a film about desires repressed in favour of worthless and unsatisfying ideals. And it's a film about how England dreamt of itself as a nation and how this dream disguised inadequacy and brutality in the clothes of honour. A. L. Kennedy, writing as a Scot, is fascinated by the nationalism which The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp explores. She finds human worth in the film and the pathos of stifled emotions and unfulfilled lives. 'If he is unaware of his passions, ' she writes of Clive Candy, the film's central figure, 'this is because his pains have become habitual, a part of personality, and because he was never taught a language that could speak of emotions like pain.'. This edition includes a foreword by the author exploring the film's continuing relevance in an age of Brexit, when English and British national identity are deeply contested concepts.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=vCPODwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Slave Community: Plantation Life in the Antebellum South","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=jbmLNAEACAAJ&dq=The+Slave+Community:+Plantation+Life+in+the+Antebellum+South&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Hope for the Troubled Heart","description":"What hopeless situation troubles your heart?

The war in the cold north was to become a fixed component in the lives of the Spaniards of the Golden Age for many years. This book reconstructs the images that the Spanish had of the Netherlands and its inhabitants. These images are inextricably intertwined with the picture that the Spanish constructed of themselves as participants in the conflict. This book follows the developments of these images from the construction of an image of the enemy that reached a climax between 1621 and 1648 and then gradually faded away. Which images and representations circulated the most, and where did they come from? Which rhetoric was used to present them to the public, and in which genres and contexts were they disseminated and preserved? On the basis of a varied collection of sources, war chronicles and plays, as well as pamphlets, poems, historical works and prose writings, the author illustrates the appearance of the Netherlands through Spanish eyes during the course of the Eighty Years' War.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=8h-_H4APTQUC&dq=Spanish+Eyes&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"WONDER BOY","description":"Twb is the story of a boy who has been gifted with some special powers to access information bases.

The natural - or supernatural - laws there were, to say the least of it, distinctly odd. Things kept changing. This made the mssion with which he was entrusted, as the price of his return to the normal world, even harder than he expected. He had to penetrate the Kobold Hills, where it was said that swords were being made, and discover if an ancient enemy had returned. He was given a magic wand - but not told how to use it. Through the fields and forests he went, meeting dryads and sprites, ogres and two-headed eagles, on the way. Danger, seduction and magic lay all around him.

It begins with the Allied nations' bombing of Berlin in February 1945, which destroyed the Reichsbank, and the subsequent discovery of an abandoned salt mine in southern Germany, where an incalculable stash of gold bullion, currency, and precious art and antiques has been stored for the express purpose of financing the continuation of the Nazis' thousand-year reign. Maya Warwick is an enigmatic and reclusive author living in a mountain community outside Denver. When she discovers that her best friend, Thea Rousseau, has committed suicide, her only clue is an empty bottle of Euphorin, the latest Prozac-like \\"mood brightener\\" touted as a panacea for anxiety and depression. Maya is no stranger to bad drugs slipping through the FDA approval process. Ten years earlier, she wrote a best-selling book on another pharmaceutical that was implicated in dozens of grisly tragedies, including the murder-suicide of her parents. Fearing that Thea's actions were a side effect of the medication, Maya uses the Internet to research Euphorin and its manufacturer. She discovers that FetcherBurkeWinslow is a subsidiary of VB Pharmaceuticals (referred to as the \\"poison machine of the Third Reich\\") and that VB was the maker of the psychotropic drugs used in mind-control experiments at Auschwitz. She now suspects that Euphorin has a more sinister intent. From there, her investigation leads to various neo-Nazi websites where she learns that Baron Alexander von Brandt, president of VB Pharmaceuticals, is the reputed leader of a burgeoning Nazi party and the son of a former Third Reich minister. In her outrage, Maya innocently posts her conspiracy theories on various Internet bulletin boards alleging that the Nazis are trying to wrangle the bleating herds into a planetary corral, attracting the attention of a couple of CIA lurkers who have been monitoring certain websites since the 9-11 terrorist attacks. She is lured into an online relationship with one of the lurkers and eventually meets the man in charge of the infamous CIA experiments known as Project MK-Ultra. Riggs Haywood ardently recruits Maya into Operation SHADOWHAWK, a black project set up to entrap Baron von Brandt into disclosing his plans for advancing the new Nazi party. More importantly, Riggs wants to know how von Brandt intends to access the vast sum of money and gold that was stashed in Credit Suisse by his father before the collapse of the Third Reich. The Schweizerische Bundespolizei want to know the same thing. Once recruited, Maya is assigned a new name and identity and is sent to Munich to be squired to Baron von Brandt's lavish Christmas extravaganza by a nefarious CIA sleeper named Horst Freundlich. It then becomes her mission to ferret out von Brandt's intentions. After several meetings, he discloses his vision of a future world comprised of genetically engineered people whose lives are enhanced by pharmaceuticals that induce neurochemical bliss. Several attempts are made on her life before Harry Langdon, one of the lurkers who helped ensnare her in this diabolical plot, rescues her. Both he and Maya seek asylum in Switzerland under the auspices of Swiss intelligence. Most of the action takes place in Munich, but also includes scenes in New York; Provence, Switzerland; and Colorado. In the end, each of the characters finds the will to overcome the events that have shaped their lives and reclaim their right to find real love and personal happiness in a world that seems fraught with illusion.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=soCIDQAAQBAJ&dq=Blind+Reason&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Service Quality - The Enlightened Approach","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=L1ndAAAACAAJ&dq=Service+Quality+-+The+Enlightened+Approach&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Making Of An American","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=frU7zQEACAAJ&dq=The+Making+Of+An+American&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Cranford","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=n4tJLgEACAAJ&dq=Cranford&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Baby Girl or Baby Boy: Determining the Sex of Your Child","description":"Choose the Sex of Your Child?

The book first covers the classical ensembles of statistical mechanics and stochastic processes, including Brownian motion, probability theory, and the FokkerPlanck and Langevin equations. To illustrate the use of statistical methods beyond the theory of matter, the author discusses entropy in information theory, Brownian motion in the stock market, and the Monte Carlo method in computer simulations. The next several chapters emphasize the difference between quantum mechanics and classical mechanics the quantum phase. Applications covered include Fermi statistics and semiconductors and Bose statistics and BoseEinstein condensation. The book concludes with advanced topics, focusing on the GinsburgLandau theory of the order parameter and the special kind of quantum order found in superfluidity and superconductivity. Assuming some background knowledge of classical and quantum physics, this textbook thoroughly familiarizes advanced undergraduate students with the different aspects of statistical physics.

Bringing together an impressive array of familiar and lesser-known figures, Edwards paints a detailed, compelling picture of what it has meant to preach the gospel. Pastors, scholars, and students of homiletics will find here many opportunities to enrich their understanding and practice of preaching. Volume 1, appearing in the print edition, contains Edwards's magisterial retelling of the story of Christian preaching's development from its Hellenistic and Jewish roots in the New Testament, through the late-twentieth century's discontent with outdated forms and emphasis on new modes of preaching such as narrative. Along the way the author introduces us to the complexities and contributions of preachers, both with whom we are already acquainted, and to whom we will be introduced here for the first time. Origen, Chrysostom, Augustine, Bernard, Aquinas, Luther, Calvin, Wesley, Edwards, Rauschenbusch, Barth; all of their distinctive contributions receive careful attention. Yet lesser-known figures and developments also appear, from the ninth-century reform of preaching championed by Hrabanus Maurus, to the reference books developed in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries by the mendicant orders to assist their members' preaching, to Howell Harris and Daniel Rowlands, preachers of the eighteenth-century Welsh revival, to Helen Kenyon, speaking as a layperson at the 1950 Yale Beecher lectures about the view of preaching from the pew. Volume 2, contained on the enclosed CD-ROM, contains primary source material on preaching drawn from the entire scope of the church's twenty centuries. The author has written an introduction to each selection, placing it in its historical context and pointing to its particular contribution. Each chapter in Volume 2 is geared to its companion chapter in Volume 1's narrative history. Ecumenical in scope, fair-minded in presentation, appreciative of the contributions that all the branches of the church have made to the story of what it means to develop, deliver, and listen to a sermon, A History of Preachingwill be the definitive resource for anyone who wishes to preach or to understand preaching's role in living out the gospel. \\"...'This work is expected to be the standard text on preaching for the next 30 years,' says Ann K. Riggs, who staffs the NCC's Faith and Order Commission. Author Edwards, former professor of preaching at Seabury-Western Theological Seminary, is co-moderator of the commission, which studies church-uniting and church-dividing issues. 'A History of Preaching is ecumenical in scope and will be relevant in all our churches; we all participate in this field,' says Riggs....\\" from EcuLink, Number 65, Winter 2004-2005 published by the National Council of Churches","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=_bSxuXz_fIYC&dq=Convincing+Minds+and+Moving+Hearts&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Germany's Tiger Tanks D.W. to Tiger I: Design, Production & Modifications","description":"This first volume, of a three-volume set, covers the history, development and production history of the Tiger tank variants from the idea's conception to the end of Tiger I production. This includes details on the development series known as the D.W., VK 30.01(H), VK 30.01(P), VK 36.01(H), VK 45.01(P) as well as the Tiger I. All of this illustrated with scale drawings by Hilary L. Doyle, combined with drawings, sketches, and photographs depicting external modifications as well as internal views. Over thirty years of intensive research went into finding the original documents needed to create this history of the development, characteristics, and tactical capabilities of the Tiger. An exhaustive search was made for surviving records of the design/assembly firms (including Krupp, Henschel, Porsche, and Wegmann), the Heereswaffenamt, the Generalinspekteur der Panzertruppen, the D656 series of manuals on the Tiger, and the war diaries with their supporting reports from German army units. This is supplemented by the authors' collecting hundreds of photos and climbing over, under, around, and through nearly every surviving Tiger I.

In I of the Vortex, Rodolfo Llinas, a founding father of modern brain science, presents an original view of the evolution and nature of mind. According to Llinas, the \\"mindness state\\" evolved to allow predictive interactions between mobile creatures and their environment. He illustrates the early evolution of mind through a primitive animal called the \\"sea squirt.\\" The mobile larval form has a brainlike ganglion that receives sensory information about the surrounding environment. As an adult, the sea squirt attaches itself to a stationary object and then digests most of its own brain. This suggests that the nervous system evolved to allow active movement in animals. To move through the environment safely, a creature must anticipate the outcome of each movement on the basis of incoming sensory data. Thus the capacity to predict is most likely the ultimate brain function. One could even say that Self is the centralization of prediction. At the heart of Llinas's theory is the concept of oscillation. Many neurons possess electrical activity, manifested as oscillating variations in the minute voltages across the cell membrane. On the crests of these oscillations occur larger electrical events that are the basis for neuron-to-neuron communication. Like cicadas chirping in unison, a group of neurons oscillating in phase can resonate with a distant group of neurons. This simultaneity of neuronal activity is the neurobiological root of cognition. Although the internal state that we call the mind is guided by the senses, it is also generated by the oscillations within the brain. Thus, in a certain sense, one could say that reality is not all \\"out there,\\" but is a kind of virtual reality.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=Er5NEAAAQBAJ&dq=Vortex&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Little Bit of Wisdom: Conversations with a Nez Perce Elder","description":"But it is also a story about family and extended family relationships, about respect, tradition, patience, kindness, healing, and grace (as well as their opposites).","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=4U1GAAAAMAAJ&dq=A+Little+Bit+of+Wisdom:+Conversations+with+a+Nez+Perce+Elder&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Seed and the Sower","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=Sd6ttAEACAAJ&dq=Seed+and+the+Sower&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Women artists: An illustrated history","description":"Strikingly beautiful and a pleasure to read, Women Artists surveys female painters and sculptors from the Renaissance to the present, illuminating both the obstacles the artists encountered and the contributions they made. 179 illustrations, 132 in full color.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=h4TuRQAACAAJ&dq=Women+artists:+An+illustrated+history&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Act! 4 (Visual QuickStart Guide)","description":"Adobe InDesign CS4, Adobe's page-design component of Creative Suite 4, offers exciting new enhancements to its already powerful tools.

Despite the popularity and abundance of flower paintings in modern collections, the book includes a wide range of subjects and styles, from the simple to the complex, the charmingly small to the opulent and extravagant, and from flowers to hunting still lifes or objects in the corner of a painter's studio, along with an occasional trompe l'oeil. The visual delights of still-life painting have a strong historical context. Collectors and connoisseurs purchased them because of their realism, visual appeal, and relevance to their own lives. Poets praised the wonders of still-life paintings and evoked the power of painting to transcend the seasons and the passing of time. Contemporary observers lauded the expensive and elaborate objects often on display. The book therefore considers the visual achievement of the Netherlandish still life painters in the context of contemporary reactions to pictures, art theory, and issues of patronage. Numerous artists were tempted to try their hand at still life, drawn by a new and enchanting genre that allowed an artist to create independent worlds of inanimate objects on the flat surface of a picture -- imaginary realms that had an exceptional following among connoisseurs of the time. These images continue to work their magic on present-day art lovers.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=OjfrAAAAMAAJ&dq=Still-life+paintings+from+the+Netherlands,+1550-1720&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"All about words;: An adult approach to vocabulary building,","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=EMgEzQEACAAJ&dq=All+about+words%3B:+An+adult+approach+to+vocabulary+building,&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Beech Tree","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=OPoIzQEACAAJ&dq=The+Beech+Tree&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"God is Like a Mother Hen and Much, Much More","description":"A collection of simple metaphors to help young children understand the nature of God.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=OH0MAAAACAAJ&dq=God+is+Like+a+Mother+Hen+and+Much,+Much+More&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The 25 Best World War II Sites, European Theater: The Ultimate Traveler's Guide to Battlefields, Monuments & Museums (25 Essential World War II ...

It chronicles the transformation of IBM into a computer company in a remarkably few years, discussing projects that ended in frustration as well as the more successful ones, and providing a sense of the atmosphere, the people, and the decision-making processes involved during the company's rapid technological transformation. IBM's Early Computers is a unique contribution to the modern history of computers. It focuses on engineering alternatives rather than business and general management considerations and reveals the significance of imaginative solutions to problems in design and technology, from initial experiments with electronics in digital machines to the threshold of the System 360 era. This fair and balanced account of IBM's role in shaping today's electronic revolution identifies the individuals (both inside and outside the company) whose pioneering work influenced developments at IBM. The book's fourteen chapters briefly survey the card machine era and then cover electronic calculation, the magnetic drum calculator, the Defense Calculator and other first-generation products, ferrite core memories, magnetic tape, and disk storage development, programming, transistors, \\"Project Stretch\\" (which involved disappointments but led to one of IBM's greatest successes) high-speed printers, research, and new-product-line considerations. Charles J. Bashe, Lyle R. Johnson, John H. Palmer, and Emerson W Pugh are senior members of the staff at IBM's Thomas J. Watson Research Center, each with many years of technical and managerial experience in the developments they describe.

P. Lovecraft","description":"He was the premier writer of horror fiction in the first half of the 20th Century, perhaps the major American practitioner of the art between the time of Edgar Allan Poe and Stephen King. Born into an upper middle class family in Providence, Rhode Island, Howard Phillips Lovecraft (1890-1937) had a lonely childhood, but read voraciously from his earliest years. He soon became interested in science and astronomy and began penning stories, poetry, and essays in great profusion, publishing them himself when no other market was available. The advent of Weird Tales in 1923 gave him a small outlet for his work, and he attracted a large number of followers, with whom he exchanged literally tens of thousands of letters, many of them quite lengthy. A number of these young correspondents eventually became professional writers and editors themselves. Lovecraft's fame began spreading beyond fandom with the publication of his first significant collection, The Outsider and Others, in 1939, two years after his untimely death.

John William Gardner In his classic treatise Self-Renewal, John W. Gardner examines why great societies thrive and die. He argues that it is dynamism, not decay, that is dramatically altering the landscape of American society. The twentieth century has brought about change more rapidly than any previous era, and with that came advancements, challenges, and often destruction. Gardner cautions that  a society must court the kinds of change that will enrich and strengthen it, rather than the kind of change that will fragment and destroy it.  A society s ability to renew itself hinges upon its individuals. Gardner reasons that it is the waning of the heart and spirit not a lack of material might that threatens American society. Young countries, businesses, and humans have several key commonalities: they are flexible, eager, open, curious, unafraid, and willing to take risks. These conditions lead to success. However, as time passes, so too comes complacency, apathy, and rigidity, causing motivation to plummet. It is at this junction that great civilizations fall, businesses go bankrupt, and life stagnates. Gardner asserts that the individual s role in social renewal requires each person to face and look beyond imminent threats. Ultimately, we need a vision that there is something worth saving. Through this vision, Gardner argues, society will begin to renew itself, not permanently, but past its average lifespan, and it will at once become enriched and rejuvenated.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=djxODwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The constitution of man considered in relation to external objects","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=dXMAAAAAMAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Programming Jabber: Extending XML Messaging (O'Reilly XML)","description":"Jabber is a set of protocols expressed in XML, and an extensible framework that allows people and applications to exchange all sorts of information, from simple text messages to being used to extend the backbone of an enterprise data system.

Tolkien makes a thrilling debut as a novelist in this suspenseful courtroom drama that will have you guessing to the very end.  Don t let the author s last name confuse you, for there are no Hobbits in this debut novel by the grandson of J.R.R. Tolkien, only a wonderful story of family, relationships, and suspense. . . . Part English cozy, part family saga, part courtroom drama, this genre-bending work of fiction is touching and enchanting.   Booklist (starred review)  The book is fast-paced and crisply plotted, with Tolkien elegantly piecing together the different perspectives and introducing unexpected twists.   Publishers Weekly  Tolkien s skill as a storyteller is worthy of notice in this taut, well-paced legal thriller. The excellent courtroom drama and well-drawn, believable characters make this a good choice. . . . With an easily recognizable surname, a formidable Oxford education, and a successful career as a London barrister, the grandson of the author of The Lord of the Rings is bound to create a stir with this debut novel.   Library Journal One summer night, two men break into an isolated manor house and kill Lady Anne Robinson. Her son, Thomas, convinces the police that his father s beautiful personal assistant sent the killers, but Thomas is known for his overactive imagination, and he has reasons to lie. Thomas s father, Sir Peter Robinson, the British minister of defense, refuses to believe his son. Instead, he marries his assistant, Greta Grahame, and will be giving evidence for the defense at her trial. He will be the final witness. Author Simon Tolkien successfully combines legal suspense and psychological tension in this sharply etched portrait of four people whose lives are changed by a murder. Alternating between the trial in London s Central Criminal Court and private moments among the characters, Tolkien expertly describes the art of the trial, the clash between Britain s social classes, and, most notably, the complexity of family relations. Who is telling the truth the new wife or the bereaved son? What will Sir Peter tell the court? With tantalizing ambiguity, Tolkien keeps readers guessing about the true motivations of these characters until the final witness.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=dBYC01Wa55EC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Kiddar's Luck","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=12dOtAEACAAJ&dq=Kiddar%27s+Luck&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Jiangxi Virus","description":"International suspense thriller about biological terrorism.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=zpsFAAAACAAJ&dq=The+Jiangxi+Virus&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The 4 Dimensional Manager: DiSC Strategies for Managing Different People in the Best Ways (Inscape Guide)","description":"Successful managers work like coaches, assessing each person's strengths and weaknesses and developing the best strategy to get the job done.

Her prohibition only fueled their desire and so began their torrid, secret seven-year-affair, enlisting the aid of a few intimates and servants (willing to risk their own positions) to shuttle love letters back and forth and to help facilitate their clandestine meetings. Eventually, Giustiniana found herself pregnant and she turned for help to the infamous Casanovahimself infatuated with her.

But much of what passes for humanitarianism today is a commercial enterprise, manipulated by market forces of supply and demand. And since the launch of the \\"war on terror,\\" national security interests and political objectives have increasingly come into play. The Charity of Nations probes the reasons behind governmental and nongovernmental responses to urgent human need. It explains why some crises get the lion s share of attention and resources, while others are essentially forgotten. Vibrantly contrasting cases of Afghanistan, East Timor, and Sierra Leone, among others, illustrate how foreign policy and domestic politics have shaped what has become the business of humanitarianism. The authors call for a revamped humanitarian structure--one that eliminates the ambiguities and confusion that exist today. They argue for a shift away from rampant political and commercial intrusions, and a rededication to multilateralism, genuine accountability, and trust.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=uXq6AAAAIAAJ&dq=The+Charity+of+Nations:+Humanitarian+Action+in+a+Calculating+World&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Return of Heroic Failures","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=f2gXAAAACAAJ&dq=The+Return+of+Heroic+Failures&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Crystals and Cobwebs and Jailbird Blues","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=qEZ7AAAACAAJ&dq=Crystals+and+Cobwebs+and+Jailbird+Blues&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Makioka sisters (Borzoi books)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=CP_ROrHpxCcC&dq=The+Makioka+sisters+(Borzoi+books)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Commander Toad and the Big Black Hole (Paperstar Book)","description":"The space ship Star Warts, commanded by Commander Toad, encounters a black hole which threatens the vehicle with doom.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=S_9MDwAAQBAJ&dq=Commander+Toad+and+the+Big+Black+Hole+(Paperstar+Book)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Our Father","description":"Our Father is an accessible but theologically astute book, employing sound biblical scholarship, systematic theological reflection, and socio-cultural assessments which aid understanding of the profound implications for our time in history and of the sixty-seven words that comprise the Lords Prayer.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=pPtWEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Making of the New Testament Documents","description":"This volume identifies and investigates literary traditions and their implications for the authorship and dating of the Gospels and the letters of the New Testament.

The tunes include a representative collection of what people are playing in the current old-time music scene. The author has indicated the source of the tune when known, plus notes on achieving the proper feel and playing style. Although a few of the arrangements are real finger-twisters, most are well within the reach of the intermediate dulcimer player. Some tunes are written for old-time  noter  style playing, some are best fretted with your fingers. All of the arrangements include suggested chords for guitar or other instruments. One or two include lyrics; most do not. Old-time tunes tend to be played in fiddle-friendly keys like D, G, A (major and minor), and C. Although you can play in most of those keys out of DAD tuning, the music really comes alive when you re-tune and let those drones ring. Tunings include DAA, DAD, DGD, AAA and more. The author includes notes on how to re-tune your dulcimer, as well as alternative tunings for some of the tunes. The author says,  This book represents the fruits of over fifty years spent chasing down a good tune.

Many ideas, which were only known to a small, select group of players, were made available to anyone who was striving to become an expert, and the hold 'em explosion had begun. It is now a new century, and the authors have again moved the state of the art forward by adding over 100 pages of new material, including extensive sections on \\"loose games,\\" and \\"short-handed games.\\" Anyone who studies this text, is well disciplined, and gets the proper experience should become a significant winner. Some of the other ideas discussed include play on the first two cards, semibluffing, the free card, inducing bluffs, staying with a draw, playing when a pair flops, playing trash hands, desperation bets, playing in wild games, reading hands, and psychology.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=pV1JlAqLTiYC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Brush with Hong Kong","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=50AUHQAACAAJ&dq=A+Brush+with+Hong+Kong&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Black brigade: I.

His La Boh me and Tosca are more frequently performed in the major opera houses than works by other composers, and Madame Butterfly and Manon Lescaut rank not far behind. What is the explanation for Puccini's enormous success? How do his operas work as music and drama? What was he like to contemporaries such as Verdi, Toscanini, and Caruso? Charles Osborne, author of highly successful Complete Operas of Verdi and Complete Operas of Mozart, here analyzes the entire Puccini oeuvre from Tosca and Turandot to the less-often performed Edgar, La Fanciulla del West, and La Rondine. His fourfold approach linking biography with musical, textual, and dramatic analysis is especially valuable for Puccini, who revealed many of his personal contradictions in his music and whose sense of detail can be appreciated by close study of the scores and characters. For the legions of Puccini lovers everywhere, this guide to his life and work can serve as an ideal reference source and opera companion.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=4CVEswEACAAJ&dq=The+Complete+Operas+of+Puccini&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Inside Greenspan's Briefcase : Investment Strategies for Profiting from Key Reports and Data","description":"A big-picture guide to the financial information that really matters, and how investors can use it Fed chairman Alan Greenspan's infamous, packed-beyond-capacity briefcase has for years represented the definitive behind-thescenes collection of market-moving financial knowledge and economic reports.

Feminists want it abolished or regulated as sex work; governments have to safeguard public health and order. This book shows how women s movements in Western Europe, North America and Australia have affected politics on prostitution and trafficking of women since the 1970s, asking what made them successful in some countries but a failure in others. It also assesses whether government institutions to advance the status of women - so-called women s policy agencies - have played a key role in achieving policy outcomes favourable to movement demands. Written by an international team of experts and based on original sources, all chapters follow the same framework to ensure comparability. The final chapter offers an overall comparison identifying what makes women s movements successful and women s agencies effective, presenting the case for state feminism .","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=gbAUdBR2f5sC&dq=The+Politics+of+Prostitution:+Women%27s+Movements,+Democratic+States+and+the+Globalisation+of+Sex+Commerce&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Crowded Nest Syndrome : Surviving the Return of Adult Children","description":"Bringing the serious topic of postparenting out into the light, this is a humorous collection of insightful anecdotes on the perils and pleasures of being a parent of boomerang kids in the 21st century.

Its ideals of serenity and compassion seem to supply a dimension of personal spirituality that they don't find in their own traditions. For those raised in the Christian Church, Buddhism can appear to exemplify the best in their own religion--qualities such as peacefulness, simplicity, and reverence for life--while dispensing with rigid doctrines and legalistic morality. Indeed, the number of Christian converts to Buddhism--especially in the United States--has grown exponentially over the years. At the same time, Buddhists and Christians, recognizing the affinities of the two faiths, have increasingly sought to advance an inter-religious dialogue. In Serene Compassion, John and Denise Carmody provide an accessible overview and evaluation of Buddhist thought and practice from a Christian point of view. They find that Buddhism is, in many ways, an ideal complement and companion to Christianity. To show why, the Carmodys focus on Buddhist ideas about holiness--comprising such virtues as purity, devotion, orderliness, compassion, and wholeheartedness--and reveal how they compare to similar values in traditional Christianity. They emphasize the kinship between seekers of holiness in both traditions, and offer a nuanced and sympathetic portrait of meditative practices that bring attention and imagination into the service of spiritual life. At the same time, however, they are frank about matters of doctrinal disagreement, making it clear that some aspects of Buddhist thought are not compatible with a Christian world view. Moving well beyond a simple exposition of Buddhist notions, or a comparison of Christian with Buddhist practice, Serene Compassion concludes that Buddhists and Christians share a basic humanity, and that Buddhism's success at the task of nourishing this humanity has much to teach all Christians. Informative and insightful, it will appeal to readers approaching the dialogue from either side, and to all engaged in the spiritual quest.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=WaaGZC-68WMC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Word by Word Picture Dictionary English/Russian Edition","description":"Parallel title in Russian (Cyrillic) also present.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=I39zNwAACAAJ&dq=Word+by+Word+Picture+Dictionary+English/Russian+Edition&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Teddy Bear Encyclopedia : Makers, Dates, Descriptions, Over 270 German Manufacturers","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=M4XrAAAACAAJ&dq=Teddy+Bear+Encyclopedia+:+Makers,+Dates,+Descriptions,+Over+270+German+Manufacturers&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Jim Cirillo-Modern Day Gunfighter : Everything You Ever Wanted To Know About Gunfighting By A Guy Who Put His Life On The Line To Find Out","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=xS5nWf844YAC&dq=Jim+Cirillo-Modern+Day+Gunfighter+:+Everything+You+Ever+Wanted+To+Know+About+Gunfighting+By+A+Guy+Who+Put+His+Life+On+The+Line+To+Find+Out&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Tcl/Tk Programmer's Reference","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=148_AQAAIAAJ&dq=Tcl/Tk+Programmer%27s+Reference&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Dead, Mr Mozart","description":"It is 1820, and George IV has just assumed the throne. An ageing Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart is intrigued by the prospect of a coronation, scenting rich pickings. As a child he had visited England with his family in 1764, but instead of returning to Austria and an early death (as orthodox music history relates), they stayed on, deluded by a piece of royal generosity  the result of a misunderstanding of guttural royal English. Now Mozart conducts his own meretricious rubbish at a London theatre, but dreams of having one more  real  opera staged before he dies. However, the trial of George IV s wayward queen for adultery, before the Lords, leads Mozart into dangerous  and indeed murderous  waters. Insulted (most graciously) by the King, the composer finds himself involved in disposing of an inconvenient corpse and initiating enquiries to uncover the murderer . . . a matter which seems of remarkably little consequence to everyone else. This diverting and perplexing piece of alternative history is a delightful addition to our knowledge of the great composer, and to the output of Bernard Bastable, also known to crime fans as Robert Barnard.

They are the work of a novice. But it struck me as I read them that this is the work s strength. One of the attractions of the memoir form is that there are often rich ironies to be tilled in looking back. In this true account, born of a bygone era and steeled in the stoic immigrant ethos of a previous generation, a poor, barely literate Italian mother betrayed in marriage and left to fend for herself, struggles against a relentless succession of odds to forge a little corner of life for her family in the New World. Recounted by a daughter who loved her, suffered with her, and survived, the prose is so simple and naked of artifice, it is the reader, rather than the author, who rubs against these ironies. And that, for my money, is literature. Something about this story, which I can not deconstruct to the point of fully identifying, made it a compelling read for me. My thought and hope is that you might share this conclusion.

In Savage Summit, Jennifer Jordan shares the tragic, compelling, inspiring, and extraordinary true stories of a handful of courageous women -- mothers and daughters, wives and lovers, poets and engineers -- who defeated this formidable mountain yet ultimately perished in pursuit of their dreams.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=RWfNMmgIQCgC&dq=Savage+Summit:+The+Life+and+Death+of+the+First+Women+of+K2&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Late Jay Gould May Be Alive and Well","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=mdBxxTyZthAC&dq=The+Late+Jay+Gould+May+Be+Alive+and+Well&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Critical Thinking About Research: Psychology and Related Fields","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=YiKvtQEACAAJ&dq=Critical+Thinking+About+Research:+Psychology+and+Related+Fields&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Secrets Of Harimau : The Explosive Art Of Pencak Silat Harimau Minangkabau","description":"Donn Draeger, in his world-renowned Asian Fighting Arts, wrote, \\"Perhaps there is no pencak-silat as curious as the harimau style performed in Sumatra.\\" Named for the tiger that its movements so aptly portray, harimau has previously been taught to only a handful of adepts who have used this lithe, sinuous style with deadly effectiveness against armed and unarmed opponents alike. Now the secrets of harimau's low-line kicking, devastating takedowns and savagely effective groundfighting can be yours. In this video, Guru Richard Crabbe de Bordes, certified instructor under Indonesia's General Hanafi, teaches you the basic postures (kudas) and footwork patterns (langkhas) of harimau. He then shows you how to combine these elements into a fighting art designed to take your opponent to the ground and keep him there. Guru de Bordes also teaches rarely seen defense tactics against multiple attackers and demonstrates the practical effectiveness of harimau in a real-life kidnapping scenario. Don't miss this rare opportunity to learn the secrets of one of the most dramatic and unusual martial arts ever developed.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=erDiOwAACAAJ&dq=Secrets+Of+Harimau+:+The+Explosive+Art+Of+Pencak+Silat+Harimau+Minangkabau&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"1967-1972 Chevy/gmc Truck Factory Assembly Instruction Manual","description":"This 1967 - 1972 Chevrolet / GMC Truck Assembly Manual is a high-quality, licensed PRINT reproduction of the assembly manual authored by General Motors Corporation and published by Detroit Iron.

Bij kinderen draaien nieuwe media in eerste instantie om contact. Ze spelen samen met vrienden games, op spelcomputers, op spelletjeswebsites en in virtuele werelden als Stardoll.nl en Habbo. Ze bekijken filmpjes op YouTube en soms maken ze die zelf om ze vervolgens met anderen te delen. Ze hebben contact met elkaar via de mobiele telefoon en MSN. Ze 'krabbelen' elkaar op Hyves en presenteren zichzelf daar aan elkaar. Vriendschap, liefde, ruzie en pesten; alles uit het echte leven heeft ook een plaats in hun digitale leefwereld. Op steeds jongere leeftijd zijn kinderen actief met nieuwe media. Sommige ouders en leerkrachten worstelen met het mediagebruik van (jonge) kinderen. Ze vragen zich af hoe de nieuwe mogelijkheden het best benut kunnen worden en hoe gevaren vermeden kunnen worden. Wat moeten kinderen leren om veilig en effici?nt met nieuwe media om te gaan? Welke vaardigheden zijn er nodig om mediawijze burgers van hen te maken? En wat zijn hierbij taken van opvoeders? Het boek Contact! Kinderen en nieuwe media brengt het werk van de beste onderzoekers in Nederland op dit terrein samen.

An internationally known and respected journalist, Robertson had a knack for finding the interesting and exotic in seemingly humble or ordinary folk and a keen eye for human interest stories. His power of description and disarmingly straightforward narrative were the hallmarks of his writing. A loyal Southern son, Robertson cherished what he judged to be the South's best traditions: personal independence and responsibility, the rejection of crass materialism, a deep piety, and a love of freedom. He repeatedly lamented the region's many shortcomings: poverty, racial hierarchy, political impotence, lack of inttellectual curiosity, and its tendency to blame all of its twentieth-century problems on the defeat of the Confederacy. An informative and entertaining new introduction by Lacy K. Ford, Jr., associate professor of history at the University of South Carolina, provides fascinating new facts about Robertson's life and recasts his achievements in Red Hills and Cotton as social commentary.

R. Martin's fantastical world, from the physics of an ice wall to the genetics of the Targaryens and Lannisters. Game of Thrones is a fantasy that features a lot of made-up science fabricated climatology (when is winter coming?), astronomy, metallurgy, chemistry, and biology. Most fans of George R. R. Martin's fantastical world accept it all as part of the magic. A trained scientist, watching the fake science in Game of Thrones, might think,  But how would it work?  In Fire, Ice, and Physics, Rebecca Thompson turns a scientist's eye on Game of Thrones, exploring, among other things, the science of an ice wall, the genetics of the Targaryen and Lannister families, and the biology of beheading. Thompson, a PhD in physics and an enthusiastic Game of Thrones fan, uses the fantasy science of the show as a gateway to some interesting real science, introducing GOT fandom to a new dimension of appreciation. Thompson starts at the beginning, with winter, explaining seasons and the very elliptical orbit of the Earth that might cause winter to come (or not come). She tells us that ice can behave like ketchup, compares regular steel to Valyrian steel, explains that dragons are  bats, but with fire,  and considers Targaryen inbreeding.

We zien veel objecten niet meer, maar kijken er als het ware dwars doorheen. Het zijn schimmen die enkel bestaan om ons in het dagelijks leven te dienen. In Dansen met een plastic zak krijgt   n van deze alledaagse schimmen, die zich bij uitstek kenmerkt door zijn dienstbaarheid en onaanzienlijkheid, een podium geboden: de plastic zak. Hoewel er per dag miljoenen kilos plastic worden geproduceerd, verbruikt en weggegooid, duikt de plastic zak relatief zelden op in filosofische of kunstzinnige reflecties. Dit boek bestaat uit een reeks filosofische bespiegelingen over de plastic zak, over onze relatie tot dit onaanzienlijke ding en tot onszelf.

They were the biggest and brashest icons that New York, and possibly America, has ever produced--magnificent giants that became intimately familiar around the globe. Their builders were possessed of a singular determination to create wonders of capitalism as well as engineering, refusing to admit defeat before natural forces, economics, or politics. No one knows the history of the towers better than New York Times reporters James Glanz and Eric Lipton. In a vivid, brilliantly researched narrative, the authors re-create David Rockefeller's ambition to rebuild lower Manhattan, the spirited opposition of local storeowners and powerful politicians, the bold structural innovations that later determined who lived and died, master builder Guy Tozzoli's last desperate view of the towers on September 11, and the charged and chaotic recovery that could have unraveled the secrets of the buildings' collapse but instead has left some enduring mysteries. City in the Sky is a riveting story of New York City itself, of architectural daring, human frailty, and a lost American icon.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=wglOAgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Rhys's Redemption (Harlequin Presents, No. 2126)","description":"Dominic's downfall!

They provide a global model of some metric of a design (such as weight, aerodynamic drag, cost, etc.), which can then be optimized efficiently. Engineering Design via Surrogate Modelling is a self-contained guide to surrogate models and their use in engineering design. The fundamentals of building, selecting, validating, searching and refining a surrogate are presented in a manner accessible to novices in the field. Figures are used liberally to explain the key concepts and clearly show the differences between the various techniques, as well as to emphasize the intuitive nature of the conceptual and mathematical reasoning behind them. More advanced and recent concepts are each presented in stand-alone chapters, allowing the reader to concentrate on material pertinent to their current design problem, and concepts are clearly demonstrated using simple design problems. This collection of advanced concepts (visualization, constraint handling, coping with noisy data, gradient-enhanced modelling, multi-fidelity analysis and multiple objectives) represents an invaluable reference manual for engineers and researchers active in the area. Engineering Design via Surrogate Modelling is complemented by a suite of Matlab codes, allowing the reader to apply all the techniques presented to their own design problems. By applying statistical modelling to engineering design, this book bridges the wide gap between the engineering and statistics communities. It will appeal to postgraduates and researchers across the academic engineering design community as well as practising design engineers. Provides an inclusive and practical guide to using surrogates in engineering design. Presents the fundamentals of building, selecting, validating, searching and refining a surrogate model. Guides the reader through the practical implementation of a surrogate-based design process using a set of case studies from real engineering design challenges.

They asked with a puzzled look to which Mom replied, \\"An Invisible String made of love.\\" That's where the story begins. A story that teaches of the tie that really binds. The Invisible String reaches from heart to heart. Does everybody have an Invisible String? How far does it reach, anyway? Does it ever go away? Read all about it! THE INVISIBLE STRING is a very simple approach to overcoming the fear of loneliness or separation with an imaginative flair that children can easily identify with and remember. Here is a warm and delightful lesson teaching young and old that we aren't ever really alone and reminding children (and adults!) that when we are loved beyond anything we can imagine. \\"People who love each other are always connected by a very special String, made of love. Even though you can't see it with your eyes, you can feel it deep in your heart, and know that you are always connected to the ones you love.\\" Thus begins this heart-warming and reassuring story that addresses the issue of \\"separation anxiety\\" (otherwise known as the sense of existential 'aloneness') to children of all ages. Specifically written to address children's fear of being apart from the ones they love, The Invisible String delivers a particularly compelling message in today's uncertain times that though we may be separated from the ones we care for, whether through anger, or distance or even death, love is the unending connection that binds us all, and, by extension, ultimately binds every person on the planet to everyone else.

Preachers and theologians throughout Christian history have grappled with Scripture's diverse emphases alongside the urgent task of declaring the authoritative Word of God in the contemporary pulpit. Aaron Edwards offers a new way of engaging with this problem, by exploring the theological relationship between biblical dialectics and heraldic proclamation. Edwards highlights the theological necessity of dialectical variety, without forfeiting assertiveness in the prophetic moment of preaching. A vast array of key voices from the theological tradition are drawn upon - including Augustine, Aquinas, Eckhart, Luther, Calvin, Hegel, Kierkegaard, Chesterton, Barth, Bultmann, Tillich, Ebeling, and others - to navigate the connection between Scriptural unity, clarity, and paradoxical plurivocality, leading to a nuanced account of dialectic. Applying this to the homiletically neglected concept of 'heraldic' confidence in preaching, Edwards examines the theological possibility of preaching in light of dialectical complexity via its 'prophetic' dimension. He shows how the uniquely revelatory relationship of Word and Spirit enables Scriptural illumination, prophetic discernment, and dialectical decisiveness in the 'momentary' encounter which undergirds all Christian proclamation.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ARxeDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Generation Next (X-Men: The Age of Apocalypse Gold Deluxe Edition)","description":"Featuring more than 35,000 updated prices, this easy-to-use guide covers all the new titles in the rapidly expanding comics market. 600 illustrations.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=yJrYIOQqq-8C&dq=Generation+Next+(X-Men:+The+Age+of+Apocalypse+Gold+Deluxe+Edition)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"First Place (Sweet Valley Twins Series, Book 8)","description":"When Lila gets her own beautiful horse, Elizabeth does anything Lila wants just to get to ride the horse every day.

Having battled lifetime obesity, Marsha Miller lost approximately 100 pounds, beginning during middle age, by finally following a sensible path. It took eleven years to change from living at morbidly obese levels with health concerns, to living at a reasonable weight and in the best physical condition of her life. Knowing that she was constantly improving her body, rather than dieting, erased all excuses to alter her direction. Obesity s oppression not only robs us of physical enjoyment, but steals our inner peace. Discovering peace within a healthy lifestyle is liberating! Many of the obese are simply  Slow Losers/Fast Gainers  who are frustrated by society s imposed expectations for quick weight-loss results. This book shows that learning to make peace within an overall wellness process (enjoying the ride) fortifies confidence in our sense of self, improves general health at everyone s starting level, and makes healthier weight management possible for everyone. Marsha s first fifty-five years may have been spent within the slavery of obesity, but the second fifty-five years?

The raid on Taranto anticipated the attack on Pearl Harbor, and historians have seen it as a precursor to the larger and more devastating strike by the Imperial Japanese Navy. The Taranto raid takes on added significance with the little-known fact that an officer in the US Navy was aboard the British aircraft carrier, and reported extensively on the attack to the Office of Naval Intelligence in Washington. For the first time, this book tells the entire story of Taranto and its relevance to Pearl Harbor. The book describes the attack in detail, and clears up mistakes and misconceptions that appeared in previous publications. The damage was done by 21 planes flown off the deck of HMS Illustrious, without any participation of the Royal Air Force. Illustrious took to sea the radar and aircraft control procedures that helped win the Battle of Britain. From British sources, the book describes the techniques used to allow successful use of aerial torpedoes in the shallow waters of Taranto harbor.

Lucy Honeychurch journeys from England to Italy on holiday hoping to broaden her world, but it s not the beauty of Florence that she falls in love with. No, trapped in a hotel populated by nothing but fellow Britons, it s hard for Lucy to experience Italy at all. To make matters worse, the room with the view she was promised isn t available. Overhearing her dismay, a father and son duo offer to switch rooms with her. It is a generous gesture met with revulsion from Lucy s suffocating chaperone, for to accept would put them in a compromising position and be a major social gaffe. Touched by the kindness of it and for the first time in her life questioning the barriers of her social standing, Lucy develops a fondness for the two uncouth gentlemen. In fact, George Emerson, younger of the two, might be the only spot of joy Lucy has in Florence. No sooner does Lucy find herself falling for George, who values her mind and spirit, when she is whisked away to Rome. There, she meets Cecil Vyse who, though domineering, pompous, and snide, matches her social standing and proposes. Lucy, thinking she is making the most practical choice, is ready to settle for Cecil. But when George moves closer to her and confesses his true feelings, Lucy must choose between her true desires and that which she was taught was best her entire life.

Just as amateur sleuth Fran Varady is getting her life back on track, problems arise in Watching Out, the fifth fantastic Fran Varady mystery by Ann Granger. The perfect read for fans of M.C. Beaton and Rebecca Tope. 'One of crime fiction's most engaging heroines' - Yorkshire Post Fran Varady fell into private detective work by accident rather than design. Now she's got a 'real' job at a trendy pizzeria, she's back on track with her acting ambitions, and she's even found a nice flat to rent. But things aren't as straightforward as they seem. The job, for a start: there's something rather sinister about the way the pizzeria is run. And the play rehearsals aren't going well. As if all this doesn't bring problems enough, Fran has rashly undertaken to help a young boy, illegally in the country, find an elusive people-trafficker called Max. When the trail Fran is following is suddenly and tragically interrupted by a horrifying death, she finds herself up against dangerous men and a ruthless organisation.

Caliban is the monstrous native, in love with what he cannot possess, lost to his own sense of identity. In Virgil Su rez's vision, the island of Caliban's imprisonment merges with the island of Cuba, where the carboneros make charcoal and sell it door-to-door by the pound, young boxers crackle with caged energy, dock workers spill like ants out of the bellies of ships, and the rain falls in torrents on corrugated tin roofs. On this island of fire, the Marquis de Sade joins other historical figures to drink absinthe, and J. Edgar Hoover lingers over mojitos and a cigar at the Tropicana Night Club in Old Havana. Hovering behind the hotel shutters or half-concealed behind their masks, the old poets and prophets--Shakespeare, Tiresias, Pablo Neruda--are waiting to speak their passions. Out of this rich imaginative brew, Su rez evokes the mythical and historical landscape of Cuba and distills the \\"hollow, deep-thudded pangs\\" of exile's rootlessness, the immigrant's constant longing to be possessed by a sense of place. Steeped in a seductive, incantatory language of desire, Guide to the Blue Tongue gives entry to a place of blue possibility and daily undoing, where the sting of salt-fresh air is compounded by the ache of displacement and loss.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=1iaDrINqsOQC&dq=Guide+to+the+Blue+Tongue:+POEMS+(Illinois+Poetry+Series)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Strategic concepts in fire fighting","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=5mM4bwAACAAJ&dq=Strategic+concepts+in+fire+fighting&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Cinderella Man: James J. Braddock, Max Baer and the Greatest Upset in Boxing History","description":"New York Times Bestseller: This true Depression-era story of a down-and-out fighter s dramatic comeback is  a delight  (David Halberstam). James J. Braddock was a once promising light heavyweight. But a string of losses in the ring and a broken right hand happened to coincide with the Great Crash of 1929 and Braddock was forced to labor on the docks of Hoboken. Only his manager, Joe Gould, still believed in him. Gould looked out for the burly, quiet Irishman, finding matches for Braddock to help him feed his wife and children. Together, they were about to stage the greatest comeback in fighting history. Within twelve months, Braddock went from being on the relief rolls to facing heavyweight champion Max Baer, renowned for having allegedly killed two men in the ring. A brash Jewish boxer from the West Coast, Baer was heavily favored but Braddock carried the hopes and dreams of the working class on his shoulders, and when he emerged victorious against all odds, the shock was palpable and the cheers were deafening. In the wake of his surprise win, Damon Runyon dubbed him  Cinderella Man.  Against the gritty backdrop of the 1930s, Cinderella Man brings this dramatic all-American story to life, telling a classic David and Goliath tale that transcends the sport.

Ross Anderson explores what security engineering means in 2020, including: How the basic elements of cryptography, protocols, and access control translate to the new world of phones, cloud services, social media and the Internet of Things Who the attackers are  from nation states and business competitors through criminal gangs to stalkers and playground bullies What they do  from phishing and carding through SIM swapping and software exploits to DDoS and fake news Security psychology, from privacy through ease-of-use to deception The economics of security and dependability  why companies build vulnerable systems and governments look the other way How dozens of industries went online  well or badly How to manage security and safety engineering in a world of agile development  from reliability engineering to DevSecOps The third edition of Security Engineering ends with a grand challenge: sustainable security. As we build ever more software and connectivity into safety-critical durable goods like cars and medical devices, how do we design systems we can maintain and defend for decades? Or will everything in the world need monthly software upgrades, and become unsafe once they stop?","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=GNIHEAAAQBAJ&dq=Introduction+To+Security+Printing&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Days of Atonement: A Novel","description":"Drie kinderen dood in bed, hun moeders lichaam verbrijzeld door een ongeluk in een pakhuis, hun vader overleden tijdens een militaire oefening en dat allemaal binnen   n week.

In exploring these issues using a multidisciplinary methodology, Effros suggests that scholars may assess historical manifestations of the use of food and drink to create and reinforce the social hierarchy. Effros addresses the tensions between monastic and lay communities and focuses on patronage through food and drink as a source of informal power, a subject too often overlooked in favour of institutional structures more familiar to twentieth-century historians.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=782kDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Murder on Capitol Hill","description":"Between them, Senator Cale Caldwell and his blue-blooded wife controlled as much power on Capitol Hill as the law would allow.

George MacDonald, nineteenth-century Scottish novelist and poet, was reintroduced to twentieth century Christians by C.S.

Chesterton said of MacDonald, \\"If we test the matter of originality of attitude, George MacDonald was one of the three or four greatest men of the nineteenth century.\\" W.H. Auden adds, \\"In his power ... to project his inner life into images ... which are valid for all, he is one of the most remarkable writers of the nineteenth century.\\" Despite acclaim by his peers, historians, Christian statesmen, and literary giants of the past 100 years, MacDonald's life and writings continue to be a source of controversy. Challenging the traditional religious views of his day, MacDonald was continually stretching, reaching, probing, questioning, and searching for truth. Author Michael R. Phillips leads the listener through those controversies to bring a fresh and insightful look at the man, his times, and his work.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=TobyAAAAMAAJ&dq=George+MacDonald:+A+Biography+of+Scotland%27s+Beloved+Storyteller&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Tarascon Pediatric Emergency Pocketbook 4th Edition","description":"The Tarascon Pediatric Emergency Pocketbook, Sixth Edition is a meticulously referenced pocket guide to managing ill or injured children.

Reinforcement learning, one of the most active research areas in artificial intelligence, is a computational approach to learning whereby an agent tries to maximize the total amount of reward it receives while interacting with a complex, uncertain environment. In Reinforcement Learning, Richard Sutton and Andrew Barto provide a clear and simple account of the field's key ideas and algorithms. This second edition has been significantly expanded and updated, presenting new topics and updating coverage of other topics. Like the first edition, this second edition focuses on core online learning algorithms, with the more mathematical material set off in shaded boxes. Part I covers as much of reinforcement learning as possible without going beyond the tabular case for which exact solutions can be found. Many algorithms presented in this part are new to the second edition, including UCB, Expected Sarsa, and Double Learning. Part II extends these ideas to function approximation, with new sections on such topics as artificial neural networks and the Fourier basis, and offers expanded treatment of off-policy learning and policy-gradient methods.

Assembling this work not only brings together some of the finest examples of loft architecture from over more than a decade, but also defines the distinguished output of ten New York architects, who collectively evidence the nature of a developing modernity in their projects. All the architects included are also engaged in the teaching of architecture or in the exhibition of their work, thereby extending the influence of their thought and conceptual process. The extensive illustrations include original concept drawings, renderings and plans, some prepared specifically for this publication. The photographs are selected to reveal more than just impressions of the interior, conveying and encapsulating the dual sense of both space and materiality, and the presence of fine detail. Overall, what is established is a deep sense of rooted settlement and the restorative values of ordered space and light within the structure of a personal retreat - a peaceful sanctuary withdrawn from the external life of the city. The ten New York architects and architectural teams included in this collection are: Thomas Hanrahan & Victoria Meyers; Frank Lupo & Daniel Rowen; Bernard Tschumi; Richard Gluckman; Henry Smith Miller & Laurie Hawkinson; Tod Williams & Billie Tsien; Gisue & Mojgan Hariri; Scott Marble & Karen Fairbanks; Sulan Kolatan and William MacDonald; and George Ranalli.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=8UtUAAAAMAAJ&dq=Lofts+(Architecture&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Yr Prsnl Vitamin Pfl","description":"In Your Personal Vitamin Profile, medical scientist Dr. Michael Colgan shows how individually tailored programs of vitamin and mineral supplements lead to better health and longer life. According to Dr. Colgan, no two people have the same nutritional needs. Consequently, an \\"all-purpose\\" one-a-day vitamin pill cannot guarantee optimum nutritional supplementation in any diet. And there are factors beyond diet that must be considered. For instance, a man who smokes twenty cigarettes a day may require as much as fifteen times the Recommended Daily Allowance of vitamin C to maintain efficient functioning of the immune system. A woman who takes birth control pills may require ten times the RDA of vitamin B12 to maintain normal functioning of the cardiovascular system. Dr. Colgan's Health and Performance Nutrient Supplement Program -- a vitamin and mineral plan geared to the individual -- has been successful in reducing the incidence of herpes, eczema, high blood pressure, and migraine headaches. The program has also proven successful in diminishing the pain of muscle and joint injuries, and in alleviating depression. Moreover, Dr. Colgan's individually oriented supplement program has -- in a double-blind study -- helped athletes improve marathon times by an average of seventeen minutes.

Foxes of the Desert is the definitive work on the Afrika Korps and the other German forces who served in the Western Desert and Tunisia during World War II. Dominating the story are the personality and the brilliant strategy and tactics of the wily, fast-thinking and hard-hitting \\"Desert Fox,\\" Field Marshal Erwin Rommel. In fascinating detail the author tells the full story of the great German master of desert armored warfare and his men and the other German forces in North Africa, during their many months of bitterly contested fighting against the pick of Britain's forces under such commanders as Wavell, Auchinleck, and finally Montgomery, and the Americans under Eisenhower. Here are the famous siege of Tobruk; Rommel's celebrated surprise push in the early spring of 1941 when the Afrika Korps captured Mersa el Brega and Agedabia and rolled on far eastward into Bardia and Sollum; the battle of Halfaya (\\"Hellfire\\") Pass; the great tank battle on the Gazala front; the Germans' capture of Tobruk, with 33,000 prisoners and vast booty; the fateful battles of Alam Halfa and El Alamein; and the bloody campaign in Tunisia. Interwoven are fascinating accounts of the work of the German Secret Service; of the British Long Range Desert Group, and of its German counterpart, the Brandenburg Group. Numerous other commando operations and exciting exploits of espionage and sabotage are described in detail for the first time. As a result of personal interviews with over a thousand combatants, tireless reading, and painstaking research, Paul Carell has skillfully blended a mass of new and exciting information into a dramatic and completely authentic narrative. As a story of strategy and battle, Foxes of the Desert is both exhaustive and engrossing, and, as authorative history, it cannot be overlooked by anyone wishing a full understanding of World War II. This edition contains a new preface by Paul Carell who is also the author of Invasion! They're Coming!, Scorched Earth, Hitler Moves East, Stalingrad: The Defeat of the German 6th Army, and Operation Barbarossa in Photographs.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=9mEfAAAACAAJ&dq=The+Foxes+of+the+Desert+:+The+Story+of+the+Afrika+Korps&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Chalk Whispers","description":"Los Angeles police detective and author Paul Bishop brings gripping authenticity and power to Chalk Whispers, his latest poignant and revealing novel featuring L.A.P.D.

These two Indian groups viewed the world in different ways. The Southeastern Indians, primarily Choctaws, Cherokees, Creeks, Chickasaws, and Seminoles, were agricultural peoples. By the nineteenth century they were adopting American \\"civilization\\": codified laws, Christianity, market-driven farming, and a formal, Euroamerican style of education. By contrast, the hunter-gathers of the Southern Plains-the Comanches, Kiowas, Wichitas, and Osages-had a culture based on the buffalo. They actively resisted the Removed Indians' \\"invasion\\" of their homelands. The Removed Indians hoped to lessen Plains Indian raids into Indian Territory by \\"civilizing\\" the Plains peoples through diplomatic councils and trade. But the Southern Plains Indians were not interested in \\"civilization\\" and saw no use in farming. Even their defeat by the U.S. government could not bridge the cultural gap between the Plains and Removed Indians, a gulf that remains to this day.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=RxbQdtCk3CUC&dq=Contrary+Neighbors:+Southern+Plains+and+Removed+Indians+in+Indian+Territory+(Civilization+of+the+American+Indian)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Writer's Guide and Index to English","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=yeN4AAAAIAAJ&dq=Writer%27s+Guide+and+Index+to+English&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Technique of Screen and Television Writing","description":"Vale's Technique of Screen and Television Writing is an updated and expanded edition of a valuable guide to writing for film and television. Mr. Vale takes the aspiring writer through every phase of a film's development, from the original concept to the final shooting script. Teachers of the craft as well as writers and directors have acclaimed it as one of the best books ever written on how to write a screenplay. This book combines practical advice for the aspiring or established writer with a lucid overview of the unique features of this most contemporary art form, distinguishing film and video from other media and other kinds of storytelling. It teaches the reader to think in terms of the camera and gives practical advice on the realities of filmmaking. At the same time, Vale, who began his own career as a scriptwriter for the great French director Jean Renoir, provides a solid grounding in the history of drama from the Classical Greek theater through the great cinematic works of the twentieth century. Both philosophical and pragmatic, this is a very readable book for students and active professionals who want to improve their writing skills, and for film enthusiasts interested in knowing more about what they see on the screen. Mr. Vale is that rare combination, a practitioner of great experience who can offer a lucid explanation of his craft. Eugene Vale was born in Switzerland and began his career in France in the 1930s. He was an award-winning novelist, film and TV scriptwriter and teacher, whose works include the bestselling novel The Thirteenth Apostle and the scripts for Francis of Assisi, The Bridge of San Luis Rey, and The Second Face. He also worked in many other areas of the motion picture industry, including directing, producing, cutting, distribution and finance. His archives are held by Boston University and University of Southern California. Mr. Vale died in 1997, shortly after he completed the updated version of this handbook.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=e4-JpW4_CFkC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Pashto-English/ English-Pashto Dictionary & Phrasebook (Hippocrene Dictionary & Phrasebooks)","description":"Presents a concise Pashto-English, English-Pashto dictionary and phrase book, with additional information on the grammar and script of the Pashto language, as well as cultural information about its speakers.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=0aMHAAAACAAJ&dq=Pashto-English/+English-Pashto+Dictionary&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"DIE BIBEL IN HEUTIGEM DEUTSCH","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=tRVuzgEACAAJ&dq=DIE+BIBEL+IN+HEUTIGEM+DEUTSCH&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Doctrine of Karma: A Study in Its Philosophy and Practice","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=bWuGmgEACAAJ&dq=Doctrine+of+Karma:+A+Study+in+Its+Philosophy+and+Practice&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Wiley CPA Exam Review: Finance 2000","description":"Helping candidates pass the CPA exam for more than 25 years! * Time-proven-the most effective system available to prepare for the CPA exam * Timely-up-to-the-minute coverage.

The man whose inventions changed the world and defined the future course of American life first visited the young and still untamed town in 1885, purchasing a winter residence known as Seminole Lodge that he and his family would use until his death in 1931. His Fort Myers home subsequently provided the setting for the many notables who would visit Edison, including automobile magnate Henry Ford, rubber baron Harvey S. Firestone, and writer and naturalist John Burroughs. Today, the Edisons' mutual bonds with the community are perhaps the defining feature of Fort Myers' history. The city has named numerous streets and public venues, its community college, a mile-long bridge, and its major shopping mall after Edison, and Fort Myers has recognized the annual Edison Festival of Light and Pageant as its premier social and winter events. Because of Edison's long association with Southwest Florida, his memory and persona hold an unparalleled significance for the entire region.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=TFW2sI3zWI0C&dq=Thomas+Edison:+The+Fort+Myers+Connection+(FL)+(Images+of+America)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Paterson Colt Book Early Evolution of Samuel Colt's Repeating Arms","description":"The fascinating story of the American inventor and manufacturer who perfected the revolver Samuel Colt (1814-1862) first patented his \\"Colt\\" revolver in 1835 and thereby redefined the architecture of handguns. This stunning book is the first to present in detail the evolution of his most famous invention and to document the unsurpassed Colt firearms collections held by the Wadsworth Atheneum. Colt designed his revolvers with an artistic sensibility--paying particular attention to form and beauty and juxtaposing colors and finishes to heighten the visual effects. He was also one of the first American manufacturers to secure celebrity endorsements and to commission paintings by renowned artists like George Catlin to promote his arms. Colt's standards for excellence, industrial foresight, and quest for market domination are explored in light of primary documents that reveal his constant battles to protect his patents. Essays discuss Colt's personal collection of historic firearms as well as the memorial collection of Colt-manufactured firearms, the relationship between art and commerce as they pertain to the inventor's career, and his international celebrity. Richly illustrated and beautifully produced, this volume presents the artistry of the firearms that Colt worked so diligently to perfect--as well as his promotional abilities that made a tremendous impact on American culture.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=T9e37mYzuNIC&dq=Paterson+Colt+Book+Early+Evolution+of+Samuel+Colt%27s+Repeating+Arms&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Sightseein' and RVin': Travel Adventures after 50","description":"Sightseein' and RVin': Travel Adventures After 50 chronicles six years of fulltime RV travels and discoveries across our country, as told through e-mail newsletters.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=1DkIZvfZHmQC&dq=Sightseein%27+and+RVin%27:+Travel+Adventures+after+50&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Economics for Real People: An Introduction to the Austrian School","description":"LARGE PRINT EDITION!

The Handbook begins with a consideration of Yeats's early work, and the legacy of the 19th century. The broadly chronological areas which follow, covering the period from the 1910s through to the 21st century, allow scope for coverage of key poetic voices in Ireland in their historical and political context. From the experimentalism of Beckett, MacGreevy, and others of the modernist generation, to the refashioning of Yeats's Ireland on the part of poets such as MacNeice, Kavanagh, and Clarke mid-century, through to the controversially titled post-1969 'Northern Renaissance' of poetry, this volume will provide extensive coverage of the key movements of the modern period. The Handbook covers the work of, among others, Paul Durcan, Thomas Kinsella, Brendan Kennelly, Seamus Heaney, Paul Muldoon, Michael Longley, Medbh McGuckian, and Ciaran Carson. The thematic sections interspersed throughout - chapters on women's poetry, religion, translation, painting, music, stylistics - allow for comparative studies of poets north and south across the century. Central to the guiding spirit of this project is the Handbook's consideration of poetic forms, and a number of essays explore the generic diversity of poetry in Ireland, its various manipulations, reinventions and sometimes repudiations of traditional forms. The last essays in the book examine the work of a 'new' generation of poets from Ireland, concentrating on work published in the last two decades by Justin Quinn, Leontia Flynn, Sinead Morrissey, David Wheatley, Vona Groarke, and others.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=EvIyMXtM9NIC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Strike Sparks: Selected Poems, 1980-2002","description":"A powerful collection from one of our most gifted and widely read poets117 of her finest poems drawn from her seven published volumes.

Aldiss then explores the social and religious divisions keeping the planet s population in conflict even as they re devastated by plague in Helliconia Summer, and concludes the trilogy with Helliconia Winter, which recounts both the threat of a looming, frigid age of decay and the hope of a new future.

This book, argued from a perspective shaped by postmodernism, is at once an accessible guide to and an engagement with various methods, theories, and critical practices transforming biblical scholarship today. Written by a collective of cutting-edge scholars--with each page the work of multiple hands--The Postmodern Bible deliberately breaks with the individualist model of authorship that has traditionally dominated scholarship in the humanities and is itself an illustration of the postmodern transformation of biblical studies for which it argues. The book introduces, illustrates, and critiques seven prominent strategies of reading. Several of these interpretive strategies--rhetorical criticism, structuralism and narratology, reader-response criticism, and feminist criticism--have been instrumental in the transformation of biblical studies up to now. Many--feminist and womanist criticism, ideological criticism, poststructuralism, and psychoanalytic criticism--hold promise for the continued transformation of these studies in the future. Focusing on readings from both the Hebrew Bible and the New Testament, this volume illuminates the current multidisciplinary debates emerging from postmodernism by exposing the still highly contested epistemological, political, and ethical positions in the field of biblical studies.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=dG1b7ACZwRsC&dq=The+Postmodern+Bible&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"When God Became ApParent","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=oroF4UKDrcIC&dq=When+God+Became+ApParent&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Papa Doc; the truth about Haiti today","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=QBNUnQEACAAJ&dq=Papa+Doc%3B+the+truth+about+Haiti+today&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Three lives for Mississippi (A Signet book)","description":"This new edition of biographical sketches of notable blacks from Mississippi expands the edition published in 1977.

Il procedimento pittorico di Salvatori si basa sulla memoria, egli esprime sulla tela le sensazioni ed emozioni che ha ricevuto vedendo un luogo, respirando un atmosfera. Il compito dell arte, secondo l estetica hegeliana,  : << rivelare la verit  sotto forma di configurazione artistica sensibile>>. La profonda fede religiosa conferisce prima all uomo Salvatori e poi al pittore serenit  d animo che si rispecchia nei quadri. Ne deriva una pittura che si materializza in configurazioni visionarie; la colorazione dei paesaggi potrebbe portare a considerare una vicinanza all impressionismo ma, diversamente dal movimento francese, nei quadri di Salvatori non c   n  l intenzione di cogliere il fenomenico, n  tantomeno una tranche de vie. Il tempo di questi paesaggi non   l istante ma l eterno. Letture dell Estetica di Hegel, di testi sacri e una profonda religiosit  sono, quindi, le radici della pittura inattuale di Salvatori. Inattuale perch  diversa dalle tendenze dominanti improntate al nichilismo, a una eccessiva spettacolarit , a uno scimmiottamento della tecnologia, a una spasmodica ricerca di originalit ; Salvatori invece ricerca l origine profonda dell esistenza e con una pittura tradizionale coglie l anima che sottost  alla forma sensibile. Per Salvatori l arte viene dal cuore dell uomo puro e fiducioso che avendo gioia nel cuore la rivede specchiata nella gaia bellezza della natura. E allora una luce emana dalle tele, la luce dello spirito.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=hr5PEAAAQBAJ&dq=Love+Roma+1&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Sir Ebenezer Howard and the town planning movement, (Publications of the University of Manchester)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=zhXoAAAAIAAJ&dq=Sir+Ebenezer+Howard+and+the+town+planning+movement,+(Publications+of+the+University+of+Manchester)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Simply Shakespeare: Readers Theatre for Young People","description":"Thirteen scripts from Weekly Reader's Read magazine feature age-appropriate play adaptations from some of Shakespeare's greatest and best-known works.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=J45wq6hw1HMC&dq=Simply+Shakespeare:+Readers+Theatre+for+Young+People&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The 13th Black Crusade (Warhammer Novels)","description":"A collection of charts, maps, illustrations, and photographs complement a fascinating journey inside the Warhammer 40,000 world, which chronicles the last great crusade of the Chaos Warmaster Abaddon.

Michael Halloran bring together nine essays that explore change in both the theory and the practice of rhetoric in the nineteenth-century United States. In their introductory essay, Clark and Halloran argue that at the beginning of the nineteenth century, rhetoric encompassed a neoclassical oratorical culture in which speakers articulated common values to establish consensual moral authority that directed community thought and action. As the century progressed, however, moral authority shifted from the civic realm to the professional, thus expanding participation in the community as it fragmented the community itself. Clark and Halloran argue that this shift was a transformation in which rhetoric was reconceived to meet changing cultural needs. Part I examines the theories and practices of rhetoric that dominated at the beginning of the century. The essays in this section include \\"Edward Everett and Neoclassical Oratory in Genteel America\\" by Ronald F. Reid, \\"The Oratorical Poetic of Timothy Dwight\\" by Gregory Clark, \\"The Sermon as Public Discourse: Austin Phelps and the Conservative Homiletic Tradition in Nineteenth-Century America\\" by Russel Hirst, and \\"A Rhetoric of Citizenship in Nineteenth-Century America\\" by P. Joy Rouse. Part 2 examines rhetorical changes in the culture that developed during that century. The essays include \\"The Popularization of Nineteenth-Century Rhetoric: Elocution and the Private Learner\\" by Nan Johnson, \\"Rhetorical Power in the Victorian Parlor: Godey's Lady's Book and the Gendering of Nineteenth-Century Rhetoric\\" by Nicole Tonkovich, \\"Jane Addams and the Social Rhetoric of Democracy\\" by Catherine Peaden, \\"The Divergence of Purpose and Practice on the Chatauqua: Keith Vawter's Self-Defense\\" by Frederick J.

This volume follows the army's withdrawal through 800 miles of devastated countryside, crossing the horrific relics of the Borodino battlefield, fighting its way through the Russian General Kutusov's successive attempts to cut it off, and winning, against overwhelming odds, the three-day battle of the Berezina crossing. First-hand narratives, many published in English for the first time, describe Marshal Ney's astounding achievement in holding together the rear-guard until he himself, musket in hand, was the last man to re-cross the Niemen into Poland.Using the words of the participants themselves, Paul Britten Austin brings unparalleled authenticity and immediacy to his unique account of the closing stages of Napoleon's dramatic and tragic 1812 campaign.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=D-vNAwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Politics of Urban Planning","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=iYmbnQAACAAJ&dq=The+Politics+of+Urban+Planning&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Alcoholism and Christian experience,","description":"This firsthand study of actual case histories \\"looks at a conversion experience in relation to the life pattern of the alcoholic and sets a pattern of research that can be assimilated into the practice of the Christian ministry.\\"--Wayne E.

In the fall of 1918, a fever gripped Boston. The streets emptied as paranoia about the deadly Spanish flu spread. Newspapermen and vigilante investigators aggressively sought to discredit anyone who looked or sounded German. And as the war raged on, the enemy seemed to be lurking everywhere: prowling in submarines off the coast of Cape Cod, arriving on passenger ships in the harbor, or disguised as the radicals lecturing workers about the injustice of a sixty-hour workweek. War Fever explores this delirious moment in American history through the stories of three men: Karl Muck, the German conductor of the Boston Symphony Orchestra, accused of being an enemy spy; Charles Whittlesey, a Harvard law graduate who became an unlikely hero in Europe; and the most famous baseball player of all time, Babe Ruth, poised to revolutionize the game he loved.

During the height of the 1990s bull market, they were America s new heroes: the heroes of business. They were our bold new leaders, cutting the fat, pushing for productivity, implementing visionary plans, and making strategic deals. When the bull market turned to bust and the applause turned to cat-calls, the world was shocked at the truth. Drenched in money and public acclaim, our CEO-heroes mostly white, mostly male, mostly middle-aged turned out to be not much different than a group of twenty-something rock stars drunk on power and driven by sex, greed, and glamour. Testosterone Inc. goes behind the boardroom doors to show the serial affairs and marriages of these acquisitive corporate titans. At the center of this story is Jack Welch, the biggest of America s rock star CEOs and the former head of General Electric Co., surrounded by  mini-me  CEOs Ron Perelman of Revlon, Al Dunlap of Sunbeam, and Dennis Kozlowski of Tyco all gone wild in public displays of consumption and predatory appetites writ large. Byron gets inside the bars where Welch liked to hang out and pick up women with his early  business soul mate  buddies. Byron hovers unseen at the elbow of Ron Perelman and his mistress aboard the Concorde for a week in Paris in his mistaken belief that his wife knows nothing about his secret affair. Byron peeks behind the curtains of a U.S. Army officers  quarters to behold Al Dunlap horrifying his first wife, who claimed in her divorce action that Dunlap would point his knife at her and say,  I often wondered what human flesh tasted like.  Byron becomes a fly on the wall to chronicle the longing for respect and serial womanizing of Dennis Kozlowski. Frequently hilarious, sometimes heartbreaking, Testosterone Inc. follows the intertwined lives of these four corporate heroes, from childhood to their ultimate moments of glory and the crash-and-burn calamities that followed, as man s age-old hunger for power, greed, and temptation undid them all. From suicide to murder, from dysfunctional childhoods to dysfunctional marriages in adulthood, from business chutzpah to financial suicide, here is the ultimate untold business story of our time: what went on at century s end, when testosterone got the best of businessmen everywhere, and CEOs went wild.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=MJPzDwAAQBAJ&dq=Call+Me+Roger:+The+story+of+How+Roger+Smith,+Chairman+of+General+Motors,+Transformed+the+Industry+Leader+into+a+Fallen+Giant&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Tainted Trail (Ukiah Oregon, Book 2)","description":"Provides synopses for over 1,500 titles of current popular fiction and recommends other books by such criteria as authors, characters portrayed, time period, geographical setting, or genre","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=NGPlAAAAMAAJ&dq=Tainted+Trail+(Ukiah+Oregon,+Book+2)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Jehovah's Witnesses Answered Verse by Verse","description":"No other book answers the Jehovah's Witnesses' misinterpretation of Scripture so immediately and shows how to use the same Scripture in leading Jehovah's Witnesses to Christ.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=nEGfoZUovyIC&dq=Jehovah%27s+Witnesses+Answered+Verse+by+Verse&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Guy Noir: Radio Private Eye","description":"Famous radio private eye Guy Noir leaps from A Prairie Home Companion to the page On the 12th floor of the Acme Building, on a cold February day in St. Paul, Guy Noir looks down the barrel of a loaded revolver in the hands of geezer gangster Joey Roast Beef who is demanding to hear what lucrative scheme Guy is cooking up with stripper-turned-women's-studies-professor Naomi Fallopian.

Drawing on the emerging psychological literature in this area, as well as evidence from authors' research with musicians, this text outlines innovative ideas on what defines improvisation and the psychological, creative and social processes involved. It explores the role of specialist skills, the importance of musical identities and the nature of understanding in improvised interaction and between improvisers. It discusses how we develop as improvisers and the role of improvisation within therapeutic applications of music. Each chapter proceeds from discussion of an illustrative instance of musical improvisation. Providing fresh and provocative insights for anyone interested in playing, studying, teaching or listening to improvised music, the authors offer suggestions for approaching this practice in new ways at any level, and identify potential developments in cross-disciplinary improvising. Asserting that everyone can and should improvise, the book provides a resource for courses teaching improvisation in contemporary practice, and has strong relevance for those applying musical improvisation in community and therapeutic contexts. The book deals with such questions as: What constitutes improvisation? Do all forms of improvisation represent the same thing? Faced with myriad possibilities, how do improvisers decide what to play? How does an improviser in a group know what the others will do? How might improvisation influence our wellbeing? In response to such questions, a definition of improvisation based on its unique behavioural features is set out as an exciting context for psychological investigation\\"--","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=-QbcDwAAQBAJ&dq=IMPROVISATION+FOR+THE+CONTEMPORARY+MUSICIAN+(Text)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Japan Examined: Perspectives on Modern Japanese History","description":"\\"This book deserves admiration.

The narrative-hermeneutical paradigm which Gerkin offers holds and works with many of the complexities of pastoral care in postmodern times.\\"--Carrie Doehring, School of Theology, Boston University \\"Gerkin's Introduction to Pastoral Care breaks new ground for an introductory text in its emphasis on care as 'the central metaphor of life in the Christian community.'

December 1941. The inhabitants of Niihau lead a simple life. Mostly Hawaiian natives, they work the ranch of Niihau's eccentric haole owner, who keeps his island totally isolated from the outside world, devoid of cars, phones, and electricity. But then a plane crash-lands there, and although the villagers rescue the pilot, they have no idea that he has just attacked Pearl Harbor. War has now come to Eden, slowly undoing its tranquillity, widening the cracks in the already troubled marriage of Irene and Yoshio Harada, the island's only Japanese-American couple. It will test everyone's loyalties and all they believe in . . . as Paradise, once within reach, slowly falls victim to its own isolated innocence.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=esIe-dC0CE8C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"An economic interpretation of the Constitution of the United States","description":"In his piercing introduction to An Economic Interpretation the author wrote that 'whoever leaves economic pressures out of history or out of discussion of public questions is in mortal peril of substituting mythology for reality.' It was Beard's view that the founding fathers, especially Madison, Jay, and Hamilton, never made such a miscalculation. Indeed, these statesmen placed themselves among the great practitioners of all ages and gave instructions to succeeding generations in the art of government by their vigorous deployment of classical political economy.In this new printing of a major classic in American historiography, Louis Filler provides a sense of the person behind the book, the background that enabled Beard to move well beyond the shibboleths of the second decade of the twentieth century. While the controversies over Beard's book have quieted, the issues which it raised have hardly abated. Indeed, one can say that just about every major work in the politics and economics of the American nation must contend with Beard's classic work. Beard's work rests on an examination of primary documents: land and slave owners, geographic distribution of money, ownership of public securities, the specific condition of those who were disenfranchised as well as those who were in charge of the nascent American economy.The great merit of Beard's work is that despite its incendiary potential, he himself viewed An Economic Interpretation in coldly analytical terms, seeing such a position as giving comfort to neither revolutionaries nor reactionaries. Attacked by Marxists for being too mechanical, and by conservatives as being blind to the moral purposes of the framers of the constitution, the work continues to exercise a tremendous influence on all concerned. The fact that Beard wrote with a scalpel-like precision that gripped the attention of those in power no less than the common man is, it should be added, no small element in the enduring forces of this work.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=8Ks0DwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Teach Yourself Beginner's Italian Pb","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=fP5WAAAAMAAJ&dq=Teach+Yourself+Beginner%27s+Italian+Pb&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Hugh Wynne Free Quaker","description":"\\"Hugh Wynne, Free Quaker\\" by S.

According to most observers, the main Contra army, or the Fuerza Democr tica Nicarag ense (FDN), was a mercenary force hired by the CIA to oppose the Sandinista socialist revolution. The Real Contra War demonstrates that in reality the vast majority of the FDN s combatants were peasants who had the full support of a mass popular movement consisting of the tough, independent inhabitants of Nicaragua s central highlands. The movement was merely the most recent instance of this peasantry s one-thousand-year history of resistance to those they saw as would-be conquerors. The real Contra War struck root in 1979, even before the Sandinistas took power and, during the next two years, grew swiftly as a reaction both to revolutionary expropriations of small farms and to the physical abuse of all who resisted. Only in 1982 did an offer of American arms persuade these highlanders to forge an alliance with former Guardia anti-Sandinista exiles--those the outside world called Contras. Relying on original documents, interviews with veterans, and other primary sources, Brown contradicts conventional wisdom about the Contras, debunking most of what has been written about the movement s leaders, origins, aims, and foreign support.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=_8b60uPMyFwC&dq=The+Real+Contra+War:+Highlander+Peasant+Resistance+in+Nicaragua&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Diabetic Sweet Treats","description":"Offers a variety of dessert recipes for diabetics, including drinks, ice cream and frozen treats, puddings, cream puffs, and cakes and ice box pies","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=4dcOAAAACAAJ&dq=Diabetic+Sweet+Treats&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Moshe Dayan (Great Commanders S.)","description":"Martin van Creveld's Moshe Dayan tells the story of one man and of one people, to whom he was a figurehead - a symbol of their patriotism and their determination to survive. Born in a kibbutz in 1915, Dayan joined the Hagana when he was just fourteen, thus starting early a military career that saw him serve in every war fought in the Middle East from the War of Israeli Independence in 1948 to the Yom Kippur War of 1973. Twice he led his country's forces into smashing victories. Having planned and executed the one and directed the other, with his one eye he towers over them like Nelson over the Battle of Trafalgar. Skilled in battle, skilled in diplomacy, like many powerful public figures, Moshe Dayan's private life was far from mundane. The book quotes from little-known sources, including an account written by one of his mistresses, that reveal much about his character and his life away from the battlefield. This is an honest portrayal of both the private and the public figure, which seeks to understand a man whose contribution to the state of Israel in its developing years was immeasurable.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=MOyVBgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Spiritual Capital: Wealth We Can Live by","description":"In their new book Danah Zohar and Ian Marshall envisage two scenarios. The first is business as we know it today - all short-term interest, short-term gain, isolationist thinking, with the material bottom line as king. The second envisages a business culture driven by fundamental values and a deep sense of purpose in which wealth is accumulated to generate a decent profit while acting to raise the common good. The emphasis is on 'stake-holder value', where stake-holders include the human race, present and future, and the planet itself. These are the values of Spiritual Capital. The crucial question, which Zohar and Marshall address, is: How we can move from one scenario to the other? They show how we need to consider three types of capital to make the leap. Rational Intelligence (IQ) and Emotional Intelligence (EQ) are needed to diagnose the current state, and then the twelve qualities of Spiritual Intelligence (SQ) can be used to bring about the final transformation. The ultimate goal is sustainable capitalism within a framework of a more meaningful working life.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=_AwtZtmFgFoC&dq=Spiritual+Capital:+Wealth+We+Can+Live+by&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Psychology of Poker","description":"Poker demands many skills and strategies.

Wells and fictional characters like Henrietta Stackpole, the lady-correspondent in Henry James's Portrait of a Lady. It chronicles the exploits of a neglected group of American women writers and uncovers an alternative reporter-novelist tradition that runs counter to the more familiar story of gritty realism generated in male-dominated newsrooms. Taking up actual newspaper accounts written by women, fictional portrayals of female journalists, and the work of reporters-turned-novelists such as Willa Cather and Djuna Barnes, Jean Marie Lutes finds in women's journalism a rich and complex source for modern American fiction. Female journalists, cast as both standard-bearers and scapegoats of an emergent mass culture, created fictions of themselves that far outlasted the fleeting news value of the stories they covered. Front-Page Girls revives the spectacular stories of now-forgotten newspaperwomen who were not afraid of becoming the news themselves the defiant few who wrote for the city desks of mainstream newspapers and resisted the growing demand to fill women's columns with fashion news and household hints. It also examines, for the first time, how women's journalism shaped the path from news to novels for women writers.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=nlhuDwAAQBAJ&dq=Front-Page+Girls:+Women+Journalists+in+American+Culture+and+Fiction,+1880-1930&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The art of attack in chess (Pergamon international library of science, technology, engineering, and social studies)","description":"Includes Part 1, Number 2: Books and Pamphlets, Including Serials and Contributions to Periodicals July - December)","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=dyIhAQAAIAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Watunna: An Orinoco Creation Cycle","description":"Originally published in Spanish in 1970, Watunna is the epic history and creation stories of the Makiritare, or Yekuana, people living along the northern bank of the Upper Orinoco River of Venezuela, a region of mountains and virgin forest virtually unexplored even to the present.

The fallout from the Blair scandal rocked the Times to its core and revealed fault lines in a fractious newsroom that was already close to open revolt. Staffers were furiousabout the perception that management had given Blair more leeway because he was black, about the special treatment of favored correspondents, and most of all about the shoddy reporting that was infecting the most revered newspaper in the world. Within a month, Howell Raines, the imperious executive editor who had taken office less than a week before the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001and helped lead the paper to a record six Pulitzer Prizes for its coverage of the attackshad been forced out of his job. Having gained unprecedented access to the reporters who conducted the Times s internal investigation, top newsroom executives, and dozens of Times editors, former Newsweek senior writer Seth Mnookin lets us read all about itthe story behind the biggest journalistic scam of our era and the profound implications of the scandal for the rapidly changing world of American journalism.

Even as he staggered back into Camp 4 the next morning, Beck's condition was such that the other survivors assumed he would not make it back down the mountain. He was effectively left for dead, but drawing upon reserves of determination and courage he didn't know he had - as well as the extraordinary selflessness and bravery of a Nepalese helicopter pilot he'd never met - he finally made it to safety. Only then could a new battle begin: to rebuild his life with a family he'd taken for granted for too long.

Some researchers spend years on detailed statistical analyses of minute parts of the game, while others wax poetic about its players and plays. Many trace the beginnings of the civil rights movement in part to the Major Leagues  decision to integrate, and the words and phrases of the game (for example, pinch-hitter and out in left field) have become common in our everyday language. From AARON, HENRY onward, this book covers all of what might be called the cultural aspects of baseball (as opposed to the number-rich statistical information so widely available elsewhere). Biographical sketches of all Hall of Fame players, owners, executives and umpires, as well as many of the sportswriters and broadcasters who have won the Spink and Frick awards, join entries for teams, owners, commissioners and league presidents. Advertising, agents, drafts, illegal substances, minor leagues, oldest players, perfect games, retired uniform numbers, superstitions, tripleheaders, and youngest players are among the thousands of entries herein. Most entries open with a topical quote and conclude with a brief bibliography of sources for further research. The whole work is exhaustively indexed and includes 119 photographs.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=iI0-CgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Clarke's Commentary","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=L6Z1zQEACAAJ&dq=Clarke%27s+Commentary&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Manual Gearbox Design","description":"A must-have book for anyone designing manual gearboxes, based on 40 years of industrial experience.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=36SpQgAACAAJ&dq=Manual+Gearbox+Design&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Soldier Dead : How We Recover, Identify, Bury, and Honor Our Military Fallen","description":"What happens to members of the United States Armed Forces after they die?

Soldier Dead is the first book to fully address the complicated physical, social, religious, economic, and political issues concerning the remains of men and women who die while serving their country. Michael Sledge traces the changes in the handling of our Soldier Dead over time and their reflection of advances in technology and the shifting attitudes of the public, government, and military. He also considers the emotional stress experienced by those who handle the dead; the continuing efforts to retrieve bodies from Korea and elsewhere; and how unresolved issues regarding the treatment of enemy dead continue to affect U.S. foreign relations.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=2oa-AwAAQBAJ&dq=Soldier+Dead+:+How+We+Recover,+Identify,+Bury,+and+Honor+Our+Military+Fallen&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Opera Anecdotes.","description":"Building on the long-established success of Ethan Mordden's Opera Anecdotes, The New Book Of Opera Anecdotes continues where the original left off, bringing into view the new corps of major singers that arose after the first book's publication in 1985 -- artists such as Renee Fleming, Roberto Alagna, Deborah Voigt, Jonas Kaufmann, Kathleen Battle, and Jane Eaglen (who tested her family with Turandot's three riddles and got a very original answer). There are also fresh adventures with opera's fabled great -- Rossini, Wagner, Toscanini (whose temper tantrums are always good for a story), Franco Corelli, Luciano Pavarotti, Leontyne Price (who, when the Met's Rudolf Bing offered her the voice-killing role of Abigaille in Verdi's Nabucco, said, \\"Man, are you crazy?\\"). Almost all the stories in The New Book Of Opera Anecdotes are completely new, whether from the present or the past, taking in many historical developments, from the rise of the conductor to the appearance of the gymmed-up \\"bari-hunk\\" who refuses to play any role in which he can't appear shirtless. While most of Mordden's anecdotes are humorous, some are emotionally touching, such as one recounting a Met production of Mozart's The Marriage Of Figaro in which Renee Fleming sang alongside her own six-year-old daughter. Other tales are suspenseful, as when Tito Gobbi shows off his ability to make anyone turn around simply by staring at his or her back. He tries it on Nazi monster Joseph Goebbels, who does turn around, and then starts to move toward Gobbi, seething with rage, step by step... Mordden recounts these stories in his own unique voice, amplifying events for reading pleasure and adding in background material so the opera newcomer can play on the same field as the aficionado. Witty, dramatoic, and at times a little shocking, The New Book Of Opera Anecdotes will be a welcome addition to any opera fan's library.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=_Y7UDwAAQBAJ&dq=Opera+Anecdotes.&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Martin McMillan and the Lost Inca City","description":"Martin takes his skateboard when his parents drag him off to an archaeological dig in Peru.

In the late 1970s when the government mandated we get the fat out of our food, the food industry responded by pouring more sugar in. The result has been a perfect storm, disastrously altering our biochemistry and driving our eating habits out of our control. To help us lose weight and recover our health, Lustig presents personal strategies to readjust the key hormones that regulate hunger, reward, and stress; and societal strategies to improve the health of the next generation. Compelling, controversial, and completely based in science, Fat Chance debunks the widely held notion to prove  a calorie is NOT a calorie , and takes that science to its logical conclusion to improve health worldwide.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=xyCyIYEXaoQC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"X-Calibre (X-Men: The Age of Apocalypse Gold Deluxe Edition) (Excalibur)","description":"Een man lijkt ten onrechte veroordeeld te zijn voor de moord op zijn grootmoeder.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=tYOpPAAACAAJ&dq=X-Calibre+(X-Men:+The+Age+of+Apocalypse+Gold+Deluxe+Edition)+(Excalibur)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Love Roma 2","description":"When Hoshino meets Negishi for the first time, he asks her out on a date.

They moved to Warsaw, Poland, and were married. Once there, they planned to move to a safer country, farther away from the Nazi threat. But when their daughter, Micki, was born in 1937, financial constraints forced them to delay those plans. On September 1, 1939, they were awakened at dawn by the rumble of German aircraft. The war had begun, and David was angry with himself for not having already emigrated to a safer country. He vowed he would never again allow his inaction to endanger his loved ones. With dogged determination, help from the people he befriended along the way and luck, he guided his wife and two-year-old daughter through the siege of Warsaw, their separation and hiding on the Aryan side of the city, his application for emigration at the Hotel Polski and their two years of internment in Bergen-Belsen.

Borrowed Finery, her first book in nearly a decade, is an astonishing memoir of her highly unusual beginnings. Born in the twenties to nomadic, bohemian parents, Fox is left at birth in a Manhattan orphanage, then cared for by a poor yet cultivated minister in upstate New York. Her parents, however, soon resurface. Her handsome father is a hard-drinking screenwriter who is, for young Paula, \\"part ally, part betrayer.\\" Her mother is given to icy bursts of temper that punctuate a deep indifference. How, Fox wonder, is this woman \\"enough of an organic being to have carried me in her belly\\"? Never sharing more than a few moments with his daughter, Fox's father allows her to be shunted from New York City, where she lives with her passive Spanish grandmother, to Cuba, where she roams freely on a relative's sugar-cane plantation, to California, where she finds herself cast upon Hollywood's grubby margins. The thread binding these wanderings is the \\"borrowed finery\\" of the title-a few pieces of clothing, almost always lent by kind-hearted strangers, that offer Fox a rare glimpse of permanency. Vivid and poetic, Borrowed Finery is an unforgettable book which will swell the legions of Paula Fox's devoted admiriers.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=8acDAAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Hispanisms (Hispanic) and Homosexualities (13 Essays)","description":"A collection of essays addressing gay/lesbian identities and practices in relation to Spanish/Latin American literatures and cultures.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=u-JxDFNSM2YC&dq=Hispanisms+(Hispanic)+and+Homosexualities+(13+Essays)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"THE SHADOW OVER INNSMOUTH","description":"??

Exact facsimile of the original edition, not reproduced with Optical Recognition Software. \\"Epistemological Problems\\" is a milestone in Ludwig von Mises' groundbreaking development of praxeology. This important work contains foundational thoughts on his theory of human action, or \\"logic of action,\\" which forms the \\"distinctive methodology of the Austrian School... Mises was not only the major architect and elaborator of this methodology, but also the economist who most fully and successfully applied it to the construction of economic theory\\" (Rothbard). Mises headed the Austrian School, which \\"celebrates freedom and the individual, rather than determinism and the collective... and explicitly rejects the idea that the natural sciences provide the proper model for economic analysis\\" (Shenoy et al., Towards a Theoretical Framework, 19, 19n). In establishing the school's epistemological foundations, Mises first began working on the subject in a series of articles published in the 1920s. He \\"collected and published them in his seminal philosophical and methodological work, \\"Grundprobleme der Nationalokonimie\\" in 1933,\\" which was not translated into English until this edition. Here Mises presents \\"economics from the point of view of the philosophy of science, and the actual economic analysis of value and inconvertible capital.\\" The first chapter of the book, \\"The Task and Scope of the Science of Human Action,\\" evolved as the core of the system \\"Mises had been working on for years... He argued that economic laws were true a priori, on a par with the laws of logic and mathematics... [This] remained one of his most controversial tenets,\\" in that it frames economic theory as addressing \\"acts of the real world, such as the one that human beings make choices. But the facts of this sort cannot be observed... Economics is not an empirical science in this sense, but it is a science nevertheless.\\" To Mises \\"the epistemology of economics was not just an idle pastime for ivory tower intellectuals. It was of direct practical relevance.\\" \\"Epistemological Problems\\" remains fundamental in establishing the \\"significance of economic calculation for the architecture of economic science.\\" It is his most powerful and comprehensive elaboration of the span of economic science, arguing that errors of socialism, institutional racism, nationalism and other aspects of human society can be seen as a revolt against the distinctive rationality of economic logic and science. A work that \\"has lost nothing of its importance... Epistemological Problems contains a considerable amount of discussion that cannot be found in any other of his writings... in particular his critical discussion of the works of those thinkers to whom he felt the greatest intellectual affinity and intellectual debt: Carl Menger, Eugen von Bohm-Bawerk and Max Weber\\" (Hulsmann, Introduction, 2002 edition, 670-671, 948, xxix, lv).","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=3P0SrgEACAAJ&dq=Epistemological+Problems+of+Economics&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Teach Yourself German Vocabulary (Teach Yourself Books)","description":"Is this the right course for me?

It helps cities become places of solidarity where the relations between the individual, the group, outsiders to the city and the planet are in better alignment. Following the widespread success of The Creative City, this new book, aided by international case studies, explains how to reassess urban potential so that cities can strengthen their identity and adapt to the changing global terms of trade and mass migration. It explores the deeper fault-lines, paradoxes and strategic dilemmas that make creating the 'good city' so difficult.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=o0TUa_x-UP8C&dq=The+Art+of+City+Making&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"9 Innings With Cal Ripken Jr.","description":"Profiles the personal life and professional career of the star center for the New York Rangers who has earned the reputation of being the greatest hockey player ever.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=ALve74rVou0C&dq=9+Innings+With+Cal+Ripken+Jr.&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Half a dozen mock trials,","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=yU9zNwAACAAJ&dq=Half+a+dozen+mock+trials,&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Knight and the Squire","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=QrbeXwAACAAJ&dq=Knight+and+the+Squire&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Contemporary issues in bioethics","description":"This anthology represents all major points of view on the central topics in bioethics.

Identity processes encompass biographical experiences, historical eras and cultural norms in which the self's autonomy varies according to the flux of power relationships with others. Identity Structure Analysis (ISA) draws upon psychological, sociological and social anthropological theory and evidence to formulate a system of concepts that help explain the notion of identity. They can be applied to the practical investigations of identity structure and identity development in a number of clinical, societal and cultural settings. This book includes topics on national and ethnic identification in multicultural contexts and gender identity relating to social context and the urban environment. Clinical applications that describe identity processes associated with psychological distress are also examined. These include anorexia nervosa and vicarious traumatisation of counsellors in the aftermath of atrocity. Analysing Identity is unique in its development of this integrative conceptualisation of self and identity, and its operationalisation in practice. This innovative book will appeal to academics and professionals in developmental, social, cross-cultural, clinical and educational psychology and psychotherapy. It will also be of interest to those involved with sociology, political science, gender studies, ethnic studies and social policy. Of particular note is the availability of new software, Ipseus, which facilitates ISA for use by practitioners. It enables them to enhance their professional skills by ascertaining their clients  perspectives on self as located in the social world. This has been successfully used with pre-school three to five year-old children, and all other age-ranges through childhood, adolescence and adulthood. Ipseus is designed to be used in inter-cultural contexts and appeals to practitioners for their input for the generation of customized identity instruments (see www.identityexploration.com).","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=EmUZ_AV8Z5wC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Transitive Vampire: a Handbook of Grammar for the Innocent, the Eager, and the Doomed","description":"This guide to the rules of grammar presents amusing instructional sentences to demonstrate correct usage and is illustrated with old engravings","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=5dg2cCvnDoUC&dq=The+Transitive+Vampire:+a+Handbook+of+Grammar+for+the+Innocent,+the+Eager,+and+the+Doomed&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Let It Snow!

The Fallon Legacy is the tale of a father and son who have never met but who share a destiny and drive born of their blood, with one struggling to hold our nation together and the other to expand it. Well past his prime, Robert Fallon now fights the battles of politics to save the country he cherishes from civil war. It is 1832, and the high tariffs that protect northern industry are crippling the South. President Andrew Jackson thinks force is the answer to the South's threats of secession. Robert must pay a final-hour visit to Washington, as an appeal to Jackson and Congress to pass a compromise tariff before the country is torn apart. Like his father and grandfather before him, James Fallon is a man of vision and iron will, determined to succeed. But where his forebears were men of the sea, he is a man of the land, the vast land of northern Mexico--a land called Texas. James sets out for Stephen Austin's colony of Americans with dreams of a horse-breeding empire. The land is harsh enough, but he soon learns that Fallon past harbors deadly shadows--Cordelia Applegate and Gerard Fourrier. With political influence, hired pistoleros, and Comanches, they seek to destroy all Fallons. But James has more pressing troubles. He and the other settlers, including Jim Bowie, Austin, and Sam Houston, are outraged as their rights of property come and go with the shifting winds of Mexican politics. Rumors of Santa Anna's rise to power in Mexico City have driven the Americans to prepare to fight for the land that has absorbed their sweat and blood. Santa Anna will soon be on the march to drive the yanquis out of Mexico, and events are moving swiftly toward the conflagration that will give birth to the Republic of Texas.

Tom Brokaw writes about growing up and coming of age in the heartland, and of the family, the people, the culture and the values that shaped him then and still do today. His father, Red Brokaw, a genius with machines, followed the instincts of Tom s mother Jean, and took the risk of moving his small family from an Army base to Pickstown, South Dakota, where Red got a job as a heavy equipment operator in the Army Corps of Engineers  project building the Ft. Randall dam along the Missouri River. Tom Brokaw describes how this move became the pivotal decision in their lives, as the Brokaw family, along with others after World War II, began to live out the American Dream: community, relative prosperity, middle class pleasures and good educations for their children.  Along the river and in the surrounding hills, I had a Tom Sawyer boyhood,  Brokaw writes; and as he describes his own pilgrimage as it unfolded from childhood to love, marriage, the early days in broadcast journalism, and beyond he also reflects on what brought him and so many Americans of his generation to lead lives a long way from home, yet forever affected by it.

It is the mid-1960s, and in Czechoslovakia communist ideology is fading. One disillusioned, middle-aged journalist retreats from the politics of Prague to the Moravian countryside of his childhood. There he rediscovers a complex relationship with his dead father, a crusader for communism in the early days, who reappears through letters written decades earlier. When the narrator is accused of disgracing his father and his proletariat background, he realizes that he, too, is a leader - but the stakes now are reversed.

What makes a teacher a mentor? From Teaching to Mentoring is an argument for the power, practicality and the basic good of a simple educational idea. The authors advocate a sound, comprehensive and lifelong education, shifting the emphasis of the learning process to the needs of the student. Whilst heeding traditional criteria of educational excellence, they ask for profound educational and political transformations: * Teachers become collaborative inquirers with their students * Students become skilled and lifelong independent learners * Academic institutions become learning communities embracing the full diversity of human curiosity and experience. The book covers discussion on what mentoring is, and why it is now so much in demand. It details the distinctive features of mentoring, including asking questions, students' reflections and responses and collaborative curriculum planning. Drawing upon two decades of extensive research and practice, and using a variety of illuminating case studies, the authors offer a stimulating and thorough examination of mentoring. This combination of theory and practice will be invaluable to anyone involved in the teaching of adults in further and higher education, as well as university administrators, programme directors and developing and training officers.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=93aBAgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Carnivorous plants and \\"the man-eating tree,\\" ([Field Museum of Natural History] Botany leaflet 23)","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=6nUVDPqqpn4C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Linear and Nonlinear Programming","description":"This new edition covers the central concepts of practical optimization techniques, with an emphasis on methods that are both state-of-the-art and popular. One major insight is the connection between the purely analytical character of an optimization problem and the behavior of algorithms used to solve a problem. This was a major theme of the first edition of this book and the fourth edition expands and further illustrates this relationship. As in the earlier editions, the material in this fourth edition is organized into three separate parts. Part I is a self-contained introduction to linear programming. The presentation in this part is fairly conventional, covering the main elements of the underlying theory of linear programming, many of the most effective numerical algorithms, and many of its important special applications. Part II, which is independent of Part I, covers the theory of unconstrained optimization, including both derivations of the appropriate optimality conditions and an introduction to basic algorithms. This part of the book explores the general properties of algorithms and defines various notions of convergence. Part III extends the concepts developed in the second part to constrained optimization problems. Except for a few isolated sections, this part is also independent of Part I. It is possible to go directly into Parts II and III omitting Part I, and, in fact, the book has been used in this way in many universities. New to this edition is a chapter devoted to Conic Linear Programming, a powerful generalization of Linear Programming. Indeed, many conic structures are possible and useful in a variety of applications. It must be recognized, however, that conic linear programming is an advanced topic, requiring special study. Another important topic is an accelerated steepest descent method that exhibits superior convergence properties, and for this reason, has become quite popular. The proof of the convergence property for both standard and accelerated steepest descent methods are presented in Chapter 8. As in previous editions, end-of-chapter exercises appear for all chapters. From the reviews of the Third Edition:  ... this very well-written book is a classic textbook in Optimization.

She amassed one of the most important collections of early 20th century European and American art embracing cubism, surrealism and expressionism. A 'poor little rich girl', (her father, Benjamin, went down with the Titanic in 1912), she was magnetically drawn to the avant-garde artistic community of Paris. She bought works by, and befriended, such artists as Picasso, Duchamp, Man Ray and Dali. In 1938 she opened her first gallery of modern art in London, followed by the 'Art of this Century' gallery in New York. Then, after a 4-year marriage to Max Ernst, she returned to Europe, setting up her collection in Venice where she lived until her death in 1979. This is the fascinating autobiography of a society heiress who became the bohemian doyenne of the art world.

For many on the left, the Chinese economy seems to provide an alternative model of development to that of neoliberal globalization. Although it is a disputed question whether the Chinese economy can be still described as socialist, there is no doubting the importance for the global project of socialism of accurately interpreting and soberly assessing its real prospects. China and Socialism argues that market reforms in China are leading inexorably toward a capitalist and foreign-dominated development path, with enormous social and politcal costs, both domestically and internationally. The rapid economic growth that accompanied these market reforms have not been due to efficiency gains, but rather to deliberate erosion of the infrastructure that made possible a remarkable degree of equality. The transition to the market has been based on rising unemployment, intensified exploitation, declining health and education services, exploding government debt, and unstable prices. At the same time, China's economic transformation has intensified the contradictions of capitalist development in other countries, especially in East Asia. Far from being a model that is replicable in other Third World countries, China today is a reminder of the need for socialism to be built from the grassroots up, through class struggle and international solidarity.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=g0O5AAAAIAAJ&dq=China+and+Socialism:+Market+Reforms+and+Class+Struggle&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"El cdigo del samuray","description":"El Bushido es el c digo de los principios morales ense?ados a los caballeros en el Jap n antiguo.

It was this battle that defined the United States as a military power to be reckoned with and an independent democracy here to stay. A happenstance coalition of militiamen, regulars, untrained frontiersmen, free blacks, pirates, Indians and townspeople - marching to 'Yankee Doodle' and 'La Marseillaise' - inhabit The Battle of New Orleans in a rich array of colourful scenes. Swashbuckling Jean Lafitte and his privateers. The proud, reckless British General Pakenham and his miserable men ferried across a Louisiana lake in a Gulf storm. The agile Choctaw and Tennessee 'dirty shirt' sharpshooters who made a sport of picking off redcoat sentries by night. And Jackson himself - tall, gaunt, shrewd, by turns gentle and furious, declaring 'I will smash them, so help me God!' Robert Remini's vivid evocation of this glorious, improbable victory is more than a masterful military history. It proves that only after the Battle of new Orleans could Americans say with confidence that they were Americans, not subjects of a foreign power. It was the triumph that catapulted a once-poor, uneducated orphan boy into the White House and forged a collection of ex-colonies and dissenters into a nation.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=eH9GBAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Best Christmas pageant ever","description":"This year s pageant is definitely like no other, but maybe that s exactly what makes it so special.

He introduces philosophy as a repeating series of (failed) attempts to answer the same questions: Can we prove that there is an external world? Can we prove cause and effect? Can we validate any of our generalizations? Can we objectively justify morality? He asserts that philosophy cannot answer any of these questions and that any value of philosophy must lie elsewhere than in offering proofs to these questions. Wittgenstein suggested further that these questions are empty and the value of philosophy is as an assistant to science.Focusing on problems he believes will provoke positive and constructive discussion, Russell concentrates on knowledge rather than metaphysics: If it is uncertain that external objects exist, how can we then have knowledge of them but by probability. There is no reason to doubt the existence of external objects simply because of sense data._x000D_ _x000D_ _x000D_","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=ogpzEAAAQBAJ&dq=The+Problems+of+Philosophy&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Cancel the Meetings, Keep the Doughnuts: And Other New Morsels of Business Wisdom","description":"A collection of simple rules-of-thumb offers humorous insight into job security, business travel, meetings, balancing work and home life, and other aspects of corporate life","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=Jv8OopYxB3wC&dq=Cancel+the+Meetings,+Keep+the+Doughnuts:+And+Other+New+Morsels+of+Business+Wisdom&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Treasury of Great Mysteries VOL 2","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=4A4HzQEACAAJ&dq=A+Treasury+of+Great+Mysteries+VOL+2&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Cube: Keep the Secret","description":"Spread the word...but keep the secret!

Key questions are addressed. What is meant by Islamisation? How far was the spread of Islam as a religion bound up with the spread of Muslim culture? To what extent are Islamisation and conversion parallel processes? How is Islamisation connected to Arabisation? What role do vernacular Muslim languages play in the promotion of Muslim culture? The broad, comparative perspective allows readers to develop a thorough understanding of the process of Islamisation over eleven centuries of its history.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=VjZYDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Dawn of Art: The Chauvet Cave (The Oldest Known Paintings in the World)","description":"In December 1994, in the Ardeche Valley of southeast France, three explorers chanced upon the hidden entrance to an underground cavern. Digging away the rubble, they made their way through a narrow passage into a vast cave, and there made one of the most thrilling discoveries of modern times: The Chauvet cave, named for one of the discoverers, which had been untouched for thousands of years. It was filled with Stone Age cave bear skeletons and footprints, the blackened remains of fires, and, most importantly, walls covered with more than three hundred extraordinary paintings and engravings of animals. These staggering images proved to be doubly remarkable, for not only have radiocarbon tests established them to be over 30,000 years old - the oldest known paintings in the world, nearly twice as old as those found at Lascaux - but they are powerful, sophisticated works of art rather than crude sketches. Dawn of Art is the first book in English on the images that have, as the French Ministry of Culture declared, \\"overturned the accepted notion about the first appearance of art and its development.\\" The remarkable photographs in Dawn of Art show each wall in clear detail, revealing the incredible mastery of the prehistoric artists. Astonishingly, while most cave art is of creatures such as horses, aurochs, and bison, over half of these images depict such dangerous animals as cave bears, hyenas, lions, mammoths, and rhinoceroses. The paintings are particularly impressive in terms of the techniques used to present perspective and motion. Many figures interact with each other; some are staggered, to give perspective; others are drawn on bulges in the cave wall to further suggest depth.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=xLbpAAAAMAAJ&dq=Dawn+of+Art:+The+Chauvet+Cave+(The+Oldest+Known+Paintings+in+the+World)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Four Scottish Journeys: An Identity Rediscovered","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=1v1gGwAACAAJ&dq=Four+Scottish+Journeys:+An+Identity+Rediscovered&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Twilight of Empire (Eckert, Allan W.

The story of how these forces evolved over time encompasses almost every aspect of American history. Always cognizant of change over time, this book explores the ways that urban development influenced people's lives and on the ways people shaped the urban environment. A city is simultaneously a social, economic, and political entity, and Howard P. Chudacoff and Judith E. Smith have taken care to examine each of these dimensions of urban life. Their focus is on urban society: its institutions, its activities, and, especially, its people. In this, the Sixth Edition, Chudacoff and Smith pay particular attention to issues of race, ethnicity, gender, the built environment, regional differentials, and emerging cultural forms such as rock and rap music. New material has been added on the environmental impact of cities and suburbs and on the new racial and ethnic mix produced by the most recent immigration trends. In addition, the final chapter has been expanded to take into account issues relating to the presidential administration of George W. Bush and to the consequences of the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001.

Tegen de achtergrond van de Europese hoofdsteden en bloedige slagvelden, dure skiresorts en donkere gevangenissen, beschrijft Timothy Snyder de periode in de Europese geschiedenis waarin de oude orde plaatsmaakte voor een onzekere situatie waarin alles, inclusief de diffuse Europese identiteit zelf, voor het grijpen leek te liggen. Wilhelm groeide op als jongste telg in het Habsburgse geslacht. Hij verstootte zijn familie om te vechten aan de kant van de Oekra?ense boeren in de hoop dat hij hun koning zou worden. Maar Oekra?ne werd ingenomen door de bolsjewieken, en Wilhelm vluchtte eerst naar Parijs, waar hij een wild leven leidde, en later naar Wenen, waar hij tijdens de Tweede Wereldoorlog spioneerde voor het Franse en het Amerikaanse leger. In 1947 werd hij door de Russen gevangengenomen en doodgemarteld.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=zFwvAgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Collected Sandman Covers, 1989-1997","description":"\\"An amazing collection of dark and arresting imagery, THE SANDMAN DUST COVERS: THE COLLECTED SANDMAN COVERS presents the haunting artwork of this critically acclaimed and award-winning epic.

This work moves gender analysis towards a fuller understanding of men's diverse gendered identities, and how these are implicated in their everyday working lives in developing country contexts. The questions addressed in the papers range from conceptual and methodological issues of definitions and measurement of men's work, to case studies of working men in specific settings, but all are concerned with the recognition of gendered vulnerabilities of (some) men as men, as well as with a re-thinking of gender relations in the light of consideration of the subjectivities of specific groups of men.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=UR64AQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Marky and the Seagull","description":"Marky and his family go to visit his grandparents at the beach.

The West combines myth and history, rugged natural scenery and wide open spaces, popular culture and promises of transformation. These imagined places draw in tourists, attracted by a cultural heritage that is part fictional and mediatised. In turn, tourism operators and destination marketing organisations refashion what they present to fit these imagined images. This book explores this imagining of a mythic West through three key themes, travel, film and frontiers to offer new insight into how the imagination of the West and popular culture has influenced the construction of tourism. In doing so, it examines the series of paradoxes that underlie the basic appeal of the West: evocative frontier, a boundary zone between civilisation and wilderness and between order and lawlessness. It draws on a range of films and literature as well as varying places from festivals to national parks to showcase different aspects of the nexus between travel, film and frontiers in this fascinating region. Interdisciplinary in character, it includes perspectives from cultural studies, American studies, tourism and film studies. Written by leading academics, this title will be valuable reading for students, researchers and academics in the fields of cultural studies, tourism, film studies and media studies and all those interested in film tourism.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=DVjLCQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Guided Reading Books for the Emergent Reader: Reproducible, Take-Home Books","description":"Contains twenty-one reproducible stories for use in guided reading programs, presented in a format that allows the instructor or volunteer to assemble the story into book form with only one cut and two staples.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=kowNAAAACAAJ&dq=Guided+Reading+Books+for+the+Emergent+Reader:+Reproducible,+Take-Home+Books&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Encyclopedia of Jewish Humor: From Biblical Times to the Modern Age","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=52ryzgEACAAJ&dq=Encyclopedia+of+Jewish+Humor:+From+Biblical+Times+to+the+Modern+Age&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Human Behavior and the Social Environment: Shifting Paradigms in Essential Knowledge for Social Work Practice (3rd Edition)","description":"While social work policy can be considered the what, and practice, the how, the study of human behavior is concerned with why. Why do people do the things they do? Why do individuals behave differently in groups than when alone? Why do some people become the victims of their lives while others who have endured tragedy become life's heroes? Resilience across the life span is a new major theme of the second edition of the bestselling Human Behavior and the Social Environment, Micro Level. In an elegant and accessible manner, Katherine van Wormer explores the nuances of the biological, psychological, cultural, and spiritual dimensions of our social lives from an ecosystems and empowerment-based perspective. Drawing on examples from social work, psychology, literature, philosophy, and current events, vignettes highlight the turning points in our lives and invite students to explore the contradictions between how we mean to be and how others view us. The result is an essential book that bridges theory and practice, providing extraordinary insight into our drives and motivations, and revealing the myriad patterns and paradoxes of our behavior in the social context. * Integrates new research findings and recent census and global health data * Revised with augmented discussions of multiculturalism, Latino/Latina identity issues, and late adulthood to reflect demographic changes in the United States * Outlines theoretical concepts and practice implications in each chapter * Places unique emphasis on biology's influence on human behavior, employing the latest empirical data in discussions of matters such as gender differences, genetics, and mental disorders * Focuses on evidence-based theory and research * Teaches from a global, cross-cultural, perspective, highlighting themes of empowerment and social justice * Features dynamic readings, personal narratives, and photographs that highlight each chapter's topic * Accompanied by an online instructor's manual with lecture presentations, chapter summaries, key terms, suggested classroom activities, and a test bank with essay and multiple choice questions at www.oup.com/us/HBSE/ Don't miss the companion volume, Human Behavior and the Social Environment, Macro Level, Second Edition written with Fred H.

Known as Israel?s ?master poet,? Amichai conveys a portrait of life in modern Israel, summarizing and reflecting all the major preoccupations of his generation. Unlike most of his Israeli contemporaries he explores the alteration of Jewish perspectives, the loss of religious orthodoxy and the nature of Jewish identity in the mid-20th century. He illuminates the dislocation of Jewish life after the Holocaust and the dilemma of response on the part of young Israelis. His poetic language is rich in figuration and laced with quotations from classical Jewish texts which he manipulates into ironic discourse with the problems of the present. Echoing the 17th-century metaphysical poets, Amichai?s writing reveals a tussle between physical love and spirituality; its tension lies in his failure to synthesize both in religious faith. Abramson presents a detailed critical description and thematic analysis of Amichai?s work, with reference to the historical background from which it has emerged. The problems of an emerging national culture are seen subjectively through the eyes of one of its most sensitive and perceptive literary observers.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=2iFpXg2qM60C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Earth Shelter Technology","description":"As early as the 1960s innovative builders were beginning to design and construct underground and earth-covered houses as part of the search for alternate lifestyles.

This first volume of The Selected Papers of Margaret Sanger documents the critical phases and influences of an American feminist icon and offers rare glimpses into her working-class childhood, burgeoning feminism, spiritual and scientific interests, sexual explorations, and diverse roles as wife, mother, nurse, journalist, radical socialist, and activist. These letters and other writings, including diaries, journals, articles, and speeches, most of which have never before been published, have been selected and assembled with an eye to telling the story of a remarkable life, punctuated by arrests and imprisonments, exile, love affairs, and a momentous personal loss--a life consumed with the quest for women's sexual liberation. Because its narrative line is so absorbing, volume 1 may be read as a powerful biography. Volume 1 covers a twenty-eight-year period from nurse's training and early socialist involvement in pre- World War I bohemian Greenwich Village to Sanger's adoption of birth control (a term she helped coin in 1914) as a fundamental tenet of women's rights. It traces the intersection of her life and work with other reformers, activists and leaders of modernity on both sides of the Atlantic, including Havelock Ellis, H.G. Wells, George Bernard Shaw, Emma Goldman, Max Eastman, and Eugene Debs, as well as many leading radical artists and writers of the day. It highlights her legislative and organizational efforts, her support of the eugenics movement, and the alliances she secured with medical professionals in her crusade to make birth control legal, respectable, and accessible. This volume also includes letters from women desperately in need of fertility control who saw Sanger as their last hope. Supplemented by an introduction, brief essays providing narrative and chronological links, and substantial notes, the volume is an invaluable tool for understanding Sanger's actions and accomplishments. The documents assembled here, more than 80 percent of them letters, were culled from the Margaret Sanger Papers Microfilm Edition, edited by Esther Katz, Cathy Moran Hajo, and Peter C. Engelman. Two subsequent volumes will address later periods in her life, and an additional volume will cover her international work in the birth control struggle.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=P0GTPwAACAAJ&dq=The+Selected+Papers+of+Margaret+Sanger,+Volume+1:+The+Woman+Rebel,+1900-1928&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The difference of man and the difference it makes (Meridian books)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=oW3AzIh9oawC&dq=The+difference+of+man+and+the+difference+it+makes+(Meridian+books)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Developing Solutions with Office 2000 Components and VBA","description":"Learn to customize Microsoft Office applications with this complete professional's guide to developing robust, custom solutions.

Bethlehem Hospital, or \`Bedlam' as it became in cockney slang, is the world's oldest psychiatric hospital. Founded in 1247 it developed from a ramshackle hovel to the magnificent \`Palace Beautiful', where visitors could pay to gawp at the chained inmates, through to the great Victorian hospital in Lambeth, now the Imperial War Museum. Catharine Arnold takes us on a tour of Bedlam and examines London's attitude to madness along the way. We travel through the ages, from the barbaric \`exorcisms' of the medieval period to the Tudor belief that a roast mouse, eaten whole, was the cure. We see the reforming zeal of eighteenth century campaigners and the development of the massive Victorian asylums. This was the era of the private madhouse, run by \`traders in lunacy' who asked no questions and locked up insane and sane alike at the behest of greedy relatives. But it was also the age of the determined reformers who eventually made their way into Bedlam and exposed conditions of terrible deprivation and brutality. \`A finely written, thoroughly researched and humane book, packed with moving stories' Independent \`Smoothly written, densely researched...When you close this rewardingly informative and tastefully conceived book, you will be the richer for it' Sunday Express","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=BFZ3IRUs8YsC&dq=BEDLAM&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Inner Guide Meditation","description":"Describes the transformational journey to enlightenment and awareness using the tarot, astrology, the Qabalah, the alchemy of transformation, and analytical psychology.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=CVtQdA1aiN0C&dq=Inner+Guide+Meditation&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Search for the Real and Other Essays","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=lkpftAEACAAJ&dq=Search+for+the+Real+and+Other+Essays&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Secret Life of Puppets","description":"In one of those rare books that allows us to see the world not as we've never seen it before, but as we see it daily without knowing, Victoria Nelson illuminates the deep but hidden attraction the supernatural still holds for a secular mainstream culture that forced the transcendental underground and firmly displaced wonder and awe with the forces of reason, materialism, and science. In a backward look at an era now drawing to a close, The Secret Life of Puppets describes a curious reversal in the roles of art and religion: where art and literature once took their content from religion, we came increasingly to seek religion, covertly, through art and entertainment. In a tour of Western culture that is at once exhilarating and alarming, Nelson shows us the distorted forms in which the spiritual resurfaced in high art but also, strikingly, in the mass culture of puppets, horror-fantasy literature, and cyborgs: from the works of Kleist, Poe, Musil, and Lovecraft to Philip K. Dick and virtual reality simulations. At the end of the millennium, discarding a convention of the demonized grotesque that endured three hundred years, a Demiurgic consciousness shaped in Late Antiquity is emerging anew to re-divinize the human as artists like Lars von Trier and Will Self reinvent Expressionism in forms familiar to our pre-Reformation ancestors. Here as never before, we see how pervasively but unwittingly, consuming art forms of the fantastic, we allow ourselves to believe.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=eAtP7N10Rh8C&dq=The+Secret+Life+of+Puppets&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Proto Indo European: The Archaeology of a Linguistic Problem : Studies in Honor of Marija Gimbutas","description":"A.

Twaalf jaar lang werkt hij op plantages in Louisiana, vaak onder de meest wrede omstandigheden, altijd in de hoop zijn vrijheid terug te winnen. In 1853 komt Northup eindelijk vrij.

It features five challenging plays by Irish writers, and one by an international author, interrogating and commenting on crucial events of Irish history and of the diaspora, with introductory essays by established academics. Together these plays represent the most innovative development in contemporary Irish theatre and illuminate the social and political realities of contemporary Ireland. The first two plays, of 2010 and 2013, deal with scandals of clerical and institutional abuse, and use as source material the Ryan Report of 2009, and the documents from the 2008 Irish Bank Guarantee. The next two, of 2014 and 2013, concern interpretations of the most iconic moment of Irish history: the Easter Rising. The first of these is based on published statements of participants in the event and the second on the lived experiences of those in the contemporary Republic whose founding ideals have not been realized . The last two plays, of 2015 and 2016, widen the view to the history of the Irish in the diaspora: one retelling the history of emigration to England based on published research material; and the other tracing Roger Casement's experiences in the Amazon and his subsequent participation in the Easter Rising using extracts from his diaries and other writings. The plays included and discussed are: No Escape by Mary Raftery Guaranteed by Colin Murphy Of This Brave Time by Jimmy Murphy History by Grace Dyas My English Tongue, My Irish Heart by Martin Lynch The Two Deaths of Roger Casement by Domingos Nunez","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=i97bDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"New Philanthropy Benchmarking: Wisdom for the Passionate","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=LmDuAAAAMAAJ&dq=New+Philanthropy+Benchmarking:+Wisdom+for+the+Passionate&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Sport of Nature","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=eTRiNwAACAAJ&dq=Sport+of+Nature&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"PORSCHE: BROCHURES AND SALES LITERATURE - A SOURCE BOOK 1948-1965","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=ncJiAAAACAAJ&dq=PORSCHE:+BROCHURES+AND+SALES+LITERATURE+-+A+SOURCE+BOOK+1948-1965&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Peter Raven: Under Fire (SIGNED)","description":"Peter Raven is a midshipman in the Royal Navy during the Napoleonic Wars and must help Commodore Beaumont, a spy, foil a French plot to take over the Americas.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=TXroA7y_-d8C&dq=Peter+Raven:+Under+Fire+(SIGNED)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Creative Problem Solving and Opportunity Finding (Decision Making and Operations Management)","description":"Educational research reveals that most people demonstrate a great deal of creativity at age 5.

As far as the sea he conquered this haughty land. Not a single castle remains standing in his path Charlemagne (768-814) was crowned Holy Roman Emperor in 800 and presided over a huge empire. He frequently appears in literature as a great warlord and pious crusading figure. In 778, the rearguard of Charlemagne's retreating army was ambushed and defeated at the battle of Roncevaux. This became the inspiration for songs and poems celebrating deeds of valour in the face of overwhelming odds, through the character of Charlemagne's nephew (the imaginary) Roland. The Song of Roland is the most stirring and moving epic poem of the European Middle Ages, offering a particularly heady mixture of history, legend, and poetry. Presented here in a lively and idiomatic new translation, the Song of Roland offers fascinating insights into medieval ideas about heroism, manhood, religion, race, and nationhood which were foundational for modern European culture. The Song of Roland is accompanied here by two other medieval French epics about Charlemagne, both of which show him to be a far more equivocal figure than that portrayed by the Roland: the Occitan Daurel and Beton, in which he is a corrupt and avaricious monarch; and the Journey of Charlemagne to Jerusalem and Constantinople, which gives the heroes of the Roland a comic makeover.

Blood on the Forge was first published in 1941, when it attracted the admiring attention of Richard Wright and Ralph Ellison.

While some focused on governing the Church and addressing challenges from the world, others recognized their primary responsibility to proclaim and teach the Gospel. Author Alan Schreck calls these the \\"teaching popes\\" and John Paul II was such a pope, leading the Church and impacting the world with his witness and his teaching. The encyclical letter has been, in modern times, the instrument for popes to express their most important teaching teachings that have lasting value for the Church, and often for the whole world. Dr. Schreck invites the reader to become familiar with the encyclical letters of Pope John Paul II. In The Legacy of Pope John Paul II, Dr. Schreck breaks down more scholarly writing into accessible language. The reflection questions and suggestions for further reading at the end of each chapter help facilitate a systematic study of the central teachings of this brilliant but pastoral pope, who conveyed the truth in love.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=gBJfE1Q8uiUC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Joy in the Morning (Enduring Faith Series, Book 6)","description":"Book 6 in The Enduring Faith Series.

Interestingly, while Japanese governments and planners borrowed carefully from the planning ideas and methods of many other countries, Japanese urban planning, urban governance and cities developed very differently from those of other developed countries. Japan's distinctive patterns of urbanisation are partly a product of the highly developed urban system, urban traditions and material culture of the pre-modern period, which remained influential until well after the Pacific War. A second key influence has been the dominance of central government in urban affairs, and its consistent prioritisation of economic growth over the public welfare or urban quality of life. Andr  Sorensen examines Japan's urban trajectory from the mid-nineteenth century to the present, paying particular attention to the weak development of Japanese civil society, local governments, and land development and planning regulations.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=LomFAgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Anam Cara","description":"\\"Anam Cara is a rare synthesis of philosophy, poetry, and spirituality.

An excelllent book. Ron Burt writes a compelling story about his older brother's heroism and injuries received at the hands of Kamikaze direct hits on two ships, about his brother's recovery from those injuries and about his own efforts to gather the information necessary to support the process to have his brother awarded the Navy Cross and Silver Star. His brother, Pete Burt, was on the USS OMMANEY BAY (CVE-79) when it was sunk by a Kamikaze attack. While he was in the water following the order to abandon ship he gathered ten non-swimmers and kept them together until rescued. The officer on the whaleboat told Pete that he planned to recommend him for the medals. Following his rescue he was transferred to the USS COLUMBIA (CL-56) where two days later it too was struck by a Kamikaze attack resulting in the injuries sustained by Pete Burt. He was to survive fifty surgeries and twenty-two and one half months in hospitals and nearly a lifetime of post traumatic stress syndrome (PTSD). During much of this time his brother Ron, a four year Navy veteran of the Korean Conflict and a tin can sailor (USS SHELTON (DD-790), spent years of research and writing his account of his efforts to locate veterans who could corroborate Pete's heroism. He contacted the Navy, veteran's organizations, his congressman, placed ads in veterans magazines and contacted numerous veterans by phone, mail and in person. He went to the reunion of the survivors of the OMMANY attack in 1990 and spoke to the nearly 120 veterans and their families who were there. The result is a book that is unique in that it puts a face to the Kamikaze pilots who committed these atrocities, provides vivid first person accounts of the experience (as painful as they are) and gives us a hero that we can all identify with, one who was there and who lived through it with grace. This is a book that will make you think about war in all of its ugliness. Availability: Amazon.com * * * This book (with 28 photographs) is about my brother, Pete Burt, a survivor of four Japanese kamikaze crashes while on board the USS Ommaney Bay (CVE-79) and the USS Columbia (CL-56). These two ships encountered countless attacks from the kamikazes. The Ommaney Bay was sunk while the Columbia sustained three hits, seriously injuring Pete. He was pronounced dead twice, unconscious for 7 days and hospitalized for 22 1/2 months, undergoing 50 operations during that period. He suffered from PTSD for 32 years. For 44 years, he contended that the kamikaze pilot was a woman. Research uncovers a unique aspect of the kamikaze that has remained dormant for years. * * * The Dept. of The Navy has deposited \\"Kamikaze Nightmare\\" in their Operational Archives Branch to allow for its preservation and availability to researchers. The book is a fine addition to the Center's World War II Collections and is especially valuable because it adds a personal dimension that is lacking from the official records. Ltr.

He begins to investigate what Smith says \\"angels\\" whisper to him about Cahill. Soon Nick has an assignment to work with his longtime friend, reporter Ryan Lockridge, on the Cahill story.

By the time they figure out that the disappearance is related to gambling legislation, dead bodies are turning up. As Nick struggles to keep the uglier details from his family, the story takes a new twist.

In theater, literature, story telling, and news reporting, it is a powerful mechanism that draws attention, heightens the senses and evokes emotion. Schirch argues that peacebuilding has the potential to do just the same. Examples of peacebuilding often center on the serious, rational negotiations and formal problem-solving efforts in conflict situations. Schirch argues, though, that what truly bonds adversaries and helps achieve peace are the symbolic, non-verbal ritual acts--shaking hands, sharing a meal, showing a photograph of a loved one. Yet these are often overlooked as deliberate components of peace negotiations. Ritual and Symbol in Peacebuilding underscores the importance of incorporating symbolic tools, including ritual, into traditional approaches to conflict. Ritual assists in solving complex, deep-rooted conflicts, and helps to confirm and transform worldviews, identities, and relationships. With theories and language to explain the symbolic dimensions of conflict, this text will be useful to scholars and practitioners active in the diverse field of peacebuilding.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=Hc82EgYQ7c0C&dq=Ritual+and+Symbol+in+Peacebuilding&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Never a Greater Need","description":"\\"Contains [Benton's] selection of the best poems he has written since the publication of his first book.\\"--on inside flap of dust jacket.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=0XiNwgEACAAJ&dq=Never+a+Greater+Need&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Cook 1.0: A Fresh Approach to the Vegetarian Kitchen","description":"Photographer, designer, and passionate home cook Heidi Swanson presents 40 basic vegetarian recipes for breakfast, lunch, and dinner dishes, sides, desserts, and drinks, each accompanied by easy-to-read tables that show delicious, inventive ways to build on them.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=hoUUAQAAMAAJ&dq=Cook+1.0:+A+Fresh+Approach+to+the+Vegetarian+Kitchen&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Just Moms : A Mother by Any Other Squawk, Cheep, Yip or Mew Is Still as Sweet","description":"The moment a child is born, the mother is also born.

Rockwells new book is as pro liberty as it is brutally critical of government. It is relentlessly forthright yet hopeful about the prospects for liberty. It is rigorous enough to withstand the enemys closest scrutiny, and chock full of the energy and enthusiasm that will keep you reading. As a collection of speeches delivered over a period of ten years, Speaking of Liberty is long (470 pages), but it is the kind of book people will want to see in the hands of friends, family, and students. The book begins with economics, and explains why Austrian economics matters, how the Federal Reserve brings on the business cycle, why we need private property and free enterprise, the unrecognized glories of the capitalist economy, and why the gold standard is still the best monetary system. The remaining sections deal with war, Mises and his work, other important thinkers in the libertarian tradition, and the culture and morality of liberty. The book is united by a set of fixed principles: the corruption of politics, the universality and immutability of the ideas of freedom, the centrality of sound money and free enterprise, the moral imperative of peace and trade, the importance of hope and tenacity in the struggle for liberty, and the need for everyone to join the intellectual fight. We all have searched for the book we could give to friends and neighbors, business associates and family members, to explain why we believe in the cause of liberty. Speaking of Liberty is that book. \\"Critics of the free market are therefore the Wile E Coyotes of our day: sitting on the stool in comfort, they systematically saw away at the legs beneath them, on the absurd assumption that they will be able to hang in the air indefinitely after their work is done.

In his palavering, stream-of-conscious style that has marked him as one of the major writers and innovators of postwar European literature, Hrabal gives a humorous and at times moving account of life in Prague under Nazi occupation, Communism, and the brief euphoria following the revolution of 1989 when anything seemed possible, even pink tanks. Interspersed are fragmented memories of trips taken to Britain ? as he attempted to track down every location mentioned in Eliot?s ?The Waste Land? ? and the United States, where he ends up in one of Dylan Thomas?s haunts comparing the waitresses to ones he knew in Prague. The result is a masterful blend of personal history and fee association rendered in a prose as powerful as it is poetic.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=D5wYAQAAIAAJ&dq=Total+Fears+Letters+to+Dubenka&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Discovery of the Tomb of Tutankhamen","description":"This book captures the painstaking, step-by-step process of excavation, and the wonders of the treasure-filled inner chamber. 106 on-the-spot photographs depict the phases of the discovery and the scrupulous cataloging of the treasures.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=25Y2fiAWpWkC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Hardest 30 Days of Your Life","description":"CHANGE YOUR LIFE IN 30 DAYS takes you on a thirty-day journey that will help you make extraordinary changes in your life.

Indeed, the writing and rewriting of this endlessly intriguing icon's life has produced more than six hundred books, from the long procession of \\"authoritative\\" biographies to the memoirs and plays by ex-husband Arthur Miller and the works by Norman Mailer and Joyce Carol Oates. But even as the books have multiplied, myth, reality, fact, fiction, and gossip have become only more intertwined; there is still no agreement about such fundamental questions as Marilyn's given name, the identity of her father, whether she was molested as a child, and how and why she died. The Many Lives of Marilyn Monroe reviews the unreliable and unverifiable-but highly significant-stories that have framed the greatest Hollywood legend. All the while, cultural critic Sarah Churchwell reveals us to ourselves: our conflicted views on women, our tormented sexual attitudes, our ambivalence about success, our fascination with self-destruction. In incisive and passionate prose, Churchwell uncovers the shame, belittlement, and anxiety that we bring to the story of a woman we supposedly adore. In the process, she rescues a Marilyn Monroe who is far more complicated and credible than the one we think we know.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=L2I9wyYrMNkC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Short Stories","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=Q2mIwwEACAAJ&dq=Short+Stories&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Themes, Dreams, and Schemes Banquet Menu Ideas, Concepts, and Thematic Experiences","description":"This innovative, comprehensive reference guide is ideal for caterers, special event managers, and other foodservice professionals.

Written from a cross-cultural perspective, it challenges depictions of women s roles in religion where they have been relegated to compliance with specifically designated gendered attributes. The different chapters contest the resultant stereotypes that deny women agency. Each chapter describes women as engaged in an aspect of religion, from that of ritual specialists, to benefactors and patrons, or even innovators. The volume examines topics such as sainthood and sacrifice so as to refine these ideas in constructive ways that do not devalue women. It also examines the meaning of the term  gift  today, embracing the term in both figurative and literal ways. Such a collection of diverse women s writings and activities provides a significant contribution to their quest for recognition, and also suggests ways this can be understood and realized today.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ERtLDQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Spirituality According to Jesus: 8 Seeker Bible Discussions on the Gospel of Luke (Saltshaker Resources)","description":"Offering eight seeker Bible discussions in the Gospel of Luke, Rebecca Manley Pippert helps you to explore what Jesus said about the best way to live and what his teaching may mean for you.

One of the most significant aspects of these letters has been the discovery of Canaanite influence in the Akkadian language of these letters. This discovery has provided a wealth of linguistic knowledge concerning that period and its influence on subsequent ages. Though much has been written about the Amarna letters, until now there has been no comprehensive study of the personal names found in the cuneiform texts from El-Amarna. Dr. Hess fills the void with this comprehensive reference tool. The main part of the book catalogs the Amarna personal names, providing necessary information for each name, including attested spellings, occurrences, identification, textual notes, and analysis. The author then offers a grammatical analysis of the names and glossaries of the seven languages attested in personal names in the letters. Glossaries of divine name and geographical name elements and an extensive bibliography complete the study. This volume is essential for research libraries and for scholars and students working with the Amarna letters or Akkadian and Northwest Semitic languages.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=ifqhPlmMqiwC&dq=English-Egyptian+Index+of+Faulkner%27s+Concise+Dictionary+of+Middle+Egyptian+(Aids+and+Research+Tools+in+Ancient+Near+Eastern+Studies+:+Vol+1)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"THE MARQUIS TAKES A WIFE (HARLEQUIN PRESENTS #188)","description":"Wife For A Year by Rachel Lindsay released on Dec 25, 1980 is available now for purchase.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=O9kByG29aqoC&dq=THE+MARQUIS+TAKES+A+WIFE+(HARLEQUIN+PRESENTS&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The design of simple roof-trusses in wood and steel","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=8_s4AAAAMAAJ&dq=The+design+of+simple+roof-trusses+in+wood+and+steel&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Decline and Fall of the American Empire","description":"The analog of the fall from grace of the greatest power on earth since ancient Rome.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=LlPuAAAACAAJ&dq=The+Decline+and+Fall+of+the+American+Empire&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"It's Good to Be the King...Sometimes","description":"Jerry Lawler is hailed as one of sports-entertainment's most enduring and colorful characters. His life has been filled with hilarious, never-been-told stories...until now! His reign consists of thirteen championships (one of which he's held more than forty times), three marriages, and two children. He's dominated Memphis radio and television airwaves. Starred in feature films. Recorded albums. Tolerated countless sprains, broken bones, concussions, and contusions. The way Jerry \\"The King\\" Lawler tells it, if you're good at something, do it more than once. It's Good To Be The King...Sometimes is a no-holds-barred personal account from the \\"puppies\\"-pantin' King of one-liners, who steps out from behind the announcer's desk of WWE Raw to hold court about everything. His passion for art that first drew him to the ring of a rundown West Memphis movie theater over thirty years ago. The comic adventures and tragic bumps endured journeying down the \\"Music Highway\\" of Interstate 40 with the National Wrestling Alliance. Earning his royal personage in the Bluff City of the Mighty Mississippi against his own mentor, \\"Fabulous\\" Jackie Fargo. Grappling with mat legends Ric Flair, Lou Thesz, Jesse Ventura, Andre the Giant, Terry Funk, and Bret \\"Hitman\\" Hart. And his crowning achievements as co-ruler of the United States Wrestling Association, which contributed to the rise of future WWE Superstars Hulk Hogan, Undertaker, Stone Cold Steve Austin, and The Rock. It's time you lackeys pay heed as the King reveals the schemes and outrageous storylines to many of wrestling's most fantastic theatrics and all-too-real moments. Lawler tells of his legendary \\"feud\\" with Andy Kaufman, and his much-publicized confrontation with the actor portraying the late comedian on the set of Man on the Moon, and the \\"Karate-versus-Wrestling\\" match that almost occurred between Lawler and Memphis's other King. And be sure to honor his royal proclamations regarding former wives, and his mother's opinion of wrestling; why he once sued future boss Vince McMahon...and won; and the body part he truly worships on a WWE Diva.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Qv83yXvjPOkC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"African Adventures","description":"A true pioneer missionary, Brenda survived many snake and wild animal attacks in the first thirteen years of her ministry to orphans in Mozambique, Africa.

It opens by comparing and contrasting two models of statistical inference: the classical population model espoused by J. Neyman and E.S. Pearson and the permutation model first introduced by R.A. Fisher and E.J.G. Pitman. Numerous comparisons of permutation and classical statistical methods are presented, supplemented with a variety of R scripts for ease of computation. The text follows the general outline of an introductory textbook in statistics with chapters on central tendency and variability, one-sample tests, two-sample tests, matched-pairs tests, completely-randomized analysis of variance, randomized-blocks analysis of variance, simple linear regression and correlation, and the analysis of goodness of fit and contingency. Unlike classical statistical methods, permutation statistical methods do not rely on theoretical distributions, avoid the usual assumptions of normality and homogeneity, depend only on the observed data, and do not require random sampling. The methods are relatively new in that it took modern computing power to make them available to those working in mainstream research. Designed for an audience with a limited statistical background, the book can easily serve as a textbook for undergraduate or graduate courses in statistics, psychology, economics, political science or biology. No statistical training beyond a first course in statistics is required, but some knowledge of, or some interest in, the R programming language is assumed.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=DEhFEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Your Best Face Without Surgery","description":"Women are hungry for reliable answers to their questions on how to have better skin.

This sign is quickly revealed to be a forgery, which takes leader and secretary into a larger discussion about the nature of truth:  In the light of what Your Eminence says, even the truth appears to be a lie.  Their conversation broadens into an epic journey of the mind, stretching across the colonial history of their nation, filled with surrealist imagery, labyrinthine turns, and footnotes supplied by a mysterious  compiler.

Schenker's method is based on two cardinal concepts-a hierarchy of tones grouped into structural levels, and a recognition of the importance of strict voice-leading at all structural levels. In Analyzing Fugue-A Schenkerian Approach, author William Renwick utilizes Schenkerian techniques to explore the relationship between imitative counterpoint and voice-leading in fugue. He shows that the art of fugal composition as practiced by masters such as Bach and Handel involves a remarkable degree of systematic structural patterning that is not evident on the surface of the music. Reviews-...Renwick's book offers a penetrating theory of fugue, with telling observations for theorists and composers alike.

He has defined the parameters and structured the vision of Modern Orthodoxy as a vibrant and attractive religious phenomenon that combines fidelity to Jewish tradition while embracing the modern world of knowledge and culture, with tolerance for all Jews and civility toward all humankind.

Classical social theory in its search for the genesis of capitalism explored the process of transition from feudalism to capitalism. Making Capitalism without Capitalists focuses instead on the transition from socialism to capitalism, where capitalism is made without a capitalist class. Making Capitalism without Capitalists reflects on the sociological characteristics of the Communist system breakdown in 1989 and offers a theory of social structure of post-Communist societies. 1989 is seen as a successful revolution led by the former technocratic fraction of the old Communist ruling estate against the bureaucracy. In order to secure its victory, however, the technocracy had to make substantial concessions to the former dissident intelligentsia. The irony of the post-Communist way to capitalism is that these most unlikely actors see 'building capitalism' as their historic task. By identifying some unique features of capitalism built on the ruins of socialism, Making Capitalism without Capitalists contributes to a deeper appreciation of the diversity of capitalism today.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=R7McOM9raNYC&dq=Making+Capitalism+without+Capitalists:+The+New+Ruling+Elites+in+Eastern+Europe&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Colonial Small Wars, 1837-1901","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=FJctPQAACAAJ&dq=Colonial+Small+Wars,+1837-1901&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Success Series: Volumes 1 & 2: Success, Decision, Risk, Persistence, Responsibility, Confidence, Action, Money, Goals, Attitude, Creativity, Communication","description":"This book contains the four volumes in the Just Get Serious success series.

It is also the major political and symbolic border contested by Israelis and Palestinians. Combining biblical and folkloric studies with historical geography, Rachel Havrelock explores how the complex religious and mythological representations of the river have shaped the current conflict in the Middle East. Havrelock contends that the intractability of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict stems from the nationalist myths of the Hebrew Bible, where the Jordan is defined as a border of the Promised Land. Both Israelis and Palestinians claim the Jordan as a necessary boundary of an indivisible homeland. Examining the Hebrew Bible alongside ancient and modern maps of the Jordan, Havrelock chronicles the evolution of Israel s borders based on nationalist myths while uncovering additional myths that envision Israel as a bi-national state. These other myths, she proposes, provide roadmaps for future political configurations of the nation. Ambitious and masterful in its scope, River Jordan brings a fresh, provocative perspective to the ongoing struggle in this violence-riddled region.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=G5_H76kOJtkC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"My \\"t\\" book (My first steps to reading)","description":"Van populair weblog naar New York Times-bestseller is dit h t boek voor zelfhulphaters!

It begins with the Valley's participation in the Midwest Crime Wave of 1933-34, describing the demise of the legendary bank robber \\"Pretty Boy\\" Floyd. This is followed by the demise of one of the Valley's own in the brutal slaying of \\"Happy\\" Marino, which also happens to be one of the Valley's few gangland murders in which all the participants were tried, convicted and sent to prison. The mid-to-late 1930s is chronicled showing the dominance of the ethnic-based lottery houses, which operated in Youngstown. These operations came to end after a run-away grand jury created enough interest to draw the governor's attention. The late 1940s saw the height of popularity of the infamous Jungle Inn gambling den, located just over the Mahoning County line in Trumbull County. The history of this establishment is chronicled in \\"Welcome to the Jungle Inn,\\" also by Allan R. May, and is a companion book to \\"Crimetown U.S.A.\\" describing the history of organized crime in Warren and Trumbull County, Ohio. By the end of the 1940s the citizens of Youngstown put a new mayor in City Hall. Charles Henderson ran on the platform of \\"Smash Racket Rule\\" in the city. The man he brought in to do the \\"smashing\\" was Edward J. Allen. The feisty and fearless police chief began by chasing out two-thirds of the Valley's \\"Big 3,\\" including Mafia member Joe DiCarlo, who muscled into the race wire service and controlled the local bookmaking. This period was followed by what was known as the \\"bug\\" craze, which was the Valley's nickname for the numbers game or policy, as it was also known. The battle for dominance resulted in a bombing war throughout the 1950s for supremacy in this field by the city's top policy racketeers, Sandy Naples and Vince DeNiro. By the end of the 1950s, Youngstown had become known as \\"Bomb Town.\\" In the early 1960s, the bombs that were used to scare the competition were now being used to eliminate it. A wave of vicious killings took place, some taking the lives of innocent people. No murder was more notorious than the November 1962 car-bombing that took the lives of \\"Cadillac Charlie\\" Cavallaro and his 11-year old son. The senseless killing shocked the country and brought national attention to Youngstown. It also brought the city an everlasting and despised nickname, \\"Crimetown, U.S.A.\\"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=QyM7nwEACAAJ&dq=Mafia,+USA&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Luke (Communicator's Commentary: Mastering the New Testament)","description":"A comprehensive verse-by-verse commentary for lay Bible students, fully highlighted by articles, maps, charts, and illustrations-all in one volume.

Drawing on literary, artistic, and archaeological sources as well as on comparative studies of family history, Mark Golden offers a vivid portrait of the public and private lives of children from about 500 to 300 B.C. Golden discusses how the Athenians viewed children and childhood, describes everyday activities of children at home and in the community, and explores the differences in the social lives of boys and girls. He details the complex bonds among children, parents, siblings, and household slaves, and he shows how a growing child s changing roles often led to conflict between the demands of family and the demands of community. In this thoroughly revised edition, Golden places particular emphasis on the problem of identifying change over time and the relationship of children to adults. He also explores three dominant topics in the recent historiography of childhood: the agency of children, the archaeology of childhood, and representations of children in art. The book includes a completely new final chapter, text and notes rewritten throughout to incorporate evidence and scholarship that has appeared over the past twenty-five years, and an index of ancient sources.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=DPZ0CQAAQBAJ&dq=Children+and+Childhood+in+Classical+Athens&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Milady's Professional Barber-Styling Workbook","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=ku1DzwEACAAJ&dq=Milady%27s+Professional+Barber-Styling+Workbook&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Find Courtney: A Psychological Thriller","description":"Written in a tone of suppressed eroticism and infused with surprising revelations of false identities, Find Courtney is a psychological thriller that keeps the reader guessing up to its startling climax.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=_Qy_AAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Why Me?","description":"After surviving the attacks on the town, a few teenagers discover their pets acting strangely.

His first covers appeared in 1958, and since then he has painted over one thousand of them, for all the major publishers in all genres. He is most renowned for his portraits of women. The elegant, sexy and intelligent McGinnis Woman is as distinctive and recognizable as was the Gibson Girl in the early 1900's. McGinnis was elected to the Society of Illustrators Hall of Fame in 1993. McGinnis's paperback work is avidly sought after by collectors. However, collecting McGinnis covers has been a huge challenge, not only because of the unprecedented volume of his work, but because he was often uncredited, he worked in a wide variety of styles, and many illustrators imitated him. No reliable checklist has been available until now. This book provides a complete and definitive bibliography documenting McGinnis's work as a paperback cover artist. With the artist's cooperation, it has been compiled by two long-time fans and collectors of his work, who began comparing notes and exchanging checklists in 1985. Over 250 paperback covers are reproduced in this book, along with many examples of the original art, model photos and preliminary sketches which afford an inside-the-studio look at the artist's working methods. The parade of covers-mysteries, westerns, romances, bestsellers-is a capsule graphic survey of trends in American mass market fiction of the last forty years, and of the extraordinary career of a gifted illustrator, Robert McGinnis.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=-josKwAACAAJ&dq=The+Paperback+Covers+of+Robert+McGinnis&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Turf Management in the Transition Zone","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=nL3vMgEACAAJ&dq=Turf+Management+in+the+Transition+Zone&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Aikido with Ki -","description":"Best-selling martial-arts author Carol Shifflett presents an expanded second edition of her popular book Ki in Aikido, the detailed guide that combines aikido techniques and principles with extensively illustrated step-by-step instructions and ki exercises.

And what is it about a joke's dirtiness that makes it funny? G. Legman was perhaps the foremost scholar of the dirty joke, and as legions of humor writers and comedians know, his Rationale of the Dirty Joke remains the most exhaustive and authoritative study of the subject. More than two thousand jokes and folktales are presented, covering such topics as The Female Fool, The Fortunate Fart, Mutual Mismatching, and The Sex Machine. These folk texts are authentically transcribed in their innocent and sometimes violent entirety. Legman studies each for its historical and socioanalytic significance, revealing what these jokes mean to the people who tell them and to the people who listen and laugh. Here -- back in print -- is the definitive text for comedians and humor writers, Freudian scholars and late night television enthusiasts. Rationale of the Dirty Joke will amuse you, offend you, challenge you, and disgust you, all while demonstrating the intelligence and hilarity of the dirty joke.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=vsZYihpCoHMC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Course ILT: Microsoft Word 2002: VBA Programming","description":"This ILT Series course builds on the skills taught in Word 2002: Intermediate.

Even so, Robert Lee Maril s Waltzing with the Ghost of Tom Joad is the first comprehensive analysis of poverty in the state. Skillfully combining ethnography with statistical analysis, Maril portrays the lives of poverty-stricken Oklahomans, many of them children, minorities, and the elderly. Exploring myths about the poor and discussing the facts behind these myths, Maril discusses the real causes of poverty in the state, especially low-wage labor. He concludes by presenting a public-policy agenda that would benefit the poor directly and, in so doing, improve the lives of all Oklahomans. From the Foreword by Robert McCormick: Why did my grandparents and many Oklahomans of their generation escape from poverty while many others did not? The reasons are not clear. Nor do we have easy explanations for those present-day Oklahomans fighting the same struggle. Robert Lee Maril s compelling account shows the plight of hundreds of thousands who remain poor even though conditions in the state have vastly improved. Blaming the victim is not an option for intelligent and caring Oklahomans. The question before us today is, what will we do as citizens to reduce the level of poverty in our state? From my vantage point as someone who has fought for increased opportunities for Oklahomans. I have seen a common thread that runs through story after story of individuals who make the move from poverty to prosperity: that thread is access to and support for education. Inherent inequalities in economic and family backgrounds often dissipate before doors that education routinely opens. One wonders in reading Dr. Maril s accounts of Oklahomans in poverty how different their stories might have been had someone cared enough to see to it that their underlying condition of poverty did not interfere with their opportunity to get an education.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=d983G_UY6kQC&dq=Waltzing+With+the+Ghost+of+Tom+Joad:+Poverty,+Myth,+and+Low-Wage+labor+in+Oklahoma&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Meditation Handbook","description":"The New Meditation Handbook is a practical guide to meditation that teaches us how to make ourself and others happy by developing inner peace, and in this way making our lives more meaningful.

Our Lord answers us clearly that our forgiveness of those who hurt us shall have no end. This is one of the most difficult things any person has to face. David Augsburger understands this. He knows the outrageous cost-and incomparable value-of forgiving. He also knows this is a believer's only option. Any other course of action will not only be destructive, it will violate the will of God. In The New Freedom of Forgiveness, Dr. Augsburger expands upon his classic writing to provide a more comprehensive, expanded, and stronger message. Combining personal testimonies with Scripture, Dr. Augsburger provides readers with practical guidance on applying forgiveness in our everyday lives. With an excellent new study guide, readers will be challenged on an even deeper level. We are commanded to forgive everything. Not just the little stuff, the minor irritations and thoughtless behavior of others, but everything. When we forgive, we are set free from bondage. The New Freedom of Forgiveness is an essential resource not only for understanding what God requires, but also learning how to apply it every day. Read this life-changing book and discover the freedom of forgiveness.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=mqsgDk5SQNMC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Teaching English To Koreans","description":"Are you thinking about teaching English in South Korea but not really sure what to expect?

Special emphasis was placed on the review of acoustic emission (AE) research and applications in the 20th century and its future in the 21st century. The technique for monitoring defects and abnormal vibrations due to machine failures is vitally important for the safety of structures in a modern society. AE, as a passive, rather than an active NDT method, has drawn much attention because of its applicability to on-stream surveillance of structures. One important point is its capability to acquire data very simply but with high sensitivity so that the development of a non-contact sensing technique is particularly important. A quantitative method to evaluate structural integrity and remaining life from the detected AE signals is strongly required. Quantitative analysis, based on inverse procedures, has provided a certain solution, but has not been utilized widely enough in structures due to its complexity. Its applicability is limited partly because the accuracy of solutions depends on noise levels and partly because the phenomenon is usually non-reproducible. AE is expected to be a next-generation technique not only to monitor conditions but also for the repair of damaged structures, combined with an active-adaptive technique using a 'solid state actuator'. 'Smart Materials and Structures' are known in this respect. AE is considered to be a very promising technique, together with such sensing techniques as optical fiber, shape memory alloy and electro-rheological fluid. Thus, AE can play a very important roll in monitoring, evaluating and repairing structures. In this workshop, a limited number of invited papers are presented for technical discussion to review the achievements of AE research and applications in the 20th century. The proceedings are entitled Acoustic Emission - Beyond the Millennium to celebrate the new millennium, and stepping forward to a new era. The authors and topics of these review papers were selected by the editorial board.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=fScdwaN42IAC&dq=Beyond+the+Millennium&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Spinsters in jeopardy","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=4o23twEACAAJ&dq=Spinsters+in+jeopardy&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Straight Up Or on the Rocks: the Story of the American Cocktail","description":"A revised and expanded social history of social drinking and the cocktail in America discusses 350 years of drinking history--from colonial taverns to today's watering holes--and features more than one hundred recipes, including many new ones, for the most interesting and enduring beverages.

Now Bond debutes an exciting new series that rockets straight from the cutting edge of America's war on terror . . . Officially designated the Joint Services Special Demands Project, \\"The Team\\" is a unique unit created to address unconventional threats in an unconventional manner, beyond the beurocratic restraints of either the U.S. intelligence or military establishments. With an almost unlimited budget, the Team, consisting of a CIA officer, two Special Forces commandos, and one outnumbered Marine--is authorized to track vital intel and then take immediate action. A radical response to perilous times, the Team has never been more needed than this very moment: a quantity of radioactive waste, being shipped across the former Soviet Union, has gone missing. In the wrong hands, the stolen material can be converted into a \\"dirty bomb\\" capable of rendering any American city uninhabitable for centuries. With time running out, the Team must locate and neutralize the threat--unaware that their unseen enemy has already chosen a target: the island paradise of Honolulu.

We often think the key to success and satisfaction is to get more: more money, time, and possessions; bigger budgets, job titles, and teams; and additional resources for our professional and personal goals. It turns out we re wrong. Using captivating stories to illustrate research in psychology and management, Rice University professor Scott Sonenshein examines why some people and organizations succeed with so little, while others fail with so much. People and organizations approach resources in two different ways:  chasing  and  stretching.  When chasing, we exhaust ourselves in the pursuit of more. When stretching, we embrace the resources we already have. This frees us to find creative and productive ways to solve problems, innovate, and engage our work and lives more fully. Stretch shows why everyone from executives to entrepreneurs, professionals to parents, athletes to artists performs better with constraints; why seeking too many resources undermines our work and well-being; and why even those with a lot benefit from making the most out of a little. Drawing from examples in business, education, sports, medicine, and history, Scott Sonenshein advocates a powerful framework of resourcefulness that allows anybody to work and live better.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ku8qDAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Time to Teleport and The Genetic General","description":"Donal Graeme is a warrior.

When they woke up they discovered that things had changed--they had changed. Some started having visions. Others heard ominous voices. And then, scientists from a mysterious government agency arrived. Determined not to become research subjects of strange experiments, the residents of Fogg Lake blamed their \\"hallucinations\\" on food poisoning, and the story worked. But now it has become apparent that the eerie effects of The Incident are showing up in the descendants of Fogg Lake.... Catalina Lark and Olivia LeClair, best friends and co-owners of an investigation firm in Seattle, use what they call their \\"other sight\\" to help solve cases. When Olivia suddenly vanishes one night, Cat frantically begins the search for her friend.

This book follows the two teams, whose members include Christy Mathewson, Jim Thorpe, and half a dozen other future Hall-of-Famers, as they barnstorm across the United States and sail the seas to Asia, the Middle East, and Europe, finishing with a game before twenty thousand fans and King George V. Along the way, baseball's envoys meet such dignitaries as Pope Pius X, tea magnate Thomas Lipton, and the last khedive of Egypt. They play the tables of Monaco, survive a near-shipwreck, and cram a lifetime's worth of adventures into six months.

A revision of one of the most successful books on human-computer interaction, this compilation gives students, researchers, and practitioners an overview of the significant concepts and results in the field and a comprehensive guide to the research literature.

Unlike their colleagues in Synoptic Gospel studies, however, students of Samuel/Kings and Chronicles have not had easy access to English-language harmonies in which the principal texts are laid side-by-side in such a manner that comparison is facilitated not just of large blocks of text, but of individual words and phrases as well. . . . The text is that of the Revised Standard Version, Samuel/Kings in the left column, Chronicles in the right (except where noted).
