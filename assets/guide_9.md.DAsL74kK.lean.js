Chapter contents: Youth in Holland (1905); In the backwash of war (moved to Canada 1919); Parisian days; Men and events; The Street of Our Lady; Notes from an African diary; Ethiopian interlude; After seven centuries; L'Infame; World without end; Voices in the storm; Afraid of victory; In the shadow of tomorrow. At the Sorbonne had a curse in Biblical exegesis in late 1920s.. The author recounts the events of post-WWI in Europe; not that he participated much in any decision- or influence-making way, he just sort of reports on various social riots or political movements of the day: people rioted in Paris, Lenin made some remarks about communism, general stuff of no real impact upon the author. He became of newspaper reporter, toured Europe. Lived in Morocco, talked about the fairs of Marrakech and Fez and Meknes - but not really much detail of interest. He reports on several newspaper stories of the mid-1930s detailing how various French commanders had executed various soldiers for failing to follow orders to attack German military units during The Great War (p. 150-161). In this 1940 book he talks about the rise of Adolph Hitler in Germany in the mid 1930s, and recounts how some newspaper writers dismissed Hitler's rise in politics in the late 1920. The author did report on Hitler's demands for the German reoccupation of the Rhineland, but based on information he received from other sources - not his own. He discusses his reading of various books regarding Italy's Duce: Mussolini. He talks of his living in Berlin in mid 1930s, but very general information - one just doesn't get a \`feeling' of his experiences. Due to his critical writings against Hitler, he was interned in a Dachau prison for awhile, before being released upon appeals from his journalist friends. The author details WHAT is happening with the rise of Hitler's fascism rule, but not really the WHY of Hitler's thinking. The author is in Lake Chad in 1934, but doesn't really offer much detail about his travels there. He details his watching the French shooting of four Arab youths for some crime [p. 265]. He discusses a run-down Jewish school in the Jewish ghetto (mellah) [p. 267]. In Agades he talks about the slave trade [p. 289]. He visits Ethiopia to detail the Italian's conquest of that country. He visits Palestine to cover the Druse revolt in Syria, and discusses the Jewish development around Tel Aviv, and details his interview with the Muslim \`Grand Mufti', who said to the author: \\"There will be no peace in this country until they [the Jews] go ... Our people are at the end of their patience. They cannot bear the sight of the Jews any longer\\" (p. 365]. The Mufti went on to claim that Jews sought the blood of Arabs. The author discusses the incident when Arabs in Hebron passed out falsified photographs showing the Omar mosque of Jerusalem in ruins, which set off anti-Jew riots [p. 370]. The author claimed that some Arabs did not like his articles in \\"The Palestine Post\\": \\"One day a British tommy...with a blow of his rifle broke the arm of an Arab who rushed me with a long knife as I emerged from (my hotel)\\" [p. 387]. In May 1936 he begins reporting on the political troubles of Spain and the beginnings of Franco's military rise. In 1939 he returns to Europe to discuss the gathering war clouds, then travels to England to escape Hitler's invasion of France - then publishes this book."},{"Title":"All Things Are Lights","review":"This is perhaps my all-time favorite book.

In fact, in an attempt to add elements, Morrell throws in a handful of unrealistic characters that aren't in the film, when he could have really invested a little time fleshing out the (once surprisingly deep) protagonist he actually created.The whole situation is kind of akin to something like this:Following the success of Misery, Kathy Bates writes a screenplay for a film Misery 2: The Continuing Adventures of Annie Wilkes and, later, Misery 3: Annie Wilkes Judgment Day. Kathy Bates then hands Stephen King her completed script and asks him to turn it into a novel. And thus we have Misery 3 by Stephen King, based on a screenplay by Kathy Bates.As James Caan says in the original film, \\"You do realize that this is not the usual manner in which books get written.

The story follows female detective Lynn Davis as she attempts to solve a baffling mystery involving one of Cincinnati's wealthiest families.

It provided me with an opportunity to get to know the characters.These characters were all different, but there were aspects of their personalities that Gigi Gossett got me to understand and to appreciate, and even to empathsize with. It's interesting... it's like a roller coaster ride. At least for me, my feelings towards them shifted. She drew me in to them, and made me care.

Excellent book!!"},{"Title":"The interpretation of dreams","review":"Deified by secular academia in the 1960s, Sigmund Freud has become increasingly disparaged - despite the circumspectness of his arguments - and his popularity become increasingly eclipsed by his student Carl Jung. But for readers of James Joyce's Finnegans Wake (clearly a small group) Freud is an invaluable resource for understanding dream consciousness: Eg, Freud suggests crucial ideas of a \\"universal grammar\\" of dream-consciousness. (See also the linguistic works of Noam Chomsky, and Leonard Bernstein's video lecture The Unanswered Question.)1. NO-NOThe subconscious doesn't understand negatives - (\\"no, not, never\\") - instead perceiving them as affirmations. Like Molly Bloom's repetitive \\"Yes\\" as she drifts off into sleep at the conclusion of Ulysses, Freud posits there is no negation in sleep. Rather, negation can only be expressed by the subconscious as ideas inverted or otherwise made insensible. (Joyceans, see Joseph Campbell's appraisal of Picasso's handling of mythic imagery).2. OPPOSITESA vague idea may signify its opposite. Freud compares this to primitive proto-language etymology, in which either pole of an extreme is expressed by one and the same word. (Joyceans, see any page of Finnegans Wake and page 38 of Ulysses - \\"contransmagnificandjewbangtantiality\\").3. CONSUBSTANTIALITYConflation of ideas and persons is employed by the subconscious to short-circuit \\"inner censoring\\" and \\"prefrontal control\\". For example, supposedly-not-dreamed-about Mr A is indirectly indicated in a dream because Mr B appears in that dream wearing a hat usually associated with Mr A. (Joyceans, obviously this is the essence of Finnegans Wake.)Again, an invaluable resource for Joyceans. For all others interested in the dynamics of the subconscious, certainly well worth reading."},{"Title":"The interpretation of dreams","review":"ALTHOUGH THIS IS THE FIRST BOOK THAT I HAVE READ THAT WAS WRITTEN BY SIGMUND FREUD, I FEEL THAT THIS BOOK WAS REALLY GOOD.

The length of the book, bored me to tears, and was too hard for people unfamiliar with his work (i am though somewhat familiar but still his theories made no sense to me and lacked relevance in my life). The book went into painstaking great detail describing dreams and interpretations. His theories and interpretations were intriguing, and informative, but lacked any research to back up his theories."},{"Title":"The interpretation of dreams","review":"It is very hard to find the logic in believing Freud when he himself was quite mentally disturbed and sick. Freud rationalizes things to death, he gives no hope, and removes all magic from the world. It seems, finally, that Freud is falling into disrepute after some years of popularity. He was never correct, only popular. If you want really important work in the field, then read Karl Gustav Jung, because, as I mentioned in the title, Freud is not worth reading."},{"Title":"The interpretation of dreams","review":"No philosopher has had such a profound influence on all subsequent thought as Sigmund Freud. His theories, particularly those of this volume, have become such an integral part of daily discourse that most people fail to even realize how much they buy into the psychobabble. However, Freud must be viewed as a philosopher, not as the scientist he believed he was. His conclusions are either backed by superficial research or, more commonly, no research at all, and this book's most famous theory, that of the Oediple Complex, is argued (poorly) through literary examples, not scientific ones. The fact is that Freud is simply following a long-standing METAPHYSICAL tradition of dream interpretation which goes all the way back to Ancient Greece and Biblical tribes. All he does is invent his own gods to send the messages. The underlying motives for the book are quite obvious, though often overlooked--this paranoid cocaine addict wished to deal with his own psychoses by projecting them onto everyone else. We laugh at comedians when they tell of common acts of stupidity, mainly because we are relieved that we're not the only ones who do such things. Similarly, Freud, who fell in love with his mother when he saw her naked at age 2, concluded that everyone must want to sleep with their mother, because to do otherwise would be to admit that he was mad, which indeed he was. This is not to say that the book should not be read, only that it should be read because of its influence, and not because its ideas have any validity whatsoever."},{"Title":"The interpretation of dreams","review":"For all those who need to get their baloney straight from the horse's mouth, this book is all the Freud you need to decide: visionary or fraud. I find it incredible that thousands, even millions, of seemingly intelligent people have fallen for something with so little objective evidence in its favor.Although Freud had little, if any, sense of humor, he is unintentionally funny in this book. For that reason, if for no other, it deserves at least an attempted reading."},{"Title":"The interpretation of dreams","review":"This is a new translation (2006) of Freud's Interpretation of Dreams. I hope someone qualified might soon comment on the merits or significance of this new translation. Meanwhile, the Editorial Review information offered for this book comes from an earlier edition of a different translation of Freud's work, FWIW. And the second paragraph in the editorial review prelim is entirely inappropriate--it's for another book altogether.I give Freud's book (not the translation) a low rating because it is misleading. It's not about the interpretation of dreams in general, but more specifically it's, covertly of course, about Freud's own dreams. More basically, it's about \\"infantile memories\\" he claimed dreams concealed. (For more explanation of this point, one could consult \\"If Freud's Theory Be True...\\" in Psychological Reports (1992, 70, 611-620), which would explain how Freud himself tells us his book is not about what it appears to be about."},{"Title":"The interpretation of dreams","review":"I've studied philosophy to a good degree and therefore and to read some of Freud's work in Philosophy of Psychology. While making some entertaining remarks, Freud has now long been discounted as anything valid and understandably so."},{"Title":"The interpretation of dreams","review":"As a licensed psychologist I LOL when I saw Dr.Freud in the Religion/ Spirituality section. It seems the profession has made some progress."},{"Title":"The interpretation of dreams","review":"Dreams are some of the most mysterious, most enchanting, and most sacred experiences in all of human existence--and yet they are also some of the most elusive, and so their meaning has been scrutinized by every culture of the human race, for thousands and thousands of years.In all of these inquiries, perhaps none has been more thorough, more scientific, and more systematic than Dr. Sigmund Freud's &quot;Interpretation of Dreams&quot; (1900). In his book, Freud surveys the scientific research on dreams put forth so far (a remarkable achievement of scholarship in itself), and then puts forth his own theory of dreams.Dreams, Freud claims, are nothing more than a fulfillment of an unconscious wish. He supports his theory with analysis from a selection of actual dreams from his patients and from his own experience.Much of this book is entertaining and enlightening. Freud's good taste in literature is reflected in his own engaging style, and his sense of scholarly adventure is catching. Plus, he doesn't shy away from the big questions. How can we interpret dreams? How does a dream come about? What is the purpose of dreams? Why are all dreams wish fulfillments? What are the meaning of typical dreams, like losing teeth?--all these questions are tackled here. This is the book where Freud first puts forth his Oedipal theory.Freud's theory is always insightful, if not totally accurate. He seems to try too hard to make all the data jive with his &quot;wish-fulfillment&quot; theory, and when it doesn't, he resorts to ludicrous arguments reminiscent of Anselm's ontological catastrophe. For example, when a dream is clearly not a wish fulfillment, Freud asserts that it has actually fulfilled a wish--a wish that his theory is wrong. Poppycock.Despite these occasional stretches of reasonability, you'll come away from this book with a much greater understanding of the nature of dreams and the mental processes that bring dreams about. Highly recommended.This is a good intro to Freud; consider also &quot;Introductory Lectures on Psychoanaylsis.&quot;"},{"Title":"The interpretation of dreams","review":"It does not really matter whether we love or hate Sigmund Freud. What is important to acknowledge is that he revolutionized the way we think about ourselves. Some of this revolution can be traced back to The Interpretation of Dreams, the turn of the century masterpiece that outlined his theory of unconscious forces in the context of dream analysis. Joyce Crick's groundbreaking new translation is based on the original text published in November 1899 and it is clearly a more readable and accurate picture of Freud's original work.It is apparent that Freud concentrates to a larger extent on the use of words in dreams and on the difficulty of deciphering them. Freud's ideas of dreams as wish-fulfillment, his ideas of the retelling of the dream as a continuation, as well as the dream's manifest and latent content, are covered much more clearly than in any of the later editions of the same text. The fact that Joyce Crick's translation is faster-moving and definitively lighter than previous versions enhances the understanding of the material and engages the reader. It established a sense of dialogue with the reader.While reading Joyce Crick's translation the author of the review remembered her first encounter with Freud's original German version Die Traumdeutung while she was an undergraduate student. The German version was definitely much more difficult to read and caused some confusion for the reader. The author valued Freud's elaboration on the symbols of dreams, but viewed the statement that all psychopathic phenomena derive from the suppression of sexual desires as difficult to comprehend (for an undergraduate student). However when comparing The Interpretation of Dreams with Freud's discussion of dreams in his work Introductory Lectures on Psychoanalysis it has to be pointed out that the latter is probably an easier way of gaining insight into his views about dreams. Dreams are covered in Part II of the Introductory Lectures on Psychoanalysis, which Freud delivered in two successive winter terms (running from October to March) in 1915-16 and 1916-17 at the University of Vienna. The new translation is targeted at the psychoanalytically minded postgraduate student or psychiatric registrar who had previous exposure and an understanding of basic concepts such as the preconscious, unconscious and conscious as well as the id, ego and superego. However some explanation about these concepts is provided at the end of the book.Freud's work on dreaming has recently regained interest because among many other opportunities, the ability to conduct studies in sleep laboratories and the neuropsychological assessment of brain-injured patients has assisted us in finding some scientific evidence for some of his theories. Neuroscience has proven that dreaming can be switched on or off by a neurochemical pathway whose main function is to &quot;instigate goal-seeking behaviors and an organism's appetitive interaction with the world&quot; (Panksepp, 1985, p. 273). This means that neuroscience has contributed to the evidence of a radical hypothesis that is more than 100 years old (i.e. that dreams are motivated phenomena, driven by our wishes and the dopamigergic mechanisms, the appetitive (i.e. libidinal) 'command system' of the brain (Panksepp, 1985, 1998)). The Interpretation of Dreams edited by Ritchie Robertson is meeting the challenge for psychoanalysis to refresh Freudian theory, &quot;which now has an unpalatable and distinctly post-Victorian flavor for many&quot; (Panksepp, 1999, p.35). It assists in moving psychoanalysis towards a modern and dynamic mode of thought that continues to be rejuvenated by the accumulating evidence in neuroscience, thus consolidating its presence in the twenty-first century.References Freud, S.

In it Freud undermines the picture of mankind as primarily a being of reason, and presents the idea that we are all creatures of our wishes, our inner unconscious lives. Dreams are not nothing, and they are not in Freud's eyes rare religious gifts, but rather to the key to our own mental life. Freud in this book presents a vast world of examples and interpretations .I am not a psychologist and do not consider myself competent to really judge how much of what Freud presents here is valid or even capable of scientific testing. I do know that this work is one which like a great literary masterpiece has inspired countless interpretations and reinterpretations.Understanding human Intellectual History is now impossible without knowing this work."},{"Title":"The interpretation of dreams","review":"Freud may or may not have been a creative genius. Whatever else he was, however, he was enormously clever and remarkably well informed, with access to an astonishingly broad and diverse range of references. Moreover, he had an uncanny ability to pluck as needed from his well-stocked head a suitable allusion, concept, image, or idea to make whatever point he wanted to make. He was a prodigiously skillful ethnographer of the psyche, an activity that included the interpretation of dreams.Freud worked as one steeped in classical scholarship and also thoroughly knowledgeable in the science and practice of the medicine of his time. The latter body of knowledge included more scholarly material and sustained research concerning mental illness than many of us realize. Freud, moreover, was a capable practitioner who brought relief and even recovery to those suffering from a variety of neurotic symptoms, or so he reports, and I see no reason to doubt him, though he does seem unwaveringly committed to the notion that he's always right, a characteristic that might diminish his effectiveness just a bit.Nevertheless, I found The Interpretation of Dreams to be very disappointing. This may be due to the fact that my previous knowledge of Freud was limited to textbook accounts, which are often unreliable and seldom capable of capturing the genuinely brilliant insights of world-class scientists and scholars. Perhaps I was unprepared to appreciate Freud in anything stronger than a textbook distillation.I think, however, that there is a more serious problem, one that is intrinsic to Freud's work and pervasive in mainstream social and behavioral science even today. Freud was a functionalist. In this instance that means that once he concluded that all dreams were instances of wish-fulfillment, he unduly constrained his interpretations, and he made excruciatingly heavy demands on his interpretative powers. Otherwise, he wouldn't have been able to maintain the claim that all dreams functioned to serve this one end.By way of analogy, imagine that Freud was a contemporary ethnographer interested in the way schools work rather than what dreams mean. Imagine further that he proceeds from the assumption that all schools are organized in a merit-based way, producing young people who have been selected, sorted, educated, and allocated in accordance with their innate intelligence. There would be no surprise, then, when observing an elementary school classroom, his practiced eye and fine-tuned ear affirmed that assignment to ability groups was indeed made according to what Freud took to be intelligence. His meritocratic assumption seems correct.However, suppose another observer of the same classroom noted that there was also a very close connection between family income and ability group placement. This might be construed as suggesting that money brings advantages that may make affluent students seem smarter than they are, while the intelligence of students from families with little money is masked. Just like that, Freud's assumption that elementary schools function in a merit-based way is faced with a plausible alternative.At this point, Freud can either acknowledge that his functionalist deductions may have been wrong, or he can creatively argue that income is a good proxy for intelligence, say after the fashion of Herrnstein and Murray in their much celebrated and much maligned book The Bell Curve. Eventually, moreover, Freud will be forced to do the same kind of intellectual contortions with regard to race, gender, number of parents in the home, ethnicity, region of the country, urban or rural residence, and a whole host of other factors that are confounded with merit in the form of innate ability. Why should these seemingly extraneous factors serve as disguised indicators of brain power? Exactly the sort of conundrum that mainstream sociologists of education and educational psychologists find themselves facing today.Given Freud's demonstrated ability to come up with a seemingly endless collection of self-serving interpretations, however strained, stretched, and willfully contrived they may have been, he'd probably do quite well. The fact remains, however, that once he makes an all-embracing assumption -- that dreams function as wish-fulfillment, that schools function as meritocracies, that religion functions to assure social solidarity, ... -- he has boxed himself in. His interpretations have to serve the function he has assigned them. If his assumption was correct, it's all to the good, narrowing the scope of material with which he must deal. If he was wrong, however, he's in trouble.I found many of Freud's dream interpretations tortured, twisted, convoluted, wildly implausible, and unregulated in any way as to what constitutes suitable evidence. If Freud had been less clever and his cultivated intelligence had been less well stocked with variegated substance from every domain of knowledge imaginable, I think he would have been forced to concede that he was wrong. But Freud made what I take to be an erroneous assumption and then outsmarted himself, giving incorrect interpretations to dreams because of his initial dubious assumption as to the function of wish-fulfillment.Freud is to be commended for introducing extremely interesting and useful concepts such as censoring, resistance, over-determination, condensation, displacement, and dream work, and for helping us understand how these notions mediate the connections between the manifest and latent content of dreams. His bottomless grab bag of obscure references, abetted by his too-often stream-of-consciousness writing style, enabled him to make a case that all dreams function as wish-fulfillment. The case was often very weak, however, and his technique was inconsistent, sometimes using the dreams of psycho-neurotics and other times discounting them as aberrant. Truth be told, Freud's method of dream interpretation was constrained only by his unbridled functionalist cleverness.Yes, some dreams may function as wish-fulfillment, but it seems abundantly clear that many do not. Why Freud tied his brilliance to this dubious assumption escapes me. In any case, I give him credit for stubborn determination and boundless ingenuity."},{"Title":"The interpretation of dreams","review":"Amazon and Pink Panda should both be ashamed of this 99 cent \\"edition\\", though in fairness, I suppose you get what you pay for, and I more or less assume the text is complete.

Don't; go here instead:The Interpretation of Dreams: The Complete and Definitive Text"},{"Title":"The interpretation of dreams","review":"Freud was one of the first, and one of the most brilliant, psychologists to attempt a \`scientific' study of the mind. Freud attempted to explain and understand the dynamics of the psyche, not through mere casual observation or personal introspection, but through clinical experience. There are many scientists and philosophers, Karl Popper being the most famous, who have attacked Freud for being \`unscientific' in method and for failing the test of falsifiability in his conclusions.It must be admitted that any attempt to study the mind using the methods of objective science is going to run into some serious epistemological hurdles; hurdles that still have not been entirely overcome to this day. These epistemological questions are important questions and should be taken seriously. But in my opinion the people who are busy picking apart Freud's theories to see whether they are \`scientific', or whether they measure up to some preconceived notion of what a scientific theory should be, are asking the wrong questions. The question that should be asked is: have Freud's theories and writings increased our understanding of the nature and the dynamics of the human mind? The obvious answer to that question, in my opinion, is yes.The Interpretation of Dreams is Freud's attempt to understand the nature and dynamics of dreaming. We all take for granted the fact that we dream, but few of us ever truly begin to wonder at how strange a fact that is; and even of those of us who do only a few will go on and attempt to understand why we dream in any serious way. There were people who attempted to understand dreaming before Freud but Freud has come to tower above them in the same way that Adam Smith has come to tower above all the economists who came before him and probably for good reason.Freud puts forward some fairly counter-intuitive thesis in regard to dreaming. The first is that all dreaming is wish-fulfillment. This is the kind of claim that seems to fly in the face of empirical evidence, as well as our everyday understanding of the nature of dreams. I am not going to attempt to enter the debate in regard to whether Freud was right in this conclusion but it should be pointed out that this was a conclusion Freud was led to in his clinical experience, and the obvious objections to this theory (the existence of anxiety dreams for instance) were objections that Freud was well aware of and Freud deals with them directly in this book.The real meat of the book, in my opinion, is Freud's attempt to analyze the psychological processes that give rise to dreams. The fact that Freud begins with a counter-intuitive hypothesis, namely, that all dreams are wish-fulfillments, requires him to undertake the task of explaining how (and why) these wishes take the form of dreams as we know them. Dreams certainly do not appear to us to be wish-fulfillments. Freud has to explain why dreams do not appear on the surface to be wish-fulfillments and this requires him to work out a theory of psychic functioning which will adequately explain how dreams are formed.This ultimately is the reason why I say that Freud was one of the first to attempt a scientific study of the mind whether his theories measure up to the philosopher of science's standards or not. Freud's method is entirely different from the person who simply attempts to describe the nature of dreams by describing their pictorial form, their logical incongruities, etc. Freud puts forward an hypothesis and this hypothesis leads him to some new and startling conclusions about psychic functioning which would not be immediately obvious to a person merely engaged in casual introspection.In order to explain the form dreams take Freud first makes a distinction between the manifest and latent content of a dream. This is probably the central notion behind the whole book, and the reason, in Freud's opinion, that no one had succeeded in understanding dreams before him was because no one was able to make this distinction. Attempts to understand dreams before Freud focused all of their attention on a dream's manifest content. The latent content of a dream can only be discovered in the analytic situation by allowing the patient to free-associate in regard to different elements of the dream. Through this method one is able to discover the latent thoughts behind the creation of the dream.The dream is formed by a number of processes operating on these latent thoughts. One of the processes is condensation in which elements from the dream-thoughts are combined and condensed into a single manifest content. Another process is that of displacement in which psychic values are transferred between contents. The dream also has to deal with the problem of representability which Freud deals with extensively.There are a number of aspects of Freud's work which seem slightly primitive when reading him today. Freud was well aware that he was heading out into new territory and that many of his theories would have to be revised in the future as we learned more. But a person can still learn a great deal about the functioning of the psyche from reading this book, and not just about the formation of dreams. Freud's theory of dreams (as well as his theories on neurosis which are not dealt with directly in this book) required Freud to re-evaluate the nature of the human mind. He presents a new schematic of the mind and how it functions in the final chapter of the book. While some of this does seem slightly primitive today it cannot be denied that Freud's theories have profoundly altered our understanding of what it means to be human. No one who is interested in that question should skip this book (or Freud's other works)."},{"Title":"The interpretation of dreams","review":"Freud believed that every dream would reveal itself as a psychological structure, full of latent significance, often beyond the accessibility of normal consciousness. It was in fact belief in this assumption about a hidden psychological structure that eventually led to the discovery of the unconscious and to the later mapping of the architecture of the mind.The discovery of the unconscious had monumental ripples across the intellectual landscape, especially in psychology and the aesthetic arts. It opened the gateways to the complexity of the mind and made it respectable to speak of the mind's hidden dimensions and their effects on both normal and abnormal psychological functioning.Here using subjects, with now famous pseudonyms, Feud describes how their \\"dream-content,\\" and the overt images of their dreams are in fact but the coded residue of latent thoughts and unresolved subconscious processing: Indeed, how they are little more than symbolic representations of deeply hidden ideas, feeling, and conflicts in these cases mostly of a sexual nature that have been unconsciously repressed, compressed, or suppressed beneath consciousness.The book demonstrates how dream content is deciphered under proper psychoanalytic techniques and conditions, and what those techniques and conditions should be. When the techniques are applied properly, the blocked content is gradually recovered, examined and made manifest to the patient under clinical control. The goal of the analysis is to allow this \\"recovery process\\" and the exposure to the patient of the blocked items - that is exposure to \\"what lies beneath consciousness\\" -- to give the patient relief from psychological stress, tension, and conflicts.Although many of Freud's theories have since come under careful scrutiny and sometimes withering criticism, \\"The Interpretation of Dreams\\" has remained one of his more enduing of his works.

He wrote the following:&quot;Now I have finished and am thinking about the dream book again. I have been looking into the literature and feel like a Celtic imp.&quot;Oh, how I am glad that no one, no one knows...&quot; No one suspects that the dream is not nonsense but wish fulfillment.&quot;Indeed, this is the premise of Freud's entire thesis: dreams are no more than repressed unconscious wishes, battling for expression and consummation.In his own words, Freud had 'dared' to rally against the 'objections of severe science, to take the part of the ancients and of superstition.' In 1900, the official year of the book's publication, its reception, despite its provoctive title, was tepid, and in the course of six years, only sold 351 copies. Freud never gave up hope, and 30 years later, in the preface of the third English edition, he wrote, &quot;It contains, even according to my present day judgement, the most valuable of all the discoveries it has been my good fortune to make. Insight such as this falls to one's lot but once a lifetime.' In present day, one can question any Freud scholar about ~The Interpretation of Dreams~ and they will say the same thing: the book contains everything that 'is' psychoanalysis.Anyone interested in the history of psychoanalysis and the mind of Sigmund Freud, reading this book is an absolute must. The reading runs along too, quite easily, as Freud was an excellent writer: his unique prose style even shines through some clumsy translations.If you are interested in the book's process of development, I would suggest reading ~The Complete Letters of Sigmund Freud and Wilhelm Fliess~; another gold mine for understanding the growth of psychoanalysis."},{"Title":"The interpretation of dreams","review":"Though the content of the text met expectations (it's a fairly canonical text), the binding on this book was terrible.

Certainly he'd never have argued that because a patient's stomach hurt during a painful recital of an early memory, this indigestible piece of emotional trauma was &quot;caused&quot; by the gastronomic rejection of a burnt piece of toast eaten just before the session. OF COURSE psychical activity has a physical substrate. And, perhaps, vice versa. What he'd have wanted to know was: in what psychological situation was all this embedded?One can't help but admire the boldness and honesty with which Freud presented his own dreams and associations. We might speculate in hindsight that Irma, the partially cured patient whom Freud tried to talk out of her hysteria, showed up in his dream with throat and stomach symptoms and an illness caused by a bad injection to protest the way he injected women with his sex-etiology theories, thereby in effect silencing their true voice; and smile at Freud's dream of an orator named Lecher, a dream he had shortly after accepting a position in which he did a lot of public speaking about psychology.But that we can speculate thus we owe largely to the techniques inspired by Freud himself.

But, his wish fulfillment theory of dreams is definitely wrong both concerning its origin and its consequences, as explained below.Freud began to interpret his patients' spontaneously reported dreams by likening them to daydreams and psychotic hallucinations. Everyone knows that daydreams are produced for fulfilling wishes in an imaginary way, and psychologists know that most psychotic hallucinations constitute imaginary fulfillments of wishes frustrated in the waking state. But, likening waking-state products to sleep-state products does not look realistic, because the waking state is a time for fulfilling wishes, whereas the sleep state is known to realize resting and self-restoration rather than realizing new successes and gains. So, Freud's first step in dream interpretation was most probably wrong.Nevertheless Freud became convinced that dreams meant wish fulfillments because of two dreams that he misinterpreted, as explained below.Pepi's dream: Medical student Pepi H. was late to wake up one morning, and the landlady called through the door: \\"Wake up, Herr Pepi! It's time to go to the hospital!\\" He dreamed that he was lying in bed in a room in the hospital, and there was a card over the bed on which was written: \\"Pepi H., medical student, age 22.\\" He went on sleeping, thinking that he was already in the hospital.It is evident that Pepi had, in the disabling state of half-sleep, the incompatible wishes of staying in bed and going to the hospital. Both of these wishes were fulfilled by the image of him in bed in the hospital. This cannot be considered a true dream because of several reasons: (1) Pepi was in a state between sleep and wakefulness; (2) both of his wishes belonged to the waking state instead of being activated in the sleep state; (3) his two wishes frustrated each other; and (4) therefore the image of him in bed in the hospital, which fulfilled both of his wishes in an imaginary way, looks more like a psychotic hallucination than a true dream.On the other hand, the image of the card on the bed, which was apparently produced after he fell asleep, can be considered a true dream element seeking to terminate the failure to go to the hospital by conveying the following message: \\"You are not a patient, and you are not a child; you are a medical student of age 22! So, get up and do what you have to do!\\" The last part of this message was only implied.We see that, after baselessly likening dreams to psychotic hallucinations, Freud had the bad luck of encountering a mental product that was half hallucination and half dream and took it for a true dream. Below is a dream that is similar to Pepi's dream.A man who had been driving all night was desperately trying to stay awake and to keep the car on the road, or rather to keep the road in front of the car, as he later remembered. The car jolted twice with no apparent reason, and he woke up in a cornfield. We understand that the image of the road in front of the car had become a hallucination caused by the wish and the failure to keep the road in front of the car in the disabling state of half-sleep. It is also possible that this hallucination was then replaced by a \\"sleep-preserving\\" dream when sleep prevailed. Thus, a hallucination was produced in the state of half-sleep and was then transformed into a dream when sleep took over, just like it happened to Pepi.Freud's dream \\"Irma's injection\\" (Freud 1900). This dream of Freud's about a hysterical patient of his gave to him the final conviction that dreams meant wish fulfillments. He had it 9 months before he delivered his lecture The Etiology of Hysteria, in which he exposed his seduction theory of hysteria, according to which this disorder is caused by sexual abuse suffered in childhood. This means that the thoughts expressed in this dream were produced in conformity with the seduction theory. But when he published the interpretation of this dream in his book on dreams, he had already switched to the fantasy theory of hysteria, which said that this disorder was caused by repressed unacceptable fantasies, or wishes, of sexual nature. Thus, the dream's thoughts were based on the seduction theory of hysteria, whereas its interpretation presented by Feud in his book was based on the fantasy theory. But despite this discrepancy, Freud produced an interpretation that is correct to a great extent. He misinterpreted only the part of the dream that explained the cause of hysteria and the part that said that hysteria was incurable, as shown below.The dream is about Freud's failure to cure his patient Irma. Many psychologists believe that Irma represented Freud's patient Emma Eckstein and others like her, whom he had failed to cure. Freud recognized correctly the subject of the dream as the presentation of several causes of his failure to cure Irma. For example, Irma did not cooperate with Freud and did not believe his interpretations, which must have been based on the seduction theory, and physicians ignorant of hysteria influenced the therapy negatively. Freud interpreted these parts of the dream correctly, including even the part that accused Freud of believing a physician's wrong diagnosis without examining the patient himself. He had to say, \\"the material was, one might say, impartial.\\" We can say that the dream expressed the truth, as it was known to the dreamer, as Jung believed. The accusations directed to the physicians were realistic external attributions of Freud's failure. Freud interpreted them as \\"revenge on other doctors\\" and \\"derision of physicians who are ignorant of hysteria.\\" The dream accused physicians of ignoring that hysteria was caused by sexual abuse, as explained below, whereas Freud implied that they ignored its cause explained by the fantasy theory.The dream explained the cause of her illness as sexual violation and declared that it was incurable because it was impossible to undo the violation. This is the part that Freud misinterpreted, knowingly or by mistake, which in reality carried the following message: \\"Physicians thought that hysteria could be cured by physical, physiological intervention, but this is absurd, because hysteria is caused by sexual violation which cannot be undone. You all directly know that your colleague who was staying with her gave her an injection. Injections of that sort should not be made so thoughtlessly. That was a dirty injection, and you know very well what it was.\\" The negative idea that hysteria could not be cured by physical/physiological intervention is expressed in the dream through an absurdity (this being one of the means of expressing negative ideas in dreams): Someone suggested in the dream that dysentery would intervene and Irma would be cured. This absurd thought exposed the physicians' ignorance, but also the fact that sexual violation could not be undone and therefore hysteria could not be cured. This dream shows clearly why Freud chose to lie about the cause of hysteria and switched from the seduction theory to the fantasy theory of it. Evidently, he had thought that the only means of curing hysterical patients was to deny that the sexual abuse had happened. That was the only means of \\"undoing\\" the abuse which was said by his dream to be impossible.Freud's overall interpretation of the dream was that it \\"represented a particular state of affairs as I should have wished it to be. Thus its content was the fulfillment of a wish and its motive was a wish.\\" So, Freud became convinced that dreams meant wish fulfillments by summarizing the meaning of Irma's dream taking into consideration only what he liked in the dream and ignoring, for example, the accusations directed to him by the dream and the fact the dream said that the real cause of hysteria was being sexually abused.Freud's final belief about the meaning of dreams is this: \\"A dream is a (disguised) fulfillment of a (suppressed or repressed) wish.\\"One of the arguments that Freud used to support his wish fulfillment theory was that the mind could do nothing but fulfilling wishes, and because realistic wish fulfillment was impossible during the sleep state, it was done in the form of perception. This argument is obviously wrong, because the mind does plenty of preparatory work before it can actually fulfill a wish, and much of such work can be non-pleasurable. Ignoring these facts, Freud interpreted everything in a dream as an actual wish fulfillment, as exemplified by his misinterpretation of his Irma dream, which presented, for example, several non-pleasurable causes of his failure to cure Irma. I have shown elsewhere that a complete dream contains three types of thought (expressed in Freud's terminology): the frustration of a wish, the causes of the frustration, and the means of fulfilling it. Irma dream was about Freud's failure to cure her but did not present a means of fulfilling it and said instead that curing her was impossible, this being his honest opinion.Freud's idea of the disguised fulfillment of suppressed or repressed wishes had one more source. He wrote in his letter of January 3, 1899 to Fliess: \\"I now understand why in spite of all my efforts I have not yet finished the dream book . . . . I shall be able to present the psychic process in dreams in such a way that it also includes the process in the formation of hysterical symptoms.\\" How Freud \\"discovered\\" that psychic process is explained below.Freud's friend Fliess claimed that hysteria could be cured by a surgical operation performed on the nose of the patient. Freud believed him, and Fliess performed an operation on Emma's nose on February 20, 1895. On March 6, 1895, a second operation was performed by another friend of Freud, and half-a-meter of gauze was removed from Emma's nose. The gauze had been accidentally left in by Fliess and had caused excessive bleeding that had nearly killed her. Nose-bleeding continued even after the second operation and was probably a consequence of the two operations. But Freud wrote to Fliess about Emma on May 4, 1896: \\"She became restless during the night because of an unconscious wish to entice me to go there, and since I did not come, she renewed the bleeding, as an unfailing means of rearousing my affection.\\" And he wrote to him on February 19, 1899: \\"It is not only dreams that are fulfillments of wishes, but hysterical attacks as well. This is true of hysterical symptoms, but it probably applies to every product of neurosis.\\"We see that Freud's wish fulfillment theory of dreams and symptoms was a consequence of baseless generalizations, misinterpretations of some dreams, invalid arguments, and the wrong and wishful interpretation of a physiological phenomenon. Thus, Freud's theory is untenable as far as its origin is concerned. It is equally without proof concerning its consequences, as explained below.Freud believed that every event that a dreamer could associate with the images of his or her dream in the waking state was part of the meaning of the dream. And he interpreted all that material as wish fulfillment by using devices such as displacement, inversion, and other types of disguising to make the dream fit his theory. It is evident that any event can be interpreted in any way one wishes by using such devices. Even this procedure shows that Fred's theory is wrong.Freud's theory is refuted also by the difficulty he experienced in explaining the emergence of anxiety in dreams and his total failure to interpret the so-called \\"incest dreams.\\" He wrote in a footnote added to a later edition of his book on dreams that anxiety was experienced in dreams by consciousness when an unacceptable wish was fulfilled without being sufficiently disguised. But if this were true, \\"incest dreams\\" interpreted as wish fulfillments would be dreams of highest anxiety, which is not the case. They are found revolting in the waking state by being interpreted wrongly as wish fulfillments. I explained elsewhere that \\"incest dreams\\" mean that sex partners must intimately know, love, and respect each other. The wish fulfillment theory has not been useful in psychotherapy either.However, to repeat, Freud's book must be read by anyone who studies dreams, because it contains about 220 dreams and valuable information about the dreamers' life experiences related to their dreams. The book also contains some of Freud's own dreams, of which the correct interpretations tell much about his life experiences and the true geneses of his theories. Moreover, the book exposes the importance of unconscious thinking, although Freud misinterpreted the contents of the unconscious and the aims of its products, as I further explained elsewhere.Cognitive-Behavioral Cybernetics of Symptoms, Dreams, Lateralization: Theory, Interpretation, TherapyTheory Construction and Testing in Physics and Psychology"},{"Title":"The interpretation of dreams","review":"The science of interpretting the hidden meaning of one's dreams is the key to unlocking the door to our unconscious psychic life.

These wants and desires are otherwise hidden and suppressed by our conscious mind because of our moral and social inhibitions and tensions. In fact, Sigmund Freud theories invented a whole new branch of treatment for neurosis.

He suggested many revoluntionary theories, and the later theories he developed were fundamented on that . One of the most significant book of Freud, I can say.It deals with very normal but very difficult question: what is mind? Do we have completely control of our actions? Do we really know ourself? Then, it touches a philosophy problem: if we can't even control our actions, are we still responsible for every crime we commit? Is capital punishment correct? And then, if nobody actually has free-will, does what the heck is God doing on us? Does God exist? And it questions every piece of moral value of ours.As a philosophy student, I want to tell everybody that this book is as important as reading Bible if you have any certain desire of knowing what life is, and you are trying to figure out the true meaning of life, just like me, then you must read the book.

This books is no light reading, even for those accustomed to reading serious books. Freud's style presents no difficulties, but moral courage is needed. Nevertheless for those courageous enough there is also enormous entertainment here. Personally I find it extremely difficult to read it often. It's too dense and challenging. And much of it is also deeply flawed because the author was overly confident. Despite all this, this may well be the greatest book of the 20th century, and those who want to take the challenge ought to try it. My pragmatic advice is to skip the first chapter, which is a rather dated review of literature."},{"Title":"The interpretation of dreams","review":"Most reviewers see the value of this great work, which lays out the dynamics of the unconscious mind. Others have a variety of misconceptions: first, he was not a cocaine addict. He misunderstood cocaine [as most people did] and, briefly, recommended it to others, including his fiancee. When his close friend died of it, Freud realized his error.Second, one reader states that you can't find &quot;measurements&quot; to prove anything about dreams. As one who has practiced in the field, I can say that the reader can measure the truth of Freud's theory by using it to understand him or herself, by analyzing one's own dreams.The dynamics of dreams are:first, dreams are phylogenetic, i.e., inherited as a species; they are not ontogenetic, i.e., created by environmental factors.R.E.M. studies have shown for fifty years that our eyes move rapidly while dreaming as is we were watching a film. However, all of the people in a dream are different fragments of ourselves, of our wishes, of our interests.Second: this phylogenetic inheritance includes an innate propensity to think in pictures. Moving up the scale of consciousness, in Ucs. [unconsciousness, thinking is mostly pictorial but sometimes verbal]; in Pcs. [preconsciousness, i.e., in daydreaming, thinking is pictorial and verbal and partly in our control]; in Cs. [consciousness, thinking is mostly verbal but partly pictorial].Dreams have two main dynamics: one, displacement [in which the mind protects itself by displacing the troubling thought with a symbol]; two, condensation [in which the mind places symbols on top of one another in layers in order to make the troubling thought hard to find].Schizophrenics are hard to understand because much of their thinking is dominated by displacement and condensation while they are awake. Their speech has numerous layers of symbols - condensation.In displacement, there is a manifest meaning [that which appears evident] and a latent meaning [that which one has to dig for by piercing the condensation of the displacements.Any thinker, who chooses to simply understand, should avoid preconceptions or anger or a need to disdain or to repress. He or she should merely use the dynamics of dreaming to unravel his or her own dreams and daydreams [which can be analyzed with the same dynamics, except it is much easier because condensation is not as severe].Freud was originally sceptical of his own insights and, as a result, he sat on this work for about a year, being reluctant to believe himself. He finally realized he was being defensive, that he was trying to repress disturbing truths about himself that were also true of us as a species.In analysis, the analyst doesn't speak much because the best person in a position to understand himself is the patient . . . just as the best person in a position to understand his/her dream is the dreamer. Further, an analyst doesn't talk because he wants the patient to speak until he/she finally understands him/herself. That takes time.It takes time for a person to crack the layers of condensation in his/her own thinking and to see all of the displacements.After 100 years, Freud's book remains one of the great gifts anyone ever gave men and women to understand themselves."},{"Title":"The interpretation of dreams","review":"This is the book that started the revolution in our view of human psychology: it uncovered the (always disputed) existence of the unconscious mind as well as created an entirely new mode of thinking about the human psyche.Strangely enough, it is also a fun and very informative read: there are great case studies of patients, charming autobiographical asides, and a rigorous snapshot of the science of dreams at the time. It is also beautifully written: ironically, though never the recipient of the Nobel prize, Freud did win the Goethe prize in Germany for his writing style. As Walter Kaufman said so eloquently, with his rich ironies and attention to the individual, Freud offered a way to reintroduce poetry into science.Certainly, much of what Freud thought is now disputed and discredited. Like Copernicus, whose model of our solar system failed in many respects, Freud also made fundamental errors, in particular his notorious over-emphasis of sexuality and the phallus. But we do not blame Copernicus for not seeing what Kepler, Newton, and later Einstein discovered: we value him as a step towards the unknown, as a pioneer, however timid. Freud will come to be seen the same way, as the discoverer of the unconscious mind.Warmly recommended."},{"Title":"The interpretation of dreams","review":"Freud's thesis, The Interpretation of Dreams, can be summed up as follows - all dreams are the mind's subconscious effort at wish fulfillment. For some dreams this is obvious - if you eat salty foods before going to bed, you may then dream that you are drinking water. This is a simple example of you wanting something and your subconscious trying to fulfill that wish. For most dreams, quite a bit more analysis is required to undercover what exactly you are wishing for, and Freud dedicates the bulk of his book to giving examples of such analysis. Freud argues that dreams are distorted because the upper layer of the mind is trying to censor what the lower layers of the mind are wishing for - usually out of embarrassment, guilt, etc. For example, I may be envious of my friend's success, so I will dream that my friend fails, but I am also embarrassed at wishing ill will on my friend, so the dream is distorted - perhaps the activity that he fails at will be obscure, twisted, strange, etc. Freud also makes the point that all dreams have their trigger in the preceding day's events, and once triggered the dream has access to all the experiences a person has gathered during his lifetime, as long as the experiences can be linked back somehow to the trigger event. Since the mind thinks in terms of symbols, the dreams must by analyzed by trying to understand how the various symbols can be translated into wishes, or the suppression of wishes. Thus the inner layers of the mind, or the Ego (prime desires), will generate a basic wish based on the experiences of the previous day. The Super Ego (refined sense of culture, guilt, morality, consciousness, etc.) then regulates the Ego's basic wish to fit within the mind's framework of right and wrong behavior. The greater the conflict between the Ego and Super Ego, the more distorted the dream becomes. All dreams are wish fulfillment, without exception.Freud successfully makes his point within the first 75 pages of the book - the remaining 400 pages are a dry, archaic, tiresome, and in my opinion are not worth the time to read. Much of the book is dedicated to analysis of the dreams of either Freud or Freud's patients. Since Freud lived in early twentieth century Germany, the dreams described are anachronisms and for the most part are irrelevant. Also, I think a lot of meaning is lost in the translation from German to English.Bottom line, Freud successfully explains the fundamental truth on dreams, put this pioneering analysis is archaic and difficult to read by today's standards. For the layman, I would look for something more current."},{"Title":"The interpretation of dreams","review":"This book changed my life in a profound way. Freud taught me that everything is connected. He used dreams to illustrate this. During the few weeks I was reading this book, I began looking at everything around me as possibly symbolic and/or connected. It is amazing what is available when you are receptive to this information. Freud can teach you to see the meaning in your dreams, but these lessons apply to all of life.Freud also has such a disarming way of writing that I felt as if I knew the man as a friend once I was done reading."},{"Title":"The interpretation of dreams","review":"Easy to read and perfectly inteligible for the averagenon-professional reader like me. This is the most important book written by Sigmund Freud and is in the Freudian tradition of writting some books which focus on difficult issues with a rather simple to understand language and fine style. The purpose of the author, in his own words, was to disturb the sleep of mankind.This is the kind of book that will help you a lot in understand the mechanisms behind one's dreams and all the relationship between what Freud calls your \\"waking life\\" and your \\"dream-life\\". Before going on interpreting a lot of his and his patients dreams, something that took a lot of personal sacrifice to someone so jealous of his private life as Freud, the author introduces us to the then (1899) accepted theories of dreams, which basically took the dreams as irrational and confuse manifstations that didn't have nothing to do with our real or waking life.The rationale Freud uses to demolish the anti-Freudian myths is powerful and convincing and he even suggests that reading the book will have some effect on our immediate dream life (it happened to me). Despite quite voluminous (700 pages) it deservs the attention and the effort of all of us who want to understand what dreams are all about. Here also, one reads the first paragraphs Freuds devotes to the Oedipus complex, and one has the opportunity to explore along with Freud the mechanisms of the UCS (unconscious) and of our Conscious activities, which some decades latter would lead to the concepts of Ego, Super-Ego and Id.As a trademark the text is always polemical, remembering this same quality one faces in Marxists texts."},{"Title":"The interpretation of dreams","review":"Although Freud's ideas and psychoanalytic theory haven't fared that well in recent decades (Jung's views and reputation have actually done much better), there is no doubt that Freud's ideas were a major contribution to the understanding of human behavior and the mind and remain at least historically important today. Although perhaps superceded by the cognitive and neurobiological approaches that have developed in the last few decades, Freud was still a brilliant thinker who changed our undestanding of the mind for the better.For example, although his idea of the ego, super-ego, and id are now being supplanted by more physiological explanations (the limbic system of the brain being a very good analog to the id), nevertheless, basically what Freud was saying was that a shaping process goes on during early childhood that results in the formation of relatively enduring personality characteristics. There is no doubt that this developmental idea still has validity to this very day.However, while I certainly respect and admire many of the early psychologists, and they were great pioneers in many ways, and some of their ideas are still important, nevertheless, a lot of what they said has to be taken now with a considerable grain of salt, and the area of dream interpretation is one them. It doesn't mean that dreams are completely valueless, but they're of much less significance than has been claimed in the past. The most serious critique of the psycholanalytic (and others) view of dreams comes from recent research into the brain and neurobiology. The problem is that dreams are really not what people think at all most of the time--which is some sort of cyptic but profound message from the unconscious mind.For example, consider the question of why most dreams seem to consist of collections or sequences of difficult to interpret images, thoughts, and memories that seem to be combined or strung together in a not very logical and difficult to interpret fashion. The reason why, contrary to the popular belief that this reflects some profound and not easily discernible meaning, is that the order really is almost random, or is governed by very weak associational processes. The reason why this is, and why most dreams seem so puzzling and difficult to understand is that when you go to sleep, the memory areas of the brain located in the temporal cortex become more active through a process known as corticocipedal disinhibition, allowing memories, images, and thoughts to flood into consciousness willy-nilly. This is prevented or inhibited during normal waking, otherwise the flood of thoughts and images would interfere with normal memory retrieval and thinking processes.This is a little off the subject, but one area of pseudo or quasi-scientific theory and speculation that has been getting a lot of attention lately (and shows how much more sophisticated the more fantastically oriented or perhaps \\"mystically\\" oriented types in psychology are getting) is the idea that the brain is a \\"quantum computer\\" and uses quantum mechanical and even multi-dimensional spatial capabilities to do its work. At least one world-famous physicist and mathematician, Roger Penrose, has suggested it himself. (I critique Penrose's proposal on this in my Amazon review of his book, The Large, The Small, and the Human Brain).However, although a fascinating idea, there is still no real evidence that this is in fact the case. Neurobiologists have drawn analogies between devices like SQIDs (super-conducting quantum interference devices) and nerve cells, but this is reaching a bit.One main problem for me would be the noise factor. There is already a huge amount of random noise in the firings of nerves in the human brain and quantum mechanisms are far below the level of this noise. The brain seems to ignore the high noise level just fine and to operate pretty well despite it and so I don't see how quantum effects which would be far more subtle would have much of an effect.The other main problem is that the brain typically shows a huge amount of integration and convergence in its mechanisms, and phenomena at the level of quantum effects would probably just get lost in the overall convergence process or even the resting level of noise. Another way to think about it is how likely quantum effects are to manifest themselves at the molecular level, let alone the cellular level or the level of a neural circuit or the entire brain.So until there's some real evidence, I remain sceptical, and this is probably another \\"mystical\\" idea that will probably go the way of all the others.But anyway, getting back to the present book, that little digression was really by way of pointing out that unscientific speculation has been rife in psychology from its birth in the mid-19th century with thinkers such as Rudolph Lotze, Paul Brentano, Wilhelm Wundt, Johann Fechner, Hartmann and the Scottish faculty psychologists, Janet, Freud and the other psychoanalytic theorists, and many others. It's just getting harder for the layman to recognize this sort of thing when he sees it since their ideas are more and more taking on the language of physics and engineering and neurobiology. But that doesn't mean it's not the same old unfounded speculation and mystical nonsense."},{"Title":"The interpretation of dreams","review":"I just got my 2007 edition copy of \\"Interpretation of Dreams\\" in the mail so I haven't had a chance to read it.

She gives an insightful introduction to Freud that is well referenced. However, her style is absolutely monotonous and was far more difficult to complete than Freud's writing which was to follow. What Crick has done well with this version is that she has retained certain significant or vague tests in German (original) with their translations as parentheses, footnotes, or explantory notes. She has also added value to the version with an extensive package of explanatory notes after Freud's work. In addition, her translation of Freud's work \\"captures the lightness and pace of Freud's style, freed from the jargon and Victorian elaborations of James Strachey's famous version.\\"On Freud's work itself, The Interpretation of Dreams was a revoluationary paper of its time, discussing for the first time, concepts such as the Oedipus complex and the practice of psychoanalysis. Freud explores his personal life with this paper, enriching the reader with his self-analyses. However, I felt he over did the case studies, presenting several examples of a single concept, which was for me perhaps a little long-winded and tiring to read, especially if his first examples were good ones, and presented the concept/s acutely.The pace of the paper picks up at the start of each new concept and tends to wind down and even drag at the middle or end portions. Towards the end however, his pace dramatically picks up (and no, it's not a placebo effect), as he summarises and pulls all his concepts together in an attempt to hold on to the reader and deliver his final call to action. Overall this is an outstanding read that delivers esteemed perceptivity to the faculty of psychoanalysis, how we perceive and interpret the arts and literature, and on the variety of complex languages with which we do so. However, be prepared for an intense read, but remain assured that upon completion of this work, you will be duly facinated, inspired, and impelled to re-examine your psyche."},{"Title":"The interpretation of dreams","review":"The ego has no need to mediate between the id and the super ego when coming down to the problem of which this book is worth reading because the super ego wins by far! Did you understand that last statement? If not then The Interpretation of Dreams by Sigmund Freud explains it all. It is the \\"Rosetta Stone\\" so to speak of all things psychanalytical. Not only does Sigmund demonstrate the process of interpreting the underlying meaning of one's dream but he also answers the age old questions of why one sleepwalks and sleep talks. Also, why do you forget your dreams soon after you wake up sometimes? Sigmund Freud answers that. Why does everything in your dream feel so real? Sigmund knows the answer to that too! Sigmund not only interprets dreams but he also explains such things as the psyche, psychology, psychoanalysis, psychosexuality, and the psychic apparatus, the Oedipus complex, and the Electra complex as well. According to Sigmund dreams aren't just stories made up while you sleep. Dreams are wish fulfillments; stuff you wish you could do while you are awake, or stuff you couldn't possibly do while you are awake. Every step you take, thing you do, and word you speak has an underlying, symbolic meaning (latent content in Freudian language), and interpreting that could quite possibly bridge the gap between consciousness and subconsciousness, resulting in a more meaningful life. According to Freud's drive theory that is one of the most clear, obtainable objectives one could stride for, next to death that is."},{"Title":"The interpretation of dreams","review":"This is indispensable for any student of Freud or psychoanalysis.

His treatise on human dreams is truly a product of a brilliant mind. But neither the process of creation itself nor not the results and findings it brought out are the true wonders of this book. The great achievement of Freud's theory is its immunity to criticism. In other words, it is virtually impossible to criticize the results and propositions inserted in this book. His main tenet - a dream is a fulfillment of a desire - cannot be attacked in any intelligible way. If one says for instance that an unpleasant dream or a bloody nightmare is clearly not the fulfillment of a desire, Freud would promptly mention masochism or self punishment. Or, if one finally brings forth a dream that is surely not a desire fulfilled, he might nonetheless say there is at least a desire accomplished, viz: the desire to destroy Freud's dream theory."},{"Title":"The interpretation of dreams","review":"While Freud has been called many things, what IS agreed upon is the weight of his contributions (we wouldn't be talking about or reading him if he weren't still relevant).If you're curious about what Freud was really all about, I suggest you read this book. It's understandable, it's simple: you don't have to have a degree in psychology to get it. It's actually quite entertaining and while it and Freud can't tell you what YOUR particular dreams mean, you will find a rather useful guide in beginning to understand what your brain does while you're asleep.Basically, what Freud says is that all dreams are wish-fulfilments and it makes sense. What, to me, sounded far-fetched was his almost comical insistence on signaling out objects in the dream as representations of sexual organs. It is safe to say nowadays that Freud was pretty hung up on this side of human behavior and it shows.I wanted badly to read this book because I have strong recurring dreams that I go crazy trying to figure out. And this book has shed some light on them. But other things just didn't add up in my particular case. And the final verdict is precisely that: you have to take dreams on a case-by-case basis. There's too much information in everyone's daily life for any single person to be able to come up with a general magic formula for the interpretation of dreams.Meanwhile, I suggest you crack this book open and find yourself in many of the dreams Freud relates."},{"Title":"The interpretation of dreams","review":"This edition of \\"Interpretation of Dreams\\" hits all the marks-it has extensive introductory notes, bibliography, and a more than adequate index. Moreover, specific dreams in the text are referenced in a separate index. They also have the English translations of the foreign-language footnotes, which is always helful for those of us who only speak three and not seven languages. The editors understand all facets of \\"user friendly,\\" which means that this book not only friendly to the user, but friendly for use. It has every bell and whistle that any student, scholar, or savant could want in a book, which is a rare thing.Moreover, the cover art is very eye catching, since the blurred water-color profiles have a dream-like quality about them, reinforcing, but not distracting from the books subject and contents. In many ways, the book is the cover.I admire the heavy secondary research Freud put into his book. Keeping in mind Freud's ideas were gestating in the late 1800's, when there was none of the perfected scientific research and research methods that we have today. Like Darwin, Galileo, or Newton, Freud did so much with so little in the way of technological gizmos. This adds even a greater luster to his genius.However, there are two issues I have with Dr. Freud's methodology. First, his has a very odd universe of sampling, namely himself and his neurotic patients (136, 138). First of all, relying on his own dreams for analysis tends to make his research solipsistic, which is to say we may be looking more at Freud than his research and conclusions. Moreover, relying on neurotic patients does not yield statistically balanced data. His skewed sampling leads to a skewed conclusion.Secondly, Freud comes to the reductionist conclusion that all dreams are wish fulfillment. Keeping in mind the strange and limited universe of sampling, it is no wonder that Freud came to this rather odd conclusion. Part of the problem is that Freud completely ignored the creativity aspect of dreams. The classic example of the creativity in dreams is Elias Howe's invention of the sewing machine needle. He was an English inventor trying to invent the sewing machine. He had all the parts in place expect the needle, which was giving him problems. He fell asleep at his inventor's table and dreamt cannibals were chasing him, whose spears that had holes in the tops. He woke up and put the hole in the top of the machine needle, and presto! A new industry.I recognize that this book is an essential the historical literature of psychology. And I have no qualms about typical and ubiquitous Freudian sexology. Sex, or better yet reproduction, is a power drive in humanity, although I do not concede that it is the one and only drive."},{"Title":"The interpretation of dreams","review":"I bought this book because I was having some crazy dreams and thought this might help me understand.

All psychopathic phenomena derive from the suppression of the sexual desires! How foolish! For a rural young boy it seemed that &quot;Love&quot; by Standhal was more realistic. In a few weeks, I shut out the content of this book from my brain because I took it serious. This effect was too pessimistic to interpret the human being.This book shows two important results. At first, the psychopathic is understandable if the unconsciousness exists. At second, the neuroses disappear if the unconscious sexual desires are made conscious.

Anyone who seeks writing in the tradition of Kafka and Kobo Abe will absolutely love these books. Publishers Weekly mentions \\"sacrificing internal logic,\\" but a more accurate description might be either \\"redefining\\" it or \\"not succumbing\\" to it. If internal logic is tone and voice, then Stacey Levine's work introduces even the most jaded reader to something completely new. As a reviewer once wrote (apparently I am not supposed to refer to reviewers on this page), her writing is often both \\"simultaneously funny and disturbing,\\" and combined with her rapturous lyricism, the effect is cathartic and out-of-body, even when the writing is explicitly exposing \\"the oppressive mechanisms\\" of the body itself, as the reviewer so aptly described it. Even the darkest and most disturbing passages cannot be called \\"gruesome\\" (as PW put it) because they are controlled so expertly by Levine's masterful tone that there is always a kind of strange otherworldly beauty that shines through, and humor, uproarious humor that suddenly wells up, making one want to immediately share it with whoever is around, including strangers, for these are among the most laugh-out-loud funny books I have ever read. Even in the darkest most blackly poetic scenes there is a kind of disturbingly giddy humor that makes one want to climb out of one's skin for joy. On the other hand, if what is meant by \\"internal logic\\" is the trite conventionality and expectation that continues to hold morbid sway over the dominating and overspent traditions of realism (yes, I am beginning to sound full of myself, sorry) than this is exactly the sort of writing that Levine refuses to succumb to, and that is what makes her writing so great: not tired routine and sleepwork, but high heavenly art.

Cervantes follows this pattern of putting things upside-down to show right-side-upness. He accentuates reality by taking an insane man as his lead character. The paradox, however, is that Quixote seems to be the sanest person in the story.\\"The Man of La Mancha\\" has two advantages over its parent-text \\"Don Quixote.\\" The first is that Wasserman, et al. did a marvelous job of pairing down Cervantes' two part book into a one act play. A lot of Quixote's adventures are funny parody, but it at times becomes a bit over-done. The play captures the essence of the Quixote-Idea without any gas. \\"Brevity is the soul of wit,\\" as Shakespeare testified.The second advantage is the music. \\"The Quest (The Impossible Dream)\\" is a triumph not only for Wasserman et al, but it is a triumph for humanity. So this book needs to be read with the soundtrack. The original Broadway is my favorite, since it captures the Iberian wind that blows over the story. The Peter O'Toole film is too produced and had too many sweet strings that drench out the Spanish guitars.You know how good a work of art is by seeing how it is parodies. Quixote has been copied on \\"Quantum Leap,\\" and Alf, and Jim Neighbors sung \\"The Quest\\" on Gomer Pyle. There is even a cartoon \\"Don Coyote and Sancho Panda.\\" And, of course, there is the classic Mr. Magoo (Jim Baccus) version of Don Quixote.So buy, and enjoy this play. Read along with the movie, and ponder reality through the eyes of an insane man."},{"Title":"Man of La Mancha;: A musical play,","review":"Man of La Mancha remains my alltime favorite musical. Others such as Les Miserables and Phantom of the Opera are perhaps better in many ways, but nevertheless, Man of La Mancha holds a very dear place in my heart. It is a powerfull tale of a man who, disalusioned with everyday life, decides to become a Knight Errant and sally forth into the world righting all wrongs. Its overall themes of good over evil, and the search for happyness are an inspiration. Don Quixote may be a bit out of his time, but is he really so insane? Perhaps its the rest of the world that could do with some of his peculuar brand of boldness."},{"Title":"Man of La Mancha;: A musical play,","review":"I really enjoy the story of Don Quixote and all of his quests. In all honesty, (it could be my fault) but i thought this was going to be a straight up book of Man a la Mancha, but instead it was more like a script of the musical. It's still great though. If you order the book you should definitely get the CD to play along with it."},{"Title":"Man of La Mancha;: A musical play,","review":"Maddest of all is to see things as they are and not as they should be.This simple premise lies at the heart of every marriage proposal, politcal campaign, revolution and of course the birth of every religion.That such a poignant essence was successfully reduced for theatrical presentation from the lengthy Cervantes work is nothing short of genius.All too often its easy for story tellers, playwrights and movie makers to tease out the prurient drama of human suffering. It is so much more compelling when someone manages to capture that moment of inspiration when someone dares to believe and others chance to join.First with Sancho, then fair Dulcinea, then ultimately maybe us, we gather eagerly to that spark of faith that grows in this play.If you think about it, \\"Impossible Dream\\" could easily have been rendered maudlin in the wrong hands. It's a testiment to this play and this writer that it actually inspires."},{"Title":"Man of La Mancha;: A musical play,","review":"This musical is absolutely hilarious.

The character of Dulcinea is particularly touching - where those who would use and abuse her see only a whore broken by life's cruelties and painful necessities, our mad hero sees a woman capable of love, kindness, and friendship. He sees a person, with pain and sorrow and strength and inner beauty. How can we know that this view is \\"insanity\\"? Perhaps it is the rest of the world that is mad, and only our dear man of La Mancha has clear senses.~ Ana Mardoll"},{"Title":"Man of La Mancha;: A musical play,","review":"During reading I pursued my impossible dream and at the end the sensation was: \\"But I'm a Man of La Mancha...\\".

I saw a production of the play when I was in high school (long time ago) and remember liking it. It's the condensed story of Don Quijote, book-ended by Cervantes in a Spanish prison, awaiting his trial before the Inquisition. Obviously, reading the play, especially a musical, is nothing compared to seeing it live.

The diner has undergone a renaissance in recent years and while there are no where near the number of diner establishments that there were in the 50's and 60's, people are once again seeing the allure of the tiny, home-cooking stops. The diner influence can be seen today even in many mainstream chain restaurants with menu options reminiscent of diner foods. As the authors of More Retro Diner point out, while all diners sold burgers, soups, etc, it was their unique creations that often out them on the map and kept customers coming back for more.Along with vintage photos and art of diners, and diner menus, the book provides dozens of authentic recipes culled from some of these legendary eateries, many of which are still in business today. Frequent travelers, particularly in the eastern part of the country where diners flourished will certainly recognize many of the names. At it's core diner food is the best comfort food, good tasting and filling. There's the French onion soup from the Oasis Diner, Cincinnati-style Chili, fish & chips, and Ken's real onion rings.Sandwiches were always a diner staple and Mastoris diner in New Jersey boasts a menu of over 80 different sandwich selections. You'll find recipes for classics like chicken clubs, Philly cheese steaks, Sloppy Joes, and the good old meatloaf sandwich. Moving over to the grill there are delectable recipes for chicken-fried steak, skirt steak fajitas, and cheese-stuffed burgers. But getting back to those unique recipes, the section devoted to blue plate specials includes fare like the chicken & rice casserole from Moody's Diner in Maine, in business for over 75 years; the crab cakes from the Blue Comet Lounge, and Betsy's Shepherds pie.For those who long for the feeling of those family vacations in the car of yesteryear, or for anyone who just loves good home-cooking, More Retro Diner satisfies the hunger.Reviewed by Tim Janson"},{"Title":"More Retro Diner: A Second Helping of Roadside Recipes","review":"When someone gifted me this book, my first thought was, \\"Oh, No, not ANOTHER cookbook!\\" Boy was I surprised as I turned from mouth watering page to mouth watering page.

What are the chances that just when she thought her she life was about to turn around and her dreams realized, that she would then put her faith and trust in Miles Bondurant, a wolf in sheep's clothing?

She does an outstanding job of allowing the reader to really get to know all of the characters. Although some of the people in the book make choices that most of us would not (hopefully), by the time those choices are made, the reader understands why the person is the way he/she is. You feel the fear and frustration, and it made me incredibly angry to see that the murderer used innocent children to force his girl friend to do what he wanted her to do. It is a very sad story. I recommend this book to any true crime fan, and I strongly recommend any book written by Irene Pence."},{"Title":"Triangle","review":"This story was filled with twists and turns. I couldn't imagine a multi-millionare committing murder over a woman he knowingly plucked out of prison, but the author did her homework and made the story very believable."},{"Title":"Triangle","review":"Warren Miles Bondurant was a well-established business man. A pillar of his Fort Worth, Texas community, he placed an ad in a newspaper looking for a good looking woman for whom he would finance a college education, all expenses paid. Sandra Underhill was a good looking woman for whom this ad was just the ticket she was looking for. She was an inmate in a Texas prison from which she was soon to be released, when she responded to the ad, and, to her complete surprise, Warren Miles Bondurant wrote back to her. This was to chart a course for these two troubled people that they would both live to regret.Sandra was a drug addict, under-educated, gullible, and totally amoral. Warren was some one used to getting his own way, a total control freak, who was also an ugly drunk. Together they would have a volatile relationship. While in drug rehab, Sandra met Carri Coppinger, a young woman who was kind, caring, and looked after Sandra who was pregnant with Warren's child. Initially friends who became lovers, they eventually settled into being just best friends. When Sandra returned to Warren, as she inevitably did, this time she took Carri with her, and this threesome proved to be combustible under the same roof, with Carri paying the ultimate price.This is definitely not the author's best work. Although somewhat entertaining, the quality of the writing is not up to the author's usual standard. The book reads as if it were written in a hurry, even though it is evident that the author did quite a bit of research. Moreover, neither Sandra Underhill nor Warren Miles Bondurant are particular sympathetic or likeable. It is only the unfortunate Carri who seems to be the only one to have had a shred of humanity in her makeup, leaving the reader wishing that it had been Sandra, rather than Carri, who had paid the ultimate price at the hands of Warren Miles Bondurant."},{"Title":"Triangle","review":"Pence's book, recalling the 1994 murder of Warren Bondurant's girlfriends best friend, was a good read but not up to the caliber of the author's other fine true crime books. While the story is full of many details, which obviously shows that Ms. Pence thoroughly researches the cases she writes about, this book seemed to be written fully in the view of Sandra Underhill who was Bondurant's want-ad lover. As stated in the book Underhill provided many hours of interviews with the author as the basis for the book and I think this is why it seems so \\"one-sided\\". (I could not get over the feeling that Underhill really told some half-truths and sometimes not the truth at all) However it is an entertaining read nevertheless. UPDATE: as of the writing of my review Warren Miles Bondurant still sets in a Texas prison at the age of 71. He is eligible for a parole hearing in 2021, at the age of 86."},{"Title":"Triangle","review":"WHEN YOU START READING THIS BOOK YOU CAN NOT PUT IT DOWN. YOU WONT BELIEVE WHAT HAPPENS.

It's encyclopedic in scope on the topic of garlic, and L.J. Harris has a lively writing style and a passion for the subject that keeps it from ever becoming stuffy or long-winded. Health Quarterly described him in their review as \\"kindly, mischievous and talented\\". Included are chapters on references to garlic in the Talmudic and Mohammedan traditions and quotes from Pliny and Virgil that are surprisingly contemporary in their points of view about health and society. Herbalist and culinary traditions from China and India are represented, as are the viewpoints of the British (alliophobic) and the French (alliocentric, depending on geography and politics). Literary lore, folk medicine, herbalist tradition, and culture & politics all contribute to this very readable volume. My two favorite recipes were Puerto Rican Garlic & Egg Soup, and Nancy's Artichoke Pie."},{"Title":"Lady Jane","review":"Loved the book.

He seems to really enjoy his job and that makes for a good read. He also seems to know quite a bit about what he's doing, which lends the reader confidence. Confidence enough to try things that may cost you money? We'll see...This book is about modding your XBOX. There are several reasons someone would want to do this, and the author covers most of them. The primary reason is to run import DVDs and to install software on your XBOX harddrive. Other valid reasons include increasing the hard drive capacity and turning your XBOX into a Media Center. One reason that isn't valid is software piracy. Unfortunately 95% of the people who see this book on the shelf will assume that's what it is about. Those people are wrong. Fortunately the author doesn't dwell on that topic for long.The primary focus of this book is around the Xenium mod chip, although others are mentioned. The author provides tons of photos and references to help you determine which version of the XBOX you have (who knew there were so many??) and includes detailed instructions for installing both soldered and solderless modchips. The is relevant because certain versions will only allow one or the other.I have to admit I've been leary of cracking open my XBOX but after reading this book, I've changed my mind. After all, as the author states repeatedly, it's just a PC and my 90 day warranty ended well over a year ago. Even if I don't mod my XBOX, I should at least take a look under the hood.Will I be adding a mod chip to my XBOX? No comment. Will I be following some of the tips and suggestions for tricking it out and adding cool stuff like lights or a new case skin? Probably. Even if you never crack the case, this is a book worth reading. I read it over a couple days and really enjoyed it.The book also discusses flashing your XBOX bios, dissassembly (step by step WITH photos), upgrading your hard drive (with more photos) and installing various after market software.At $25 the book is reasonably priced, although you can find it cheaper at Amazon.

She is the racist.This viewpoint is part of the problem that African-Americans cannot escape from; racism against others. Sister Souljah blames white people throughout her book without thinking that it was the early Egyptions that raided the African villages for slaves, not the early Europeans. With her point the finger mentality we, as a nation not just individual races, will not be able to overcome this debilitating disease called racism.The situations she gets into with people are not only caused by a lack of common sense but embarrassingly phony. If you are that clueless to these types people using you, you need a check up from the neck up.

Even though I disagreed with a lot of ideology, I still found her stories compelling. I read this book in 1 day. I was obsessed. I truly couldn't put it down.In many ways her true life story mimics some of the character's in Terry McMillian's &quot;Waiting to Exhale&quot;. Intelligent black professional woman gravitating toward destructive relationships. The sacrifices Sista Souljah makes for black men who use and abuse her leave you bewildered. Sista Souljah aks (SS) makes too many excuses for black men which cause her much pain and disrespect. She never once discusses the issue of black men respecting and uplifting black women or even more importantly - themselves.My main dislike (there are a few others) - her racial views. Yes, racism exists. Yes, due to racism we have many ills in our community. ((But now what....she leaves you hangin')) I think she needs to consider writing a separate book addressing this issue. Or at least add a some kind prelude to this book because it might solidify some of her arguments.Instead, (SS) does not explain her racial and political views, she assumes you understand the issues and it's manifestations - this is a big mistake. Instead, it gives you the appearance that she blankets racism as the excuse for ALL negative behavior in our community. This gets redundant and you begin to question whether or not she entertains other possibilities.There was a comment by a reviewer that she came across as having an \\"I'm all that\\" attitude about her appearance and intelligence. And (SS) does go at length to discuss her beauty and intelligence - many, many times! But when you look at the choices she makes in her personal life, her attitude only masks her low self-esteem.As you can see this book gets you questioning and thinking about your own views.

She has the ability to provoke thought in such a critical manner that it gives me chills. Yet another inspiring woman that has shown resilience in adversity and emerged victorious.

This is a must read for all african american women in every age group."},{"Title":"No Disrespect","review":"This book has uncovered layers and layers of hurt and pain and struggle for the black woman in American society. Through reading her book as a young African American woman in college I was able to look into myself and similar situations that she experienced and realize that I wasn't alone in fighting against what people think I should do. I too struggle with finding a way and means to fight for social justice while finding love in other black men and men in general.

Though it has been since the early nineties that I read No Disrespect, I will always heartily recommend Sister Souljah's grand debut; this book is pure heart; not easy to come by in these plastic times. I say, pick it up and give it a read, you won't be disappointed, and something might change within your soul, a new perspective, or even a song within your heart might be born and you might chance to sing along with No Disrespect ~ I think it takes guts to write like this, and this author has my full respect for putting herself out there.

If there is one book that everyone (white, black, latino, etc) should read, it is definitely this book! It is very hard to set this book down once you begin to read it.

Everyone should read this joint! I read it twice!"},{"Title":"No Disrespect","review":"It's no doubt that Souljah is one of the stronger voices of our generation. Her debut bio \\"No Disrespect\\" tells us various stories that influenced her to become the person she is today. I can appreciate this book because, she got what you call \\"a little salt in her sugar.\\" Because of her massive intelligence, potential and overexerted confidence, she was to blind to use foresight and see that she wasn't immune to heartache and bruised emotions that harsh realities could bring. Little did she know. Souljah goes into intricate detail about her past relationships and friendships with people that affected her life the most. Her stories will blow you away with mouth dropping and lip-curling consequences. I learned a valuable lesson after reading this book, always use foresight in whatever you do. A definate wake up call for those who are sleeping."},{"Title":"No Disrespect","review":"I've been reading this book lately. It was one of the first books recommended to me as to be really good. It is pretty good and I have to admit Sister Souljah does tell it like it is and she sounds very respectful towards herself and others. Personally I think she was too goodie-goodie, though. She stays monogamous for way too long. I'm not going by other reviews either. I don't know any girl that thinks as pure as her, and I know goodie-goodie girls! But all in all, the chapters are pretty much like glue and they're realistic. The book is definitely good and I do recommend it. Especially for people who like being in touch with who they really are. I definitely want to keep reading on."},{"Title":"No Disrespect","review":"The book was excellent, very well written.J"},{"Title":"No Disrespect","review":"I can't say enough about this book. This book is excellent and affects me everyday. The one thing I enjoyed about this book is Sister Souljah tells the TRUTH about Black America. &quot;Where did we go wrong&quot; is the question I have. She talks about black female empowerment and our responsibility to our community. In fact, this book inspired me to work in my community more. I don't care for all the controversy around this woman, all I know is what this book makes me feel."},{"Title":"No Disrespect","review":"Sister Souljah did a great job of expressing her true thought process on paper while undergoing lifes lessons. This is a great book to read regardless of gender. Being a black man in a community of white corporate america, and talking to young minority labours and students, it is important to focus on yourself. Talk to yourself and listen to yourself. Family, friends and loveones will always try and redirect you. Stay strong and focused like Sister Souljah, and your accomplishments will come. It is nice to see a strong black woman deal with it all and still be a strong black woman with morals and most of all self dignity. Stay up and stay strong and keep God in your life regardless of your personal practice."},{"Title":"No Disrespect","review":"SISTER SOULJAH WAS VERY DIRECT ON HER VIEWS, SOME OF WHICH I AGREED WITH &amp; SOME I FELT THAT SHE WAS WAY OUT IN LEFT FIELD. THERE IS NOTHING WRONG WITH SUPPORTING YOUR &quot;BLACK MEN&quot; IF THAT IS WHAT YOU BELIEVE IN. BUT THROUGHOUT THE BOOK, NOT ONCE DID SHE EVER STREES THE IMPORTANCE OF THE BLACK MAN SUPPORTING THE &quot; BLACK WOMAN&quot;. IT SEEMS TO ME THAT EVERY MAN SHE ENCOUNTERED PLAYED HER. I THINK THAT BLACK WOMEN WERE RAISED TO BELEIVE THAT A BLACK WOMAN SHOULD STICK BY HER MAN NO MATTER WHAT, &amp; THAT IS A STEREO TYPE I STRONGLY DISAGREE WITH &amp; THIS BOOK SUPPORTS THAT &quot;OLD&quot; THEORY. I THINK IT WAS VERY INTERESTING AND VERY ENLIGHTING AS FAR AS SOME AFRICAN AMERICANS ON THE SUBJECT OF OPPRESSION &amp; &quot;THE SYSTEM&quot; AS FAR AS WELFARE GOES. ALSO, I WOULD LIKE TO GIVE HER PRAISE AS FAR AS HER CELIBACY &amp; MONOGAMY ISSUES GO. I MYSELF HAPPEN TO BE ONE OF THE FEW BEAUTIFUL BLACK WOMEN THAT ARE PRACTICING CELIBACY. AND IT FELT GOOD TO KNOW THAT SOMEONE AS OUT SPOKEN AS SISTER SOULJAH DOESN'T SEEM TO THINK THAT IT'S CRAZY FOR A SISTER NOT TO &quot;GET HERS&quot; EVERY CHANCE SHE GETS IS REALLY GREAT.

SHE KNOWS HOW TO CAPTURE THE READERS ATTENTION. I ALSO RECOMMEND &quot;COLDEST WINTER EVER&quot;. I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE THAT BECOME A MOVIE."},{"Title":"No Disrespect","review":"I believe Sister Souljah wrote this book when she was in her early twenties, and if that's the case, it is pretty impressive. She draws lessons from her own personal experiences, and from those close to her. I really thought it was thought-provoking, and not nearly as polemical as some make her out to be.However, her rationalization of cheating with a man who's spoken for (\\"there aren't enough black men out there, so we'll have to share\\") wears a bit thin, and her criticism that gay black men are doing a disservice to the black community at large...should be the other way around."},{"Title":"No Disrespect","review":"Sister Souljah became my favorite writer when I finished The Coldest Winter Ever. I just loved it! This led me to read No Disrespect. The book begins discussing her childhood and how her parents marriage came to end, and as a result her family moved into the projects. Throughout the book she refers to her beauty. She always describes her full figure and constantly compares herself to other women. This became a little boring, until it finally clicks that even with her physical beauty and inner strength, she was extremely vulnerable. She experienced so many trials and tribulations, even though she was well known and respected in the black community.I cannot say enough about this book. Her honesty became clear to me in the end. That I really appreciate. Her depiction of &quot;Black America&quot; is most accurate. I have stated many of these things myself. Read this book only if you're not easily offended (black or white) and if you really want to grow as a person. My props to Sister Souljah for living up to my expectations.!"},{"Title":"No Disrespect","review":"i was walking around a bookstore and what caught my eye was the title of the book,..then the woman on the cover had a sense of mystery in her eyes. I started to read this and was cought up within the first few pages. As I read more aobut people; and the situations that anyone can find themselves in, it made me think of all the f...uped relationships that I have had in my life and all the lessons that were taught to me through those folks. that's what this book is about...learning and relearning life lessons,...the author seemed filled with pissosity throughout this book, though. It seemed to me that the author was blaming all these people in her life were to blame for failed relationships, and as I read the end of the book, still took no blame or shame with the part she played in those relationsips,..everyone lied to her about this or that, but she didn't accepet her own truths. Sister, like your syle of writing, though...."},{"Title":"No Disrespect","review":"And those are the nice things I have to say about this woman and her book. She's a young woman with a LOT to learn. She sounds like a one of those white far-right &quot;Christian&quot; nuts.By the way, if she doesn't believe in interracial relationships, why does she work with Sean &quot;Puffy&quot; Combs, who is dating Jennifer Lopez? Souljah would probably rationalize that Sean was driven to make it with Jennifer by our racist society. (Sean looks to me like he's having fun!)"},{"Title":"No Disrespect","review":"Sister Souljah is the BOMB! I borrowed the Coldest Winter Ever from a friend to take on my cruise next week. I got the book from her on Monday and finished on Wednesday (3 days and that's only because I had to go to sleep). I've read a lot of book in my lifetime but this is the BEST I've read since reading Long Distance Life by Marita Golden several years ago. Keep up the good work Sister Souljah!

This book was educational eye-opening and above all it was straight from the heart. It helped me to see what I knew to be the case all along, that the things that are going on in our communities is apart of vicious cycle. That we must put a stop to. We are doing it to ourselves."},{"Title":"No Disrespect","review":"Sister Souljah has written one of the most important books of the century. The honesty and sincere concern in which she wrote her story, exposing all of us to our strengths and weaknesses. Maybe it is time that we all take a look at the reality of or environment, our culture, our cities, country and the world. We are sick, very sick indeed, and the only way to cure our illness' is to first diagnose them. Sister Souljah laid all the cards face up, unashamed and unrepentant. She saved her own soul and unselfishly gave those who will understand a dose of the same medicine that ultimately and may in the end be her salvation. Being a savior has never been easy, but it has always been enlightening. And it is that light that she shared with the world that one day will be recognized as prolific and prophetic. Ms. Souljah that is definitely an award-winning motion picture. Who has the Rights?Richmond, Va. Feburary 1999"},{"Title":"No Disrespect","review":"This book is a must read.

I read this book three times over the course of having it. Sister Souljah touched on so many issues that the black community is facing. I appreciate her honesty as she talked about up and personal issues that so many women go through, but are afraid to admit it. Sister Souljah is not only a writer but she is also an intellectual person who speaks from her heart. Anybody who reads this book will be moved. So many women can learn what not to do by listening to this powerful story. This book on all accounts is certainly a page turner. In a few more years I will revisit this book so I can read it again. This is one of the best books I have ever read."},{"Title":"No Disrespect","review":"Every one of us chooses our station in life, a position from which we posture our convictions and beliefs; which without apology Sister Souljah is no different.Admittedly I wasn't warmed by the opening. It took turning to a page just about in the middle of the book, (page 109 to be exact), and reading from there for a few pages before going back to the beginning to understand this woman's philosophies, and where she's coming from.After that, from beginning to end I didn't want to close the book. Anyone who advocates for children wins me over, before and after all else. Of course there is much more to Sister Souljah's autobiography than the children she crusades for; she had to go through some things before reaching a platform from which she could stage her fight to help empower disenfranchised children.Other spots that engaged me as well; her relationship with her family, and as well other relationships... Nathan (of course being the premier), but also Joseph...(Sonya's spiel was truly potent), and Chance I just adored...at first! And that incident in Baltimore had me in stitches. Oh, that was one of a special kind of hilarious. Nikki was interesting, and also that talk on lesbianism with Mona. Tusani, and her mother Nita, just may have been the most stirring. It was the message behind the mother's message that I found tremendous; one where although it wasn't written, I felt wasn't lost on Sister Souljah either--the other thing I found impressive...her openness to hear what the people she was trying to help, and as well all of those she forged relationships with, were saying.I highly recommend \`No Disrespect.' I really want to go on and on here, but in summary this work is as compassionate as it is passionate, intellectual, and outstanding."},{"Title":"No Disrespect","review":"I' what I liked about this book is that she's brutally honest. She speaks what was on her mind then (and very likely in her mind now). She doesn't pull any punches when it comes to sharing her experiences with men, friendship, school, and especially when it comes to sharing her views, even those I do not agree with. She definitely has seen a lot of rough spots in her life. She comes from 'the ghetto'. She's seen the violence, the brutality, and the overall lack of love and empathy in her community. She's a battle scarred warrior who has been in the trenches. And from it, she definitely has many pearls of wisdom to share. Of course she means it for 'her people', but I think it's wisdom that almost anyone can get something out of if they have an open mind. I admire this woman's drive, her philanthropy, and the amount of love she has for embracing her roots and for wanting to make her community better. She speaks to the reader as though she's having an actual conversation with him/her, and reliving her experience. You can literally get inside her mind and watch the scenes play out and feel the emotion. And there's a lot of it to go around in this book.What I don't like is her hatred. I understand she was writing how she feels (and definitely felt at that time and moment, which is what I believe to be her intention). I also know that my views are imperfect and that I'm never going to fully be able to understand 'the other side'. However, for someone whose been abroad (including European countries)and has been amongst many different races, classes and educations, the fact that she can group every single white person as evil is beyond me. What's even further beyond me, is that she can consider herself a Christian and admire the likes of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr and Malcolm X and still have these views (clearly she hasn't read the words of Jesus or even the words of Dr. King or Malcolm X upon his conversion to Islam). She claims to have an unselfish heart yet the fact she can entertain these revenge fantasies, group entire people as though all could be spoken for, and be so venomous, even amongst her motives throughout the book, including trying to take someone else's boyfriend, really speaks otherwise to me. She has these same views towards homosexuals and blacks who try to get along with others (especially whites). One she doesn't understand and views with the same contempt as would the fundamentalist Christian community, the other because it doesn't agree with her militant, warped view of how people who share her skin color 'should be'. Clearly she needs to read her Bible (or her Quran for that matter), a bit more. Especially the sayings of Jesus. Bill Clinton really did hit home when he called her an inverse David Duke. Because despite all semantics of 'power vs privilege' and history, deep down the mentality is still the same. It boils down to hatred.It's really an unfortunate thing, because I definitely admire this author because of her drive, her strength, and the fact that she can write in a way that is brutally honest. Even if I disagree with much of it, I give her credit for speaking out. It's so unfortunate because so many people could learn from her and her experiences. I, a gay, non-black male, certainly have. People like her could quite literally change the world if she learned to keep her hatred in check. She doesn't have to make people comfortable or even like them. But she certainly should learn to look past people on the outside instead of becoming the very thing she hates. I still admire her achievements and triumphs though, and I hope in the future she comes out with an updated version now that she's older, wiser, and has more experience."},{"Title":"No Disrespect","review":"This is one of the best books I have ever read. I don't keep my books after I read them. If they are hardcover I donate them to the library.

I feel SS did not get the job done by getting through to enough of you. As a MIXED (African American AND white)researcher for almost 36 years, SS hit the nail on the head. She is not whining or PLAYING victim. She IS a victim; all African Americans are. Sure, there is self responsibility and it is up to us to get ourselves out of poverty, but in a society that had to pass affirmative action, a law that says white people HAVE to hire minorities because they outright refused up until around 2000, clearly we are still being victimized. Shame on you African Americans talking down on one another instead of being an alli. Sure SS appears racist, but the most educated white person who has studied culture, sociology, and history will tell you to your face: SHE HAS EVERY RIGHT TO BE. Its clear that those of you calling SS a racist have NO idea who you are; no nothing about your roots. Google PAN AFRICANISM, CHEIKH ANTA DIOP, MALCOLM X, AND NATIONALISM. You all are sure fools if you believe your opinions are more correct and more sensible than those groups who have studied, embraced, received Masters, Doctorates, and Ph Ds., and have LIVED through racism.

We are so darn happy that we have saved our 3 from the horable, unetical, imoral life that is epicted in this book. If that is how Sister has lived her life, we see absolutely no reason why she would brag about it. Also, while white students are worrying about their student loans, and wondering how in the world they will ever be able to pay them back, little or nothing was said about the African-American students concerns about their pay-back. Oh, yes, I forgot \\"We Owe You\\"(?) Great that Sister Souljah is trying to help her \\"brothers\\" and \\"sisters\\", but maybe she should start with teaching them some morals, and maybe cleaning up her act while she is at it.

In life I have learned that there are people who you will meet that are not worthy of you knowing on any level. It's nothing personal, but there are just some people who you will meet in life that are just full of it and have no aspirations, goals and/or plans in life. Sista Souljah does speak the truth on many issues such as racism, sexism, being intelligent and at the same time being overlooked in the black community, poverty and education.I would recommend this book to anyone who is willing to question our status as Africans living in America."},{"Title":"No Disrespect","review":"I love Sister Souljah's book. The book was her truth and her all the experiences and thoughts put together in the book. I am an avid reader and I could not put the book down. I totally disagree with anyone who could dare say anything negative about the book. It was definitely not boring and not another book on oppression. It was her experiences and her thoughts about her experiences. Anyone who says the book is just about racism is obviously living in a fantasy world. I strongly advise the reading of Sister Souljah!! Any person of color true to themselves can get something positive out of her book."},{"Title":"No Disrespect","review":"I was so touched by this book. Sister Souljah is such an inspiring young woman with quite a story to tell. Her drive and passion in helping Black Americans is endless.Her biography was touching and the lessons that she learned in her short life especially with respect to relationships were enlightening. The style of her biography is &quot;storylike&quot; which makes it an easy yet educational read. After reading her other book &quot;The Coldest Winter Ever&quot; a couple of years ago, I thought that nothing that she wrote would be able to captivate me the way that book did, however I was wrong. Sister Souljah's life as told in &quot;No Disrespect&quot; loosely resembled the main character's life of &quot;The Coldest Winter Ever&quot;. This is a must read!"},{"Title":"No Disrespect","review":"Sister Souljah is a writer who is no scared to express the hardships of life I think this is what makes he a very good writer, not only for the African American community but for any race and any generation. From this book I gained so much information about what really goes on in African American communities. What I really likes is how she displayed the overcoming of a strugle."},{"Title":"No Disrespect","review":"Who is this Sister Souljah? - She's fantastic!!! What an amazing book and a real eye opener for anyone who ever wondered what life was like living in the drug world. Sister Souljah addressed all the issues that I was questioning as I read along. This is a very well written book and should be read by all African American females. SS made me care about the characters, especially Winter. Boy, did I feel it for her, and what a fighter. Right or wrong she had to try and survive. Unfortunately her fight for survival had serious repercussions, with a totally unexpected ending. This book is far from predictable. There are many lessons to be learnt in the reading of this title.Fantastic!"},{"Title":"No Disrespect","review":"this book really was well written. it hit home personaly. since i knew the characters whom she had written about. Sister, described them to a T. I hoped all would enjoy this book. unfortunately all didn't some of the persons that Sister wrote about wanted to take legal action. But Suljah overcame that, just like she overcame all the other obstacles she had to face in her life."},{"Title":"No Disrespect","review":"This work is simply inspiring, this book should be required reading in all African American courses. As a young Black and endangerd male, living in the United Snakes of Amerikkka, I related to her brutal truth about living in White America. This text strikes at the root of the struggle, while also relaying the human struggle of African American Women. Most impressive was Sista Soulja's ability to succeed, while remaining true to herself and her people."},{"Title":"No Disrespect","review":"I FELT THAT THE BOOK TOUCH UPON ALOT OF REAL ISSUES IN THE BLACK COMMUNITY. I DID NOT AGREED WITH EVERYTHING BUT EVERYONE CAN HAVE THIER OWN OPINIONS. THE BOOK NO DISRESPECT ALSO GAVE ME AN IDEA OF SISTER SOULJAH'S LIFE AND BACKGROUND,WHICH WAS A HARD LIFE. I LOOK FORWARD TO READING ANOTHER BOOK FROM SISTER SOULJAH AND MUCH RESPECT TO THE BOOK."},{"Title":"No Disrespect","review":"This book is an eye opener. I learned things about her past that make me see her in a completely new light. This is not for the faint of heart as she will keep everything straight up with you."},{"Title":"No Disrespect","review":"Sistah Souljah created an honest look at the truths of society. To call her a racist for being honest reporting her realities and what she has witnessed in her work and service to communities is mere ignorance. I do not fully agree with every word Sistah writes. However, I commend her honesty, her openness, and her consciousness.The book is a must read regardless if one agrees or disagrees. It is not to be used as a life manual. It is to be used as a mirror, or a stepping stone. If you are the person she regrets being or you want to elevate to another level the book will give you insight that may not be easily found in accessible literature."},{"Title":"No Disrespect","review":"This book was as brutaly honest about black male female relationships as it gets.This book made me a black male look at myself and Black woman in a whole new light.I admire and respect Sistas unrelenting love and passion for her beliefs in self and her people.This sisters story proves greatness in the black womans spirit. Her story proves that in order for black people to truly love one another it requires sacrafice,activisim,vision,patience,and most of all an understanding of the dynamics associated with racsisim and its catastrophic effects on this ability to love one another."},{"Title":"No Disrespect","review":"I heard raving reviews about this book a while ago, and although this is not my type of book, I read it. It started out great, and it was awesome to see someone so focused and confident at such a young age. Then as SS got older, that confidence stuck with her and created her into what she has become today. Towards the end, I must admit, I began to get rather bored and couldn't wait until the book finished (too many bad relationships and a little more Black Power than I care for.)The book kept my attention because of the different twist that it continued to take, in particular, her relationships with Joseph, Nikki and Chance. It was a unique balance between being confident and being naive, or rather, needing to be loved. It was puzzling to see someone so self-assured and to a degree self-rightous, be so naive when it came to relationships. To a degree, I think that was the point she was getting at.I recommend this book to the young woman who is soul searching."},{"Title":"No Disrespect","review":"No Disrespect is a book that my sociology professor had assigned for the class to read. I must say that it is one of the best assignments that I had ever been given--mainly because it gave me a new pair of eyes. I can also relate to a lot of situations that Sister Souljah expressed in this book. For example, I too am angry when I come home from work and see the same guys standing or sitting in the exact same place as they were when I left for work. If one is blind to the harsh reality of life within the African-American community, this book will make one see."},{"Title":"No Disrespect","review":"This book was thang! I read it in three days, it could have been less if i didn't have to work. I just couldn't put it down. The end had me in tears, which i couldn't really believe. I thank Soulja for writing this book in so many was, but most of all to let our young, black women know the real. Thanks, Soulja"},{"Title":"No Disrespect","review":"I would like to first say that this book was an interesting read as far as mixing racism and politics with drama. The author heightens intellect with urban intellect (intellect with street smarts or what is referred to as common sense). However, the drama is what kept me interested in reading this book. At times I felt as if the author's political views were contradictory and confusing until the lessons at the end of the book. Although I understand the authors reasoning for writing the literature in this form, I believe that the form that was utilized can easily distance a reader from completing the book. Overall, I admire how Ms. Souljah demonstrates the effects politics joined with racism has on everyday life for African Americans and Caucasians."},{"Title":"No Disrespect","review":"This book was not that bad,There are things that agree with Sister Souljah on and things that I disagree with.But for her to be so intelligent and have alot of book sense...She lacks a great deal of common sense and I honestly think and feel that she has alot of issues within herself to deal with by judging of her actions in this book."},{"Title":"No Disrespect","review":"I really LOVED this book it was so different and interesting. Siser Souljah really kicked AZZ with this one. I can't wait until she comes out with something else."},{"Title":"No Disrespect","review":"Often overshadowed by The Coldest Winter Ever, No Disrespect is my favorite book of all time. The talented Sister Souljah, will keep your eyes glued to this book. When you think things couldn't get any more intense, they do. You will turn so many pages, before you know it, you'll be finished. Read this one!!"},{"Title":"No Disrespect","review":"SUMMARY:The book begins, with what I believe to be her earliest memories, of being a 4 year-old little girl, in a two-parent working-class home, in which her mother was a homemaker and her father was the breadwinner. Everything is \\"Leave it to Beaver-ish\\" until her father loses his job as a truck driver after it is discovered he has epilepsy and refuses to let her mother work. They lose everything. Her mother moves them into the projects with no high school education, no work history, three kids and an absent husband; evidently, he has developed mental health issues due to his inability to take care of his family and he feels emasculated.As you can probably foretell, life in the projects is not a bed of roses. A woman with three kids, no education and no child support is reduced to using other resources, in her mother's case her looks and youth (she is only 22 years old) to get support from \\"temporary\\" men. So, as you can imagine, men pass through Sister Souljah's household frequently and the mother she was once proud of she starts to reduce to and consider a whore, fairly or unfairly. She is determined not to live her mother's life.Due to these vicissitudes, she has to make a decision as to how she is going to get herself and her family out of these situations that cause her such pain to watch and experience. She develops her mind, becomes an avid learner and diligent student, and heads off to college. She gains a reputation there as an activist, is admired by many, and grows and develops as an African woman. She meets many men and women along the way that teach her what to do and what not to do. She is hurt and inflicts pain and ends the book with some important life lessons she has learned along the way.Sister Souljah has traveled and studied around the world and has met and collaborated with important leaders and dignitaries to raise awareness and do something about the issues that affect black people. She calls herself a \\"ghetto girl.\\" In the truest sense of the word, I suppose she is right. However, I think that she is more of a global thinker in regards to the things that affect people of African descent and I personally don't feel that marginalized people are global thinkers. It's an interesting conundrum regarding how one sees oneself and how one is regarded.REVIEW:I did not like the book. It was very brave of her to be so open with her thoughts and experiences. I have to wonder how much embellishment there was in regards to the details of some of her stories. Regardless, it was interesting. I would rather read a biography of her life than an autobiography and I will follow with why.The things that occurred in her life that she deemed worth writing about, I don't think an objective observer would have. She's traveled all over the world. When she said that she was leaving for the summer to go to Zimbabwe, I was so hungry to hear about that experience. But, was so very disappointed when the next chapter was about another person she met. She has been to Finland and studied in Spain. I would've loved to read what that was like for her.She introduced a person to the reader, Tusani, I believe her name was. An 11-year old girl living in a \\"homeless hotel\\" in New York City with an abusive and drug addicted mother in horrid conditions. I don't know if she was a real person or a composite character, but I was SO VERY interested in knowing how her life turned out. Did she go on to college? Did she get away from her mother? Did the unstable adult that she was having sex with (technically, repeatedly being raped by) ever come back into her life? Did he ever get out of prison? Did that man's father ever get arrested for raping him and his sister?She talked in detail about the homeless hotels in every borough in New York City. How did it come about that they were eventually torn down? She said the families were relocated; to where? How did that affect her activism? What were the measurable differences in the lives of the people she tried to help?Even in regards to some of her personal encounters, there was no insightfulness, it seems. She used her feminine wiles to seduce a young man because she was lonely and a little desperate. She changed her mind about sleeping with him and found him passed out. She thought he was dead. It turned out he had epilepsy. Did that make her wonder about her father? Did that give her any insight into why he had difficulty after he lost his job? Did that make her an activist in regards to that illness? Did she feel that her relationship with her father, or lack thereof, and his advice not to trust anyone affected her frequent encounters with unavailable men who eventually abandoned her and betrayed her?I don't know why all out of all the wonderful and interesting things that occurred in her life she chose to focus on her relationships. I would think that everyone goes through similar experiences, especially when you are marginalized, not given a good example of womanhood or manhood, or are abused and/or witness abuse as a child. It just left me wanting more.I give it three stars for the honesty and bravery of her writing."},{"Title":"No Disrespect","review":"This book will hit you smack between the eye sockets as Sister Souljah describes her own upbringing in the projects, in the grips of a welfare system designed to convey feelings of inferiority, an educational system in which black children were given no reason to take pride in their colour, their origins or their past, life in college and as an activist. She discovers a class beneath the underclass where she grew up. Souljah writes of the desperation that gripped not only adults but children and the complete death of love between black folks (235). She calls welfare hotels urban hellholes where \\"African children were doomed. It was a recipe for extinction of my people. It was genocide.\\" This story brings to mind an activist called Geoffrey Canada who tried to convey the urgency of the problem. Souljah nailed it beautifully. Man/woman relationships play a significant role in this story. Be prepared to be jolted out of your seat."},{"Title":"No Disrespect","review":"As I read No Disrespect, I developed a new respect for Sister Souljah - for she is bright, strong, sober, calculating, and in your face, telling it like it is! I've read works of so-called prolific writers more than twice her age, yet none have touched nerves and brought revelation to me as she has in No Disrespect!I smiled to myself as I read the penetrating questions she asked the people in her life. I admire her! I wish every Black man and woman could and would read this enlightening tome, for it is a life changing adventure into a world where knowledge is king! The multitude of lessons learned are a by-product of a very entertaining read!"},{"Title":"No Disrespect","review":"This is my first time reading anything By Sister Souljah and I must say that I was quite impressed with her novel. It felt so real and alot of things hit home with me on a personal level about how we view ourselves as African Ameicans and where our priorities lye. All of her characters where certainly people that I could relate too She kept it real and insightful she made you think about everything she wrote down. I think that I have just aquired another author that I will continue to read whatever she writes because she did such a damn good Job Word sistah Souljah keep doing what you are doing and I will keep buying."},{"Title":"No Disrespect","review":"This book really did it for me my daughter said mom you read her other book you'll love this one it's more about her life. I said I really don&quot;t want to read about her life. It's probaly boring.No the bomb i could not put it down I read it in two days every break I got at work had me picking up the book. now I wish everyone could read it. Starting with every black child in every ghetto anywhere. We all lived it no matter how you try and hide it. Maybe the parents need to pick it up they might learn something."},{"Title":"No Disrespect","review":"FIRST OF ALL LET ME START BY SAYING THIS WAS A VERY GOOD BOOK. I HIGHLY RECCOMEND THAT ALL TEENAGE GIRLS READ THIS BOOK. I FOUND IT TO BE VERY UPLIFTING, &amp; LIKE EVERY DAY LIFE. MUST READ!!"},{"Title":"No Disrespect","review":"I normally don't like autobiographical books... but this book puts such a spin on in that category.... it was unbelievable. I couldn't put it down. I found myself laughing, crying... and most importantly FEELING where she was coming from. I learned all types of information... and all the while... was still enthralled by her story. Souljah is without a doubt... one of the most powerful writers that I have ever come across. Don't delay.... elevate your mind... and read this book today."},{"Title":"No Disrespect","review":"This book was wonderful. I saw myself in her. This is a must read."},{"Title":"No Disrespect","review":"Peace...I have read both of her books and I am very impressed on her idealogies of life and things she has endured. She definately gets my respect for manifesting her life on paper to share with those who have possibly gone through simular things. I definately suggest reading this book ESPECIALLY if you are a young woman trying to search and find out who you are."},{"Title":"No Disrespect","review":"This book is TOTALLY AWESOME. I started reading this book on a Friday afternoon and was finished Saturday by noon. This book was so captivating that I could not put it down once I started. I am looking forward to reading more of her writings."},{"Title":"No Disrespect","review":"This book was given to me as a gift and I had no idea that I would enjoy it as much as I did. All I knew about Souljah at the time was that she was a controversial sista who used to hang out with Public Enemy. But this is not your average autobiography. The way she tells her story and names her chapters after characters in the order that they appear in her life was very unique. Her characters were well developed, especially Nicki. Miss thang was a trip! The unexpected turns that happen in Souljah's life, the disappointments, the triumphs, the crazy people in her life will keep you up at night constantly turning pages. This is a great first novel by Souljah and I am eagerly awaiting her next project."},{"Title":"No Disrespect","review":"First, I want to say that I really admire what Sister Souljah was trying to do with this book. I mean, how many people just bare it all to the whole world in the hopes that others will learn from their mistakes? Not many! However, I feel this book is still very much limited by the author's own shortcomings. After an emotional and promising beginning, most of this book seems to be about how gorgeous she thinks she is and how let down she's been by black males. She talks about the damage racism has caused blacks all over the world and then espouses intrinsic racial beliefs about people constantly. Basically, she believes in genetic identity: that all black people are spiritually Africans and should probably live separately in their own country. (Should people who are part white and part black spend half their year in one country and then half in the other? What about people who are black, asian and white? Do they need three residences?) At certain points she was sounding uncomfortably like David Duke to me. And, when she runs into something she doesn't understand, such as homosexuality or white women who admire African culture, her first, middle, and last impulse is to judge and condemn. Her later novel The Coldest Winter Ever contains all the lessons this book was meant to, with only a sliver of the bigotry toward gays and anyone other than religious blacks. I would definitely recommend that book with five full stars, over this one. Yet while I didn't agree with much she had to say, this was a very moving, well written memoir. I still gotta give her respect for the fact that she cares so much about the situation of blacks in America that she is willing to put herself on the line for the cause."},{"Title":"No Disrespect","review":"Sister Souljah is MAGNIFICENT!!!! I read &quot;The Coldest Winter Ever&quot; first, and I had to have this one!! The man at the bookstore told me that President Clinton had real issues about &quot;No Disrespect&quot;. Thats when I REALLY wanted it. And I'm glad I got it. The girl is BAD!!! I can't wait for her next book to come out!!! This book is definitely a page turner!!! I highly recommend this book to every African man and woman!!!"},{"Title":"No Disrespect","review":"No Disrespect, October 29, 2003The novel No Disrespect by Sister Souljah is about the life of a young African American woman. Full of stories of triumphs and tribulations, the main character in the book is put into situations that help her grow as not only a woman but also as an African American woman. Sister Souljah No Disrespect takes you on the real journey of her life. She is a writer who isn't scared to express the hardships of life. After reading her first, novel, The Coldest Winter Ever, I knew that I was going to have to read No Disrespect and I was not disappointed. The book begins discussing her childhood and her experiences that she learned from in the projects. It's a real journey of Sister Souljah's life full of knowledge and truth. Her writings in each chapter are about people in her life that both educated her and mis-educated her. With this start Sister Souljah captures the readers attention by causing many different emotions. These experiences for Ms. Souljah have helped her to be the intelligent, courageous, strong woman she becomes by the end of the book. With these experiences the author informs her readers with an understanding of the real African American life. It's a book about a young confused girl who alters into a strong enlightened woman. Throughout the book Sister Souljah the author refers to many experiences in her life that always end up with a resulting lesson. With these lessons Sister Souljah teaches her readers about class, gender, and the prejudices that are associated with them. By the end of the story Sister Souljah refuses to allow people to disrespect her but only gives and expects the respect she always wanted and deserved. No Disrespect is an amazing novel that everyone should read at least one time in their lives."},{"Title":"No Disrespect","review":"a friend of mine had said this book was ab-soul-lutely stunning, and i'm disappointed to say it was anything but. The vast majority of the text is spent pointing fingers at various groups who are seen by Souljah to be opressing the African-American woman, and yet she doesen't go into any real solutions to the problems. I, being a black lesbian, was extremely offended by her outright homophobic comments in the book, and had to try to get through them without throwing it away. I ended up throwing it away anyway at the end. Feel like revolution? Listen to Me'Shell Ndegeocello. Don't buy this book."},{"Title":"No Disrespect","review":"One thing I learned was how deep and wide the African American woman is wounded in her self esteem by the effects of racism. I think it is a shame that Sister Souljah who seems so strong on the surface carries within her such a desperate whimpering need for the attention and approbation of black men no matter what.It is so strong and overriding that the very idea of interracial dating drives her into a rage, but not at a black man who might be dating a white woman. No Sister Souljah's rage is reserved exclusively for the white woman. That's pretty convienent for the black man don't you think?I was at a party once where a black guy hit on every white woman there. The line he used was that they should sleep with him to prove they weren't racist. I would like to hear how Sister Souljah would rationalize this obnoxious-on-so-many-levels kind of behavior. It is bound to be inventive.All that said, this is a very interesting read but I really couldn't give it 5 stars because the child has too little self knowledge. And if I had been her mother and she made the remarks she made about who I choose to date, I would have slapped the snot out of her."},{"Title":"No Disrespect","review":"I thought this was a great book. Sister Souljah and Eric Jerome Dickey are two of my most favorite authors. Her book is so real ,interesting and exciting I didn't want to put it down. Her characters are some of the most interesting and complicated people, and the way the plot goes keeps you wondering whats going to happen next. It is a great book and I promise you won't be dissapointed if you read this. Some other good books are Cheaters, the Liar's Game, Milk In my coffe, and Friends and Lovers, by Eric Jerome Dickey. The coldest Winter Ever and all of Mr. Dickey's novels would make wonderful movies."},{"Title":"No Disrespect","review":"After reading \\"No Disrespect\\", I have learned that the behavior of a race is greatly influenced by the surroundings and the brainwashing of other cultures. Although many people will not admit to being prejudiced, the evidence is apparent. I myself feel that African Americans need to learn about our beginnings just like the teachers in the schools want us to learn about the beginnings of this country. February should not be the only month for Black History. We are black everyday we are on this earth. Sista Souljah kept it real in her book. \\"Black Problems\\" are real and will always exist. This is a book I recommend for teenagers to read to get a jump on life and the experiences they will face. I have much love for my people, and want us to again unify and take care of business; raising strong black children."},{"Title":"No Disrespect","review":"I really enjoyed this novel. After reading \\"The Coldest Winter Ever\\", I knew that I had to read this book. Although \\"The Coldest Winter Ever\\" was fictional, and \\"No Disrespect\\" was more non-fictional, there are overlapping similarities. It is a novel that I felt I could not put down.Souljah talks about her life from childhood, adolescence, and then young-adulthood and reflects on those people in her life that taught her valuable lessons (whether intentionally or unintentionally). As an African American heterosexual woman, I disagree with her views on both homosexuality (I felt that she was a little homophobic and misunderstanding about that aspect of sexuality), and the extent of her talking about interracial dating, the black vs. white issue, etc. However, I respect her opinions and feel that she was speaking her life truths, and what was important in her life. I deeply respect Souljah's opinionated mind, and agree that writing is all about expressing your personal beliefs and truths."},{"Title":"No Disrespect","review":"I read \\"No Disrespect after reading \\"The Coldest Winter Ever\\", and finding that work of fiction riveting, and well -told. I found \\"No Disrespect\\" a non-fiction work that is told with the caveat - I will tell the truth, and the names are changed only to protect the innocent\\", to be poorly told, hard to believe, and self serving. Yes, I do believe it is possible to have morals and values as SS describes herself to have in this work, but the stories she writes, rather than honest, smack of someone that is holding back, or more to the point someone tailoring the story to conclude in an ending that is suitable to them. I don't mean any disrepect, but I don't buy it was the prevailing thought as I read her story."},{"Title":"No Disrespect","review":"I couldn't put this book down when I read it. Sista is cut throat and straight to the point. Like the most dedicated rapper, she speaks her mind and she's not very concerned about offending those who might disagree with her.Though I don't share her views about homosexuality, I think this book, like Assata Shakur's &quot;Assta&quot; is very important work about cultural identity. I could relate strongly to Souljah's coming into a sense of her African self. We shared the same experiences of going to college and reading about African history, by Black authors. This experience helps to shape one's cultural identity and sense of African pride.I'm sure many people will find Souljah a little egotistical, but I'm also sure she was and remains a powerful roal model for many young people.I strongly recommend this work for high school and college classrooms."},{"Title":"No Disrespect","review":"Firstly, I find it startling that Vintage would deign to publish something so poorly written. The semi-literacy of this prose (I'm being generous) does, if nothing else, suggest that Miss Souljah didn't use a ghost writer. The words, in all their ghettofied glory, are hers. Booker T. Washington would have wept. While I can appreciate to some extent this woman's pathological disgust of whites, I cannot understand the roots of her homophobia or anti-Semitism. Her easy-way-out philosophy (Everybody's to Blame Except Me) is the very thing that keeps her where she is."},{"Title":"No Disrespect","review":"Every now and then we will look at a book on a shelf, a cd next to an entertainment center or a television show and see the people whom star, sing or are the author as immortal. Like they can do no wrong, and if they do we persecute them for their flaws. We don't understand that they are flesh and blood like you and I. This book is brings you back into reality. After reading The coldest winter ever I picked up this book expecting to read about a highly enlightened woman whom's understanding is on a plateu that we as mere mortals can not forsee. Yet as I began to read I found my self saying, \\"Oh hell naw!\\" to this and \\"WHAT!\\" to that. I even found myself disliking some views while being intrigued by others. If you don't read another book you need to read this one. And read it right now. I've recommended it so much I messed around and let my own copy loose and I have to rebuy it myself for my personal collection. This is one of those books you just need to have in your collection no questions asked.Nikkea \\"Auset\\" Lewis"},{"Title":"No Disrespect","review":"This book is soooooooooooooo good.

She was able to keep my attention from start to finish. The thing about this book which was most impressive was how I was able to look at her past experiences, highs and lows, and be able to apply that to myself and my situations I've had in the past and my current ones with the opposite sex.

Her view on life in this country as a black woman was not watered down."},{"Title":"No Disrespect","review":"Sister Souljah is a writer who is no scared to express the hardships of life I think this is what makes he a very good writer, not only for the African American community but for any race and any generation. From this book I gained so much information about what really goes on in African American communities. What I really likes is how she displayed the overcoming of a strugle."},{"Title":"No Disrespect","review":"I just want to say a special peace and blessings to Souljah. I think for someone like her to get down and intimate and dirty into her life is remarkable, even more so because she is doing it for her people, particularily young African American females. Some of the experiences she had resonated deep within my spirit while many of them did not. The one thing that I think is frightful though is that if Souljah is not careful her book takes on a tone of racism. Now I understand that due to her rage, because for those who know history, it would be crazy not to be enraged and the injustice done to AfAm people. However, I think Souljah should push the idea of self-reliance more and also not be to overly romantic about Africa. Other than that, the language is raw but beautiful, Souljah lets us grow and learn with her. Who knows? Maybe down the road she will come back with something else for us.Peace"},{"Title":"No Disrespect","review":"the story is about a girl named winter santiaga,her father sells illegal drugs for a living. she has 3 younger sisters. their names is mercedes lexus and porshe. her dad eventually got caught and sent to jail. now she's struggling for survival between brooklyn and long island."},{"Title":"No Disrespect","review":"This book was beautiful.

This was really and unexpected surprise for me. I thought that she would focus more on political issues and our (African-Americans) struggles in Africa. She did focus on those issues, but she brought them to life, with the story of her life. I want her to write another book."},{"Title":"No Disrespect","review":"I throughly enjoyed this book. It has been quite an inspiration to both my husband and I to learn more about black culture. Although we were raised in the Caribbean we can still identify with the topics covered in this book. I have gleaned quite a number of child raring tips from reading this book. If you have not already done so, please go out and buy yourself a copy of this book and read it immediately."},{"Title":"No Disrespect","review":"I recently found some clips of her on Phil Donahue from the 1990's. She would whine about Back \\"victimhood\\" in a high-pitched baby voice while the show host would condescendingly encourage her to go on, all the while trying not to laugh at her.Fortunately for her, this book makes Sister Souljah look like a smart person and a great writer. Unfortunately, she also comes off as a desperate, man-starved, boyfriend-stealing wretch. For instance, she goes on one bad date after another with men who are either bums, or financially successful and incredibly conceited. I can't accuse her of being lazy; on the contrary, she works hard at putting together healthy activities for Black youth. But I felt that her anger was misdirected. She makes out Black people to be victims, while at the same time describing her own people abusing each other. She writes about how her mother's promiscuity disgusted her, and how it made her \\"rebel\\" by refusing to have sex with boys. But as an adult, she has no problem messing around with men who are already attached. Then she writes about the welfare hotels that housed the poor, and how the security guards extorted sexual favors from the female residents. But whose fault was that? White people didn't force anyone into the welfare hotels.I'd recommend the book anyway. However, I think the book needs a sequel. Most of the events in the book end around 1990, and the country has changed since; AIDS, computers, the internet, the dot-com explosion. She looks like she's changed, so it would make sense for her to write another book like this."},{"Title":"No Disrespect","review":"I know that her goal in writing this memoir (which was well-written) was to empower and educate blacks, however, I feel that she has sent a way way wrong message, doing more harm than good. It is extremely unfortunate, the circumstances blacks have endured for so long. I agree they have lost their culture, traditions, and spirtuality-I mean in a native, true to their ancenstry sense. However, she is clearly a very angry woman who would rather enable blacks to continue to feel victimized. Now, don't get me wrong, blacks are still victimized, BUT, people can only take advantage of you if you let them. In order for blacks to rise up and organize, to educate and empower, they need to let go of the crutch they have been holding on to, which has afforded them to be passive about improving their conditions. They should never ever forget their histories and their struggles, but in order to break the cycle, they must support one another for their common good, and say \\"It stops here and now.\\"- Collectively. They must make the education of their youth their top priority. They must make informed decisions when voting and hold their elected officials accountable once in office. It will not just come to them. It does not just come to anyone, the exception being the very wealthy. And if you are very wealthy it does not matter what color you are. Every day people without a fiancial advantage all have to struggle to succeed, all are faced with challenges and great odds-no matter what their color-it's not just blacks. She really preaches hate and distrust of whites which counters her proclaimed position on racism-it is total hypocrisy. It never ceases to amaze me how some can be so intelligent yet so ignorant at the same time. It is a shame that she had the opportunity to reach such a wide audience only to preach the wrong message. Big time FAIL."},{"Title":"No Disrespect","review":"Sista Souljah is about knowledge and empowering the people. So if you want to know about the survival of the black community.

I loved how she showed the reader into her personal experiences and at the end tied everything together to give a moral lesson. I liked how she showed that she even has flaws and works to try to fix them. But one thing I disagreed with was how she pointed the finger of blame at all whites for the problems African American people go through today. Yes I agree with her on the fact that the government is not doing much in the situation of lower and underclass blacks and the situation many face in the projects, but to blame all whites is a little far-fetched. If you must blame whites also look at the other side and blame some (not all) blacks also. She should stop making excuses for the black community because we can be in the wrong also.

While growing up I developed a sort of disliking to Sister Souljah because I believed that she was a loudmouthed, know-it-all that always had her nose in where it did not belong. Now that I am grown, I decided to put all those feeling to the side to read this book, by recommendation of a friend. And now I totally undertstand her. To all those that had a negative rating, you could not have experienced anything she described in this book. This book was not only educational, but it was a total eye-opener. She gave reasoning behind what some of the raters may say is racist. She is not a racist, she is only speaking through life experience - maybe some of you did not get that in depth into this book. It is obvious that African people have endured centuries of racism and to this day we still do. She only explained some of the reasons why African relationships fail. To the negative readers, it seems as if you would never understand. Hats off to Sister Souljah, she did a great job and I look forward to many more books to come."},{"Title":"No Disrespect","review":"This Sister has the right jargon.

That said, some of the text on geometry in book one can be a bit difficult to follow. Alberti also loves to name-drop, continually referring to antique painters, but this was expected at the time - the ancients lending authority and historical context. 'On Painting' gives the reader an insight into the tastes and philosophies that inform the arts.Most interesting to me, as a teacher of drawing, were the insights on the fundamentals of life drawing - such as positioning of the head relative to the feet, and the shifting of values becuase of the limitations of white paper (or paint) being the brightest 'light' available to the artist. the saying 'there is nothing new under the sun' comes often to mind - you will read many of Alberti's observations in any contemporary text.Much of this may seem irrelevant to the modern painter - for example, his comments on consistency in portrayal of the figure may have been more relevant in an age when lay figures were used and painting took hours, but nonetheless bring up key points for the thoughtful artist to consider, especially for those interested in traditional painting. Use this book in conjunction with a good pictorial survey of art history (or the internet), so that you can readily refer to the pictures he mentions.For more of my reviews and links on Old Master Drawings, visit http://drawsketch.about.com/od/oldmasterdrawing/"},{"Title":"On painting","review":"as is apparent from the other Amazon reviews. You would not read a medical treatise, or a treatise on physics written 600 years ago, unless you were interested in the crazy-strange ideas entertained by our scientific forebears, and wondered just how we ever got from there to here--but every one of the reviewers here treats this pioneering treatise on the art of painting as if it were a valid (if occasionally heavy-going) alternative to current writings on picture-making! Just for the record: 1) Before 1436, there was NO known BOOK available explaining how 3-D objects might be projected onto a 2-D surface; of course the geometrical and optics discussions in Alberti are a bit dense: he's doing it for the first time EVER, but what's really fascinating is that in 1436, the science of optics was already on the track leading to modern optics; 2) Before Alberti, NO ONE had used the term \\"composition\\" to mean \\"organic and systematic integration of all the parts of a picture (figures/objects and the spaces between them), such that the viewer is charmed by their harmony, convinced of their truth, and moved by their vividness\\"--but now we could not do without this term when referring to works of art as virtual \\"organisms\\"; 3) Alberti wasn't even a practicing artist when he wrote this book: he was a young lawyer working in the Pope's chancery, and this book is his educated response to being bowled over by his first encounter with the art of 1400s Florence; and 4) for all its classical allusions (not so rote or beside the point as one of the reviewers suggests) this book is a miracle of conciseness even today, when we've had 600 years to think about what makes Renaissance art so special: Alberti always rewards a careful, as opposed to a distracted, reading (those geometrical explanations are actually pretty clear, if you bother to visualize them), and each of his 3 chapters (or \\"books\\") is organically linked to the others. Read Martin Kemp's introduction, if you're meeting Alberti for the first time. On Painting is prodigious."},{"Title":"On painting","review":"considering that the text was written 600+ years ago is quite interesting when you think about how some of the concepts mentioned now have scientific backing and is accurate to a certain degree but it can be very hard to understand at times especially when alberti talks about perspective problems, but overall an okay book for most part, however not something i would ever read for fun"},{"Title":"On painting","review":"Book I is a leisurely introduction to the basic geometrical principles of painting. \\"I usually give my friends the following rule: the more rays are employed in seeing, the greater the quantity seen will appear. ... Furthermore, the extrinsic rays, which hold on like teeth to the whole of the outline, form an enclosure around the entire surface like a cage. This is why they say that vision takes place by means of a pyramid of rays. ... We must now speak of the median rays. These are the mass of rays which is contained within the pyramid and enclosed by the extrinsic rays ... from their contact with the surface to the vertex of the pyramid they are so tinged with the varied colours and lights they find there, that at whatever point they were interrupted, they would show the same light they had absorbed and the same colour. We know for a fact about these median rays that over a long distance they weaken and loose they sharpness. The reason why this occurs has been discovered: as they pass through the air, these and all other visual rays are laden and imbued with lights and colors; but the air too is also endowed with a certain density, and in consequence the rays get tired and lose a good part of their burden as they penetrate the atmosphere. So it is rightly said that the greater the distance, the more obscure and dimmed the surface appears. ... We call the centric ray the one which alone strikes the quantity in such a way that the adjacent angles on all sides are equal. As for the properties of the centric ray, it is of all the rays undoubtedly the most keen and vigourous. It is also true that a quantity will never appear larger than when the centric ray rests upon it. ... [A]s it is only a single surface of a panel or a wall, on which the painter strives to represent many surfaces contained within a single pyramid, it will be necessary for his visual pyramid to be cut at some point, so that the painter by drawing and colouring can express whatever outlines and colour that intersection represents. Consequently the viewers of a painted surface appear to be looking at a particular intersection of the pyramid. ... Painters prove this when they move away from what they are painting and stand further back, seeking to find by the light of nature the vertex of the pyramid from which they know everything can be more correctly viewed.\\"Now the principles of perspective and the costruzione legittima. \\"Let me tell you what I do when I am painting. ... I decide how large I wish the human figures in the painting to be. I divide the height of this man into three parts. ... With this measure I divide the bottom line ... into as many parts as it will hold. Then I establish a point ... wherever I wish; and as it occupied the place where the centric ray strikes, I shall call this the centric point. The suitable position for this centric point is no higher from the base line than the height of the man ... for in this way both the viewers and the objects in the painting will seem to be on the same plane. Having placed the centric point, I draw lines from it to each of the divisions on the base line. ... [A]s regards the successive [parallels of a tiled floor] I observe the following method. I have a drawing surface [on the canvas margin] on which I describe a single straight line, and this i divide in parts like those into which the base line of the rectangle is divided. Then I place a point above this line, directly over one end of it, at the same height as the centric point ... and from this point I draw lines to each of the divisions of the line. Then I determine the distance I want between the eye of the spectator and the painting, and, having established the position of the intersection at this distance, I effect the intersection with ... a perpendicular. ... This perpendicular will give me, at the places it cuts the other lines, the measure of what the distance should be in each case between the transverse equidistant lines of the pavement. ... A proof of whether they are correctly drawn will be if a single straight line forms the diagonal of connected quadrangles in the pavement. ... When I have carefully done these things, I draw a line across, ... which ... passes through the centric point. This line is for me a limit or boundary, which no quantity exceeds that is not higher than the eye of the spectator ... This is why men depicted standing in the parallel [to the horizon] furthest away are a great deal smaller than those in the nearer ones---a phenomenon which is clearly demonstrated by nature herself, for in churches we see the heads of men walking about, moving at more or less the same height, while the feet of those further away may correspond to the knee-level of those in front.\\"Book II also has some concrete tricks in it, most notably the veil. \\"Circumscription is the process of delineating the external outlines on the painting. ... [T]o do this well, I believe nothing more convenient can be found than the veil ... whose usage I was the first to discover. It is like this: a veil loosely woven of fine thread ... divided up by thicker threads into as many parallel square sections as you like, and stretched on a frame. I set this up between the eye and the object to be represented, so that the visual pyramid passes through the loose weave of the veil.\\"But most of all Book II discusses aesthetic principles, most of which are amusing but quite trivial, e.g. \\"if you painted centaurs in an uproar at dinner, it would be absurd amid this violent commotion for one of them to be lying asleep from drinking wine\\", and some of which are more interesting, e.g. \\"those painters who use white immoderately and black carelessly, should be strongly condemned. It would be a good thing if white and black were made from those pearls Cleopatra dissolved in vinegar, so that painters would become as mean as possible with them, for their works would then be both more agreeable and nearer the truth.\\"There is a short Book III with more mundane advice along these lines: \\"It so happens that, as rich men are often moved by kindness more than by expert knowledge of art, they will give money to one man who is especially modest and good, and spurn another who is more skilled but perhaps intemperate. For this reason it behoves the artist to be particularly attentive to his morals, especially to good manners and amiability, whereby he may obtain the good-will of others, which is a firm protection against poverty, and money, which is an excellent aid to the perfection of his art.\\""},{"Title":"Living the Catholic Social Tradition: Cases and Commentary","review":"Here is a recent example of this author's online reasoning, which he proposes others should be governed by in a free republic:\\"Let us assume that two planets which have not yet been inhabited by humans are to be colonized by them; on Planet Alpha, heterosexual couples only are assigned; on Planet Beta, only homosexual couples. In one hundred years, will both islands be populated assuming that reproductive technologies are not available to either group? I suggest that Planet Alpha will be; but Planet Beta will not. Why?

It's gonna be a helluva ride!"},{"Title":"Rapid Descent : Disaster in Boston Harbor","review":"Jack Polidoro has a writing style that will keep you turning the pages. This book is a fast read. The plot is exciting and moves. Jack has a way of making the tale come alive in your head. This book should be made into one of those disaster movies starring George Kennedy. It would be a knock-out! Jack included a generous helping of juicy sex too."},{"Title":"Rapid Descent : Disaster in Boston Harbor","review":"This is an excellent page-turner from Dr. Jack. Are there no bounds to this man's talent? Having left Boston some 2 years ago it brought back pleasant (and not so pleasant) memories and even provided me with interesting information about the Sumner and Callahan tunnels of which I never knew.The topic, style and coverage of story are incredibly well researched and delivered. This is a true suspense drama with touching underlying stories. It is a &quot;whodunnit&quot; with a carefully carved disturbing tale that will surprise you.With all the junk being published these days, this was a refreshing and dynamic read. As an incredibly busy person I greatly appreciated the short chapters, but be careful because the more you read the less you will put it down.I guarantee you will enjoy this book.When is the next one Dr. Jack??"},{"Title":"Rapid Descent : Disaster in Boston Harbor","review":"Very simply, I was unable to put this book down. Not unlike some of the other reviewers I too was on my way to Boston on business whilst reading this &quot;glued to my seat&quot; book. For the first time, I can say that I was pleased for all the flight delays as I managed to finish reading this book on route. I am an avid reader and can say without reservation that Rapid Descent was easily as good as any of the books being written by some of the better known authors, such as Crichton, Grisham, Cook etc to name a few of my favorites. Well Done Dr. Jack when's the next one....."},{"Title":"Creative Bible Crafts: Reproducible Activities Ages 2 & 3","review":"This book has easy to make, fun to make, simple crafts based on Bible themes for young children.

For that day and age it took great daring to be different but it was well worth the effort.This novel was written in 1951 and set in early 1890's Georgia. Fancy is a beautiful but illiterate woman born on the wrong side of the tracks. Although many men will fall in love with her, her heart and body belongs to Courtland Brantley, a man from a good but penniless family, who has no respect for her. Love, hate, jealousy, rivalry, retribution and, of course, race make this a novel that all can relate to.

Haley is a slight hypochondriac, and that brings a lot of humour to the book because in one passage her father tells her that hypochondria is a sickness and to look it up. Refering to the numerous times she searches on Medline. Such as when she tripped over her cat and thought to possibly have Cat Scratch Disease.She writes in her diary (aka her laptop), adressing it as JT junior (junior for short/ protection)nearly everyday about her life. She writes about her friends and their problems, about her father and his ability to have money but no real job, how her mother left her and her search to find her, her obession with JT, and the chicken pox which she got from the boy that gave her the infamous hickeys that just don't seem to disappear.My only disappointment in this book is on the back with the discription. Sure, she contacts a spirit through the Ouija board a few times, but she's not \\"that\\" into it. Nothing really happens, in fact, it takes up barely in part in the plot. It seemed to just be stuffed in there to take up a line or twenty throught the entire 2nd half of the book."},{"Title":"The Healing Time of Hickeys","review":"Have you ever kept a diary? In the book The Healing Time of Hickeys by Karen Rivers you get a chance to enter Haley's diary. Haley is a 16 year old girl who keeps a diary on her laptop computer. She names her diary Junior JT after her crush JT, but she calls her diary Junior for short. This is one of the funniest books I have ever read! If you like hilarious books or even hilarious movies, I highly recommend you read this book. Haley has never met her mom and liives with her dad who is a hippie. Her mom left her when she was a baby with her dad. Along the way, Haley gets the chicken pox, an awful haircut, and into a dilemma with a Ouija board. Will Haley ever meet her mom? Will Haley ever get her crush to fall in love with her? Will Haley ever find out what the healing time of hickeys is? You'll have to read this book to find out!"},{"Title":"The Healing Time of Hickeys","review":"Haley Andromeda was a typical teenage girl. Except for her dad being a hippie and growing pot in the basement, her having a hopeless crush on JT, one of the cutest guys in school, and being prone to hickey's from a Cutish Stanger. Ok, so she isn't so normal, but this book is definately halarious. I picked it up on one of my book store trips, and I've read it twice since then! Read it, you won't regret it."},{"Title":"The Healing Time of Hickeys","review":"Haley Andromeda Harmony is neurotic! She is an extreme hypochondriac and worries about pretty much everything. I thought this book was decently written, but I really disliked Haley's friends, Kiki and Jules. Throughout the entire book, Haley kept complaining about how she couldn't stand them and how they were always making fun of her, and 10 pages later, she was friends with them again. Kiki actually ended up being a decent friend to Haley, but Jules wasn't at all! I just don't understand why a person would be friends with someone who didn't respect them or treat them kindly. However, Haley was an authentic teenage character (albeit an overanxious one). This book was also written in epistolary format, which I've always loved. Cute, fluffy read."},{"Title":"The Healing Time of Hickeys","review":"An light enjoyable read. Karen rivers combines the style of bridget jones and Adrian Mole in this entertaining read.This is a fun laughable teen read! Great if you love those diary style books. I had a good laugh reading it!"},{"Title":"Weapons for Victory: The Hiroshima Decision Fifty Years Later","review":"Some of the most popular books on the atomic bombing of Japan are filled to a depressing extent with distortions and incaccuracies. These books argue that there was no military necessity to use the bomb. Various nonsensical theories are offered to explain its use e.g.: The bomb was deployed to provide diplomatic leverage against the Soviets or as a result of American racism. These authors routinely take many indisputable facts and ignore or twist them beyond recognition in order to justify their arguments.Robert James Maddox does a great public service by exposing these abuses of truth in Weapons for Victory. Point by point the tendentious butchering of historical source materials is exposed until there is little doubt that the methods used by these writers are the historian's equivalent of junk science. Various quotes, documents and other pieces of information are often used selectively and taken out of context. This process drastically alters the real meaning of these sources as facts are chopped up and forced to conform to predetermined conclusions. Maddox reproduces many of these misused sources in their full context and thereby shows their true meaning to be something quite different than what these authors claim. In addition, many basic facts that contradict the revisionists' claims (and that are usually ignored by them) are recited. For example, it's often said that the Japanese would have surrendered by mid-1945 if they had only been assured that their emperor could remain in place. Drawing on U.S. intercepts of Japanese diplomatic communication, Maddox shows that the Japanese wanted the emperor to remain the actual ruler of Japan, not the figurehead that he became after the surrender. Many other revisionist arguments become farcical after Maddox compares them to the documentary evidence.This book is an indispensable antidote to such widely known and wrongly respected travesties as The Decision to Use the Atomic Bomb by Gar Alperovitz and Hiroshima by Ronald Takaki. Weapons for Victory clearly exposes the malpractice of the historian's profession contained in these books. A similar work of equally high quality is Truman and the Hiroshima Cult by Robert P. Newman.The issue here is not about varying interpretations fo history, which are completely legitimate. It is about the proper and responsible use of source materials by certain authors who hold themselves out to the public as careful historians. We should all hope that despite the popular appeal of conspiracy theories and gratuitous America bashing that has propelled many revisionists to fame, good scholarship like Maddox's will still prevail."},{"Title":"Weapons for Victory: The Hiroshima Decision Fifty Years Later","review":"Unfortunately their is so much revisionist junk history about the atomic bomb and the cold war. Nuclear diplomacy, racism and other unfounded theories about the bomb have found their way into textbooks and classrooms. Anyone who does not think Truman used the bomb to end WWII quickly and with less lives lost is simply ignoring the obvious and the evidence. This book helps set the record straight. The decision to use the bomb was simple: to get Japan to stop fighting. Truman wanted to save lives and end the war: end of arguement. This book helps set the record straight."},{"Title":"Weapons for Victory: The Hiroshima Decision Fifty Years Later","review":"Mr. Maddox has done a great service in analyzing the decision to use the atomic bomb on Japan. He systematically demolishes the arguements used by those who (for whatever reason) think that the bombing was unjustified. He shows through intercepted transmissions how the Japanese were ready to commit themselves to a bloodbath to fight off an invasion and how the Japanese military still wanted to fight even after Hiroshima was destroyed. Overall, the book is great work and should be required reading in schools and the Smithsonian Museum."},{"Title":"Lotto Winning Wheels for Powerball & Mega Millions","review":"I bought this book, because I thought I will get some new insights on the big money lotteries, but I do not think there is anything of value there. I have the older book of Gail Howard; used to play Fantasy 5; 2 of 5 and 3 of 5 are the highest prizes I have ever won. Do not get caught by the hype: This book won't tell you how to win the big money lotteries - in fact, all that Gail Howard says is that it's very difficult to predict the Powerball ball, and the Powerball ball cannot be wheeled anyway. Guess I shouldn't have spent my money to learn that... The book is no different from her previous book, Lotto Wheel Five to Win. Well, the new one has some shorter wheels than the previous one (that is why I give two stars), but if you are into wheeling, you will be able to find them elsewhere. The book has a very long section (some 20+ pages) of ads about Howard's other books and software. Hey, you pay for that too! You'd be better off spending your $$ on a couple of extra tickets..."},{"Title":"Lotto Winning Wheels for Powerball & Mega Millions","review":"This is nothing new from Gail Howard, or at all.

There is no amount of strategy unless you are already rich. And believe it or not rich people play too. They can buy 100 tickets week. I cannot.

I doubt any. It is all luck, pure and simple."},{"Title":"Lotto Winning Wheels for Powerball & Mega Millions","review":"So wonderfuly wrapped up in Gail Howard's Lottery Master Guide that I did not even look at this one until 24 hours before the last mind blowing powerball. Then I discovered the fabulous, easy to follow instructions and steps I can take for very little money.I am dyslexic and was intially afraid of this because of the wheeled groups and number selection. I need not have been because it was easy and very satisfying-just did not have enough time to win this last Mega Millions. Sure, I went over it twice but most people wouldn't have to, my neighbor said it was so easy that she bought the same book. Lots of interesting points like five winning numbers, quick picks, number selection method, wheeled groups-all made simple through step by step instructions. Gail Howard has a way of explaining and laying out concepts that make it all very easy to understand. That is very rare in this genre of books and I have read through many of them-many seem to be directly copying her. She is the one who has been around the longest and she came up with the original wheeling systems-I found something she had written years before any of these other books were out. This really is the author to follow.Lots of suggestions of how to win with very little money(under twenty dollars-my current limit and some much, much lower). I love this! There are powerballs all over the world and throughout the US this applies to and I am going to make sure I get around to all of them. You can be sure I will be reading the rest of these books."},{"Title":"Lotto Winning Wheels for Powerball & Mega Millions","review":"I bought this book and sent it to my sister who lives in a Powerball state.

Now there is finally a book on how to tackle the big Powerball and Mega Millions games!Who else but Lottery guru Gail Howard can give you maximum and minimum win guarantees and balanced wheels with no holes? You can wheel games for as little as $2 up to 100's if you choose to do so. Powerball and Mega Million games are great for pool playing since the odds of winning are so much higher than regular lottery games. The Mega Millions game has odds of over 1 in 135 million! Wow! So what chance do you have of winning these type games? How about tipping the scale in your favor?This book will show you how to take advantage by way of wheeling numbers to get you multiple prizes. Myself, I found this book an eye opener and there is none other on the market that can compare. You can also view the excerpts of this book and see what is inside right here online.Learn how to play smart and win multiple prizes instead of buying random generated quickpicks! Take charge and pick your own numbers and wheel them. While any win, anyhow, is nice, it is a much nicer feeling inside knowing that you picked the numbers yourself! (I have found this to be so true over and over with the wins I have had in the past). :-)One unique feature called: \`Budget Wheel Finder by Ticket Cost' and \`Budget Wheel Finder by Numbers to Wheel' help you quickly locate the right wheel to use for the amount of numbers you want to wheel and the amount of money you want to spend on tickets. This is great as you don't have to spend a set amount each time you play.Currently, the Powerball and Mega Millions games have 9 layers of prizes including the Jackpot itself. Here in NY we are part of the Mega Millions game. How about winning $175,000 cash by getting 5 numbers right? Wouldn't that be nice? Almost every drawing there is a winner(s) of this amount and the lesser amounts available for the taking, and no reason now with the info and wheels in this new book, why it can't be YOU!So if you play the Powerball and/or the Mega Millions Lottery games and feel overwhelmed by the odds, you need this book to help you win these games!"},{"Title":"The Kings of Judah","review":"I have not quite fininshed reading this Book, I have 2 more Kings to get through, However, this Book contains information that is missing from the Bible.

The thought of Divine Substitution and the Sacrifice of God on man's behalf could never have suggested itself to the most educated of all God's creatures.\\"From Sermon #577: \\"Luther caught this note. Many there were who said, \`The Church of Rome has in it good and true men--let us try and reform her. Her cloisters are not without piety, her priests are not without sanctified lives--let us try and restore her purity.' But Luther heard the voice of God, \`Come you out from among her, lest you be partakers of her plagues,' and therefore he led the van, taking for his watchword, \`Let us go forth outside the camp.'...Those who come out with Christ, get this reproach--they are too precise--in fact, they are \`bigots.' That is how the world brings it out at last--\`bigots'--a set of \`bigots!' I have heard say that the word, \`bigot,' took its rise from this--that a certain Protestant nobleman being commanded, in order to gain his lands, to kneel down and in some way or other commit the act of idolatry towards the host, said, when he came at last to the point, \`By God, I will not!' And they called him henceforth a \`By-God.'

No, it is \`God my Savior,' just such words as the sinner who is speaking to you might use, and such expressions as you sinners who are hearing me can use, too. She needs a Savior. She feels it.

The concept of linkage is interesting, the four critics achieve an admirable synthesis, the price is right, and the books are full of useful information, plans and excellent photographs. Sadly, their accessibility has been compromised by a wildly self-indulgent designer who squandered eight pages on headline type, overlaid body type with shadow typography, and jammed in far too many miniscule images and discordant typefaces. Its a lesson in how not to lay out a book and may scare away potential buyers.The persistent will be rewarded by graceful writing, especially by the peripatetic Dubliner, Raymund Ryan, and Catherine Slessor, executive editor of the Architectural Review. For the record, the architects covered are, in order: Antoine Predock, Tadao Ando, Wiel Arets and Ricardo Legorretta; David Chipperfield, Waro Kishi, Eduoardo Souto de Moura, and Tod Williams &amp; Billie Tsien; Jones Partners, TEN Arquirtectos, RoTo, and Smith-Miller + Hawkinson; finally, Enric Miralles, Gunter Behnisch, Mecanoo, and Patkau Architects."},{"Title":"Stream of consciousness in the modern novel (Perspectives in criticism)","review":"Consciousness is a metaphysical abstraction that all people can account for, but few can clearly explain. I have researched a decent amount of books appertaining to consciousness in literature and this one by Humphrey is by far the best. Humphrey's explanations for authorial intent are superb. I will not lie: I have attempted to write a few sentences explaining Humphrey's materialization of consciousness in Modern literature, but I have erased them all in fear that the reader of this review would be turned away from this book by my petty attempt to explain just how masterfully Humphrey articulates thought patterns, memories, and the removal of the authors voice from the work. If your interested in learning how to write a disciplined form of stream of consciousness vs. its juvenile counterpart, \\"free-writing\\" then i HIGHLY recommend this book to you.

Never grew up with guns, never stood with his hand over his heart reciting the Pledge of Allegiance.. He went on a mission to \\"Gods country\\" TEXAS and shot 2 AR-15 's one happened to be full auto. Well after shooting 2 30 round mags you woulda thought the 2 nd coming had happenef. Boyyyyyyy they kick and are POWERFULL lol shoulda messed with the buffer tube and really give his shoulder a wiork out. He even played the MSNBC video of the pro gunners haggling the dad ( Piers failed to tell everyone that MSNBC edited the video to make gun owners look bad. Nooooooo its (OBAMAVISION!!) And Furher Obama cant wrap it around his Narcissstic mind that ANYONE would disagree with him and were all wrong and a bunch of bloody idiots!! The panel deliberatly misquoted and misled the audience in the statistics given. He sounds like a damn Parakeet but instead of sqwaking whatever u want Piers keeps sqwaking (AR- AR-AR-AR) ohhhhh does piers wianna cracker???????. Anyways it doesnt stop there. I dont know why one of his guests hasnt popped him in his mouth . Piers Morgan is a far cry from Anderson Cooper on 360. Least anderson is quiet and respects all views and lets each person have their min or 2 min of UNINTERUPTED screen time. Not with ole Piers Morgan, if you are pro gun or disagree with HIS views he heckles you butts in wont let u finish is very rude, condesending. Cuts your answers off to fit what he wants to hear. Im serious next time he is on about guns try and disagree with him and he does the polly act AR, AR, AR Why, Why,Why. Then he dont let you answer. I wished he would have me on their i would educate him and everyone that is ignorant to what they are speeling and regurgitating because of MSNBC,CNN, Piers Morgan and every other warp sided news media that is controlled by Obama and his underlings.

It is severely obsolete, and in some areas it is incorrect and was incorrect even when it was written. I strongly recommend that it be abandoned by anyone who desires to write and speak correctly. There are many good, current books on grammar and mechanics. This book speaks of rhetoric as if it were some kind of monster; the truth is that the meaning of rhetoric has changed over the last 2500 years, and at present a good working definition is \\"the art of speaking and writing clearly and persuasively.\\"What needs to be addressed by the person who wants to speak and write correctly is, and I agree with the author on this, grammar, using a mixture of descriptive and prescriptive grammar. Descriptive grammar describes the language as it is used; prescriptive grammar describes language as it should be used. Both are subject to change; in fact, the only way to stop a language from changing is to kill it.Do you want to improve your speech and writing? Then consider these things:Who is my intended audience? What do I know about that audience?What is my intention in this speech or this piece of writing? Do I want to inform, sell, entertain, inspire, or what?Exactly what information do I intend to convey? How can I best convey this information to this audience?What vocabulary should I use? Is this audience comfortable with the jargon of the topic? Is it necessary for me to explain at every step?What format should I use? Is it appropriate to begin with, and/or insert, humor, or do I need to keep this extremely simple?Are there visual aids that I can use? People remember more of what they're shown that they do of what they're told.This book is not going to teach you these things, and I know that without reading it because it has bogged down so badly in grammar.

The book covers a similar format in 10 areas: cognition, environments, achievement and test performance, music/arts, memory, mind/body, nutrition, enrichment, early years, and the fragile brain. Each article gives a succinct summary of the issues based on research data, &quot;Action Steps&quot; and sources. There are just too many interesting and relevant topics. A few examples: &quot;Is Chocolate Good for Learning?&quot;, &quot;The 'Mozart Effect' Under Fire: Where Do We Go From Here?&quot;, &quot;Why Some Learners Strive on Stress?&quot;, &quot;Learning a New Language in Early Childhood Requires Less Brain Effort&quot;, &quot;Neuroplasticity: How Do We Change Our Brain?', &quot;The Biology of Cheating&quot;... There are many passages that you wish to quote and teach the students. Teachers and school administrators can also make better decisions based on reliable information supplied by the book.Compared to Jensen's other books with even more illustrations, I hope this book could be improved in the next edition. E.g., can you make sense of the following? &quot;Research suggests that fonts with serifs (referring to the short lines stemming at an angle from the upper and lower ends of the stroke of a letter) increase reading speed rates when compared to sans serif fonts (without seifs).&quot; (p. 10) A sketch of the anatomy of the brain would help for visualising many terms throughout the book. E.g. in &quot;Gender Differences and Learning Performance&quot;, unless you have some background already, it would be hard to know what is being compared (pp. 69-71). Of course you can start with other introductory books first. Overall, this is a very valuable and interesting book for all educators."},{"Title":"Learning Smarter: The New Science of Teaching","review":"This is an excellent resource, and while primarily written for the elementary or secondary school teacher, there are plenty of suggestions and scenarios for parents too. The book focuses on what can be done to encourage smart learning. There is some mention of the research, but again, the focus is on the \\"how\\" and not as much on the \\"why\\". It does not try to be a book on the psychology of learning, but a how-to book to improvement in learning.Experienced teachers will find themselves agreeing with many of the points made in the book, but there are quitely likely additional techniques and strategies to incorporate into your everyday toolbox. For the younger teacher, this is an excellent way to add a few more years of experience under your belt, with very much less effort.I most heartily suggest this, but more importantly share this information with your colleagues. No man is an island, and it is not very effective to be the only one teaching: \\"learning smarter\\"."},{"Title":"Learning Smarter: The New Science of Teaching","review":"I am very pleased with this order.

The book covers basic cross-cultural adaptation, language management, localization techniques, tools and automation. Of particular interest to anyone facing large-scale globalization and internet issues will be Rose Lockwood's article on CaterPillar's Machine Translation (MT) and Controlled Authoring (I've been digging for this kind of information for a while), Carmen Lange and Winfield Bennett's study of MT and and Translation Memory at Baan, Gary Jaekel's coverage of Terminology Management at Ericsson, and a very timely piece by Susan Cheng of Idiom on the globalization of e-Commerce sites. On the down-side I would liked to have seen more of BiDirectional L10N and I18N issues, and respository-based translation, but that's a small criticism on balance. This is a book that can be recommended for seasoned professionals and people who are new to the L10N, I18N aspects of globalization, or for anyone who just wants to appreciate the range of issues that face companies who need to provide culutrally appropriate content cheaply, efficiently and of sufficient quality.

However this book is a very personal and insightful series of vignettes from her childhood to her years as a Boston debutante in the twenties.Hale's stories describe a world of posh dinner parties, childhood outings, deb parties but all with keen insight into the fleeting nature and underlying poignancy of life. A elaborate dessert is crumbled as guests chatter, a child's fair is turned to the purposes of an adult social climber, a precious ring is lost.This is a wonderful memoir of the life of an affluent but aware young lady and subtly witty and ironic. Aside from that her stories of chilhood and early womenhood are wonderful to read as she attends school, dancing lessons, her first parties in a era that has passed. For a young women or adults a wonderful book."},{"Title":"A New England Girlhood","review":"I've loved this book since I was a teenager, because it transported me to another place and era, much like _A Tree Grows in Brooklyn_, which is another wonderful book for a teenager to read with pleasure, and then read again as an adult with different kinds of delight. Hale has a marvelous ability to capture the way the world feels to a child -- the nausea created by school bullies, the amazement of a New England beach to a kid equipped with a brand new bucket and shovel. And, even though as a teen I was dancing to the Rolling Stones at school dances, rather than attending subdeb parties with ushers and stag lines, I found so many of my teen anxieties captured in this book. Hale finds all the magic in even those little crevices of ordinary living that most of us have forgotten about and with her delicate humor she just pulls out a tiny irony, drops it on the page and moves on. For those who wonder what it was like to live near Boston before WW1 and who enjoy books that really capture the detail and fragrance of earlier days, this will be a real treat!"},{"Title":"Fordlandia: A Novel","review":"If you find bold business endeavors fascinating, and you're intrigued by the colossal mistakes of one of the 20th century's greatest entrepreneur, then I must recommend this book.

Thus, all the information is in one paragraph, making it rather difficult to find the character combination (i.e., the word) one is looking for)*Lack of some character combination (perhaps because the book is a translation of an actual Chinese dictionary, it does not include some important character combinations; this is very unfortunate, for it is an excellent dictionary overall)This dictionary and the Concise English-Chinese Chinese-English Dictionary (ISBN 0195911512) are an excellent combination."},{"Title":"Xinhua Dictionary with English Translation (Chinese Edition)","review":"I am just starting the study of Mandarin Chinese with traditional characters.I just wish to emphasize what a previous reviewer correctly said: this dictionary is based on simplfied characters, as used in mainland China and Singapore. The radical and character index tables list the characters according to the number of strokes in the simplified character forms. The traditional characters are listed in each entry, but it is not easy to find them if you don't know the pinyin pronunciation or the simplified form. The radical table also has cross-reference entries for the traditional forms of the radicals, but this only helps a little.The other version of this dictionary, Xinhua Dictionary with English Translation, published by Commercial Press, Hong Kong, ISBN 9620702530, is almost the same product, but based on traditional characters, as used in Taiwan, Hong Kong, and many expatriate communities. Its radical and character index tables list the characters by the number of strokes in the traditional character, with the simplified character listed in the entry if there is one. The radical table in this version has cross-reference entries for the simplified forms of the radicals. And as the previous reviewer said, this version has nicer printing and binding.I purchased both, but you may not need both, depending on your own requirements."},{"Title":"Xinhua Dictionary with English Translation (Chinese Edition)","review":"I have found this book to be very helpful because it has what many Chinese dictionaries do not have: a breakdown of every Chinese character into its &quot;zhuyin&quot; form. Most dictionaries limit their pronunciations to just the &quot;pinyin.&quot; However, in order to pronounce the words as accurate as possible, it is best to use the &quot;zhuyin&quot; form. Knowing the &quot;zhuyin&quot; form will also help if you ever need to look up a word in a Chinese dictionary according to its pronunciation. Every word in this book is alphabatized by its &quot;pinyin,&quot; but it lists each word's Chinese character first, then the &quot;pinyin,&quot; and then its &quot;zhuyin.&quot; One minor thing about the book is how it lists the simplified characters. In most cases it provides the traditional form, but I would prefer it list the traditional characters first. The print is not too small and easy to read. If you need to look up the definition of a Chinese word, then this is a great resource for looking it up using English letters."},{"Title":"Xinhua Dictionary with English Translation (Chinese Edition)","review":"Good points:1. You can look up a word by either pinyin, radical, or number of strokes.2. There are lots of obscure characters in this dictionary that you don't find in most others. For example, some characters have been invented to correspond to the name of some single, particular place. Also they have characters like \\"',\\" which is meant to be \\"greenish black.\\"3. There is Zhuyin notation (used nowhere else in the world except Taiwan).4. Both simplified and traditional characters are in this book.5. Appendices that have things such as dynasty dates and measurements and the Periodic Table.Bad points:1. The obscure characters here are nice (=neat little oddities), but it seems like a lot of space is taken with words that no one uses.2. The organization of the definitions is not as nice as the Martin Manser dictionary. So, the Manser-style would be to have character X, and then subheadings for X1, X2, X3....., where each subheading corresponded to a new word. Under the subheading would be a (1)pinyin with tone marks for both of the characters; (2) sometimes a sample sentence for using the word. There is *something* like that in this dictionary, but it is just not as clear.Overall, this dictionary is useful mainly for its expansion of obscure characters. It's definitely just a translation of the Xinhua Dictionary, and not meant for beginning students of the language."},{"Title":"Xinhua Dictionary with English Translation (Chinese Edition)","review":"i got this for my son who wants to go to china. he is pleased and is starting to speak a little of the language already. good book."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"The upcoming publication of Auel's fifth book has renewed my interest in the EarthChildren series. I'm now re-reading the books and reviewing the first, which I originally read almost 18 years ago. Am I allowed to reminisce like this? Am I out of bounds? Well, don't try to stop me. This book is still clear in my mind after nearly two decades. In the early 80's, I thumbed through it at an Albertson's checkout line, finished the first chapter, and told my parents about it. I received it a week later for my birthday...and loved every minute of the story. Jean Auel's narrative powers swept me into a past rich and alive with people, creatures, smells, and sights that are immediately familiar, yet breathtakingly foreign. That's what first caught my attention. Then I began to care about Ayla, the skinny, pale child caught in an earthquake. I followed her story with keen interest and ached over her insecurities and alienation. This is a story about people with all the feelings and emotions of you and me. And though some tried to ban the book for one particular scene of forced sex, I found it in no way glorifying the act. In fact, as a teenager, it made me more aware of a female's struggle in a male-dominated society. I'll never forget the experience--indeed, that's what it was!--of reading this novel. To go back and relive the story of Ayla all over again is a treat. I can't wait for &quot;The Shelters of Stone.&quot; Only rarely does an author create a world so rich and believable that we could almost call it home."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"To celebrate the upcomming release of Jean M. Auel's new Earth Series release, The Land of Painted Caves, due March 29th, 2011, we have a bargain kindle release of the first book in the series.If you have not read this series, you are in for a treat. The novels are set 18,000 year ago at a time when the Cromagnon (us) and Neanderthal people coexist. Although certain poetic license is taken with the series, the novels are thouroughly reseached and have received a great deal of praised for their accuracy.Ayla is a five-year old Cro-Magnon girl who is suddenly orphaned and left homeless by an earthquake that destroys her family's camp. She is found, near death, by a group of Neanderthal people, the \\"Clan\\" who are looking for a new home after their cave is destroyed in the same earthquake. A brother and sister, Iza, the medicine woman of the group, and Creb, the \\"Mog-ur\\" or shaman, adopt the young girl. The first book in the series focuses on Ayla's experience growing up amoung the Clan where she never quite fits in because of the differences in her nature. She lacks the Clan's strenght and 'memories' but is quicker to learn and to adapt to new circumstances.If this doesn't sound like your cup of tea - at least try the sample anyway. This is a truely extraordinary series that no one should miss. Fans wait patiently for years as each new book is researched and written, and then savor it as an extraordinary treat.Other books in the series are:The Valley of Horses ... Ayla leaves the clan to find others like herself and meets Jondular, the love of her lifeThe Mammoth Hunters ... Ayla's first experience with a group of her own peopleThe Plains of Passage ... Ayla's and Jondular's journey back to Jondular's homelandThe Shelters of Stone ... Ayla's and Jondular's experiences when they arive back at his home."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"This amazing book remains one of my favorites ever. This might sound 'sappy', but it's true! With beautiful writing, a well-researched setting, an engrossing plot, and lovable, if debatably human, characters, what more could one ask for in a novel? I normally read fantasy, and this exotic, nearly made-up setting sometimes qualifies at that -- but this is simply better than just about every fantasy novel out there!Set in Ice Age Asia, this chronicles the life of a woman named Ayla. It begins with her as a young child, orphaned, who is adopted into a clan of Neandertals. Just about every novel I've read including Neandertals has them act human -- but these people are individual and distinguished from their Cro-Magnon contemporaries, without acting in the slightest like caveman savages. Jean Auel explains their larger brain mass, factoring it into the personality of the members of the 'Clan of the Cave Bear' (describing all of this race, not merely the clan Ayla is adopted into).The young Ayla is different from the Clan people -- while not exactly 'smarter', she is far more creative. Not only that, but she's a tomboy. She defies Clan tradition by acting male -- something Clan females would never have considered. Yet the Clan members are no less special for their traditional actions. Iza, the clan medicine woman, and Creb ( a 'mog-ur', or shaman), are wonderful characters. And Ayla is amazing, throughout her life in the book.Giving away the plot in this would be pointless. But &quot;The Clan of the Cave Bear&quot; -did- make me cry at the end. I don't see how anyone couldn't cry. I've cried at it every time I've read it. It's just that beautiful.I'd definitely recommend this book to anyone. If you haven't already ordered this...do so! It's great. The only complaint I have about this is Ayla's ingenuity. She manages to come up with so many new ideas, ones that would be revolutionary even by Cro-Magnon standards, that it didn't seem realistic. Still, this doesn't detract from the story at all.5 stars out of 5, no question about it."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"The story's compelling, but often Auel's writing comes off as amateurish -- the quickness that Ayla grasps certain concepts, for example, such as when she guesses at the true cause of childbirth, or that she is \\"ugly\\" compared to Clan women, happen far too abruptly, even if she is a modern human. Something more dubious, though probably more forgivable if looking at the book as a work of fiction, is her decision to give the Neanderthal characters the gift of \\"racial memory,\\" an ability to regain memories of their ancestors. that is connected to the enlargement of their brains toward the back.Secondly, Auel's writing is not advanced enough to allow her to 'show' things rather than 'tell' them. This applies both to her characters and the society she is trying to depict. Most of the time, the characters -- Ayla being the exception, probably because it is easier for us (and Auel) to understand a character who is 'human' in the same way we are -- come off as somewhat flat. Potentially interesting character traits that Auel insists that these characters have are often negated when they act or speak. For example, she tells us that Creb is feared -- or at least seen as 'cold' -- by the Clan, but we never see this. She never shows us Creb's tenderness towards Ayla, we're merely told he feels it; She never shows us that Brun doubts his own authority, she simply tells us he does; both Creb and Iza treat Ayla with less love than we're told they feel for her. In addition, the 'formal' Clan way of speaking comes off as stilted and doesn't ring true, even if it's supposed to be a translation of sign language.This same concept applies to Auel's depiction of the Clan society itself. She consistently fails to SHOW us the way the Clan functions -- she usually is forced to make a long digression from the story to explain to us a certain part of their way of life that is necessary for understanding the next part of the story; this has the double downside of being distracting and boring, as well as giving us a big clue as to what's about to happen -- she doesn't have the skill to use foreshadowing in any long-term or meaningful way. The effect is, of course, that by the end of the novel Auel's writing is entirely predictable.But despite all of her faults as a writer, Auel is clearly a knowledgeable person, and even her digressions don't fail to carry some interest. Her prose, if not sophisticated, is usually clear, even if it does occasionally feel like reading a text book when she wanders too far from the story, or if she renders most of her characters faceless."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"I read this book for the first time more than 10 years ago, and I found it fascinating. I have read it again from cover to cover at least twice since then. It is very well researched, and I couldn't put it down. I wish I knew where Ms. Auel got all the information she did on the herbs and plants that she describes in her book, that the characters (Iza and Ayla) use for medicine. Some of them (like the willow bark) I know for a fact were used, and I wonder if all of the other herbs and plants really work the way she describes... Guess I'll have to check on herb and plant books for that matter! In any case, I also read the other books of the series (The Valley of Horses, The Mammoth Hunters and Plains of Passage), and I regularly check to see if Ms. Auel has published another book of this series. Hurry Ms. Auel, there are a lot of us waiting to hear what happened to Ayla."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"I've read Clan of the Cave Bear so many times, that I've had to buy another copy. Along with her other books in the series, this is a must for everyone's personal collection. Jean M Auel weaves so much historical data in between the story lines,in fact, it is an integral part of all that makes up Ayla's life. The strength of the heroine combined with her human limitations makes Ayla come alive for the reader. I am driven to find out as much about Ayla as I can in reading this book and in the three succeeding novels in the series that continue with Ayla's saga. The books are grand, epic tales of a young woman's growing up and maturing in prehistoric times. Losing her family in an earthquake, 5 year old Ayla sets out in search of other humans in a sparsely populated prehistoric Europe. A clan of Neanderthals stumble across an unconscious, lion mauled Ayla. The Medicine Woman of the group,Iza, cares for Ayla. The clan is initially wary of Ayla, the first of &quot;the others&quot; that they have encountered, but she is gradually accepted by them. She has much to overcome, and Clan of the Cave Bear concludes in line with Ayla's difficulites through out the entire book. The story is picked up in &quot;Valley of the Horses&quot;. I recommend that you read the entire series, and then wait, like the rest of us Auel-o-philes for the next book in this series. It's been over ten years since the last book (Plains of Passage)and I think I can speak for everyone when I say: Please Publish SOON!"},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"I read this book, and the rest of the series, when I was in high school. I think every woman who reads these books wants to model herself after Ayla. Brave, honest, beautiful, sincere - I mean, what more could you ask for? Her totem is a cave lion, for pete's sake! Jean M. Auel has an extraordinary gift for making her characters so real and alive - Ayla was probably my best friend when I was 16. She made me take a hard look at who I was and how I wanted the world to see me, and she gave me courage to overcome some of the teenage social situations I thought I would just never make it through. Funny how a work of fiction can make such an impact on your life. I love this entire series, and The Clan of the Cave Bear started it all. (just a note: I wouldn't recommend these books to anyone under 16 - some strong sexual content)"},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"Earth Children Series:1.)THE CLAN OF THE CAVE BEARS2.)THE VALLEY OF HORSES3.)THE MAMMOTH HUNTERS4.)PLAINS OF PASSAGE5.)THE SHELTERS OF STONEWhat more can I say that 244 Amazon reviewers has not. This book is full of adventure and it let readers see through the past, on how early humans (cro-mags) live their life. Their cultures, beliefs, custom and tradition. Ayla, being born to Others was found almost dying by one of the Clan of the Cave Bears. She was eventually adopted by them and have to adjust to her new family, new environment. The challenge was overwhelming and I ache for the little girl. But then again, this is also where I admire her courage, strength and determination. The affection between Ayla, Creb and Iza was a heart warming read. I admit some parts of this book falls a bit verbose, other parts I find a bit far fetch or a bit hard to believe considering the time plot. I am not an Anthropologist so I may be wrong but Ayla's intelligence of finding and realizing things on her own sometimes left me doubtful especially for a girl her age. However, it's really not too deep to distract me. In fact, it piqued my interest all the more and made me read on. Overall, this book is imaginative, educational, entertaining and worth your time.This is definitely a different reading material compare to my usual historical romance novels but I am thankful my mother in law suggested this book to me. It's the first of Ms. Auel's Earth Children Series. I am now in the middle of the second book of the series and so far, it is as interesting as this one. My mother in law waited 10 years for the fifth installment of this series and I'm glad I don't have to wait that long. It'll be out next year, 2002."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"Although this book kind of falls apart if you try to look at it as a realistic view of how human life was 35,000 years ago, If you view it simply as a fantasy novel it turns into a very good book.The story is not especially original (outsider is adopted into a society, big changes start to occur, etc...), but it is carried off very well. But where the book really stands out is in the detailed, sometimes almost too detailed, picture of the world. The author clearly knows the world, the animals, the plants, the conditions exceptionally well, and only rarely does she really go overboard in the detailing of this information.Although at times the structure is kind of awkward, especially when characters are thinking, it is a fascinating, absorbing and hard-to-put-down book with likeable, understandable characters.I definately recommend this book to everyone."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"When young Ayla's parents are killed in an earthquake, the 5-year-old is left to wander the pre-historic earth on her own. She roams for days, looking for other people, following a stream into the vast wilderness. Overcome by hunger and thirst, Ayla is attacked by a lion. Narrowly escaping death, the small girl manages to squeeze herself into a crevice to hide from the lion. The lion's paw can fit into the crevice and the lion scratches Ayla, leaving severe gashes. Thirst finally drives her from her hiding place and she passes out near a stream.At the same time, the Clan of the Cave Bear, the neolithic peoples we think of as \\"cavemen\\" happen upon the dying child. The Clan's medicine woman, Iza, takes pity on the child, even though she is of the Others, and begs the Clan leader to let her nurse the child back to health. Grudgingly, Iza is allowed to care for the child and Ayla is eventually accepted as part of the Clan. What appears as a great stroke of luck for the child, being saved by the Clan, also becomes one of the hardest things Ayla will ever have to do. She must learn to speak the Clan's language, a language not of words, but of gestures and sounds. She has to learn Clan customs and taboos and how to behave as a proper Clan child. If all of that weren't enough, Ayla also has to deal with the mockery and scorn of the Clan leader's son, Broud. Broud hates Ayla and does everything within his power to torment the little girl.As Ayla grows older, Iza trains Ayla in the ways of the medicine woman to ensure Ayla a place in the Clan when Iza and her brother Creb, Ayla's adopted parents, die. In secret, Ayla begins learning to care for herself. She finds an old sling that was discarded by one of the Clansmen. Ayla teaches herself how to use the sling, which is strictly forbidden by Clan rules.As Ayla continues to grow older, she struggles with her own place in the Clan, a group to which she doesn't belong. She tests the boundaries and borders of the group dynamic and in some cases, she pays a terrible price for learning those lessons.Friends have been recommending this novel to me for years, but I was somewhat reluctant to pick it up. I had seen the horrible Darryl Hannah movie that was made in the late '80s, and though I shouldn't have, I judged the book by the movie. Recently, though, it was recommended to me once again and I decided I would give it a whirl. I am completely glad that I did. The Clan of the Cave Bear was totally and completely spellbinding. I didn't want to put the book down. Jean M. Auel, the author, is quite talented. She brings the characters and the settings to life in such a vivid manner that the reader forgets their modern surroundings while reading and is transported to the ancient world of the Clan. Her moving and beautiful portrayal of the Clan and Ayla are simply magnificent.I highly recommend this book to everyone."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"Jean M. Auel's \\"Clan of the Cave Bear\\" is an epic adventure into our human past. Four-year-old Ayla lives happily with her prehistoric family until an earthquake takes her entire family away from her and leaves her to fend for herself. In this harsh world where humans are not on the top of the food chain, Ayla escapes death. Her saviors are a clan of bipedal cousins to her own homo sapien family.Ayla has to adopt the ways of the new clan and withstand an onslaught of taunts from antagonist, who feel the outsiders do not belong in the \\"Clan of the Cave Bear.\\" With the help of Iza (Ayla's new mother) and medicine man Creb, Ayla prospers in her new home.What makes this story great is the dynamic descriptions Auel gives us on her views of how the world of man triumphed after the last ice age. Reading \\"Clan of the Cave Bear\\" gave me a refreshing break from the hustle and bustle of the Twenty-First Century."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"Auel deserves credit for all the research she has done, and for the concept of this story, set before recorded history. The reason I picked up the book was because I thought it would be fascinating to read about people from that time period. Unfortunately, Auel is a much better researcher than she is a fiction writer. She spends just about every single page in this long book TELLING the reader what people did and thought, rather than showing. This becomes T.E.D.I.O.U.S. I picked up the book to read it, but I never did. Instead, I skimmed it because the writing was so flat.In reading comments by others who have read this book, I conclude that there are two distinct types of people who read fiction. One type does not mind being told, as in the old storytelling tradition, where listeners sat around and were told what characters did. There were no scenes, just narration. The other type wants from fiction the kind of showing, the kind of richly developed characters, the kind of tension and drama created by novelists such as Charles Dickens or Mark Twain. Sometimes it seems to me that never the twain (pun intended!) shall meet."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"I picked up \\"Clan of the Cave Bear\\" years ago when I had nothing else to read. I was immediately enthralled and hooked...couldn't believe there was a series and quickly read all available. It was truly difficult to wait for the last 2 books to be written and published...as of now I am anxiously awaiting for \\"The Painted Caves\\" to come out in March 2011...The story line in \\"Clan\\" shows how life may have been in pre-historic times with the co-existence of two species..the Cro-magnon and the Neanderthal...While the differences are obvious they are also alike in many ways...Ayla, a five year old Cro Magnon child, is left orphaned when her family is lost during an earthquake. She is found, near death, by a clan of Neanderthal searching for a new cave following the same earthquake. Their lives are immediately intertwined. I won't give anymore away..it's is too good to tell anything else.. Suffice it to say that you will be unable to put it down! I envy anyone having that first reading experience of this series."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"This whole series of books is magnificent. So unique, such a wonderful heroine. There are a lot of details in these books, and it's easy to get bogged down in them, but you just have to look at it as a learning experience. Other than that, this book is fantastic. Moving and inspiring. Could teach people today a thing or two about racism. The only thing I would caution is that I bought this to go with my set, which are the normal size for novels and this book is like a foot high. Not what I thought I was getting. But the text itself is fabulous!!"},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"This saga is a creative story and is probably the tightest book in the series (mostly before Ayla becomes a bit of a \\"Mary Sue\\" character. It also has some absolutely fascinating descriptions of what prehistoric life might have been like - it's even well researched, though now some of the theories that Auel decided to go with are outdated."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"Absolutely THE best book (and series) ever written. Jean Auel creates a world you want to be a part of over and over again. I have read the entire series at least 8 times. Ayla and her family are characters you will never forget.Warning: once you read this series, other pale in comparison."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"Ayla is a carefree young girl (five years of age) with long blonde hair, a small nose, a lean build, and clear blue eyes. A Cro-Magnon girl, she lives with her family near a river. But when a devastating earthquake leaves her with no one but herself to rely on, the lonely little girl must wander the forest using what little survival skills she has to stay alive. After giving it her all, she finally collapses and is near death when a traveling group of Neanderthal people (called \\"The Clan of the Cave Bear\\" in honor of the cave bear spirit they worship) come upon her. The kind-hearted medicine woman of the group, Iza, takes Ayla in and soon she is learning the ways of The Clan and is slowly forgetting her past language and culture. But her \\"ugliness\\" in comparison to the stocky, dark-haired, dark-eyed people of the clan and her constant rebellion against The Clan's strict rules continually seem to seperate her from her new family. Even Iza and Ayla's adopted father, Creb, the Mog-Ur (magician) of The Clan, begin to doubt her ability to be one of their kind. And the proud, self-absorbed soon-to-be-leader of the Clan doesn't make things any easier on her as he begins to develop a deep hatred for the girl that causes him to explode on her with anger and violence. It is a long, hard journey that Ayla must face, but she does what she can to make the best of things, even if it means leaving her carefree ways behind.This is without a doubt my all-time favorite book. The author, Jean M. Auel, put so much research and heart into the book, and it is obvious in her absorbing storyline, incredible writing skill, and knowledge of the people we now call \\"cavemen and cavewomen\\". It took a while to memorize all of the characters involved in the story, but she pieced it together so that the story wasn't rushing on and leaving you wondering who was who; she slowly introduced them and taught you about them so that you were able to better understand their emotions and personalities. I often felt like I was right there with Ayla, and I have to say I got pretty emotional at times. Most of the humor is just smiling humor, but I did laugh out loud once. I cried quite a few times. I ended up having to grab a box of Kleenex and wipe my nose while I read. I just grew to love Ayla so much that whenever she would suffer it really made me feel for her, even though she is just a character. I recommend this book to teens and adults looking for a good read that you won't want to put down. I do not recommend it to kids, as there was a lot of violence and very mature content. (Remember, cave people were very primitive.) But I can hardly wait to read the next book and am ordering it shortly. The ending was a cliff-hanger and the suspense is killing me."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"From the moment you open the book and begin reading the first page, you will most likely be hooked to Auel's first novel in the Earth's Children series. Auel did wonders with this first book! Not only is the story of Ayla, the blonde-haired orphan raised by Neanderthals, touching and, at times, exciting, there is a wealth of knowledge about Ice Age plants and animals. The first installment of the series can, at times, move along more slowly then I would have liked. However, I never found myself bored when reading this book. The ending won't necessarily leave you on the edge of your seat but you will be longing to read the next installment as soon as possible."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"Jean Auel captured my imagination with The Clan of the Cave Bear. Since I first read it in high school, I've re-read it at least 8 times. I just can't get enough. I've recommmended her to family and friends alike... all of whom have enjoyed the book immensely.

Hopefully I will be able to develop my characters as completely as she has and also tell a story that grips the imagination."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"I read this book, and thought it was amazing. I truely recommend it to anyone. I've read several of the reviews where people are stating that there is false information about the ice age, plants, etc. in this novel. I'd like to remind these people that this is a novel, and she never claims that everything stated in this book is 100% accurate. At the time of writting, far less was known about these people. I say just sit back, and read a wonderful story! Most of the information is quiet accurate anyways, and it gives us a glimps into the lives of our ancestors."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"I was so excited to get the message on FaceBook today that The Clan of the Cave Bear was available on Kindle! I have been checking about once a month since I got my Kindle last Chanukah for this. And what a great price.It's such a wonderful series. Everyone really should read it. I know I'll be rereading the whole series before the release of the new book in March. So excited!"},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"An old favorite, the series by Auel was just recently brought back to mind when I found it at the library and reread The Clan of the Cave Bear. I had the entire series up to The Shelters of Stone but unfortunately lost them in Katrina. Between that and my 1st edition collection of Harry Potter hardbacks I still swallow a sniffle. An epic tale, deeply rooted in historical fantasy, the series is a wonderful view of pre-historic man's (woman's) life and a series that I cherished for a long time. While the last book that I read The Shelters of Stone was a disappointment, the other books were highly enjoyable and up there as a Top Ten PJV Series Favorite.REVIEW: The series focuses on a Cro-Magnun female named Ayla who loses her parents in an earthquake and is raised by Neanderthals. Being a member of a more evolved species than Neanderthal man, Ayla is distrusted by a lot of the Neanderthal clan, but loved by the woman Isa that adopted her, and her brother, the spiritual leader of the clan. The first book covers Ayla's life within the clan and the trials she must face as a child of the Others, never to fully be accepted by her adopted people.In later books (you might want to stop reading here if you would like to avoid spoilers) Ayla travels from her life within the Neanderthal clan to find her own people. On the journey she finds out just how diverse her own people are and how even distrust runs through them when an unknown element is introduced. Ayla even finds something that she would have never found within the Clan. She finds love, the love of a man and with him she finally finds acceptance and home. Their journey is what plays out in the later books, always hinting at a final bloody conclusion that matches Clan with Other, the son she left within the Clan and the son she will bear with her new people.The Shelters of Stone (Earth's Children)You can't pass up this series, I really recommend it. Auel spins a tale in a voice that will resonate through you. The research she put into writing these novels shows within every sentence. I felt as if I could be living within the cave walls with these people, instead of just reading about them. Ayla as a character took a place within my heart as few characters do, and I love to visit her every now and again to check in and see how life is treating her in the harsh Paleolithic world.I enjoyed every book in this series, except for The Shelters of Stone (Earth's Children). I did read it through though, but it's poor plot and excessive repeating of back-story was a major disappointment and left me with a sour taste in my mouth regarding the series. But don't let that hold you back from reading the first four!RECOMMENDATIONS: Fans of fantasy and early man historicals should enjoy. But I also recommend this to anyone that would enjoy a good epic adventure that has a bit of romance, a lot of action, along with a ton of information that just might school you along the way."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"Set 35,000 years ago this story takes you back in time effortlessly to a time of neanderthals and living in caves. When Ayla's parents are killed by an earthquake, the 5-year-old wanders through the forest completely alone. Cold, hungry, and badly injured by a cave lion, she is near death when the Clan of the Cave Bear finds her. This clan, left homeless by the same disaster, have little interest in the helpless girl who comes from the tribe they refer to as the \\"Others.\\" Only their medicine woman sees in Ayla a fellow human, worthy of care. Ayla's strange ways challenge the clan who live by ancient beliefs and tradition passed down to them from their ancestors. Ayla,represents the physically modern Cro-Magnons. And as Ayla begins to grow and mature, her natural tendencies emerge, putting her in the middle of a brutal and dangerous power struggle.I am in love with this author's style. At first I was thrown, because of the way she moves from head to head. But it works because much of the 'dialogue' in this book is nonverbal. I am in love with Iza and Ayla's characters and even nasty Broud is one of my favourites. It's not really that he's a bad guy, he's doing what centuries of evolution has told him is right. Man is the boss, woman is subservient. That Ayla's tribe is a group of humans further up the evolutionary chain than the clan makes for interesting conflict. I root for her, cringe at the caveman mentality of male/female relationships and sit back in awe at the author's amazing description of how our world was during the ice age. the research she must have done is phenomenal, every plant, rock, animal, and person is described in such detail that it comes alive one the pages.My final verdict is that this is definitely worth reading. It is intimidating because it is such a long book and it is one you have to really get into and focus while reading or you miss a lot. I imagine I could read again and again and each time find a new detail or nuance in the writing. I am going to read her other books as well. Of course, I'll be spacing them out, its heavy reading for me. I don't often get quiet time.So great book, amazing and talented author, and I highly recommend reading. I'm a fan."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"Yes, you read that right, Science Fiction. Many people think that SF is all rocket-ships and ray-guns. But any novel that is based on Science and then some conjecture is basically Science Fiction.This is not an \\"Historical\\" novel as some have said, as it takes place in \\"pre-historic\\" times. So by definition it cannot be Historical.Auel was a technical writer, as I am. Technical writers will never win Nobel Prizes for literature, but they can write succinctly and accurately.She researched this book thoroughly, and the technical data in the story is very accurate as of the time it was written, although she takes liberties with some things to make the story work. And since the time it was written, Science has moved on.So if you look at this book as some sort of \\"accurate\\" rendition of what life was like for cave people, you are deceiving yourself. We cannot glean detailed parts of Neanderthal life from archeological records. But much of what she does put in seems based on sound conjecture.The central premise of the book, however, is pure SciFi/Fantasy - that Neanderthals had some sort of \\"racial memory\\" whereas Cro-Magnons had the ability to learn, and thus the Cro-Magnons were destined to displace the Neanderthals. (In one clearly SciFi scene, Ayla, in a drug-induced stupor at a cave ceremony, visualizes 20th century earth, if for a brief second - if that ain't Science Fiction, I don't know what is).From the various reviews I have read here and elsewhere, it seems that many people believe the story as historical fact, and not a work of fiction.It is an enjoyable book to read. But it is an entertainment, not a Scientific research paper. Don't take it as an historical record, as no such records exist from pre-historic times.Hence the name, \\"Pre-Historic\\"."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"Amazing and fabulous.I read this when it was first published and was overwhelmed by how Ms. Auel created a pre-human civilization with such clarity. Makes Planet of the Apes look like the schtick it was!Beautiful writing and a heroine that, without words, made this reader completely bond with her.Incredibly inventive story with such diligent attention to detail that you could almost convince yourself that it was nonfiction. This was no accident as Ms. Auel definitely had done her homework and research.Simply a wonderful book."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"The Clan of the Cave Bear by Jean M. Auel is the first novel of the Earth's Children series. Her story provides an insight into prehistoric life of humans. The series begins with the introduction of the main character, Ayla, and the circumstances that occur that results in her being adopted by \\"The Clan\\". Ayla is first presented as a five-year-old girl who had just lost her entire family to an earthquake. Alone and desperate, she wanders in hopes of finding her dead mother. Suffering from extreme hunger and weariness, she inadvertently finds herself in the middle of a lion den. The male lion, fearing the woman that had encroached upon his territory, attempts to attack Ayla. Only by sheer luck does she manage to hide and escape with only a deep gash in her leg. Near death, she collapses near a river, where a clan is traveling in search of a new cave to live in. The medicine woman of the tribe, Iza, sees Ayla and receives permission to take her and treat her wounds. From there Ayla, a Cro-Magnon, is adopted, if not completely accepted, into the Neanderthal Clan with Iza taking the role of her mother. She will endure many trials for being one of The Others and the novel ends with her being presented her biggest problem to undergo.This first story of the Earth's Children series is a well-written and researched book with a few obvious but necessary liberties by Auel. She does an amazing job describing a landscape in great detail and providing very believable story of what may have happened so many years ago. Since reading The Clan of the Cave Bear, I have since read the four books following the series and eagerly await the final story detailing Ayla's unusual and impressive life. While I found the sequels to be a bit more interesting than the first of the series, it is essential to read it. Any reader must understand the different way of life The Clan has and how it affects Ayla and her actions later in the series. However, that is not to say I did not enjoy the first novel. I greatly admired the way Ayla responded to the adversity she faced due to her differences and I applaud Auel for the effort she put into her works that led me to become so entangled within the story that I felt as if I was almost there sharing the joys of a successful Mammoth hunt and the pains Ayla felt as the people closest to her died."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"This is an awesome start to a really great series.

I had heard it was a good read, but the book was so heavy I never picked it up to read. I sold my copy. Downloaded as Kindle copy and it became a simple read. I, also. downloaded the Audible version to listen to as I read. The voice of Sandra Burr was melodic and kept my interest, even when my eyes got tired.This is deep enough that I must continue into the next book: The Valley of the Horses.

Thanks again."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"This is a book I have read over and over. Besides the fascinating world that the author creates, I think the heroine is what kept me glued to the pages. Ayla is gifted with extraordinary abilities due to the life she has led, and we are privy to that life, and therefore as her abilities develop they seem absolutely believable. The heroine is probably one of the greatest characters ever created on paper, and for that reason alone, this is a must-read novel. The bonus is the rest of the world and characters the author has created, a riveting plot, and fantastic adventures. The entire series is on my keeper shelf."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"Currently rereading the Earths Children series...Loved these in Jr High, but never knew it went past 3, until recently, so freshing up on the first 3, to then read the next 2.Finished this up today. Nice to put the general sense of memory I had about the story back into definite order. It has been a LONG time and many book in between reads on this.If the measure of a writer or a book is getting a reader to care about the characters in the story... Then Jean Auel is a great writer. I can overlook the horrendous historical lapses, as long as she keeps me interested in what is happening to her characters. And I never stopped pulling for Ayla in this one."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"I loved this book and thought it was a great start to the series.

I read it about 15 years ago, and then just picked up a copy at home and started to re-read it again. What an imagination this author has, and what a spectacular story. I think this book is for readers of all ages and simply can't be beat. There is action, adventure, drama, and so much more. You will be horrified, surprised, and awed by the things that happen. Exceptionally written book that you won't want to miss out on."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"\\"[Ayla] was a woman, and she had more courage than you...more determination, more self-control\\"Ayla is a five year old child when an earthquake forces her to flee her destroyed home and her dead parents. Iza, the medicine woman of the Clan of the Cave Bear, stumbles upon her and takes her under her wing, but Broud, the proud son of the clan leader, Brun, takes an immediate disliking to the young non-Clan girl. Ayla grows up among the clan and struggles to find her place.I've heard so much about this series of books, particularly with the most recent (and apparently last of the series??) release ofThe Land of Painted Caves. While I had read that that book wasn't so hot, I did read reviews that praised the first few books. So I went out and got my hands on an audiobook of the first in the Earth's Children series.First off, I have to give kudos to Auel for all the research and time she put into this novel. This woman didn't go, \\"I'm going to write a pre-historic novel\\" and then just throw in some almost modern humans in a wallpaper world. This book transports you back before cars and computers, before women's rights and civil rights, into a fantasy realm of what the world might have been like before the modern age. It was vibrant and meticulously detailed. I loved how the Others could speak but the Clan could not; how the Clan could access memories but were bad at new innovations while the opposite was true of the Others. A lesser author, like I said, would have seen the work needed and given up; Auel pushed on and produced a damn fine novel.Besides the vibrant setting, the characters were detailed and intricate. My favorites were Iza and Creb, but I also liked Ayla herself, Brun, and Ooba (sp?). I liked how Iza embraced Ayla and was thoughtful enough to pass along the medicine woman trade, trying to think of Ayla's future. Iza was a warm, loving, kind-hearted, strong woman. Creb was fantastic. I thought he was sweet and kind, a good father-figure for Ayla, and I loved the comparisons between him and Ayla and between him and Ayla's son, Dirk. Ayla was a great character; she grows so much throughout the book. She tries to find her place in the clan; she is constantly testing the boundaries, but not because she is always defiant. Ayla is just not Clan; she is of the Others, and that breeding comes through. I liked the differences that she accented between Clan and Others: speech, crying, differences in body shape (I really liked how the Clan had a different perception of beauty). There were a few times when she (or her son) got really close to that Mary Sue line--the amount of times she breaks rules and is able to keep from being killed is pretty astonishing. However, I think Ayla did have enough faults, and was legitimately punished enough that I didn't focus on it too much. (I wonder, though, how far it is into the series before her turn to Mary Sue-ism comes is complete.) Brun was a great strong leader; he listened to his people, but wasn't afraid of action, afraid of punishment. And Ooba became such a sweet, loving sister to Ayla. I couldn't help but think of me and my sister when I read about the two.The story meanders along Ayla's life, her struggles to become Clan, and her tension with Broud. I loved how she learned to hunt with a sling, and I liked how she became a good medicine woman, how she would drop everything to try to save someone's life. I got to learn so much in this book, my mind was bent to new depths--what would life be like living in a cave? What was the world like before?If anything about the story bugged me, it would be the sudden departures into talking about mixing medicines. As I said above, I loved the research Auel put into this book; that said, inserting several passages ONLY to show what plants mixed with what roots would make a cure for this ailment got old. Fast. Fortunately, there were not TOO many of these scenes, but there were enough to be noteworthy.Also, there is quite a bit of violence/abuse in this novel. Women are basically treated like property. Men can beat women and be completely justified--this happens to Ayla quite a few times in the book. Men also can force a woman to have sex whenever the desire hits them--even if the woman is not their wife. Again, this happens to Ayla quite a bit, in a rather uncomfortable rape montage (nothing is too graphic, however). While I am sure this is more realistic than having Clan women burning their bras (or whatever they would have used for bras), it is not for everyone and was rather uncomfortable at times to listen to. Sometimes, I wanted to smack some sense into these Clan men--how dare you treat someone like that! Being female does NOT mean being stupid and being unable to think for yourself! Ultimately, I appreciated how Auel did NOT resort to writing the Clan as if they were wise, with modern sensibilities about feminism...but I still hated the abuse.I honestly cannot wait to start reading the next book. I am desperate to know what happens to Ayla...does she meet up with her people? Does she find a mate? I've read enough reviews to know some of the answers to my questions, but that doesn't make me any less eager to read for myself. I greatly enjoyed reading this prehistoric journey, and I definitely recommend--with the caveat that there is some abuse/violence to be on the lookout for.Brought to you by:*C.S. Light*"},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"A friend at work told me about this series, which i had never heard of. Because of my native american heritage i bought it that evening when i got home. At first when Ayla is walking on her on in the wild, it seems a little boring. I kept thinking of how she was the same age as my daughter, and my daughter couldnt have done that, but then again, it was a long time ago. When reading keep in mind how long ago this story took place, and stick with the book. I promise by the middle of the book when Ayla is living with the Clan and learning their ways, you will be hooked. I think this book is a wonderful way for people to learn how life use to be before the world began to change. You will learn things along the way, and by the end of the book wont be able to even take a break befor starting the second one."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"I was very unhappy with the number of typographical errors not only in this book but in all of the books in the series. The story continues to be a favorite of mine, but the errors decreased my ability to totally enjoy the digital copy. In some places I am not sure I would have known what the word was if I were not familiar with the books already. It has made me a bit cautious about buying other digital books. I was looking forward to building my digital library and clearing out some space by getting rid of hardcopies. Now I am not sure I will."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"This book is a wonderful read, fascinating, insightful, and moving, as well as just entertaining. However, Auel really stretches reality in some places, particularly with the telepathy and the \\"ancestral\\" memories that allow them to remember back to the dawn of life (and even let Creb see the future at one point). Given that for the most part she seems to be trying to rely on anthropological knowledge, these things bugged me, and they were entirely unnecessary to the story; she could easily have gotten her point across in another way.On the other hand, I do like that she notes their lack of adaptability as the probable cause of their extinction, which I believe (if I can remember from my college Anth. classes) is accurate, and was interesting to consider in the context of a story. She did an excellent job of fleshing that theory out with examples, and it stimulated my thinking on the topic. Likewise, she did a good job of highlighting the cultural and anthropological differences between Neanderthals and Homo Sapiens, although I think some of her data is outdated now (which is obviously unavoidable). She did such a good job with this that it was hard at times to remember that this is a work of fiction and much of it is based on extrapolation (whether hers or the anthropologists of her era). Kudos to her in that regard.On a more basic level, some things about the book bothered me. For example, she makes such a big deal of how set in their ways the Clan are, but Brun is constantly bending rules and making subtle (and not so subtle changes). While he made an excellent character and helped the story flow (and allowed it go the way Auel wanted), it also totally contradicted her theory of their extinction. If Brun can change and be flexible, other Clan members must be able to also. And if that is true, it's harder to believe they would not have changed to resist the forces pushing them to extinction.Likewise, Broud's character got really old by the end of the book - I think she let it go on too long. He was a good and useful character, in that he was a good foil for Ayla and helped the story flow, particularly with regard to the ending, but he was such an annoying character that his repeated appearances got grating toward the end. I think the book just was too long - by the end I was thoroughly sick of the interactions between Broud and Ayla and Broud and Brun, just because Broud was such a jerk.I see a lot of people bashing the way she portrays the Neanderthals, but I honestly think those people aren't reading the first book very closely - she portrays specific characters that way (mostly Broud) but there are also kind, relatively intelligent characters in the Clan, especially Brun and Creb. They might be more primitive, but they are not unintelligent.Overall it was a great story, and it definitely stimulated my interest; I was tempted to dig out my old anthropology textbooks and notes to check some of her facts. Her characters are rich and interesting, and she definitely gets the reader to identify with them. She brings the environment and culture richly to life. On the other hand, the book went on a tad too long, and portions of it (particularly with regard to Broud) became a bit repititious. All in all I am looking forward to reading the next book in the series."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"just got a Kindle so thought I might revisit some older books I've read before. This was just as good the second time around :)"},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"These books were made for people who love to dive into fictional characters. Auel is by no means lacking in detail and I'm not going to lie, there are places I found myself starting to skim, but it's truly amazing that the characters and detail are based on graves, tools, and general domestic items excavated from dig sites that Auel visited herself. Creb is quite literally based on remains found at a dig site that led archeologist to understand that these prehistoric people cared for one another even when they couldn't physically contribute. But Auel isn't just an in depth researcher, she's a dedicated story teller who brings to life characters she clearly loves. This is the first book of my favorite series of all time!"},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"It made me look at how our ancestors had to struggle to stay alive and how pitifully pampered we are.

Fascinating, memorable characters and therare chance to learn a little something about the earth in its ancient pre-history days are only the beginning of what Auel has to offer in the Clan of the Cave Bear.Also note, if you've seen the movie adaptation starring Darryl Hannah (or likely the first twenty minutes before giving up) you'll be happy to know that the bookis nothing like it. I think there are many elements of the story that really do not translate well into a movie format. Since I've read the book, I enjoyed a few aspects of the movie because I already knew what was going on.The book is a delightful read. Tough to put down and the kind of story that stays with you and really makes you stop and think about people and how we came to be the way we are. If you've made it this far in my little love rant over this book, you've just gotta buy it!! You won't regret it, and neither will the people you lend it to after you've read it.

I think I'm going for a 3rd turn now in 2010! This is the first book in the series & a movie was made from this starring Daryl Hannah in 1986. If you like variety in your reading material, this is a wonderful series to sink your teeth into! It is about an \\"Other\\", a little girl that loses her family to an earthquake when she is very small. She is raised by the \\"Clan\\" people whom are pretty much cavemen & cavewomen.She is made fun of for being \\"different\\" but Ayla is a survivor & the reader can't help but love the brave & feisty character of Ayla. She has a very difficult & lonely life in the first book & cannot find a mate as she does not look like the people that raised her. The one time she meets another \\"other\\" like herself at the annual tribes meeting, he is killed by a bear. She is taught how to heal people with many medicine remedies found from herbs & plants, etc. from the cavewoman that raises & loves her like a daughter. This old woman is a great medicine healer & of extreme importance to the tribe. This healing knowledge endeavors to bond Ayla to the clan & gives her a little bit of worth to them, whereas she was deemed worthless before she grudgingly earns their respect.There is so much to this book & it is incredible the vast talent that it takes to write a book such as this. There are four more books in this series & they are all magnificently intriquing & once you begin reading, it is impossible to put the books down for long. This is probably my favorite series of books that are unlike anything I mainly love to read - which is mysteries, true crime, true survivor stories & celebrity auto/biographies. If you are looking for something to read, please seek this book out & know that there is a whole lot of pleasure awaiting you with four more books after this treasure. I give this book over 10 stars, five just is not enough. The movie was not even half as great as the book but I still enjoyed the movie. It's hard to get into the movie since in this book, the clan people really do not \\"talk\\". They use signals (a sort of sign language) to talk & other than grunts, there's not much dialogue. I recommend this series of books highly! The series of books just gets better as they go. Once Ayla meets Jondular, another \\"other\\" like her & they fall in love, the books are an even more compelling read!

I love her details and description of, well, everything. She sometimes goes overboard with some descriptions of flora and fauna, but with these books it seems right.

Life with cavemen is much different than the life she used to lead with her parents. Through all her struggles she perserviers and becomes a member of the clan, changing the way the clan views humans and forces them to accept her differences.Although a fiction, the story could have happened just like it's told in the book. The attention to details and descriptions allows the reader to get a clear picture of Ayla's world.

I can't wait for the next book!"},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"It is an imagination full history running in prehistoric times. Wonderfull characters designing, pretty good wrote, full of surprises and easy to read. While finishing the novel I ran to the nearest bookstore to buy the second book of the saga and devore it. Jean M. Auel seems to know extremely good what she is talking about. She seems having deeply investigate prehistoric times, and developement of human technology and knowledge. I was fascinated by the book."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"I have been in love with this book (and the entire series) since I started reading it when I was eleven, five years ago. Ayla is the ultimate heroine, yet she is totally human, real, and touchable. Auel's extensive research allows her to paint a stunning picture of prehistoric earth. Her characters fit this picture perfectly to tell the amazing story of one young girls life. Malinda Brow"},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"It's a wild ride that you will take with Ayla as she learns what the world around her is all about. This book is a real treat. Start with this one (it is the first in a series of four, soon to be five books) and keep going. Jean Auel is definitely talented. Enjoy"},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"My husband and I listened to the entire series on audio cassette. Enjoyed it so much we're starting it again. Please hurry Ms. Auel with the next book"},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"The Clan of the Cave Bear is by far, one of the most creative and well told stories I've ever come across. Not only are the characters brought into vivid relief but the feeling of living in the Upper Paleolithic is so strong one could almost feel the ice from the glaciers, and taste the salt of the water. The first breath of air and the blows of Broud. This wonderful novel sets up the heroine, Ayla, for her destiny with the tall and handsome Jondalar in the following books of the series and does it so well it is a pleasure to re-read this book again and again. I wouldn't trade owning this book for anything"},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"I have been wanting to read this book for quite some time but I could never get a chance to pick it up and read it. While I was in 8th grade this year, my English teacher gave us a reading list on a certain topic. And on the list was &quot;The Clan of the Cave Bear.&quot; I immediatly decided that this was the book that I was going to read. What a marvelous book! I couldn't put it down. Jean Auel has a gift for writing. The characters were built with such detail and emotion that I thought the characters really existed somewhere in that time.With all the research Jean Auel has done for this book, and the others, you feel that you are actually there while all these events are taking place. This book was also educational for me, which no school textbook could do about these past times. I have read the three other books by Jean Auel and I am anxiously waiting for the fifth book"},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"I usually read techincal books and actually bought this novel because it was recommended to me while inquiring about books to get for my 16 year old daughter for the summer.I picked up the book while in a hotel room with the family asleep in hopes that it would lull me off to sleep but, I was wrong. Instead it led me down a path of time travel that brought me a kind of knowledge and understanding that kept me captivated from beginning to end. My techie books took a back seat to this most incredible,insightful and absorbing book as I look forward to reading the rest of the books in this series, my only disappointment in this book was that it had to come to an end."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"There aren't enough words to describe this work of art, but I'll do my best with what I have. I was just amazed, to say the least, when I read the last page of Clan of the Cave Bear, with craving for more. The story line is simply magnificent and richly detailed. it's just something that keeps you on your seat. And reading the whole series, I still want more. I'm extremelly confident that the next bok will deliver the same kind of exitment the others did."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"This book was and is good but there are some boring and annoying parts. First, with the annoying parts. it bugged me and sometimes got me mad how she kept going against clan ways. I just could not belive that she kept doing it I mean at first with the weapon thing I said fine, but the a few more things and a few more things and the gosh darned baby thing and the breaking of Iza's bowl and drinking all that ceremony crap instead of just throwing it away and going into Mo-gur and the mens clan gathering ceremony. Ha! this girl is so hardheaded and self-righteous I rooted for Brou sometimes. The boring parts were the long drawn out descriptions. This is good but it is not the kind of book you read over and over. You want a good book? try Lord of the Rings. 'Nuff said. Grunts in satifaction and tells you to go get him some water. ;)"},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"This is definitely one of my favorite books. The end is so sad that three days after I finished tears still came to my eyes when I thought about it. I would certainly recommend this book to all my friends."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"The first four books in the Ayla sextet are treasured memories. I have all four books and their pages are constantly re-read by myself and by my daughter and nieces. Im sure if i had a son, he would enjoy it just as much as we all did. Our books are bound together with tape and the spines are all crinkled, but the story of Ayla remains beautiful and intact. All the pain she went through and how she healed emotionally. Jondalar is a sensitive being who has become Aylas soul mate, the one she always knew she had. I wish that Jean would write the last two books so that i could see how Ayla fits in with Jondalars people, and see if her baby is a girl and what she calls it. Also whinney is a true friend who reminds you just what an important role animals play in peoples lives. I love all the attention Jean gives the book with reference to flint. herbs and clothes and mainly Feelings. I will treasure these books always. THANK YOU JEAN!"},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"I first read The Clan of the Cave Bear about 6 years ago. My friend had recommended it to me.

I can't wait for these to come out!"},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"Jean M. Auel has captivated me with her vivid descriptions and life-like characters.

This book and series are a must for any home library!"},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"Rich and deep, some stories are threaded together, some are spun. This is the first book in a planned series of six which could be classed as a tapestry. The story of one girl who forged our destiny more so than anyone in the history of man. If you are looking for a story that will make you laugh and cry, that will enrage you, empassion you and take you to new heights of understanding what a damn fine story should be like, then The Earth's Children series is the one for you."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"I've read all four of Ms. Auel's books.

How much longer do we have to wait?"},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"I picked up Clan of the Cave Bear in the local &quot;Goodwill&quot; for a mere $0.49. Who would've known then that I stuck gold. This book is the beginning of a wonderful series that has kept me deprived of sleep for many years. It's funny how I first saw the movie with Darryl Hannah and didn't pay much attention to it. The book Clan of the Cave Bear was purchased out of curiousity as to whether it would compare to the movie. Believe me when I say, THERE IS NO COMPARISON.These series of books have developed and enhanced my love for reading. I agree with every word written by previous customers regarding the enthralling way Ms. Auel depicts Ayla and her adventures. I can only comment on how it has affected me.I highly recommend these books. THEY ARE ALL THAT AND A TRUCKLOAD OF CHIPS!!!Ms. Auel, if you are reading these posts, please, please... we beseech you.... please give us the remaining books. Let Ayla's long anticipated saga continue. We await with eager anticipation Ayla's story.We are praying for your speedy recovery from whatever illness you are stricken with, Ms. Auel. Your talent is something that can never be replaced or duplicated and we fear the loss of closure should these remaining books not make it to publication and bookstores."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"As the story of a young girl, Ayla, unfolds we are taken back to the time of early man. A captivating story of her life with The Clan of the Cave Bear is told. It shows of her hardships, human love, and every day life. It will take you on a magical journy into the heart of our species evolution.This powerfully written novel by Jean M. Auel will inspire even the youngest of readers. As a twelve- year-old girl I was easily taken away to a time long ago by her unimaginable storytelling, and I can't wait to finish off the series! Katerina Jurkoshek"},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"By any measure of literature, Clan of the Cave Bear is an awesome novel. I first read it years ago when I was in high school and decided to pick it up and read it again earlier this month. I forgot how involved with the characters you became. Creb, Iza, Uba, Broud, all of them stick in your mind and nearly make you cry when something terrible befalls them.Intrigue into the story was added by the authors assumptions that Neanderthal man had genetic memories passed down from generation to generation...something that 'The Others' do not have. An excellent concept since learning was limited to the past and the future of Neanderthal was limited to food stores and the seasons --- their ultimate demise according to this author. An excellent concept.I haven't read any of the other books in the series for a number of reasons. #1 after speaking with multiple readers about them they informed me that the sequels are nothing compared to the original. A sad statement if its true. #2 I just don't have the time or inclination to read something that my friends (whom judgements I trust) tell me that it isn't worth my while. I might pick up and look through the next one in the series. But maybe not. I'm still on the see-saw."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"I'm an archiologic from ISRAEL.

I just wish she would finish the 5th one."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"I've read a lot of books this summer, including 3 books that I had to read for the summer (Summer reading). I've also read several James Bond books (They're one of my hobbies). The Clan of the Cave Bear is my fourth and final summer reading book, and my 8th overall book of the summer. I am 108 pages in, and I have to say that I am less than mystified by it. I find many aspects of it boring, like the long descriptive paragraphs that I usually try to skip over. Don't get me wrong, this book is good. I find it interesting and I am trying to get into it. When does the books pace pick up? It seems like the first 108 pages are nothing but an opening for the book. When does the book get into the stage where so many people say I won't be able to put it down? Well, my school picked 4 books for me to read this summer, and this is so far the most boring. Unlike many books I've read this summer (The James Bond books-Do yourself a favor and pick one up), this one is not keeping me reading through half the night."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"This book was so completely tedious for me. It felt like half the time I was reading a not-very-interesting Wikipedia description of the first humans and their way of life, and the rest of the time I was left with poor writing and even worse dialogue. I can't believe this book was so popular .... Was there nothing to read in the '80s? I had expected something amazing, as I had heard so much about this book, but was sorely disappointed. Not recommended."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"Intellectually and artistically roughly on a par with the Flintstones. Despite the numerous five star reviews it has received here this risible prehistoric bonkbuster is utter dross, a hopelessly 'eighties modernist' take on the past diplaying minimal knowledge of human nature and the way new ideas and societies really evolve.Of course good fairy tales can be entertaining for children and adults alike and are an esential part of our cultural heritage. Not this one though"},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"I found Sandra Burr choppy and irritating to listen to. Her voice was not what I expected. There is another version of this book narrated by another woman whose voice is smooth, and can put you to bed. Yet she tells the tale with enough excitement and with different tones for each character that you are compelled to listen ALL DAY!The plot is wonderful, though if you want to listen instead of read, I don't reccomend the Sandra Burr narration. I reccomend the one read by Rowena Cooper. AMAZING!"},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"I LOVE THIS BOOK!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I read this book over the my vacation in April and i savored every word of it in the airplane and off. This book is about a girl named Alya who is seperated by her mother by a earthquake as a little girl. Alya has to try and servive but she gets bitten by a cave lion and gets hurt and then a clan of the cave bear find her and teach her there ways in this extrordianry book Don't forget that there are other books in the series. there is THE VALLEY OF THE HORSES witch is the book i am reading know and is the second in the series by Jean.M.Auel, THE MAMMOTH HUNTERS Witch is the third book in the Earths Children Series. THE PLAINS OF PASSAGE wich is the fourth in the series. And the newest one wich came out April 30,2002 THE SHELTERS OF STONE is the fifth book in the Earths Childrens series. I have to tell you the charecters in this book are great. There is Alya, Iza, Creb, Brun, Broud and much much more. i also have to say that my friend is named ALYA after the Alya in this book. I also have to tell you that this book my not be for you. If you like little detail in your stories then this book is not for you.

I laughed, I cried, I yelled in anger, all in all this is one of my all time favorite books. This entire series is so detailed and wonderful. I can't wait for the next book!"},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"The basic premise for this book seems like a great idea for historical (or pre-historical?) fiction. However, it failed to deliver. The entire storyline was so predictable and hackneyed I had to force myself to finish the book. The characters are all one-dimensional and stiff and Auel never really succeeds in bringing them to life. And come on, who really didn't see the ending or the rape scene coming? Auel was obviously trying to create a novel centered around a strong central female character, but she just succeeded in making Ayla looking like an untouchable annoying kid with all the answers. Also, the Neanderthal \\"mind meld\\" is one of the most ridiculous things I've ever read. The only reason I give it two stars is because I like the fact that it has a prehistoric setting."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"&quot;Clan of the cave bear&quot; by Jean M.

Throughout the book Ayla changes her attitude towards older people of her clan, and towards nature. Her parents are killed by an earthquake which forces Ayla to live on her own. She does get injured however by a lion, after her wandering around the forest she is found by another clan called the clan of the cave bear. She is then raised by the new clan, she fells protected, but still misses her original clan, and family."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"I read this book 3-4 years ago. It's still makes me highly agitated every time I think about it. You just feel bad for the main character through most of the book and there is no redemption at the end. It has the worst ending ever! It still pisses me off that I spent the time reading it. There isn't really much of a story, just a lot of details and weird issues. There are too many tangents and the protagonist is the only character with ANY sort of common sense. ASIDE: DO NOT READ IF YOU ARE SENSITIVE TO RAPE! That should be on the back cover or in a disclaimer somewhere. Not Recommended."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"I was recommended this book by a family member. I'm going to be honest, this book is really bad. The main character is a Mary Sue type character (she can do everything perfectly, tame horses, etc) and it's like a Harliquin romance novel - because there's so much sex in it. This book was a complete waste of time."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"i find it incredible that so many people speak so glowingly of this book. on the basis of its literary merit it deserves a prominent spot in supermarket checkout lanes. that this is in any way respected as a novel or thought of as remotely historical (pre-historical, is suppose) speaks sad volumes about our society.i guess my one star may be a bit harsh. it's concievable that one could glean some amusement or light entertainment from this. but i feel a civic duty to in bring down the five star average it's garnered so far."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"The book dose the job as far as that goes and it is a used book but I was expecting a newer book going by the pitchure"},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"Loved it - it's an old favorite that I will listen to again and again."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"I couldn't believe my eyes when I saw this large \\"book\\" on the kitchen table the other day. Wow! First off, Bessie rarely reads anything except diet books. Secondly, a book about Beer!!! Well, as is often the case with my angry fifth spouse, I was once again overloaded with misplaced optimism. This is not a book about some Cave Beer Clan. Instead, \\"The Clan of the Cave BeAr\\" is an overwrought, overwritten, overblown feminist ode to some silly notion about evolution filled with research and adjectives.I'll be honest, once I realized it wasn't about beer, I didn't so much read as skim. Really skim. I enjoyed the fact that the heroine was blonde with blue eyes, but I didn't like how much the author seemed to be in love with her. I also grew rapidly annoyed by this author's overuse of adjectives. It did make skimming a lot easier, but I was still annoyed. Additionally, while I can relate to the brutish sex-starved male as Cro-magnon stereotype, I didn't particularly find it made for good reading. I'm still not sure why my brooding spouse is reading it unless it's to reinforce her already firm opinion of me as an apeman. Or maybe there's a diet somewhere buried within the books 9,142 pages. Not for me. HHD."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"An earthquake opens a crack in the earth, the parents fall in, and it slams shut!?!?!? That's the best Auel could do?

This is a painful book to read. There are so many adjectives that I think the writer has used every single one available in the English language... multiple times. I find my inner dialog constantly repeating the phrase \\"okay, all right, I get it, move on.\\" Just for fun, I picked a random paragraph and in those four sentences, counted over 20 adjectives! -- I'm the sort of reader who likes to finish books, no matter how bad, but this one has tested my limits and I am, for the first time since childhood, seriously considering not finishing... and in this case, deleting it from my Kindle library. (I am now kicking myself for reminding myself that I paid full price for this POS.) There is nothing that can be said in the last 35% that will change my opinion. I don't generally write reviews, but I do read them and the high number of glowing reviews, along with recommendations from two co-workers, prompted my purchase. The truth needs to be heard. Clan of the Cave Bear is a terrible read! This book comes nowhere near to earning such high praise and for that reason alone, I submit my rating of 1... only because I can't give it a zero. -- Now, where's that hot poker?"},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"I've read this book twice, and loved it even more the second time.

Some discs are labeled accurately and some are not, while some are listed as another book title and author entirely. This made sorting the playing order most trying.

I borrowed the books from a friend who had them. The Clan of the Cave Bear is the first book of the series. The Clan of the Cave Bear is a good read but it is a better read when you read the rest of the series. After working at the local library's book sale where I could obtain hardcopies of several of Jean Auel's books, I decided to just order through Amazon.com those books that I couldn't get at the library. The Clan of the Cave Bear was one of those books. Since I already read it, I decided to go the used book route. The used book I got was in good shape. I was pleased with its appearance. I also ordered Shelters of Stone this way. When Jean Auel comes out with the final installment of her series, I'll just get the hardcover right away, provided it isn't too expensive."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"\\"Nothing in her experience ever gave her reason to doubt the shelter and those within it would be there when she returned,\\" the perfect opening line to a series of books like The Clan of the Cave Bear. Jean M. Auel wrote this line to help the reader understand the point in life where this young girl stood. She relied on others to take care of her and now she must face life on her own.Ayla a young girl, alone in a world of strangers, is forced to deal with the power struggles and taboos of the clan. Brun is the leader of the clan and is the soul determiner of Ayla's fate. Iza, the medicine woman, decides to save the girl from starvation. The holy man of all clans, Creb, learns more from Ayla than she does from him. Broud, the son of Brun, is an arrogant man, who seeks revenge on Ayla. Born out of a violent rape, Durc is the future of the clan. Ayla is my favorite character because she changes the most out of all the characters in this novel. As a young girl, she is ruled by taboos and traditions of the clan. As a young adult, she's stronger and more knowledgeable than any other clan member.Prehistoric Europe during the Ice Age is large-scale area for this novel. The extent of ice and change in coastlines during the 10,000 year Interstadial, a warming trend during the Wurm glaciations of the late Pleistocene Epoch, extending from 35,000 to 25,000 years before present time was occurring during this period. The novel takes place in a cave for a large part of the story. The cave is where the clan live and a smaller cave's where Ayla contemplates clan activities.Ayla, a young girl who is lost and must survive using only her inner strength to guide her. The leader of the clan and one of the people who help decide Ayla's fate is Brun, a bearded, barrel-chested man. Iza, chief medicine woman of the clan, takes Ayla in. Creb is the magician, but most refer to him as the holy man of all clans. Broud is the son of Brun and is set to take over the clan. Durc is the Ayla's child, born out of a violent rape and shall be the future of the clan.The main story within the novel is Ayla's growth as a person. Seeing her as a young child lost and confused about life. She does not know where she belongs and struggles to find her place in this group of people. As she grows into a young woman she learns survival techniques and picks up knowledge from other clan members. She wants to be more of a factor in the clan and play a part in the power, but the leaders will not allow that to happen.The language in the book uses everyday terms except for in the dialogue between characters, in which it changes to nomadic language. Auel has a good knowledge of early plants helped make the medicine woman more believable. The novel was written in third person point of view. Auel wrote the characters to have a range of human emotions. She writes about not only physical human survival but mental as well. The flow of the story is very smooth after the second chapter. In the first chapter you start with Ayla being lost and confused. In the second chapter you are immediately introduced to the clan and in the middle of the chapter Ayla appears again. At first, it was somewhat confusing but when you kept reading everything transitioned well. I felt the story was strong in all aspects, but Auel's strongest writing feature is her knowledge on the time period.When reading the novel you can compare it to the present day issues and power struggles, so any person would enjoy the novel. This quote fits the description of Ayla in the novel, &quot;If we don't change, we don't grow. If we don't grow, we aren't really living.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"A friend told me I should read this book, but I never got around to it. Then, last week my mom found the book in a thrift store and asked if I wanted to borrow it. Finals were over, I had a week before school started, so I figured..What the hell..I can always quit if I don't like it.This is absolutely the best book I have ever read. I would recommend it to anyone who has a little time on their hands and wants to go into Ayla's world. The characthers felt so real to me, that I hated to see the book end. I have ordered the second book, and ran across the third in the series in that same thrift shop today. I can't wait to read the others! Absolutely Excellent! As a side note: If you see the movie starring Darryl Hannah as Ayla, for clan of the cave bear..It is a horrible adaptation of the book. I was bored with the movie, but the book held my attention and was excellent..(Did I say that already?) Buy the books, rent the movie."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"This was a fascinating book. I learned a lot about the early days of the human race through this book, and the story was great too. Ayla comes from the race of The Others, the more highly developed humans who are mistrusted by the clan who adopts the young orphan girl when she is five. The clan is deeply rooted in tradition and customs and doesn't like change or deviation from the norm. So taking Ayla in takes some getting used to. But through the years, they adjust to her presence, and she grows up as part of their culture. She's different from them, though - she knows it and they know it and it's always hanging over them. But she pushes on, overcoming obstacles and standing up for herself every step of the way.I won't spoil the ending, but I was sorry it ended at the point in the story where it did. It would have been far more satisfying to see what happens after the events at the end of the book. There would have been a certain sense of satisfaction in seeing the inevitable decline and destruction that would most certainly occur under the new leadership. Alas, I guess we'll just have to imagine it in our minds."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"This book is absolutely awesome.

As a young girl, it was my introduction to primitive life and I found it fascinating. It has stayed with me all these years so I have to count it as an all-time favorite even though I really don't know how factually correct it was."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"I have the whole series on my Kindle Fire, and I love to read them over and over again.

Enjoy!"},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"Auel allows us to peer through her literary jewelers loop into a time so distant that the mists have congealed around the foundations of society. We are reminded that even then, the human spirit sought to acknowledge a higher power; saw itself as superior to the brute beasts that surrounded it and strove to rise from the morass of self survival. Her story of a young girl&#8217;s conquest over the brutality of life becomes the conquest of mankind over his environment. Aylas journey from near death to the joys of self sufficiency is the Sirens call for us all to choose the avenue which is good and pure over the one which leads to destruction.Calvin Howell"},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"I have read this book a few times since it came out.

I still find it so (I reread it)..."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"The best thing about this book is that the setting is completely new and refreshing compared to the typical swords, dragons and wizards fantasy books. The narrator puts you in a know-it-all position that is very instructive about ancient history and the origins of our kind.I gave it 5 stars to excel it about some very good 4 star books, but it would get 9 out of 10 only because the superhero of the story has things a little too cut out for her. Every bad thing turns out to be good and it insinuates a &#34;...and lived happily ever after&#34; ending (despite it not being so). I would have made it a bit flatter and more realistic for my taste, but it's not enough to lose the 5 stars.The author really did her homework for this one."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"Jean Auel 's EARTH'S CHILDREN series, starting with CLAN OF THE CAVE BEAR, is my all time favorite read. The final book of the series, THE LAND OF PAINTED CAVES, however, was a HUGE disappointment. I want the author to know that after waiting over 10 years for this book, she really let her readers down.Again, Clan of the Cave Bear, is a MUST read! The next book in the series, The Valley Of Horses, is as good! Enjoy!Jennie Porter Storch"},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"I love this book! I read it years ago and when I discovered the fifth book is out in paperback, I bought it again since I knew that winter was coming. I needed something to keep me busy in those long winter evenings. This book is the best medicine for us winter-weary folks!The book starts with Ayla who loses her parents in an earthquake and was found, wandering around delirious with pain from four lion scratches on her legs and delirious from hunger, by Iza, a Medicine woman. In spite of her &quot;otherness&quot; Ayla is adopted into the clan. And that is just the beginning of her tribulations and trimuphs. Ayla is not perfect but she's such a fascinating character to read ~~ I don't care if she's almost perfect. I can escape into her story and be glad of a cozy fire at my feet while the wind is howling outside!If you're interested in historical fiction with a good story ~~ this book is it. It's engrossing and full of rich details of primitive lifestyle ~~ it makes you wonder if they really are that different from all of us. They live, hunt, eat, love and bear babies and die ~~ like us. Just their tools and surroundings are a lot cruder than our living standards. It's a great book to escape into. Perfect for those long winter nights.2-2-04"},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"After having this book in my bookshelf for years I finally decided to give it a go. After struggling thru the first 50 or so pages I was all of a sudden thrust into a book that I have enjoyed so much.When young Ayla loses the only family she ever know to the earthquakes she is thrust into a world she is not use to. As she wanders the vast land trying to find someone to hopefully be there for her. Along the way Ayla has started to fall ill and needs help.As The Clan of The Cave Bear heads off to find a new cave, along the long journey Iza finds a young child. A child that doesn't look like her people, but is still in need of care. She takes Ayla with her in hopes that Ayla will feel better and be on her way. Iza doesn't expect that this child could be the lucky one who will change people.After agreeing to allow Ayla to live with Clan Ayla is met with some troubles with the other people of the Clan because she doesn't look them and she isn't one of them. But as time goes on she proves to people that she can be like them. She has many mishaps with the people in the Clan that make them still belive she isn't one of them, but still they let her stay with them.Ayla has to adjust to staying a woman of the Clan and that means being submissive to the men of the Clan and learning many new things along the way.The charactors in this book grow on you and you don't want to leave them for anything you want to be there to see how they grow and what they learn.This is a great book and I can't wait to read the rest of them."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"I had nearly forgotten about this book, read years ago, when someone told me that book 5, &quot;Shelters of Stone&quot; came out. I just read it, also an excellent read! It brought a nice circle to the story and was very well written. Once you meet this character you wont ever really forget her. I recommend the whole series. You can't help but to love the main character, Ayla, and picking up Auel's newest book, which brings the earlier books into a nice circle, brought back all the memories of this one and the whole series. (Reading these in order will put all the characters and relationships into perspective.) This book is a can't miss, and I'd recommend the whole series just to get to book 5!"},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"This is an amazing book. My name on Amazon isn't just because I'm a crazed fan of the series, it's because my mother named me after the herion of this book. I think it's amazing how Ayla overcame the hardships in her life and learned to used her healing and keep her calm over Broud. She's an amazing role model to look up to, for me, and for anyone who reads this. I highly recomend this. If you won't listen to the older readers, listen to me. I'm thirteen years old, and this is one of the best books I've ever read."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"I love to read, and I especially love to see a movie for the first time and find out that it was inspired by a novel. The Clan of the Cave Bear movie was good, but the book is amazing. Jean M. Auel tells an engaging story. Ayla's life from the loss of her parents, to being found by the Clan at age 5, to dealing with their differences is all very well told. I love the fact that she becomes what most women in the tribe would not even consider becomming. I read this very huge book in 2 days, I don't even remember if I stopped to eat or sleep. I try to reread it at least once a year. If you like books that grab your attention and then refuse to let go-This is the book for you."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"I have to admit it took a while for me to become interested in this type of book. It's the perfect example of not judging a book by it's cover. On first glance it seems like all those other adventure books that put you to sleep with the first sentence, but I promise if you pick up this book you will find it impossible to put down. It only gets better each time you read it, too! After reading this book, I had to read the others in the collection and believe me, the rest are just as good as the first!After reading this book, you can't help but be impacted by it. It has impacted my life and I think helps me each day to be a better person. It really has made me take a good look at myself and strive to have the qualities the main character, Ayla, has: honesty, integrity, and self-confidence. Those are just a few of her special characteristics, but are what I continually strive for each day.I'm telling you, read this book and you will see exactly what I'm talking about and what millions of others mean when they say this book is by far the best ever!"},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"I can't believe it took me so long to buy this book! I have an interest in anthropology, have always heard of it and have been almost embarrassed not to have read it! I bought it just to see what all the hype was about, but was quickly absorbed and thoroughly enjoyed the story. I rarely have time to read fictional novels, but I stayed awake four hours on a red-eye flight to finish it!The main characters and story are great, some parts are a little far-fetched and certain characters are exaggerated, but the overall story is captivating. It left me running to buy the second Earth Child book!"},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"I have read the series over 5 times and each time I enjoy it more.

Thanks Jean."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"I just happened to pick up this book out of a drawer at work on a slow night and I couldn't put it down.

I can't wait to read the other books in her series."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"I feel like I am the only one who has NOT read this story; I put it off for years thinking it was going to be a throw back of 1,000,000,000 Years BC, or something; after all, how intersting could Cave people be?!? Wow was I wrong!This story has it all! Myths and legends that I hope I can remember so I can tell them to my daughter as a story someday. Spiritual beliefs that are beautiful and daunting at the same time. A sense of community that is like no other that I have seen. A look into our past and the &quot;start&quot; of humans and humanity, and characters like no other!The Mog-ur, the highest magician in all the Clans, he speaks to the spirits, he is the one that holds all the rituals and ceremonies for the Clan, and he is the one that I would want on my side. He takes to a little girl, Ayla, who is found on the way to a new cave by the most powerful medicine woman in all the clans, Iza. Ayla is different, she is one of the Others. She brings to the Clan luck (?), because of her strong totem, and causes more controversy than this Clan has seem in 35,000 years!Ayla's story of trying to fit in, trying to overcome her &quot;ugliness&quot; and her differnces, trying to be accepted into the only family that she can remember, despite the fact that she has so many &quot;different&quot; ideas than a good Clan woman, is truly wonderful. Each one of her struggles pulled at my heart, and the writing is so good, I found myself reading long into the night, wanting to find out what happened next.This woman loved the whole story! :)Enjoy,Debbi"},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"Nothing I can write about this book can capture how I feel about it. Quite simply, it was like finding a buried treasure in my parents' basement.I usually prefer books like The Da Vinci Code, Rule of Four or anything by Nelson DeMille, but reading Clan of the Cave Bear has opened a new door for me and I, having never read these books before, feel so fortunate that I can look forward to many, many months of satisfying reading!I will read the entire series!"},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"Ayla is a people of the others. An earthquake happened early in the morning when she went swimming. Her family went into the cracks between the earth. When this happened Ayla went into the forest for many days. She got scratched by a cave lion. The Clan people found Ayla lying on the ground, weak and sick. The medcine woman, Iza, Convinced the leader,Brun, To let her stay. Ayla was given a powerful totem that was meant for males, and males only. People thought she was very ugly. In her 7th year she secretly watched a hunting ceremony, which was forbidden. She taught herself to hunt. She had a son named Durc. A couple years later she forced to to leave everything behind to find her people.Ayla was a young girl and was taller than all the men in the clan by her 6th year. She was a very adventureous person, and was very daring. She has blonde hair and light eyes, well the people of the clan had brown and dark eyes.I liked this book because it was very exciting and there was always somthing exciting going on. It taught me about the primative people and what they might have thought. Sometimes the book got boring and dragged on and on. And it did have some difficult language and it was hard for me to understand sometimes."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"This book must be the best book I have ever read, and I have read a ton, trust me. Clan of the Cave Bear is a great story about a girl named Ayla, who is orphaned after an earthquake. She is adopted by lesser-evolved humans, who decided she is \\"ugly\\" and the outcast. When her totem is a high one only males have, ( males dominate the clan, and totems are spirits that protect the clan), the leader's son Broud grows to hate her. I could go on and on, but I don't want to give it away. You should read this book, you won't regret it. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"Auel's story of Ayla who lived at an earlier time during human evolution is very exciting. Auel's description of life during the ice age is well researched and her writing is filled with description of life at that time. This is the first book in the series and, in my opinion, it is the best of the bunch. For the reader, it is thrilling to learn and imagine what life must have been like during this earlier age.I \\"read the book\\" on an unabridged audio by Brilliance Corporation. Their version was very well produced so that the listener feels like he is right there with Ayla at that earlier time."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"You must read this book! I highly, highly recommend it, along with the rest of the Earth Children's Series. You will love these books! Ayla is the strongest, most beautiful, lovable character I have ever confronted in literature. If I could meet any fictional character - it would without a doubt be Ayla. :-)The books are written beautifully as well. Auel does a fabulous job bringing the ice-age to life through breathtaking images and memorable characters.My ONLY complaint in this series is that the sex scenes are ridiculously \\"too perfect\\" - Augh. They could definitely be shorter, and there could be fewer of them. (You will not encounter these though, until the later books in the series, if you decide to read on.)I am a little hesitant for the final (6th) book to come out though... the 5th one ended on such a high note, I'm afraid to read on. Eeep."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"This is a truly touching book, in which you follow the life of Ayla, a girl born to the &quot;Others&quot;, who is found by Iza, the top medicine woman of the Clan( aka cave people). You explore the feelings of the characters. Auel has created a wormhole into the past. Each character is distinct in itself, and you have a story outline both dramatic and explicit. When Creb\\\\ Mog-ur performs his ceremonies, you feel as if you are there. It's like watching a movie, only deeper. You explore the humiliation of Creb's deformaty, the stubborness of Broud, and the kindness and caring of Iza. When Ayla is discovered to be hunting against the Clan laws, you plead along with her against the death curse. This is a truly wonderfull book. There are some mature parts, so if you don't feel you can handle them, don't try. Once again, I strongly reccomend this book!"},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"I have read all the books by this author that I have discovered by any chance,because I am a French reader.

I stayed in nebraska for 5 days and had to read the second one as soon as possible(i got it fron the local library. The book was greatly written. Iza and Creb's love (as well as the rest of the clan except Broud) for a girl of the others was great. I cried a couple times during the book due to how descriptive some things were(broud beating Ayla to a pulp!)

I miss the caracters. Is there ever going to be another book??????????????????????"},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"I was introduced to this book this summer by my aunt. She recommended it as one of her favourites. So, I decided to give it a try. I found the beginning a little slow moving. Once I got into it I couldn't put it down. The story is starts at the begging of man and is based on the evolution of man. Ayla, the main character is left to die because her clan was killed in an earthquake. She is adopted by a passing clan and brought to live with them. The story deals with her acceptance into a very different community. She is cast as an outcast from her clan because she is different. In fact she is one step above them on the evolution scale. In the end she is exiled from the only family she has ever known and goes on to search for people like her. I enjoyed this book alot,especially learning about different plants and their many uses. Jean M. Auel wrote a wonderful book and I can't wait to read the rest of the series."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"This book is if not the best then it's up there in the top five, along with the other 3 she has written. The story of a young women struggling to grow up and live in a world that doesn't accept her can be related to each of us and will be a book you remember for the rest of your life. The writing is fantastic and you are swept away into a world of prehistoric man that you won't want to come back from. The only problem is when you finish all 4 of her books you are on edge waiting for her to finish the next one. Earth's Children should be the set of books every person has and you will reread it many a time."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"I have been able to read at a very high level since sixth grade, and finally have found an author that I can read and still feel confident that I am reading at my level.

Although the story takes place about 35,000 years ago you can see lots of parallels to events in our lives today. As well as enjoying the story and learning about primative times you will also be thinking about how this can relate to today... Although the book is about 500 pages and small print its an easy read.."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"I saw the movie about 5 years ago, it was great. But then I heard about the book and read it and I must say that the movie doesnt even come close to the book. When I receive the book I wanted to read just a few lines, but I could not put it down. Now two days later I am done and I cant wait to buy the second one in the series. You just have to read it!!! Like I said, this book is simply amazing!!!"},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"This book was recommended to me by a former student of mine who is into survival skills and primitive living. Respecting his opinion, I picked up the book. Well, I thoroughly enjoyed it. The contrast and conflict introduced by having a young Cro-Magnon woman raised by Neandertals was a an excellent vehicle for the story. The author seems to have done her homework on the ice age as well. Although I don't know about her speculations on the nature of Neandertal society and their brain structure and function, they were fascinating. These people become such an integral part of the story that by the end of the book when you begin to realize that they, as a group, are going to pass away soon, it brings a poignant sadness. Well written, excellent characterization."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"The book I read was The Clan Of The Cave Bear. It is about a girl named Ayla whose mother dies in an earthquake. She wanders around until a cave lion attacks her and after that she faints. When a group of Neanderthals pass by they pick her up. She grows up with them and when she nears the age of nine, she begins to hunt with a sling, which is forbidden by the clan. If you become interested you should read the rest of Jean M. Auel's series, the books are in order.The Clan of the Cave BearThe Valley of HorsesMammoth HuntersThe Plains of PassageThe Shelters of Stone"},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"It's not as vast as the worlds created by Frank Herbert and J.R.R. Tolkien but ambitious enough to continually remind me of their work.I really liked the set up of the story over the first half of the book. A reader can experience a very foreign place and time that feels increasingly familiar as each event creates more insight into prehistoric landscape, society, species, races, thought, religion and language. The description of the mental, physical, spiritual consistency of the Clan race and the Others was fascinating and believable. The use of a five year old girl trying to fit in and bridge the gap between her younger forward thinking race and the more ancient memory ridden Clan of the Cave Bear was a perfect way to show differences and similarities.Through the second half of the book, it settles into a good story but doesn't reveal as much of Auel's amazing depiction of the prehistoric world that I found so captivating in the beginning. The characters started to remind me of people today with the same free thinking, tradition bound differences and similarities that we enjoy and struggle with.I really enjoyed the end of the book and found myself out the next day purchasing the next in the series."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"I never thought I would read this book based on the title, but I did and really liked it. I just bought the 2nd one and can't wait to start that one. At times there was too much detail and not enough action, but a great story that makes you think, what was it really like?"},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"The first time I read this book, I fell in love with the darling little orphan, Ayla. Thrust into a family that was not her own--one whose members disliked and distrusted her--Ayla survived years of mental and physical abuse, sadly assuming that she deserved most of her punishments. As much as she tried to please the clan, to fit in and become one of them, she was and always would be an outsider; something she realized but could not change. Without them, however, she would surely die. Aylahad little choice but to stay with the group for as long as they would let her (which, periodically, became a social issue) and do her best to survive in their world.Her inner strength and courage often brought tears to my eyes; her spunky personality made me grin. Ayla's story was a gripping, intense tale that just wouldn't let me go until I had read every last word of that book.Then, of course, I had no choice but to re-read it; it's just that kind of book. The second reading was an altogether different thing. I was drawn right through a time tunnel...and was there! By Iza's side, I witnessed life with the clan and struggled along with them to survive the hardships of their day.I learned to love Iza--mother, teacher, friend--as much as Ayla (and must commend Jean Auel for allowing Iza to be such a warm, wise, brave, intelligent and knowledgable woman). This was Iza's story as much as it was Ayla's and, for awhile perhaps, mine. We were family. We were Clan. I was there. It's just that kind of book.When the last page was read, I felt a twinge of regret about having to return to my own time and return the book to the shelf. And so I reached for \\"The Valley of Horses\\"...and began to read."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"I just got done reading the clan of the cave bear. This is the best book I ever seen. From the very sart it is one of the best books in the world. From when Iza finds a little girl that is so close to dieing that olny Iza's best work can bring her back to the last line this book it's grate. This is the book that you have wanted all of your live. Form the time that she is 5 to the time she is 11 she dose not stop warming your hart."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"i would just like to say that i believe that i one of the best examples of historical fiction existing. not only is it informative, the plot is rich and subtle, and the whole book is full of twists and turns. i sinverely hope that the rest of the series are just as good, and that many other people will have the chance i have to savor this masterpiece of writing. also, this review is dedicated to adrienne(if she happens to be reading this) and to my hated tx history teacher who recomended it. the only worthwhile thing he's ever said!"},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"I knew that this was a novel that has been heralded as a feminist novel - a story about strong women and their struggles with society. And eventhough I have never really considered myself a \\"strong feminist\\" I really liked the book...P>The book is fascinating, the characters interesting and the setting is awe-inspiring. I couldn't put the book down once I got into the story. I would recommend this book to anyone."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"I thought this book was in a word, amazing. I loved the idea of a novel being set over 25,000 years ago. The plot was unique and suspenseful and I found myself reading long into the night. The author kept the story very realistic and congruent with actual theorys and new archaeological discoveries; I found this facinating. I found myself sympathizing often with Ayla and hurting when she hurt. Broud was a powerful antagonist and while I was forced to hate him, it was hard not to see things from his point of view as a fierce supporter of Clan traditions. While he was arrogant and unforgiving, he was a good opposite for Ayla and kept the story moving and exciting. Iza and Crub were wonderfully developed characters, both stern and compassionate. I absoutely loved how little things in the story stuck out about what life may be like in the future. The golden hair and blue eyes. Straight legs. How children are conceived. Everything. It all fit to how the reader knew things would end up thousands of years later when the mammoths would die out along with the Clan. The only main complaint I had about the book was that Ayla was always in trouble. She never got a break and I found that sort of frustrating. I know it would be hard to keep a book interesting if the protagonist was always carefree and happy, but I found it a little unrealistic that Ayla would be brought before Brun with a death sentence that many times and still come out unmarred."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"A FRIEND OF MINE RECOMMENDED THIS BOOK TO ME APPROX. 1 YEARAGO AND I HAVE BEEN HOOKED ON PREHISTORIC FICTION EVER SINCE.CLAN OF THE CAVE BEAR IS THE BEST BOOK I HAVE EVER READ.

LYNN ARMISTEAD MCKEE IS WONDERFULAS WELL AND CHARLOTTE PRENTISS. BUT THIS SERIES BY JEAN AUELHAS TO BE READ FIRST."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"Auel's read of the perhistoric world can be summed up in two words: entertaining and informative. There's not a moment of boredom in 495 pages that record young Ayla's first seventeen years of her life - from the moment that she is seperated from the people of her race (known as \\"The Others\\" - mainly those that look like modern day human beings with blue eyes and blonde hair) to her rescue by Neanderthals (early human beings believed to have evolved from apes with bow legs, a barrel-like body, extremely large foreheads...etc) to the rather heart-wrenching ending.First of all, the plot of \\"Clan of the Cave Bear\\" is extremely well planned. Auel couldn't have done it better. This isn't your \\"just write until a plot form\\" sort of book - each chapter, each event is carefully mapped to intermingle and weave carefully with another chapter.I'm still debating on Ayla's character. At times, she seems believable - cowering in fear, becoming frightened - but at other times, it seems like Auel turns her into this goddess/Amazon woman/femenist/genius/beauty - basically into the perfect woman. Ayla always seem to save the day whenever something disatrous happens - whether it's saving a young child from drowning or a hunter from the claws of a dangerous bear. She also has an unbelievable amount of inner strength that seems a bit tad too unrealistic at times. It's true that Ayla's character and personality is very different from the Neanderthals, but it doesn't mean she can confront every problem she runs into with courage most war veterans never earn. The flaw in Ayla's character is that she is too perfect.Another thing that bothers me with the book is that it's too femenistic for this day and age. There's nothing wrong in being a feminist, but in this day and age where women are already considered men's eqauls in many parts of the world, Auel seems to be grave digging an issue that had long died and should be laid to rest. But seeing as this book was written nearly 20 years, perhaps the whole \\"women gets opressed by man\\" and \\"strong woman overcomes man\\" plot wasn't as overused as it would be in this decade. It becomes a bit tedious to read Ayla's struggle as a female in a male-dominated world over and over and over again...Although I do have to applaud Auel for making all the Neanderthals find Ayla incredibly ugly even in all her glorifying white skin, blonde hair, and pale blue eyes which is a complete thumbs-up as oppose to suddenly making her the object of all the males' desire because they find her exotic and beautiful.Overall, \\"The Clan of the Cave Bear\\" is an interesting and informative read on the prehistoric era. Despite a few minor flaws and an extremely disturbing rape scene, it's a well-written book worthy of a read."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"The plot of Clan or the Cave Bear is ok, but I found myself skipping alot as the narrator goes on and on and on. For example, every time the protagonist goes herb gathering with her mentor, 2-3 pages are dedicated to describing the herbs and techniques. A short description would've added some depth to the story, but I really wasn't reading the book to get a lecture on neanderthal medicine.The characters are the saving grace of this story, adding entertainment and almost overcoming the sorry narrative. Almost, overall this book is very boring.One gets the feeling that Auel is trying to make a statement about feminism or male-female relationships, but whatever point the author is trying to make is not clear.I think my money would've been better spent on something else."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"Most historic fiction fans like to learn little tidbits about our ancestor's habits and technologies within the course of a read, and I understand that. However, though I enjoyed reading this book, I would have read more in the series if this first weren't so pre-occupied with the crafting and survival techniques of early peoples.Like most people who would pick up this book, I'm already interested in prehistory, and I read text books and watch the Discovery Channel for those things. What I want from a piece of historic fiction is fiction and adventure. In my opinion a prehistoric fiction novel should dwell no more on minutae of era existence than a good ol' western or medieval yarn. It should be taken for granted, and only that which is needed for the story should be included. It isn't necessary to place the adjective \\"steel\\" in front of knife every time you write it in a medieval book, so why is the adjective \\"stone' required in prehistoric fiction books?Also, I was hoping for more discussion of the brutality, difficulty and barbarism of the age, and was looking for more of a plot than the course of Ayla's step mother's quaint emotions and Ayla's journey of coming of age together with the developement of a sort of revolutionary prehistoric feminism.I did like the fact that the author is allowed to discuss hominid telepathy without being kicked out of her genre and into the realm of fantasy, however... and Auel is a skilled writer- at least as far as an eye for detail goes. I guess I was just looking for a different book, and having said these things I must add that I did appreciate the work. Learning some of the cultural and \\"lithic\\" facts via fiction was more fun than the research by which I usually get that knowledge, even if it tend tend to make the prose a bit contrived and patronizing.The thing is, I have to judge this book as a work of literature and not as a learning aid, because that is what it claims to be. Therefore, three stars.(That's three and a half rounded down by the way).One more thing- I think it's pretty ridiculous that Aule is taking flack because some people think her characters are prehistoric superheroes. Granted, I only read the first one, but the neanderthals at least seemed pretty wimpish compared to what they actually were in real life.An average neanderthal could stand on the 10 yard line of a football field and hurl an NFL linebacker through the goal posts with little effort, and they also had much larger brains than moderns and possessed a much higher theshold for pain. Cro-magnons were several times stronger than modern humans as well, with denser bone mass and considerably larger brains. Both races were infinitely more instinctual and able more able to survive harsh conditions without technology than modern humans.If anything, at least in this first book, Aule has diminished the prowess of Pleistocene man, rather than augmented it.J.

THIS IS THE BEST BOOK I HAVE EVER READ IN MY LIFE!! Ayla is the ultimate survivor of all time. First her mother dies in a earthquake, she survives a lion attack, she gets banned from the clan for hunting, and she contends with the evil son of the leader. The epic goes on and on.

I found it mildly interesting. It's not a page turner, in fact, I'll admit, I skimmed through certain parts that seemed too wordy. I didn't feel like I was learning much historically, I didn't feel like the author did a lot of research on the time period. It felt like I was reading pure fiction based on speculation. All that said, I read through it and am now reading the next book, Valley of the Horses, which I am actually enjoying more.One thing that surprised me about the story was how dominating the males were over females.

How do I even begin? My only wish is that the rest of the books in the series had been even half the book that this one is... I almost wish she had never gone on... I was so disappointed and bored by the rest of them. But this book... what an incredible tale of a woman's self-exploration and identity!!! I think all young women should read this book at leats once... actually, all women, no matter your age... it is exhilerating and painful and heartfelt and so realistic... and completely and utterly empowering. I am usually into thrillers, so this was different for me, and I was afraid I would be bored but... I wasn't at all... In fact, I couldn't put it down... I was completely enraptured in this woman's life. This book is a work of art, not simply a book to be read and discarded... and should receive much more acclaim... much more notoriety... than it does. Every woman should read it... seriously. You'll never forget it! :) (Oh, and unfortunately I feel my duty to tell you... if & when you do read it, please spare yourself the disappointment of the rest of the series, and end it with this book which does stand on it's own.)"},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"I LOVE ALL OF JEAN M.

After reading two large paragraphs, I could easily tell that the large book was poorly written by a hopelessly unskilled amature.&quot;Jean Auel had some great ideas for a story, but does not have the skills to tell it. The story might be interesting and well researched, but it is difficult to get past her awful prose which does nothing to paint a picture of a prehistoric time, and her amature use of adjectives is forever distracting from the story she's trying to tell.Please read the sample pages before buying this book.

I had tried to read this book yearsago when it came out and never got through it. I got bogged down in the lengthydescriptions of the landscapes. I found that the format of an audio book made iteasier for me to get through and the reader did a good job of separating andrecreating the different characters.

So, I had heard some of this story before we decided to read it for the book club, but that did not take away from the experience.

I thought it was really an amazing book. I loved the main character how strong willed she was even though she was more human and not cave man. I thought Auel did a great job writing it, but sometimes she was too descriptive about setting of the story. Description and imagery is good, but too much of it takes away from the story. I have read the rest of the series, but if you like this book you should read the others that go along with this series.thank you for your time,Loran"},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"Jean M. Auel captures efficiently the changing times and landscape of the Neanderthals and the passing of evolution towards the more modernly advanced Cro-Magnons. The story not only provides excellent descriptions of nature and climate at the time, but also captures the customs of the people. The highlight of the novel revolves around the medicinal plants and herbs that are constantly brought up through Iza and Ayla's work as medicine women. The low points of the novel are some of the repetitive elements in Auel's description of the landscape and certain details repeated verbatim. However, the story clings to you as you flip the pages hurriedly, trying to find out about the next stages in Ayla's life. Overall, a good and worthwhile read."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"My aunt recommended this book to me... she first read it when it came out back in the 80s, and I highly doubted I would ever read it, or if I did, that I would like it. Because I never took any initiative to find it, she got the whole series for me for Christmas. (Its a good thing she did, too, because now I can't put the books down!)I am so intrigued that Auel can capture a world that very few people know anything about and create such vivid pictures and characters with such dimension. Its amazing to get a taste of the world so long ago and to read such a refreshing new style of writing - and thinking. The story is incredible, and Auel's storytelling ability is marvelous... along with the fact that she can have people of all ages addicted to these books. I'm only 15, and I know many people over 50 who have devoured and loved Clan of the Cave Bear.Its an excellent find, and while I may not buy you the whole series for Christmas, I would definitely recommend it!"},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"REVIEW: The problem with reviewing a book of such groundbreaking magnitude (especially one that has spawned a whole new literary genre) is in the tendency to forgo criticism except on the most superficial levels while basking in the fact that despite the nearly impossible task the author has undertaken she actually manages to pull it off with her plausibility (relatively) intact. Jean M. Auel's \\"THE CLAN OF THE CAVE BEAR\\" tells the story of the dawn of mankind according to Darwin's evolutionary theories whereby the soon-to-be-extinct Neanderthals are about to be overwhelmed by the more adaptable/environmentally and genetically superior Cro-Magnon. After an earthquake kills her family, young five-year-old Ayla is forced to fend for herself until she is found by the Clan Of The Cave Bear which is led by the stoic yet good-hearted leader, Brun: they are a Neanderthal tribe and she is of Cro-Magnon descent. Once Brun decides to accept Ayla as part of his own Clan (in spite of their differences), Auel's tale becomes a neat character study coupled with an in-depth, day-to-day depiction of what primitive life may have been like all those years ago. Her prodigious research and the painstaking re-creation of the spiritual, physical, and mental aspects of a Neanderthal tribe is quite breathtaking in its believability and its humanity. As such it is THIS portion of the book which deserves the most praise. However, as a whole \\"THE CLAN OF THE CAVE BEAR\\" has not aged well. Auel is an above-average writer, but the construction of the book is woefully patchy and badly in need of a good editor. Events are, at times, leisurely paced yet routinely interrupted by drastic plot twists interspersed with treatises on plants and medicinal herbs, hunting, knapping tools, clothes making, food preparation and preservation as well as the meticulous cataloging of ceremonies, rituals, and feasts that are a part of their tradition. The detail is exhausting: yet none of these elements are allowed to blend into the narrative in a cohesive way. Add to that Auel's intrusively modern, feminist point of view (i.e. the promotion of abortion, euthanasia, contraception, etc.) that tends to creep into the storyline; and the resulting equilibrium of the book seems completely off-kilter and at odds with the basic plot. People of the Judeo/Christian faith will also have problems with the Darwinian point-of-view (although Auel does a great job in conveying the seriousness of the clan's beliefs by alluding to their cave bear ceremony as a sacrament equivalent to the communion of bread and wine in honor of Christ's death and resurrection unto glory). However, I find it intriguing that the \\"spiritual element\\" of such primitive people even exists if (as Darwinists proclaim) we simply crawled out of a primordial soup and evolved from monkeys. Since we are, supposedly, the result of a vast cosmic accident: then, by default, religion and the spiritual aspect of man should not exist or even be part of our genetic capabilities. Yet the capabilities are there in spite of all the scientific \\"evidence\\" to the contrary. Interesting. Still, the book is enjoyable, the main characters well-drawn, and the overall story compelling. For popular fiction that is a major achievement, but as a contemporary classic it misses the mark by a wider margin."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"I remember seeing the Children of the Earth series in the shelves of my parent's library as a kid. I was always intrigued by the art cover of the books. Now that i am an adult i remember they existed and I reast the first 4 volumes.The Clan of the Cave Bear remains my favorite.The first few chapters were a bit tedious, but as the story unfolds, I was hooked to it. Auel stresses the fact that Human evolution is not linear like a lot of people believe it is.We can compare Human Evolution to a big tree with several branches. Which means the Neanderthal man was not less intelligent than us: they had a different type of intelligence. Ayla represents the new form of Human Evolution but she has traces of the Neanderthal man in her as well. Overall, we are all human and since the ice age (or before that) we faced the same issues:Racism,Chauvinism, struggle for survival, but also love, caring, respect and solidarity. Ayla's story is tragic and beautiful at the same time. We can all relate to her because we come from the same place."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"Can't add much to the heaps of praise and descriptions already written, except to say that I read and re-read these 5 books in Jean Auel's Earth's People series. I get more out of them with each reading. I'm hoping she writes more.I've mused about whether I would recommend them to teenagers who are not yet sexually active, and I think I would. Sometimes I am shy about saying how much I enjoy this series because the author put in such steamy sex scenes (which are NOT my prime reason for loving the books), but my opinion is that Auel presents that \\"sticky\\" topic in an extremely healthy way.The imaginative, colorful, probably accurate descriptions of our prehistoric ancestors and their world with problems, large and small, and the adventures they undertake, are what fascinate me most."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"I bought this book on a recommendation from a friend. I was looking for a new series after finishing the Outlander series.The story was engaging, and I enjoyed the historical perspective of living during this era. That being said, the authors repeated use of lists was so annoying that I wanted to throw the book down on multiple occasions. At one point after reading the 35 different varieties of trees found in a particular forest, I was able to predict correctly that the next several paragraphs would be dedicated to the 50 species found in said forest. The intent must have been to paint a picture of the landscape, but it failed miserably. It felt to me as if the author were a student trying to use filler to get the assignment to the correct number of words required. I struggled through the book, and am now reading The Valley of Horses, which is much better, but still has some of the incessant ramblings. I would not recommend The Clan of the Cavebear to anyone. If you are interested in the series, start with The Valley of the Horses and save some of your sanity."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"Like many many people, I have read, and re-read the \\"Earth's Children\\" series by Jean M Auel many times since it's debut years and years ago.

If you can get past the obviously OCR'd text. This is FULL of OCR problems. It's a good thing I know this story by heart, and can easily substitute the correct words in my head.Clan of the Cave Bear (Ignore the pathetic movie) This book is wonderful. It tells the story of a 5 year old Cro-Magnum girl who loses her family during an earthquake one day, and is taken in by Neanderthals, who raise her to be one of them. She struggles to learn things that they know almost instinctively.She teaches herself things that they won't teach her, gets punished, grows up more, has a son (mixed neanderthal & cro-magnum) at 13, and is *cursed* and forced to leave alone at 15."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"I have written another review on this book, but I would like to explain a little more in-depth about what this book is all about.First of all, I'd like to say that contrary to many reviews, Neanderthals are NOT portrayed as stupid people who can't understand squat about anything \\"different\\". They are, in reality, portrayed as they may have been in real life-an ancient with amazing memories, yet differently evolved people who are resistant to change.Ayla, also, is not \\"set up to walk on water\\". I'll admit that in later books, her lightning-fast mind seems a little ludicrous, but in this book, being strong and remembering things easily is necessary to survive.The only reason I gave Clan of the Cave Bear four stars is because of the grammatical errors, such as comma splices, that cropped up all too frequently.I also enjoyed the research that Ms. Auel obviously worked her butt off to put in. I think anyone who says it's 'too much research' can't appreciate the beauty of this book."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"I just finished reading this book and I think it is one of the best books I ever read. This book tracks the voyage of a Cromagnon girl who lives in a clan of neanderthals. This clan adopts her as a member of it. This book is about how the clan accepts her and learns to deal with her differences. This book is not only a great story but it is scientifically accurate.

I had always seen it, heard of it, but somehow never got around to actually sitting down and reading its pages. The decision to read CLAN OF THE CAVE BEAR was one that I could never regret. While reading it I cheered silently for Ayla, cried visibly for her, and was angry when injustices fell on her. Reading this novel was like visiting another world, allowing me to escape everyday life to live in the past. I was terribly sad when I had finished the last page, but look forward to continuing the series.In the beginning I was skeptic about the quality, but as I continued reading I found that the quality was the highest of any book I have ever read. The details were so descriptive that I could see the cave, the landscape, the people... so much that they became real to me. This novel is not only a great piece of fiction but a world all in its own. I could actually relate to the characters in the book, namely Ayla. I felt her will and determination, and most of all her willingness to sacrfice herself for anything that was important to her. Well done, Ms. Auel, you have created a superb piece of literature."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"I wouldn't have stuck with this improbably (even for fantasy) tale much beyond the parts where Ayla: 1) invents shampoo and 2)discovers fire, but I was in that proverbial &quot;desert island&quot; situation (it happens!).

Having seen the not-so-great movie (for one reason), the book just didn't appeal to me. But I finally relented and read it. And I loved it. In fact, I immediately read the 4 sequels and I'm anxiously waiting for the 6th and (possibly) final book in the series. Maybe I like them because I'm not a literature snob (that's a friendly snipe at another reviewer).Ayla is a great heroine. She is beautiful, smart, and a survivor! Of course all of her achievements (taken together in this and the later books) aren't realistic. She is an idealized character. She is symbolic of the new and improved, modern homo sapiens. And I dig her!My only criticism of the book is that the frequent lengthy descriptions of the flora are repetitive and long-winded, but after a while I learned to skim through those pages (sorry, Jean).For entertainment value, \\"Clan of the Cave Bear\\" and its sequels can't be beat. There are hardships, conflicts, conquests, and loving relationships. But there is much more here than just entertainment; there is an education in anthropology and botany that should be worth a few college credits!I found \\"Clan of the Cave Bear\\" and the entire series to be totally unique -- human drama and lovable characters (all except Broud, that is), when the characters are all cave people! Who would have thought?!? And by the way, after reading the books and then watching it again, the movie really wasn't that bad!"},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"If you like well crafted historical FICTION, written by an intelligent and educated author, enjoy suspense and good versus evil, root for the underdog, look out behind you! type storytelling this is the book for you. Jane Auel weaves a rich, rich tapestry in your mind. Who can argue the setting? Anything is possible, it's a never never land really. As fantastical as Star Trek in reverse. But the characters draw you in, you will no doubt fall in love with them.I bought this book because I needed something to read during a long day of travelling on airplanes and was quite reluctant to start it. But I was hooked within the first few pages and I was bonded to the characters from that time on. I am now an avid fan and can't wait to get the second book in the series \\"The Valley of the Horses\\".Politics and scientific inconsistencies aside, implied or overt racist implications, blah, blah and so on, this book is one heck of a good read. Unfortunately for Jane Auel she chose the stereotypical \\"aryan\\" protagonist, but in my opinion, what could appear weaker in any society than a helpless five year old, blonde, blue eyed female? The epitomy of fraility! Those who see this as another nazi theorem, get over yourselves!! This is more a feminist outlook; look at the brilliant Iza. This is afterall, a novel. Anyone that confuses this with a scientific thesis or dissertation, or is offended by what they perceive as racist innuendo is reading well below their level and should go back to their text books."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"The premise of this story is interesting and the story is good; it's too bad it's so poorly executed. The prose is blocky and reads like a pre-history textbook with characters and plot slapped on as an afterthought. In general there is just too much time spent on detail, like the author needed to make several length-reducing rewrites. For example she spends quite a bit of time describing how the women in the Clan are treated as property, which is so cliched it doesn't need more than a passing mention. She spends a lot of time talking about side characters who are too under-developed as characters to tell apart. The detail about the pre-historical fauna and lifestyle are told in long paragraphs that bring the story to a screeching halt, rather than being woven into the narrative in a way that's still entertaining. However with a lot of skimming the book did keep me reading until the end."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"When looking for something over a pre-historic tribe of men, i looked and looked and found this.

So well written; this is my favorite book of all time."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"*** minor technical spoiler ***I was really eager to read something about prehistoric times, and to my delight the story started out interesting as it was. But after 30 pages, I was beginning to be really annoyed about the narrator... First person, third person, in every character's point of view, in everybody's head, changing in every paragraph. Honestly, it was bothering me so much that I had to put the book down a few times. I found it dilettant. Then I got to thinking, well, if I wanted to theorize about it, I would say she is playing on the collective consciousness of these people: if they can delve into the memories of the ancestors, by analogy, we can delve into their heads, which could be a reason for the author's choices, but it sounded... just... not right.However, while reading further on, I got so immersed in the story, which is fascinating, original, fantastic and captivating, that narration stopped to matter :) I completely forgot about it! This hardly every happens to me. Incredibly detailed descriptions, relationships well-elaborated on, and all this in a realistic and down-to-earth manner. My compliments.

I was almost anxious to read it and judge for myself if it was all that it was cracked up to be. Once I started reading, I felt that it was going to be a very hard book to get into. As it went on, past the first 100 pages or so, I found myself unable to put it down. This book made me feel all of the different emotions: anger, sadness, happiness, etc. Some of the descriptions of ceremonies became a little boring ,and I was skimming over those parts, but all in all, it was a very good book."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"When is the fifth book coming out"},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"I was 12 years old when I did read this 4 children og the earth books.(I am 16 now) I love them!

It is a fascinating story, always engrossing! One of those that will stay with you forever - in a good way. None of the sequels have been nearly as good as this first book - but you still read them, hoping. I picked this book up near the register at the supermarket while waiting in line and was hooked after the first page. Hopefully sooner rather than later, Auel will get the main character (Ayla) back to the Clan for the resolution of this series. Whether she does or not, this book stands on its own. Read and enjoy!"},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"This is a moving and beautiful novel about a tall 'early-human' girl who is adopted by 'the clan' (in other words Cavemen). It is set on Pre-historic earth and follows her life from being found as a five year old to becoming a young woman and leaving the clan. Life is a struggle for Ayla, and she finds it very difficult to fit in with the ways and customs of the clan.Basically it is a struggle for survival in a harsh ice-age world, and I found myself fascinated with the real historical world that Jean has researched and written about. I couldn't get enough of it and I have since read the following four books. Thoroughly recommended."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"I read this book and the others in this series many years ago,and have since read them several times. they are all fantastic, eduacational, and just plain ole fun to read!

The language and the story are so wonderful that I couldn't get by without owning this book. I think it's a novel that everyone should read!"},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"I first read this book in the 80's and enjoyed it tremendously. I read it again just recently and it still remains one of my most favorite.The story of Ayla and her determination to overcome give me strength. Auel's detailed descriptions of everyone and everything left nothing to your imagination. I laughed and I cried. I felt every heartbreak and every ounce of pride that Ayla felt.The spirits of the totems and the ceremonies remind me of the spiritualism of our Early American Indians. Auel's book, although fiction, is very believable.I love this book. It is WELL WORTH THE PRICE!"},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"In our society time is money...zero to 60 in as few seconds as possible! Well, get in my 80 horse power Nissan and you'll probably wonder why it isn't moving. Before you realize it though, you're doing 65 with the rest of the crowd.That's what this novel will do to you. It starts you off in a Nissan that quicly transforms into a BMW roadster. And the next thing you know you've lost a night's sleep because you can't put it down!Set in prehistoric times when the era of the Neanderthals was slowly giving way to the Cro-Magnons, \\"Clan...\\" follows the life of Ayla, a blonde Cro-Magnon girl adopted by a clan of Neanderthals, as she grows into young womanhood. (Keep in mind that in Cro-Magnon days females became young women in their early teens.) The adventures of Ayla begin at age 5 and continue into her mid-teens.Along the way Ms Auel creates Ayla into something of a wonder woman. For example---clan women are forbidden to hunt or use weapons of any kind. So naturally Ayla finds a sling and teaches herself how to use it in secret. When her secret is found out Ayla, 14 years old and more than 8 months pregnant, is banished for one month in the dead of winter. As far as the Clan is concerned this is tantamount to a death sentence, since in all of the Clan's memories no female in her condition had ever survived such a banishment. But Ayla retreats to a small cave she had discovered months earlier, stocks the cave with wood and bedding materials, hunts for food with her sling, and gives birth to a son. All of this on her own, mind you, in blinding snow storms and only 14 years old.But hey!...it is a work of fiction, right?. And let's face it, females of that era surely had to be just as rugged and resourceful as the males in order to survive. So maybe it isn't so unbelievable after all. One thing is sure, you will be rooting for Ayla from beginning to end.Regardless of how far fetched you may find Ayla's adventures, Jean Auel's fertile imagination (and her obvious research) has created a novel that is truely entertaining and well worth reading."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"Picking this book is not. An employee of a chain book store recommended it to me. After reading the synopsis on the back cover, I had to ask if he was kidding. Needless to say I bought the book and after struggling through the first few pages, I found it nearly impossible to put down. Whether you're a frat boy or an elderly woman, get this book and you will find yourself quickly stocking up on the rest of the books in the series and pushing the ones you've already read on friends and family."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"One of the first authors who got me interested in historical and archeological novels.

By reading the description, I usually would have passed it by, but for some reason I went ahead and tried it. Truely a wonderful decision. My true love is magical fantasy but this book is so interesting and so well written, anyone would be caught up in it. The life Ayla deals with is fascinating. Auel obviously did her research with this making it educational as well as intertaining. I learned a lot from this book about the early days of man. I couldn't put it down and within two weeks, I had bought and read the rest of the series. Can't wait for SHELTERS OF STONE to come out in November. EXCELLENT SERIES!!

My mom gave it to me a long time ago and told me to read it, but it didn't look all that great so I procrastinated for about a year! When I finally read it, I literally couldn't put it down! All I did was eat, read, and sleep. There is no way you can be disappointed because, WOW! It's just too good!"},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"I felt like I was reading an anthropology book, which may be appealing to some readers, but wasn't what I was looking for."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"This book is.... well not very good. It's got lots of history and details that paint an interesting picture of the time the story is set in, but Auel is just not a story-teller. I think she wanted to write a history text-book, and did this instead. When she tries to give us a narrative or get us to care about her characters, most of the time she fails.*SPOILERS (if you care)*The story centers around Ayla, a cro-magnon who is orphaned and taken in by a clan of Neanderthals called the Clan of the Cavebear. The clan is very male-centric, and the women are essentially a slave class. They communicate in a version of sign-language and age much faster than modern humans.Ayla somehow *cough*plotcontrivance*cough* survives an attack from a cave-lion despite this apparently being really hard to do. She then stumbles off and gets lost and passes out. When she is found by the only truely likable character in the book, Iza, she is dehydrated and suffering from a nasty infection on her scratch-wound from the lions, making Iza take pity on her, despite not being supposed to interact with &#34;The Others&#34; (aka, the cro-magnons) and stop to help her. Her brother, the clan leader, tells her to leave the girl there, but Iza begs him to let her take the little girl with them, because she can't bear to see a child suffer, no matter what the species. Since Iza is the clan's medicine woman, and he doesn't want her to be upset and do her job badly, he allows her to keep the child, at least temporarilly.Ayla, of course, grows up to be a mary-sue to end all mary-sues. Ayla can cook, clean, make leather thongs and bone tools, bowls, etc, better than just about everybody. She's also apparently somehow magically a better medicine woman than her foster mother, Iza, for no apparent reason aside from the apparent magic of having a cro-magnon brain. She also manages to endear hersef to some of the clan's men, including the Mog-Ur (shaman) and a few of the hunters. They still treat her like crap, but typically don't smack her around like some of the others do. She is good at EVERYTHING, except making Broud, the clan's resident psychopath/sociopath/future leader, like her. Though he apparently does enjoy raping her, so there's that very icky detail.A lot of the story ends up being repititions of &#34;women are submissive and men are dominant, so it's totally weird that Ayla doesn't like being submissive!&#34; &#34;Ayla's not supposed to hunt, but SHE TOTALLY DOES!&#34; how much she totally wants to have a baby, and can't figure out why she hasn't had one yet, because she's been living with the clan for like, forever, and she's totally 8 now, so it's definitely time! and how sad she is that she's so &#34;ugly&#34; which is clearly a huge wink-wink-nudge-nudge to the reader, since she's described as absurdly conventionally beautiful when they describe her looks. She also figures out how conception, pregnancy, and paternity work, just because, and for some reason, is not killed after the first time or two she does something she's not supposed to and cheeses off the group's leadership.The other kind of creepy thing about the story is the subtle racist undertone of it. Ayla is somehow lily-white despite being out under the sun all the time, and is ridiculously perfect at everything except being a submissive woman. She's portrayed as this beautiful, super-talented, super-intelligent creature, so abused by the mean old Neanderthals. Aside from the annoying mary-sue nature of that characterization, the Neanderthal clan is described as dark, having large noses, thick course dark hair, and being generally not very bright. Hm... lily-white, blonde, blue-eyed, perfect, put-upon woman living amongst course uncivilized dark-skinned clan of idiots. Nope, no racism there. No sirree.If you're just looking for a very detailed text-book like description of the world of the Neanderthal, this is a good book for that. So, however, are many actual text-books. If you want a story or real characters, this is not the book for you."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"Esta est&oacute;ria de beleza e poder &eacute; uma saga sobre pessoas, relacionamentos, amor e sobrevivncia.Atrav&eacute;s do relato de Jean M Auel, somos levados de volta &agrave; aurora dos seres humanos.

It seems that with the passing of time, I've become more interested in a good story line and less critical of journeys into the realm of pure fantasy.The story is captivating. A child found and raised by a tribe of people from another branch of the human evolutionary tree. As the child grew to be a woman she was accepted by the tribe. She was valued, even loved but always different. Jean Auel has created a wonderful character in Ayla, smart, practical, loyal and loving, yet fundamentally different from the people she shares her life with. Fascinating from start to finish this book will leave you wanting more. Happily there are more books which continue the story of Ayla and I plan to read them soon."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"I remember during the eighties everyone was reading 'Clan of the Cave Bear' by Jean M. Auel - and they were raving about it. I don't know why it took me so long to get around to reading it, but finally I have and now that Auel has finished the six part series, I haven't stopped reading this saga (just finished number three 'The Mammoth Hunters').The reason why I finally picked it up to read was because of a recommendation from a friend who I regularly 'talk books' with. She was astounded I hadn't read it and demanded that I did so pronto, and I dutifully downloaded it. So, what is it about this book that gets people talking? For me it is the fascination of where we have come from as a species, and how we have become the people we are today.The story is set in prehistoric times, roughly 30 000 years ago. It follows the story of Ayla, the protagonist, who is separated from her parents at a young age and taken in by a travelling group of 'clan' people, they are Neanderthal.This story interests readers on a number of levels. Firstly, Ayla's struggle to belong and fit into a vastly different group is heart wrenching. The emotional journey she experiences is so engaging to read. Ayla is a highly likable character. She is intelligent and caring and we sympathies with her readily as she attempts to learn the cultural norms, taboos and language of a neanderthal society. As she becomes interested in healing and medicine, the story interests us further and we become privy to the magic of the plants used to heal in prehistoric times.Secondly, the life of the Neanderthal, the way they existed and their differences from humans makes for fascinating reading. Auel's ability to bring research to life is intoxicating. I found myself doing a little of my own research as I read this book, wanting to learn more about our evolutionary cousins. One thing I came across is that it is likely some human beings today carry Neanderthal genes. Fascinating! It is so interesting to read about a human species that is now extinct. One thing that is particularly intriguing is the differences in the brain structures. Neanderthals had very large back brains and Auel capitalises on this by showing the clan's remarkable capacity for memory.Another aspect that makes this an exceptional read is the detail in terms of the daily life of prehistoric people. The clothing, food, tools and housing are all described in fascinating detail along with how they were made. Humanity's capacity for innovation is celebrated in this series. But at the same time we are reminded of the dire consequences if we ever lose respect for the earth and all that it provides. Auel cleverly reminds us of this and we wonder if we have already lost it.The only real criticism I have is that perhaps Ayla is too perfect. Surprise, surpass as we read on in the series, not only is she altruistic, intelligent and innovative, she is drop dead gorgeous! Sometimes her perfection and her innocence about it, \\"I am not beautiful\\" gets a little irritating ... but only a little.I am up to the fourth novel, 'The Plains of Passage', but for me, so far, 'The Clan of the Cave Bear' has been a favourite. I highly recommend it for those who particularly enjoy historical fiction."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"The first book in this series The Earth Children's Series was very informative. The Story begins. The author has a tendency to repeat things in the book series that was very annoying to me over the next 6 books. I found myself skipping over details as se repeatedly described the same senarios over and over again. I wanted to see how the story ended so I stayed with it. The books have a great story line. The author has really done her homework on the cave man and his previous life. I enjoyed the knowledge that came along with the books. I feel like she needed a partner to help her with her struggling story lines at times.I enjoyed the series I didn't feel they were worth the money I paid to read them. I would wait until the price drops before purchasing them."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"This book is the first novel of the epic saga of Jean M. Auel Earth's Children series. The novels are set in Prehistoric Europe during the Ice Age, approximately 35,000- 25,000 years ago when the Cro-Magnon and Neanderthal people coexist. This is a marvelous book; it will truly go down as one of the most epic novels of the past 31 years. It is the first volume of a powerful series. This book takes you away to another time and place and will leave you fascinated with human history, with the Neanderthals, and with the history of civilization. It is a vivid and lucid reconstruction of a long forgotten era. This book is deeply researched and fascinating. Her story provides an insight into the prehistoric life of humans.The series begins with the introduction of the main character, Ayla, and the circumstances that occur that results in her being adopted by \\"The Clan\\". Ayla is first presented as a five-year-old girl who had just lost her entire family to an earthquake. Alone and desperate, she wanders in hopes of finding her dead mother. Cold, hungry, and badly injured by a cave lion, she is near death when the Clan of the Cave Bear finds her. This clan, left homeless by the same disaster, has little interest in the helpless girl who comes from the tribe they refer to as the \\"Others.\\" Only their medicine woman sees Ayla as a fellow human; worthy of care. Ayla's strange ways challenge the clan who live by ancient beliefs and tradition passed down to them from their ancestors. Ayla represents the physically modern Cro-Magnons. As Ayla begins to grow and mature, her natural tendencies emerge, putting her in the middle of a brutal and dangerous power struggle. From this point on, a strange world unfold. It's a discovery trip for Ayla and the reader. At the same time it allows us a deep insight into \\"otherness\\". In a present world that is shrinking and cultural differences arise every minute, Ms Auel's work show the human common traits that make us kin to every other human being, even if it is as distantly related as a Neanderthal.There are forceful descriptions of Ice Age habitat and Neanderthal culture, shedding light and introspection into hunting methods, social relationships, stone technology, herb doctor techniques, weaponry, the comfort of familiarity with its dogged dogma and whatever other aspect of a civilization one may be interested in. This series really does have everything: joy, sorrow, hope, despair, humor, imagination and a solid chunk of concrete facts. It is essentially a work of fiction, but Auel has done an incredible amount of research and, as a result, the work is replete with details on the way life could have been two hundred and fifty plus centuries ago. Although set in a prehistoric world of incredible beauty, sadly now lost to us for all time, it shows us that we are indistinguishable from our ancestors of the last Ice Age, & how they had exactly the same basic needs, desires and ambitions that we have now.I am in love with this author's style. At first I was somewhat disconnected, because her technique moves from \\"head to head.\\" But it works because much of the 'dialogue' in this book is nonverbal. I am in love with Iza, Creb and Ayla's characters, while even nasty Broud is one of my favorites. It's not really that he's a bad guy, he's doing what centuries of evolution has told him is right. Man is the boss, woman is subservient. That Ayla's tribe is a group of humans further up the evolutionary chain than the clan makes for interesting conflict. I root for her, cringe at the caveman mentality of male/female relationships and sit back in awe at the author's amazing description of how our world was during the ice age. The research she completed is phenomenal; every plant, rock, animal, and person is described in such detail that it comes alive- right out of the pages. The Clan of the Cave Bear was totally and completely spellbinding.Other books in the series are:The Valley of Horses ... Ayla leaves the clan to find others like herself and meets Jondular, the love of her lifeThe Mammoth Hunters ... Ayla's first experience with a group of her own peopleThe Plains of Passage ... Ayla's and Jondular's journey back to Jondular's homelandThe Shelters of Stone ... Ayla's and Jondular's experiences when they arrive back at his homeAnd the newest, the sixth of the series recently released March 29th 2011:The Land of Painted Caves ... It's been 31 years since readers were introduced to the first book in Jean Auel's Earth's Children series, \\"The Clan of the Cave Bear.\\" The Land of Painted Caves,\\" her sixth and final installment, picks up where \\"The Shelters of Stone\\" left off. Ayla is now mated to Jondalar and mother to a baby girl, Jonayla. She's come a long way from the outcast of the first book.Over the years, her journey has engrossed fans and turned the series into a bestselling phenomenon -- more than 45 million books sold. No small feat considering that the books average about 600+ pages. But readers have loved the uncertainty of Ayla's hazardous future as well as the detail Auel brings to Ayla's world. (The only thing more detailed than one of Auel's descriptive passages is probably an entry in an encyclopedia.)"},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"Readers should be warned: This book contains an abundance of descriptions of the land, the plants, the food, and life of the Neanderthal. Jean Auel is extremely knowledgeable and adds a great deal of facts to her novel. Although I find this impressive, I think this takes away a little bit from the story. At times when I wanted to find out what would happen next to Ayla or the clan, I found myself reading about plants and their healing powers or of local biology.The story as a whole was very interesting and I think it is very relevant in today's world. The characters are lovable and I was emotionally invested in them. I'm truly glad I invested the time to finishing this book. I'm not sure if I will read the next one because I was hoping it would follow both Ayla and the Clan but as I understand it, the reader only follows Ayla."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"When I first read \\"Clan of the Cave Bear\\", I couldn't put it down. I have read all the books in the series and this is by far my favorite. Don't equate the Movie to the book - there is absolutely no comparison. The book is BY FAR superior!Jean M. Auel descriptions of the life of these two diverging lines of mankind are fantastic. Auel immerses you into the lives of the Clan members, by way of the daily struggle to survive: hunting, gathering, medicines, landscape and cave life; and Ayla's conflict of staying with her mother and the need for her own kind progresses as she grows until it reaches a climax. Ayla never sways from who she is; she continued to fight for the right to be equal, and although she is banished from the tribe, she leaves with her head held high knowing she can rise above almost any obstacle.I did find the descriptions of herbs, plants and medicines a tad lengthy - however, it is a great read -- I highly recommend ALL of Jean Auel's books in the series.(NOTE: There are a few \\"suggestive\\" sections that may not be suitable for younger readers.)** Spoiler Alert **During the period of the Ice Age, the main character Ayla finds herself orphaned at the age of 5. Wandering, and near death after an attack from a tiger, Ayla awakes in the arms of Iza, a Clan member who has just lost her young daughter. She refuses to leave the young girl behind to die, and eventually becomes the child's \\"mother.\\"The Clans' only form of communication is through grunts and hand gestures, which Ayla finds foreign and difficult to understand. The Clan first considers her stupid, but Ayla, is actually of the more advanced tribe called \\"Others\\".Broud, the next in line to become leader abhors Ayla, and habitually abuses her -- physically and mentally. Women are subservient and Ayla does her best to fit in, but her natural curiosity and advanced ability for knowledge eventually rebells and gets her banished from the Clan, but not until she has gained the respect of all the tribes (excluding Broud)."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"THE CLAN OF THE CAVE BEAR is the first book in Jean Auel's series Earth's Children. Over the years, many friends have suggested this series to me, so I've meant to read it for a long time and finally did just that. In reading, it is important to remember this is speculative fiction, based loosely on fact, and not fact.Throughout the book, Auel makes good use of her knowledge of medicinal herbs, landscapes and climates. Little idiosyncracies can usually be overlooked, like the use of plants native to North America instead of Europe where the stories take place, discussion on land masses and bodies of water which aren't consistent with what we now know can usually be overlooked, and so on.Auel's strength is that she enables the reader to see life as it might have been lived by our ancestors during the last Ice Age. She makes you wonder about behavior of ancient man, what is must have been like to sit under unpolluted skies or spend the winter in a cave. While a cave may be pretty damp and cold, the damp and cold may be the least of your worries as you'd also yave to worry about food supplies as winter progressed and may also have to fend off wild animals like a cave lion.Auel doesn't mention the clan of the cave bear by name but ones senses they are Neanderthals, and the \\"others\\" are closer to what we'd consider 'modern' humans. Auel's contrast between the traditional people who relied on memory for survival versus the new people who could think and reason and viewed the world in terms of \\"cause and effect\\" is insightful and profound. But what if the world isn't really cause and effect? A good question."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"The Clan of the Cave Bear, by Jean M Auel, was a fantastic book. The idea of Ayla's family being killed and then being separated from society and found by a group of 'uncivilized' and 'under developed' Clan, makes for a great story full of adventure and excitement. There is never a dull moment around the tall, blue eyed Ayla and the rest of the people in her Clan. You find yourself not able to put down the book because you want to see what sort of trouble Ayla will get in, if she'll finally master the art of her sling, or if she'll finally be accepted into the Clan.Auel captures each character and the Clan as a whole so well and you learn so much about them. She created a 'society' for her book without leaving out any detail. Auel created their 'language', social rank, hunting habits, religion, etc. which really helps you understand the Clan that much better.Overall I really enjoyed this book and recommend it to anyone who likes adventurous stories with a heroic main character. It's a good book to pick up when there's nothing to do and you're looking for some entertainment. And after you read The Clan of the Cave Bear there are four others that follow. I hope you enjoy them as much as I did."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"Before I begin, I want to mention that I am making any events from the book as vague as possible while I write. The book is full of twists and turns and I don't want to take any surprise from you if you choose to read this book. The book as a whole is a work of art. Such a thick book might scare people away, but as soon as you begin to read the book you can't tear your eyes away from it. From the moment the book begins till the moment it ends it is full of action. Never a dull moment happens in Ayla's life. (Ayla being the main character of the book.) The characters are deep and full of life. Auel gives such rich descriptions and life to the characters. You feel as though you've met them and have actually become friends with all of them by the end of the book. Every book is not with out it's flaws, though; And this book is no exception. Auel obviously did extensive research on plants, animals, and the life and times of cave people. Her research does not blend well with the book, though. She describes scenes and settings in &quot;over detail.&quot; It seems as though she is &quot;showing off&quot; her knowledge rather than describing to the reader how things look. She will go into detail about the plants and unless you are a botanist, these details are meaningless. You can skim over these details easily, but you can't skim over a rotten book. Lucky for us, the book is great except for the over details. There was one other problem I had with the book. Inconsistency. In one part of the book, Ayla is banned from a certain activity and even from speaking of it. Continue reading for a while and you will find her not only doing the activity and speaking of it, but teaching someone else the activity. I may have been mistaken and somewhere missed it when the ban was lifted, but this ban was a punishment that I could see no reason for revoking. This doesn't take anything away from the book; It is still wonderful despite this! Time strains to change in the book. It doesn't blend seamlessly like it should. It is an abrupt change and you feel as though you have missed something. When so much time passes without telling the reader, Auel could have at least told us Ayla's current age! But you are forced to guess her age at each time change, which really makes getting a good mental picture of what was going on difficult. I hate to end on a sour note, so I'll continue on for a bit more. The plot of the book is amazing! I knew just from hearing about the topic that this book was going to be great. Some books dwell on events and seem to take forever to get interesting, but not this one! Things are quick, but not so quick that it becomes hard to understand what's going on. I cannot wait to read the entire series. I encourage every one to at least pick up the 1st book (The Clan Of the Cave Bear) and read the 1st chapter. I guarantee you'll fall in love with this book."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"Admittedly, The Clan of the Cave Bear has parts that feel a bit like a V.C. Andrews novel set during the Ice Age, but I still enjoyed it immensely and am now fascinated with the joys, hardships, knowledge, limitations, and legacy of the Neanderthals and their differing counterparts, the Cro-Magnons. Jean Auel writes in an extremely detailed and interesting style; her in-depth understanding of Ice Age flora and fauna is undeniable, and many of her characters are unforgettable (Ayla, the lucky and resourceful Cro-Magnon heroine adopted by the Neanderthal Clan after a terrifying earthquake leaves her orphaned and wandering the gorgeous but dangerous landscape; Iza, the loving surrogate mother to Ayla and the Clan's talented medicine woman; Creb, a father figure to Ayla as well the respected aging magician--or \\"mog-ur\\"--of the Clan).The Clan of the Cave Bear is packed with information regarding the rituals, customs, and home of the Neanderthals. While I am sure Auel has taken literary license in the Clan's acceptance of Ayla (an \\"Other\\") and the thoughts and motivations of the members, one can't help but become enthralled with the aspects of prehistoric life and daily survival, especially when Ayla is forced to fend for herself. I suggest The Clan of the Cave Bear for anyone remotely interested in the end of the Neanderthals' era--or, really, for anyone who enjoys vivid storytelling."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"I first read this book when I was in 7th grade, and am rereading it now, in 11th grade. This is an amazing story that my dad convinced me to read, and I've become hooked on the whole series! Auel gives the reader not only meticulously researced information concerning culture, vivid descriptions of the neanderthals, and geography, but also a twisting, inviting plot that makes the book impossible to put down! Thus Clan of the Cave Bear(and the entire Earth's ChildrenTM series) appeals to a wide audience. Adventure, history, and an eloquent storytelling style are combined with excellent results."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"The story of an orphaned little girl being adopted by a neanderthal clan in the latest ice age is very original, especially the description of their language, food, medicines, and ways of life in general. But what disturbs me about the book is whether these facts are actually correct: forMrs. Auel's saying her book is based on a very vast study of the subject. But a few years ago I've read an article about how neanderthals could talk just like us if anybody bothered to teach them - this is a MAJOR slip for a book that's supposed to be more or less accurate... I do understand how the fact that the Clan's language is not a vocal one enhances the plot of this book and the following ones, but maybe this inaccuracy should have been mentioned right next to Mrs. Auel's statement about her vast research... This way, I feel I can never be sure about any other 'facts' in the story.Another issue I wasn't comfortable about in the whole series is its feminist message. Even though I'm a woman, and believe in women's rights, I think that the importance of each gender's role in the clan wasn't given enough attention just to stress the 'unfairness' of it all. I think it's wrong to judge a society so different from our own, in time, herritage and customs, by our own standards of right and wrong."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"This book is a wonderful way to escape our every day mind set and slip into the endless adventure of the characters portrayed. If you love history you will certainly enjoy this novel as well as the others to this set. I own all the books and have read them at least twice. I would love to know when and if there is going to be another book? The author is a delightful writer with percision and style. This book and set is a must have."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"If you are looking for an engaging story, not fluffy but not too ponderous, and one that is a little off the beaten track, this would be a good choice.The previous negative review surprises me. I have read Unmeel's other reviews and believe that his inaccurate review of this book is not worthy of his talents. Author Jean Auel goes to great pains in this book not to portray the CroMagnon girl as &quot;superior&quot; to the Neandrethal clan that has adopted her. The Neandrethals survived for 250,000 years, far longer than we have, a fact which Auel reverently acknowledges. This story is set during a time where the characteristics of one hominid species (Neandrethal) would, through a certain inflexibility, bring about its demise, while the characteristics of another, CroMagnon, would enable it to continue as earth's surviving human inhabitant. Since this book deals thematically with this transition, it is essential that it looks at the differences that brought it about. Nowhere does the book explicitly or through its tone suggest that the difference meant the Neandrethals were inferior. In fact, they are portrayed lovingly and respectively.Indeed, Auel's view seems to be that the Neandrethals were in several ways superior to the CroMagnon, but that overall their inability to adapt to the forthcoming changes ultimately rendered these advantages meaningless.The plot is far fetched, and of course a certain license must be taken when writing about how people lived some 30,000 years ago, but the tale is carries you along, is often touching, and is refreshing in its refusal to impose 20th century values on prehistoric societies. The writing style can be uneven, making me think that perhaps it was written over a long period of time with gaps in between, but when all is said and done we have been introduced to several memorable characters. The most appealing is that of the Mog-Ur, the medicine man, proving that Auel's bias is not toward the &quot;new and improved&quot; CroMagnon."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"Jeam M. Auel's The Clan of the Cave Bear is one of the most moving and interesting books I have read in a long time. It is the story of a woman, Ayla, and is set in the world of prehistoric man, about thirty thousand years ago. Ayla is separated from her family at a young age after an earth-shaking natural disaster. She is adopted by a travaling Clan of Cave People. Ayla is a Cro-Magnon, and as she grows up, the author shows her readers how the girl's mental and physical deviations from her adopted family change both her and them. As Ayla grows up, the story becomes an epic tale of her struggle to both survive and fit in with a group of people she is destined to overtake through evolution eventually. Of course, Ayla doesn't know this, and the story is moving in that it shows how Ayla's love stretches all bounds, from her adopted mother and father, to her son, Durc, who was born from a brutal rape.Auel obviously did a lot of research for this book, which is shown by her seemingly unboundless knowledge of the prehistoric landscape, animals, plants, and lifestyles that surround her characters. She vividly depict the Paleolithic setting, making the reader almost believe he or she could visit the endless grasslands or glacier mountains the author writes of. Overall, The Clan of the Cave Bear is an epic book, very captivating, and definitely a real page-turner."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"The Clan of the Cave Bear is very, very good. However, I only gave it four stars because it is a bit long-winded and its sentences run on. (It would have a long phrase, a comma, and then another long phrase. It got kind of tiring.) Ayla's abilities do not seem unnatural to me; Jean Auel did an excellent job of sculpting them into the story. Whoever said that Jean Auel \\"really, really wants to be blond\\" is sadly mistaken."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"I love CotCB. It has made my favorite books list. I strongly suggest you read it. It is the story of Ayla, a five year old girl, who's family was killed in an earthquake. Alone in the prehistoric wilderness, Ayla wanders off to find help. She encounters starvation, dehydration, roaring waterfalls, cave lions, and sickness. She collaspes, almost dead. And there, she is found by the Clan of the Cave Bear, a clan of neaderthals. They are looking for a new home, sence theirs was destroyed in the earthquake. Iza, the medicine woman, begs Brun, the leader, to let her care for Ayla. He allows her to, and begins Ayla's life with the Clan.The Earth's Children series has six books, Clan of the Cave Bear, Valley of the Horses, Mammoth Hunters, Plains of Passage, Shelters of Stone, and Land of the Painted Caves. After CotCB, the books start going down hill, so you don't have to continue, but if you do, they are very addicting and you won't be able to stop. All in all, read CotCB, but not the others."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"This is storytelling at its finest. Normally, a book about a subject like this would not really pique my interest, but my mom wanted to read it together, so here I am. This book is beautifully written, it doesn't take long before before it transports you back in time. The plot development and in-depth character build up make this book extremely hard to put down. This is a must read for everybody who enjoys a good book, and I recommend reading it with a buddy because there will be many times you will want to vent about how amazing/annoying/sad certain situations and characters are. IT'S SO GOOD!!!"},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"At the outset, please note that this is an amazing work of art that most everyone is going to soak up and find impossible to forget. It's a moving tale of a human child raised by a clan of neanderthals. The way the author manages to fit so much meaning and depth into characters who spend a great deal of time unable to or rarely communicating is astounding, to say the very least. And it is also fair to say that this is sure to be unlike anything else you've ever read.My only warning to potential readers would be to point out ahead of time that you are going to encounter plenty of detailed scenery description. On one hand it is often insightful and goes to show that the author has really done her homework on the period. But the average reader may find it to be a bit much at times. I say that because I found it to be too much at times, and I'm generally overly fascinated by these sorts of additions. One could easily compare this aspect of Auel's writing style to Tolkien's obsession with sharing the historicity of each location and character in his otherwise steady-flowing works.Regardless of whether or not you love or hate this aspect of Jean's style, one thing you will not be able to deny is just how breathtaking this story ends up being. And you'll want to finish it in any case. Very highly recommended!"},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"It was a co-worker who recommended to read this series..

Over all it was a good read."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"i love this book. if i lived back then i would have wanted Ayla for my best friend. she is a very independent woman. she is very strong willed and survival minded.

Clan of the Cave Bear is pleasant, but it is profound and has enormous impact on the way we think of what it means to be human. This is not a book for simply passing the time, but for pondering over time. This novel is life-changing, and is certainly among the handful of novels that one must read before one can claim to be educated. Ayla is one of the most interesting characters in fiction, but the backdrop for her story is possibly the grandest I have ever seen developed in a novel. This novel is unique. Reading it was an experience I will never forget."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"This book is the best out of the whole series, though Valley of the Horses is a close second. The first time I read this book I was 14 and I instantly fell in love with it. In the past 15 years I've re-read it at least 5-6 times (pretty much every time Jean M. Auel released a new book I re-read Clan of the Cave Bear). You can read a synopsis of the book in the jacket so I won't go into the plot. All I will say is if you did a search for it you're at least mildly interested in reading it.....DO IT!!! You won't be disappointed. The other books in the series are good as well and you will most likely want to continue the series as each book ends a journey while at the same time starting a new one. An excellent read!"},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"In 1977 writer Jean M. Auel began research for her first book, an evocative historical fiction novel which dramatically intersects the lives Neanderthals and Cro-magnon humans in prehistoric Europe.\\"Clan of the Cave Bear\\", the cornerstone in the Earth Children series, tells the tale of a Cro-magnon orphan Ayla, who at five years old survives an earthquake and an attack from a cave lion before she is rescued by the kind and wise medicine woman Iza. Though Ayla's appearance is vastly different, and in the eyes of the Neanderthal clan even ugly, the young girl wins a place among the clan when the holy man and Mog-ur Creb decides her presence is in fact a good omen.Leader Brun remains conflicted between the steadfast traditions his people have long relied upon for their survival versus the benefit of this strange new creature among them. Had the spirits, their totems, really sent this unusual child to them for \\"luck\\", even when everything she does inevitably challenges their philosophies and customs?From the way she communicates to the way she expresses emotion, Ayla learns early on she must continue her struggle for survival by integrating with them and behaving as a Clan woman should, rather the ugly outsider she is. However having evolved past what her adopted people are able to do, this proves problematic for the earnest young girl.Whereas her Clan relies on \\"memories\\" and instinct, she has the ability for analytical thought and deductive reasoning. Whereas her Clan adheres to strict tradition, Ayla is able to adapt and evolve. She finds herself unable to abide constrictive cultural expectations in her ever growing desire to challenge herself and to push herself to the limits of her ability.For a group of people who rely on conformity for their sense of security and balance, she provides a constant source of conflict. This is especially true with Broud, Brun's son and leader to be. He resents her presence and does whatever he can to make her life miserable, longing to steal from her what he can never possess.Ayla, in her attempt to survive her sometimes dire circumstances, ends up an unintentional hero for feminism itself. What the Clan see in her, and alternately fear in her, is the strength that will carry over in all Homo sapiens for millenniums to come. Her strange behavior, thoughts and feelings are the very things that ensure the survival of her race while highlighting the limitations of their own.It is through this young child who ages no more than a teenager through the course of the novel that we once again are reminded of the indomitable nature of the human spirit.Author Jean Auel herself demonstrates this spirit by the thoughtful and thorough way she researched for this groundbreaking series; not only did she do extensive study on the Ice Age but physically learned many of the survivalist skills she describes in her books.It lends an authenticity to the tale that will keep the reader vested intellectually, while Ayla and her struggle to survive will emotionally engage audiences for many years to come. Though the prehistoric world they live in is vastly different from our modern times, the themes are widely universal. From racism to sexism and cultural divisiveness and superstition, the dynamic characters of \\"Clan of the Cave Bear\\" speak a language in which we are all familiar."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"This is a marvelous book; it deals with Ice Age and the coexistence of Neanderthal and Cro-Magnon. It is a vivid and lucid reconstruction of a long forgotten era.It is the first volume of a powerful series.The story is as follows: Ayla is Cro-Magnon orphaned by an earthquake and adopted by a Neanderthal female, from this point on, a strange world unfold.It's a discovery trip for Ayla and the reader. At the same time allows us a deep insight into \\"otherness\\".There are forceful descriptions of Ice Age habitat and Neanderthal culture, looking into stone technology, herb doctor techniques, hunting methods, weaponry, social relationships and whatever aspect of a civilization you may be interested it is shown.In the present world that is shrinking and cultural differences arise every minute, Ms Auel's work show the human common traits that make us kin to every other human being, even if it is as distantly related as a Neanderthal.Don't miss this experience!Reviewed by Max Yofre."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"I loved this book, just as much as the other three!

Remember, these books are sold in the fiction section. They're fiction, fantasy and romance. She did a lot of research and you can really get a feel of what the land must have been like 25,000 years ago.

People of the Clan, as they call themselves, refer to what we know of as the human race as the &quot;Others&quot;, a newer, younger breed that had adapted better to the changing world around them in Ice Age Europe to replace this breed of clan people. Ayla, a girl born to the Others, is adopted by clan people when orphaned in an earthquake. Auel twists a tale of intriguing suspense and a sense of adventure and excitement as she takes us along Ayla's journey into a culture born with memories of how to behave, what is expected of them, and what life was like years before. They cannot accept change, and Ayla struggles to change her natural way of being to fit into the culture of the clan, even without these memories. But the Clan makes it difficult, thinking her blue eyes, blond hair and straight limbs are ugly, thinking her crying eyes are injured, her quickness to learn evil and odd, and her ability to speak strange.

The heroine, Ayla, has been separated from her family by a massive earthquake. Though she is only a small child, she embarks upon a journey that will have repercussions down through the ages. After wandering for days in an unfriendly environment, she is found, nearly dead, by a band of Neanderthals who are engaged in their own quest for a new home. Though they are suspicious of the &quot;Others&quot;, she is taken into the clan and cared for by the medicine woman, Iza. She wins the heart and loyalty of the most respected and revered member of the clan, Creb the Mog-ur (holy man). Through him and his sister, Iza, she learns the ways of the clan with difficulty and, at times, resentment. Because she is so &quot;ugly&quot;, Iza teaches her the art of being a medicine woman so that she will have some usefulness to the clan. Iza fears that she will never mate or have children because of this &quot;deformity&quot;. She teaches herself to hunt with a sling, although it is strictly forbidden for the women of the clan to hunt or even touch weapons. She soon becomes the most skilled hunter in the clan much to the chagrin of the clan leader's son, Broud. He is determined to put her in her place and he discovers the perfect revenge, brutal and malicious rape. Soon after, at the tender age of eleven years, Ayla gives birth to her son, Durc, who is destined to be the clan's link to the future. Broud is enraged that the infant, whom the clan deems to be deformed also, is accepted and named into the clan. Immediately upon being named as the new leader of the clan, he curses her with &quot;death&quot;. The clan can no longer &quot;see&quot; her and those that loved her mourn her &quot;death&quot;. She becomes a &quot;spirit&quot; whom the clan fears will take them with her if they &quot;see&quot; her. Suddenly, at the ripe old age of thirteen years, Ayla is once again alone and on her own. She is forced to leave her son and the clan behind her to begin a new life. This life is chronicled by the succeeding books in this enthralling series. I have read all the books Ms. Auel has written in this saga at least twice. I am anxiously awaiting the next book to be released so that I can continue to participate in Ayla's amazing story. Please hurry Ms. Auel, five years is a long time to wait for the next book in the series and I desperately need an Ayla &quot;fix&quot;"},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"Do you feel different from people around you? Do they resent your ingenuity? Have you been kept from achieving your full potential by tradition-bound brutes who live only for base needs? Do you long for the company of others like yourself, who, tragically but inevitably, are biologically destined to wipe these shorter, darker subhumans from the face of the earth? Congratulations! You are either in the aryan nations or the Clan of the Cave Bear fan club, possibly both!(I exaggerate- you could be a nineteenth century English settler in Australia, or a Boer in South Africa, or maybe you just like Larry Niven, but that's beside the point)I can forgive Auel for the historical inaccuracies in the book. In the late 1970's when she did her research, we didn't have the genomic tools to reconstruct the lives of Neanderthals, and even now enough controversy persists to keep the discussion page lively over at Wikipedia. Ultimately we'll never know for sure what the paleolithic was like, and Auel's is if nothing else a vivacious fictional suggestion.Similarly, her bloated, almost puffy writing style is excusable in a first-time author, though one wonders what parasite infected her editor. I haven't read her more recent works, but I imagine she has probably improved. Even with the pendulous sentences Clan is not unreadable.What infuriates me is the casually racist subtext of the story, nowhere critiqued or even acknowledged. The story reads like a near-literal historicization of Helena Blavatsky's Secret Doctrine on the fall of the \\"aryans\\"- who interbred with \\"subhumans\\" introducing the world to, oh I dunno, domination by the unworthy, blind tradition, suppression of the individual, all the hallmarks of the book's neanderthal culture. Of course, even in this the blond-haired blue-eyed Ayla is innocent, overpowered by a brutish thug.Against this master narrative, all the admittedly interesting side notes about plant-based medicine and flintknapping make no impression. I would recommend anyone interested in paleontology take a trip to a museum or cruise the internet, and give Auel's books a wide berth.Also? Enough rape scenes already!"},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"This book was very good!!! I would not normally read books of this topic, but it turned out to be a wonderful, exciting and at some points suspenceful. I highly recommend this book!!!!"},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"paper.You can really understand and feel for Ayla,her confusion, and love for these prehistoric beings. But it's hard to imagine that these ...people could be so oblivios to the more advanced ways of different people, that obviosly were going to excel in the human races...if I could I would give this book a 4.5 because I belive Mrs. Auel gave 90%"},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"I also found myself being transported to another world. Have since found how accurate they were in describing history. Not only good reading but a history lesson as well. I have read all of her books and am anxiously awaiting the 5th book of the series. I have to find out how the story ends for Ayla."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"A really great book!! I can't wait to read the rest. Mrs. Auel did a wonderful job. I got into it so much I almost started talking with hand symbols!! It's like I was right there with Ayla! It takes a great author and a great book to do that. I give it FIVE STARS!!!"},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"Ms. Auel has done an excellent job of researching and telling this story. I have to keep reminding myself that it is a fictional story. This is a facinating story about life during the Ice Age and one girls struggles to become a respected woman. I have also read the other three books in the Earth Children's series. As I neared the end of one book, I'd rush to the store to purchase the next. But on the fourth book (I new the fifth was not out yet) instead of rushing through to the end, I put myself on a reading diet and would only allow myself a few pages a day....I didn't want it to end. Not only has this book increased my knowledge of pre-historic life, it has also given me an interest in herbs. It was great and I recommend it to everyone!"},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"An excellent read! I feel the characters are portrayed in depth. The character's interactions with each other were excellently planned and displayed. The scenery is beautifully described and promotes images in the reader's mind. I felt that it was definitely the best of the Earth's Children series. Jean Auel is a truly gifted author with a mind for detail. A well thought out description of Earth's past."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"Ever since I read Clan of the Cave bear and its sequel The Valley of Horses, I have been looking for books just like it. If i were you, i would rush to the bookstore or the library and get it. Don't wait. Its a good book."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"This is a not to be missed. Auel tells this story in a way that pulls you in and leaves you wanting more. I can not wait to read the next in the series."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"I think that &quot;The Clan of the Cave Bear&quot; is a really wonderful book. The plot and character development is all great. I agree though that the area descriptions and stuff about plant remedies can go on WAY to long. Other than that though, it's great."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"The descriptions and stories are great, though sometimes the nature descriptions get a little out of hand. The book is interesting and you can learn from it, and at the same time it's exciting. I would off course encourage anyone to read the book, but I would also say there is more to look forward to."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"It's hard to guess that we know very little about the time in which this book is set and the way their societys worked. This book makes the past seem as real as the present. Ayla's life and struggles seem to show how little humanity has changed since the beginning of time. It's easy to identify with her in her struggles against prejudices in the early world"},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"It has an interesting plot and alot of great information. I read this book when I was in 6th grade, what made me be able to get through it was the fact that the character Ayla was so well built and that I was able to believe she was real and that those thing's actually happened to her. The rest of the character's were good too but Iza and Ayla were my favorite. I am in 8th grade now and have read the four book's in the series that have came out, and I'm waiting for the 5th to be written so I can read it! when I read this book I couldn't set it down. Don't worry about letting young children read it, I read it when I was young and I was able to get over the troubling part's. I actually think it is very educational. Jean did a great job on reaserch and wrote a very interesting, fun book. I reccomend it"},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"I find it incredible to believe that among all these readers who found this book &quot;impossible to put down,&quot; not one recognised the racist silliness in the whole Cro-Magnon/Neandertal debate. The futre of mankind rested on Ayla, tall , blonde, blue-eyed and Jolandar, similarly endowed. The virtues of these physical characteristics and ability to adapt to natural surrounding are linked in such a racist fashion, as if being merely being born Cro-Magnon (Western European Nazi ideal) allowed Ayla to bypass natural, cultural and intellectual evolution within her measly 17 years of life. Creb's (and the Neandertals') inability to make these evolutionary jump is linked to their being Neandertal, of low brows and guttural speech. This book promotes a little bit of racial tolerance, disguising that fact that &quot;Flateheads&quot; are also human and okay is the same as a racist Southerner saying &quot;negroes&quot; are human and okay, just less able to think and adapt to be a part of the changing contemporary society. I am an archaeologist and I could go on and on about the stupid scientific inconsistencies presented by Auel in these subversely racist, overtly pro-european works, pandering to Victorian ideas of progress and disdain of 'barbarism.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"My Mom and sister both recommended this book, but I couldn't make it through more than half. Really not very interesting. For whatever reason, women seem to find this book interesting. I have other male friends that have had the same experience. For me, nothing that grabbed my attention happened and the writing wasn't enough to make up for it."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"I found these books fascinating and so did my husband. It's nice to be able to sit down and \\"escape\\" from our troubled world and read about people who had it a whole lot tougher that we do. A lot of my friend have read them, too and we all agree that these books are very well written, hold your attention and let you escape for a little while. We were not disappointed with any of the books and eagerly awaited the next one. We especially liked Clan of the Cave Bear. She was just a child when she lost her parents and for the most part the clan accepted her. She struck me as a very inteligent person to learn her new tribes rituals and yet was able to keep some of her own that she remembered. I would recommend this series to everybody."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"I enjoyed the characters in this story. The complexity of the every day life for these characters is portrayed as though one is sitting right there. The visual language takes the reader to time and place of the characters.There is love, pain, heartache, family ties, loneliness. It is a tail of life as it could have been so long ago."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"I read this entire series years ago and loved it. I travel a lot in my car for work and decided to get some audio books to pass the time. Checked this one out of the library because it is so long and I am hooked. Just ordered the forth book in the series and cannot wait for it to arrive. This was an awesome book the second time around, actually better than the first read. The reader, Sandra Burr is excellent and I hated for it to end. Ayla is my hero!!"},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"Perhaps one of the best &quot;easy reads&quot; of all time.

I have a friend called Alya and her mom named her that cause she was such a big fan of the Earths Children series.

So I'm making it clear that I like it. After saying that, I don't know how else to praise it. It gets a thumbs up for being absorbing and emotional.Now for the negatives. It makes a lot of assumptions about Neanderthal society that I hope are entirely unwarranted, and it gives us a cartoon Supergirl. It is telling us basically that Cro Magnon, namely us, are just so superior to Neanderthal, to an unreasonable degree. Here are some examples.A little Cro Magnon girl with no hunting experience is able to very quickly outshine all of the experienced Neanderthal men in the use of the sling as a weapon to bring down animals. This girl is a little \\"David\\" with that sling, using it like a repeater rifle that can bring down a hyena from a long distance away. Baloney. I don't buy that a little 8 year old girl can become such a killing machine. We're Cro Magnons now, so show me this 8 year old Supergirl today. It makes Cro Magnon seem so superior to Neanderthal, to a comic degree, to an unbelievable degree. Our little girls make far greater warriors than your experienced hunters. No, that smacks of silly superiority.Neanderthal society is a society of utter domination of women by men. Even violent rape is allowed, and the woman has no rights at all to object to getting beaten to a pulp and raped three times a day, every day. This also reeks of Cro Magnon superiority. My guess is that the author is Cro Magnon, no? I'd like to see a similar book written by a Neanderthal. I'm sure that the Neanderthals wouldn't come off as a bunch of, a bunch of, a bunch of Neanderthals in that book.So, to sum up, this very absorbing and emotional book is an insult to all of us Neanderthals. It makes us look like stupid, misogynistic boobs who can't even wield a slingshot as well as a baby girl of your society. All I can say is, put me up against any little baby girl you've got, and I'm sure I can do better than she can at slingshotting hyenas.And by the way, we happen to have a female dominated society. The men among us hunt wooly mammoths all day while the women watch Home Shopping Club.This applies to the audio cassette series, which is read beautifully by a Cro Magnon woman, though the speech she uses for her characters is not at all good when the characters are male. I wonder why they don't hire more than one reader to orally interpret books. Hire a cast of characters. It would help to differentiate the characters and it would prevent the ridiculous attempts by the reader to do a voice of the opposite sex. I'm sure the producers could get a full set of readers very cheaply."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"I am not usually so critical, and I must admit I read several of the books years ago, but I finally put them down without reading the rest because there was just too many descriptions of sex in them. The detailed and varied descriptions were simply unneccesary for a book that is touted as a &quot;must read&quot; for women as young as 10!"},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"If there were bodices to rip in the stone age they would be ripping furiously in this book and in its successors.Most ridiculous thing about this series is how Ayla makes every earth-shattering discovery of this time, e.g., discovering the wheel, horseback riding, flint knives, etc., etc."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"She had a older book in paper back, but the ex tore it up in spite.

She was nearly in tears she was so happy."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"I really loved this book and the books that follow this one, but I didn't really like the way the people's feelings are. I mean the way Ayla treated as some stupid animal then next she's treated like a savior come down to help them. But other then that it was a wonderful book. The way Ayla makes the bad things in her life seem like they were put there so she could be tested to see if she was worthy enough to do other things that the woman of the clan are not supposed to do. Though the parts that confused me were the mogur ceremony and the earthquakes. Because in a way it makes it seem as if all the magic is real."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"Great imagination! A little to much time spent on details.

Well researched - maybe, poorly written - definately. The plot simply goes nowhere, and the characters are so unrealistic and banal that it is impossible to feel sympathetic toward them.

I found that Ms. Auel whetted my appetite for other prehistoric novelists, and that turned me to Kathleen and Michael Gear, who I also recommend."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"It's been quite awhile since I read this book and the others in the Cave Bear series.

I am starting her 2nd novel tonite! I love all the characters and could not put this book down for anything. I want to tell you that I feel like I experienced neanderthal ways of living to the point that our commercialized life is sooo wasteful and boring compared to this saga. I love Ayla with my heart and sole and cried when my favorite characters had fallings of any kind. I love Brun, Iza, Creb and many more!!!!!!!!! My advice!? READ IT!! :)"},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"(although I am sure everyone knows by now what's happening in the book, I still won't go into detail, as it might spoil the fun!)I have read and re-read all four books in different editions and languages and I am still not tired!Realizing that there is light at the end of the tunnel (long wait for the fifth book), I started reading the whole series, yet again, to refresh my memory and be ready to dive into the Shelters of Stone.The first installment is simply breathtakingly captivating. Although this was not my first reading, I was still very moved and lived Ayla's hopes and fears and struggle to be accepted by the Clan.Fascinating details about the life and rituals of the Clan, their beliefs and values are told through this gripping pre-historic thriller.The whole series is a definite must for every shelf.

I would reccomend this book to anyone."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"Customers certainly do not need my oppinion, but I need to give it. The Clan of the Cave Bear was one of the first books I have ever read of its kind. I was obsessed with surviving and occupied my childhood with studying plants and animals, disgusted by people who depended so dearly on civilization. Greatfull for my safe home, I still ventured out every day hunting around my backyard for wilderness adventures, and swear I pretended to live the 'survivor series' so popular today back when those who produce it now were in their own back yards dreaming the same thing. I am convinced Ms. Auel has somehow BEEN to the time of the Clan...."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"What an incredible journey into prehistoric times! This book is so vivid, so moving, and has exquisite detail about Ayla's world- both her personal feelings and experiences and the civilization she finds herself in. Do not miss this book."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"I love the Clan of the Cavebear written by Jean M. Auel she has written a very good story on the life of early man and it was well researched and well done. She went threw alot of history and facts and research to tell a good story with characters you like and love, the story is so well done that you feel that you are right there in the middle of everything and seeing it first hand. the story of Ayla who loses her parents to an earthquake is left on her own at a young age and is found by a group of people called the Clan of the Cave Bear, who except for the medicine woman want nothing to do with her and ends up being raised by them. To quote the back cover of the book it is a saga about people, relationships, and the boundaries of love as Ayla struggles to grow up with her new family and learns there ways and one by one gains there trust (excpect for one) and live with them. a great book that I enjoy reading time and again."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"I must say, my first impression, from just hearing about the book and reading the first page or so was not good. I had to read this book for one of my college classes, and once I got into it I couldn't put it down. I recommend this book (and all of Auel's other books) to everyone. Especially those interested in history, it's amazing. The thing I found most, interesting was her depiction of the paleolithic age. It was really different that others would imagine."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"Now, I am VERY picky when it comes to books. But this book, while slow going at times, was fantastic. I am not a quick reader so for me this book took a little time. But once you get past some of the slower parts (in my mind specifically the background of locations etc), the contact between these people is amazing and interesting."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"Clan of the Cave Bear is a fantastic story, one which fascinated me. In what other book do we get to read about what Neanderthals may have been like? And it was not only stimulating to the intellect, but to the soul. The story is truly heart-wrenching and I really felt for the characters.My only complaint is that the book needed some serious editing. Auel is a talented story-teller...but her writing skills leave something to be desired. Namely, she switches point of view so often in this story that I often had to reread a paragraph to find out whose thoughts were being shared. She'll switch from Creb, to the narrator, to Iza, to Ayla, and back to the narrator again--and often within the same paragraph! Very sloppy writing, and confusing for the reader.However fortunately for Auel, the story speaks for itself. I fully intend to read the rest of this most interesting series."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"I'm usually a romance fiction type - but decided to try reading something different. I couldn't put this down. The research that went into this had to be tremendous and it is very believable. Who's to say how things were when humans were developing. I've had a few weeks break now I think I am ready for #2 in the series."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"The Clan of the Cave Bear was one of the best books i have ever read. You can tell that the author took a lot of time preparing to write this book in her extensive research of the Ice Age and the people that lived at that time. The story could take place in any time period because it is about a person who is adopted into a culture completely different from her own and has trouble fitting into the strict lifestyle. I would definetly recomend this book to everyone."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"Well, I don't think that I have to convince anyone that this is a good book and the beginning of a good series. I wanted, instead, to express my gratitude that there is a standard-size harcover edition of The Clan of the Cave Bear again to buy. The other three books in the series have remained in print for years, but I could never locate a hard copy of the first novel. A couple of years ago, they re-released the hardcover, but it was in a smaller format, so it didn't match the others.Now, there is the hardcover again, along with the sneak peek at the new novel!"},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"I've been rereading this book for the past 20 years.

There are plenty of reasons to list on why this book is an excellent read, but don't take our word for it. Pick it up for yourself. This book was enlightening, encouraging, heartwrenching and always interesting. You just had to know what happened next. I've been impatiently waiting for the fifth book in the series, and I've pre-ordered well in advance.

I was going through my books recently, and came across it, so I thought I'd attempt to read it again. I must say that this novel is fascinating!! The novel is about a little girl who is separated from her Clan and is taken into another Clan who finds her barely alive. The novel, I think, is about coming of age, and acceptence of ones self and of others. I think it's about growth and basically life. Ayla who is the main character in this novel, goes through many things. She had her ups and downs with the clan of the cave bear, and it gave her an identity and independence that no one in that clan had ever had: least of all women. However, this novel is brilliant, and it made me cry at the end. I cannot wait to continue the series, and I will definetly write a review for the second, third, and fourth!!!"},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"This was a really great book.

Auel's original story has enthralled millions who wait as long as ten years for the next adventure.Each book is a candiate for a reread to discover again why this series outshown the rest.Nash Black, author of SANDPRINTS OF DEATH."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"I have enjoyed rereading Clan of the Cave Bear. I read it the first time right after it came out, and enjoyed it as much this time. I've ordered The Valley of Horses from Amazon again and plan to order the rest of the series from them."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"This is a wonderful book that is exciting and new. If you are looking for an original book that contains adventure and a bit of mystery, this is the book for you. The sequels to this book lag a bit though. &quot;Valley of Horses&quot; was good but not quite as good as the first book (Clan of the Cave Bear). The rest of the series are acutally really boring because they keep on repeating the same stuff that was in the first and second book. I am in the middle of the third book, &quot;The Mammoth Hunters&quot; and I find that I have to force myself to read it because it is so boring."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"Even though some of it is far fetched, and a little unbelievable thats fine. Its not as if its possible to tell what the people were like in that age. Very interesting idea's, well written with great characters....I loved the ending, it made me have to read the sequel which is good. I must say the rest arent as great, but still really good. One minor problem in my opinion is the extensive detail about the settings....to me it was boring and i usually skipped those parts. Still a great book give it a try."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"When I read this book for the first time, I was just looking for something to do on a long bus ride to one of my Cross Country meets. But since the Earthquake on the first two pages, Auel's lovely description and wonderful storytelling skills has had me hooked. After reading this book, I was incredibly eager to read the next book in the series."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"This book is excellent. It is not any ordinary story, and is a fantastic veiw of what might have been. The conflict is created and developed perfectly, and everything that happens is believable. When reading this book, you will laugh and cry at times, and also learn a lot about the age- about neanderthals, the ice age, medicine, toolmaking, and more. Auel displays an amazing theory of why the Neanderthals might have become extinct when the Cro Magnons did not. I recommend this book to anyone who would like to be drawn into a world completely unlike our own and escape the daily schedules to have an experience to remember without even leaving your bed."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"I did the unabridged audiobook. 14 tapes of prehistoric immersion into the culture of the clan. Very satisfying, very informative, very revealing and very thought-provoking. You get to know these neanderthals better than your own clan (and maybe they make more sense in their own way!). I wish I had a smidgen of their herblore knowledge and I got to admire their common sense approach to problems. What is you animal totem? It now seems so important somehow. Enjoy."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"A friend of mine recommended this book to me a long time ago and I should not of waited.I got hooked on it from the first chapter and I could not stop until I finished reading the last chapter in the series. The only good thing about waiting so long to actually read this series is, I do not have to wait as long as some of the others who has been waiting for years for the next book to come out!"},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"This book was really amazing. It is an emotionaly involved book, you really can't help but get into it and absolutly love it."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"It held my interest all the way through, as did the 3 succeeding books in the Earth's Children series. The last book I have heard of came out in '90 or '91. WHERE ON EARTH IS THE 5TH BOOK! HAVE HEARD NOTHING SINCE. THE COVER OF &quot;THE PLAINS OF PASSAGE&quot; STATES MS AUEL WAS WORKING ON THE 5TH BOOK. WHAT HAPPENED? DID SHE FALL ILL OR DIE? This fan wants to know and I am certain I am not the only one who wants to know. Mary-Margaret Beach &lt;palen98@hotmail.com&gt;"},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"I loved this book! I couldn't put it down. The characters are so real, and Ayla is an amazing woman. This novel is more than just fiction, it is based in archeological truths, so I did a bit of learning about early man/woman. One note...don't watch the movie version of this, its terrible and doesn't even touch the strength of this book."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"This is unlike my usual choice of reading, but I really enjoyed it. It contained a lot of interesting events and information that really stimulated my anger (such as the cruel treatment of Broud to Ayla). I disliked Broud and would have done everything in my power to annoy him if I were Ayla. i am disappointed that Ayla left her son behind with the clan, but he would have slowed her down. I reccomend this book for any avid reader that can handle long yet interesting books. Also, if I were a district official of a school, I would make it mandatory for prehistoric history students."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"This book is good in its detailed descriptions of Neanderthals' way of life, customs and beliefs. I enjoyed reading about the climate, flora and fauna of the region and how people adapted to it, especially about the medicinal purposes of so many \\"modern age\\" plants. Who would have thought that willow bark is a painkiller? Despite some really ridiculous claims like the ability of Neanderthals to inherit the memories of life evolution on Earth (complete with water-to-earth and back to water transitions of marine mammals), the book is overall believable and makes an enjoyable weekend read.But reader beware! This is the only book of the Earth's Children series worth reading. All the sequels to this book are progressively worse, loosing any shreds of realism (and plain common sense) and overflowing with absolutely ridiculous historical claims and repetitive sex scenes. If you don't want to be bitterly disappointed, resist the temptation to read sequels to this book!"},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"One of my favorite books, I've carted my worn out first-print paperback through 5 houses and taped the poor thing back together when I finally wore out the spine.The book focuses on Ayla as she is raised by a primative clan(Neanderthal? I'm not sure) after the untimely death of her family. It's obvious that Auel has done an insane amount of research on this series, and she uses this to add a touch of realism to the story. Unlike the others in this series, it's not a love-story, its more of an adventure. Definitely good for people who want a fantasy adventure story that's not your typical bodice-ripper romance novel."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"I gave birth to my daughter, Summer Rose, when I was 17. Shortly after I noticed such a drastic change in my lifestyle. Throughtout my life the only time I picked up a book was in school when it was assigned. Never had I dreamed of reading for recreational purposes. I thought my own mother was crazy for even willingly picking up a book. However, ever since I was a child my facination with pre-history and native american history has always pulled at my blood and has crept not only in my brain but has made a place in my heart. Becoming a mother myself gave me the leverage I needed to finally pick up a book and see what the written word has provided for individuals such as myself. My first book to read for the reason as just because was The Clan of the Cave Bear by Jean M. Auel. Not only did it grasp my attention but it blew me away. Never in my life did I expect to love reading as much as I read this book. I thought the details and research was to my knowledge accurate (but of course I'm no expert!) The story line was believable and very hard to put down. I thought nothing would ever top this until I heard that there was a sequel..."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"I have read this book several times since it was first published and have never tired of it. Jean M Auel has obviously done her research before embarking on this novel and by doing so has managed to recreate the ancient world of the Neanderthals in a totally believable way.This is such an evocative book you can visualise the clan and their surroundings almost as if you were sat among them. The sights, sounds, smells are described so well that they feel almost real. It makes for a fascinating glimpse in to an ancient, forgotten way of life.Interwoven with this, is the wonderful tale of Ayla, a young Cro-Magnon girl who is adopted by a clan of Neanderthals after an earthquake leaves her orphaned. Her 'adoptive' mother, Isa, along with the clan's Magician, Creb, try hard to integrate Ayla into their community but not everyone is as welcoming to this strange child who not only looks so different, but acts in a way that is so alien to them.A young clan male, Broud, hates Ayla with a passion and unfortunately for Ayla, Broud is destined to be clan leader one day. Her struggle to be accepted among the members of the clan and the interaction between all of the characters, along with the richly detailed descriptions, make for a fascinating and absorbing read. This book works well on all levels and I would highly recommend it."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"I absolutely love this book. I can't say enough about it. Out of all of the books, I find that this one is the most fascinating. Jean Auel is an amazing writer. I have loved this book since I was 13 years old. I have read it so many times that not only have I memorized it, but I have had to replace my battered old copy. This book will make you laugh and cry and get angry. I have never been able to find a book that I love as much as this one and believe me, I have read a lot. Jean Auel makes you feel the characters and makes you believe in her theory about Neanderthals and Cro-Magnons. Her wrirting and characters are vivid and unforgettable. This one is a definite must read."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"I loved this book from the very beginning all the way to the very end. I laughed and cried and got mad and then recovered and then did the emotions all over again.A good read is a book that allows the reader to learn (as I definitely did about prehistoric times and about botany) and also to love the characters like Creb, Iza, and of course the main character Alya. To also get mad when things aren't going for the character's we love and to cry when they go so wrong that we feel for it too our hearts.This is the best book I have read and I am serious. I am already on page 200 of the next book to read after this one. &quot;The Valley of the Horses&quot;. I love it also and can't wait to see what is going to happen next! What a wonderful series! See ya on this review board on the current book when I am finished!:)"},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"Jean Auel has written one of the most compelling series I have ever read, I can't ever get enough of these books"},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"I was 14 years old when I read this book, and quickly followed with the next two. The other reviews focused on the plot, so I will omit that. I am going to instead concentrate on how it made me feel. As a teenager, reading about this young woman's struggle to fit in when she was so different really struck home. The story also concentrates on freedom issues that face women. How many times I identified with Ayla(main character) when she was yet again having her uniqueness stifled, or having her love rejected I cannot say. I found myself learning to stand up, and become strong physically and emotionally from her example. In short, I wanted to be her- an intelligent, strong, independant, loving healer who had to guts to defy the patriarcal system she grew up in. This book also has some wonderful information about herbal medicine and food preparation. I would especially highly recommend this to young women, because of the wonderful example it sets. I have to say I love the second book as well for it's theme of being tested by solitude, and facing predjudice. In truth, I love them all but the first two are by far the best. And I too waited over ten years for the fifth book!"},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"The first in the Earth's Children series will make you a continuing reader of the rest of the more recent books. Excellent character development and realistic setting. The reader is immediately drawn into the story and remains a follower of Ayla and her adventures in the continuing series of books.A must read!

Once I opened the first page and read a few lines I knew I was hooked. Since then I had the joy of reading all the books currently published by Ms. Auel and they have all been a delight to read. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"I loved this book so much. Ayla is sure to be a classic in liturature to come in the next decade or so. She is a great role modle. I think this woman has major courage! If this is your first book in the series, keep reading it's worth the time and effort, I promise!"},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"When I first picked up this book (some 8 years ago) I was initially put off by the thickness of it. But once I started reading I was totally hooked.The strong, self-assured and intellegent female character was truely refreshing. I have given this book to my sisters and to several friends. And whenever I get into a discussion about 'good books' this is one of the books I bring up and strongly encourage every I know to read.Today I have come to shop for this book so that I might send it to a pen-pal in West Africa. He wants me to send him books that will assist him in speaking better english. And this was the first book I thouht to send him. Well that and a dictionary.Thanks to Jean Auel for writing such a great novel."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"When I first began The Clan of the Cave Bear I gave up in the middle of the first chapter, felt it was too feministic. Then I began again &amp; found this &amp; the next three to be some of the best reading I've ever done. Please let us know when we can see book five!!! Creb lives!!!"},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"I have read these books to the point of wearing out my paperbacks. Ayla is the role model I never had as a young girl and sets a high standard for all of us to attain. I was completely transported to a different place and time while I read each story and felt drawn toward these marvelously written characters. I am so anxious for Ms. Auel's next creation I cannot pass a bookstore, anywhere, without checking to see if it's in yet. Please hurry, Jean!"},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"I have read the Earth's Children series more than once and will read it again once the fifth book comes out. What I like about this series is the fact that each book is relatively stand alone in understanding the characters. You could easily pick up The Plains Of Passage and get a fair sense of what has happened to Ayla and Jondalar. I am very happy that the fifth book will be released soon...I just wish we knew when."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"love the book when is the 5 one coming to store"},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"I first read &quot;Clan of the Cave Bear&quot; shortly after the movie came about (quite a few years ago). I liked the movie, so I said let's read the book. Well one of Jean Auel's books lead to the next and than the next one. I am proud to say I have read all of the Earth Children's sagas, and can't wait for the next one. I want to find out what happened to Aya and the rest of the characters. Please, please Jean, come out with another book soon. The wait is killing me!!!"},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"I read this book when I was 17 years old,I can only say its my all time favorit.Jean captures your heart with Ayla and leaves you panting for more.The details of the earth and nature make you think you are there.A great read you wont be sorry!!"},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"I got this book for Christmas, and was hesitant to read it, because it sounded a little boring. But I brought myself to read it, and loved it! I loved every word! It is 500 pgs, and I read it in 3 days. It was so excellent. Jean Auel expressed Ayla's feeling, Broud's hatred, Iza's love, and Creb's frustration. It was a wonderful story!"},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"This is a marvelous book; it deals with Ice Age and the coexistence of Neanderthal and Cro-Magnon. A vivid and lucid reconstruction of a long forgotten era. Ayla is Cro-Magnon orphaned by an earthquake and adopted by a Neanderthal female, from this point on, a strange world unfold. It's a discovery trip for Ayla and the reader. At the same time allows us a deep insight into \\"otherness\\".In a present world that is shrinking and cultural differences arise every minute, Ms Auel's work show the human common traits that make us kin to every other human being, even if it is as distant related as a Neanderthal.Don't miss this experience.Reviewed by Max Yofre."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"I never would have guessed that this book would change my whole view on the past. I am now very interested in ancient lives that its all i read. I have read all of the series, and i cant wait for the next. I felt as though i was the character, and I couldnt(neither could you) predict what was next. The pages become alive in the mind. Go GET IT!!"},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"I first read this book when i was doing laundry and it happened to be sitting in the laundromat. I think it's fantastic and I've read it at least five or six times. I especially love the prehistoric setting. Jean M. Auel obviously did a lot of research. Well worth the time it takes to read."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"Do you not remember the Clan of the Cave Bear hype in the mid-80's.....it was all the rage. The book is good. Good story, a little difficult to believe at times, since a lot of the actions of the people in the &quot;clans&quot; are hypothesized. But all in all a determinate story of survival, and coming of age in the post ice valleys. I do believe that she, Auel stole a bit from the Native Americans, well not steal per se, since their culture more closely mirrors the nomadic clans, but there are interesting depictions of seers, spirit chasers and medicine women. There are some romantic scenes which I have to admit were a little much for a 14 year old, but interesting nonetheless. Slightly educational and a good read. - Jennifer Rees"},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"The best book is this one right here! Ms. Auel's story makes you feel as though you right there next to Ayla the whole time. You're there when she's in the earthquake, during her time with the clan, when she leaves and all the way up until the end. When I read the first story, I couldn't put it down and when I finished, I ran to the bookstore to buy the others. I can't wait for the fifth one to come out. And as long as there are more books of this series coming, I'll be reading them. Two thumbs up and a must read!"},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"I really loved this book. I read it when I was seven and I still remember it. There are some graphic and parts that may not be suitable for smaller children, but it is good nonetheless! I give it five for the great character development, adjectives, and all over good. I loved it and I suggest wholeheartedly that you buy, or rent, or borrow, or do whatever you have to do to read this book- it's great!"},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"The novelty and originality of this novel was incredible! I never read anything as creative and imaginative as this enjoyable piece of literature. Admittedly, it is a lot of pages, but well worth the time reading it. It truly transports you to another world ... one so remote, but yet made to feel so real and vivid by the author. When you're done, you feel left wanting more ... and, guess what, there is more -- those wonderful sequels!"},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"This was a wonderful and compelling novel to read. I read it as a fourth grader. Yes, I was what nine years old when someone reccommended that I read this book. It was an extremely well written account of life for Ayla in the prehistoric times. I instantly hated Broud, and after reading a few chapters knew he would rape her. But, look beyond the graphic sex. Sex is a part of life. You can't shelter yourself from it. Those scenes were there to help tell the story of Ayla. Without it, her hatred of Broud would not have been complete. This book deserves more than five stars. I give it two thumbs way up.P.S. Yes, I was a fourth grader when I read it. I've also read the other four books and await the fifth in earnest. Those of you who think that the sex in all of the books makes them trashy, get a damn life!"},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"These books are fantastic. I was fascinated from the very start - It is hard to imagine how a 5 year old girl can captivate so many people but Jean Auel does it somehow. Ayla seems such a strong independent spirit and I feel like i know her so well. This is one of the few books that has made me weep but at the bit where Iza dies I had to stop reading because it upset me so much. Me and my friend tried learning sling-throwing in the garden so we could be like Ayla- she made such an impression on us. I was so excited when the film was on - I got up at 2 in the morning because i couldn't wait until the morning to see it!!! It doesn't even touch the magic of the book but is still definately worth seeing. The other books do not reach the same standard of tCotCB .Although in book 3 you can draw interesting comparisons between the way of live of neanderthal and Cro-magnon people, the plot fades into the background to make way for descriptions of plants, animals and sex, sex and more sex! But despite this I still kept reading (and re-reading)and I am eagerly awaiting book 5 -i want to find out whether Ayla has a boy or a girl!"},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"I'm only 11, so my opinion may not count much, but this was a really good series! The story of a person going through so much and yet still surviving is one worth the effort (although it didn't take me long to read the series). Even if they were printed before I was born, it seems like an eternity for the next book to come out. What's the deal? Oh well, I'll comfort myself with the other four."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"The beginning of an era that leads us to our modern day word. Jean Auel your research lead me to a different me and place. fantastic"},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"I read this book 20 years ago and was eager to reads it and eventenially I hope to read all of Jean Auels' books in the near future."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"Love this series, this is the first book and it starts slow but once you get into it, you can't stop!"},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"What an amazing and visually stunning book. It has been years since I have read anything that has shook me to the core of my humanity. This book has done just that. Will be reading this entire series. Such a prolific and dynamic writer. So glad my mother in law introduced me to this author."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"Made our vehicular vacation a real joy. I couldn't wait to continue our journey listening to Ayla's journey. Now we're home again and there is some story unfinished but we have scheduled some quiet time to enjoy the rest of the story. It's a win win for me, great story and the most fantastic company to share it with, yea me!"},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"I loved all three books. I had read the Shelters of Stone first as it was a gift, but thoroughly enjoyed going back to see where it all began. Amazing author."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"This book was wonderful - I have already started her second book - Valley of the Horses.Her descriptions make you feel as if you are right there with the main character. I definitely recommend this book."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"I am currently reading The Mammouth Hunters by Jean Auel, and it reminded me of how much I enjoyed The Clan of the Cave Bear. The story \\"gets\\" you on page one. Jean keeps building an amazingly plausible fiction of how we (mankind) only made it to number one spot by luck and a more efficient design. The Clan dominated their world and would have succeeded but for a design flaw - and not an obvious one. I am a sci-fi adict and have read most of the classics and many other not so well known titles. But to me The Clan of the Cave Bear is the most thought provocing and possible concept."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"This is the second time I am ready this series and I love it as much this time as I did 10 years ago when I first read them. The main Character Ayla is wonderful and you become very attached to her from the time you meet her at age 5 through her life. You root for her and cry for her. I can wait to start book 2,3,4,....until the last book which recently came out in 2012.Well worth the 500+ pages"},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"Great read,goes quickly. Enjoyed reading about the cave people and the spirits . Currently on book two and it is just a great book as well. Would recommend highly reading this book."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"I bought this book because I had suggested my book club read it and I had loaned out my old copy. Everyone at the club said they enjoyed it. From the wonderful imagination that enables the writer to tell you what the day to day life of people in cave man times was like; to the research that gives you an idea of what the geography and environment were; to the incredible story of courage and perseverance that the heroine lives, this is an excellent read. I couldn't wait to follow the heroine in the succeeding novels written by Jean Auel."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"This is the first book I ever read written by Jean Auel and could not put it down. Fascinating from the everyday description of the existance of a long gone species of a Neanderthal clan to the anthropological details that make us understand our origins and how we evolved to be who we are today...Recommend it to all...young and young at heart!"},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"Novels come and go, in our bookshelves and in our minds. But Clan of the Cave Bear is one with glue that sticks with us forever. I read this book 30 years ago when it was first published, and loved it. Shared it with my friends and family members at the time, who loved it, too. Now that I have a teenage granddaughter, I ordered it so she could enjoy it as well.Jean Auel created a character set in the backdrop of the Neantherthal age who could be (should be) a hero and role model to young girls everywhere. Her journey takes the reader into the hearts and minds of people who lived so long ago, yet the human element of love resounds deeply.Read this book! You won't be able to put it down. It is unlike anything you have ever read before."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"There is something both mundane and exciting about this book. I read it cover to cover. I couldn't put it down. It's a beautiful story and the author has put so much research into it. A must-read for all women interested in prehistoric culture and even men who don't mind books with a good believeable heroine.I first started this book when I was 17 but couldn't get into it at first because of the apparent mundanity of the story. But I discovered later that the beauty is in the details with this book. The characters and the author's descriptions of the landscape and culture of the people are just wonderful.I highly recommend this as an addition to a fantasy collection."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"I'd love to carry all the series on my Kindle! Please do it as soon as possible!"},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"A good story, told very well. There are hints of some of the problems that show up in the later books (repetition, soap opera, dry explanation of the flora/fauna/history, unnecessary heroics on the part of Ayla), but they are just hints. The story here in the first episode is very tight. Surprisingly, Auel is willing (and able) to be a bit depressing in the last 30% and still pull off a powerful and satisfying ending. For once in the series, things do seem real and believable."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"I wholeheartedly recommend this series of books. They are so different from the other novels out there. Aside from the interesting (although sometimes very lengthy) descriptions of the prehistoric landscape, the storyline is compelling. I could not put these books down!"},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"I ordered all the 5 books that have been published so far in this series. The author writes very well and has done her homework on this era of history. Great love story also."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"While some people complain of inaccuracies in Ms. Auel's novel, it is important to remember that this was written in the 70's, back before much of our archaeological technologies existed. Much of what we know today we did not know back then, especially in the field of genes. However, with what she researched back then, we're presented with a solid and enjoyable read. The descriptions are lush (and sometimes overwhelming) and you definitely get a very good read - I find this better than many novels today by sub-par authors like Danielle Steel and Fern Michaels."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"My mom had a copy of this book when I was younger and this series were some of the first adult books I ever read. I wasn't sure if I would still enjoy the story now but I couldn't put it down!A young girl, Ayla (one of the Others) is found alone and wounded by a medicine woman of the Clan, Iza. She is taken in by the Clan and raised as one of them. As a result of being different she makes many dangerous mistakes and behavioural errors but also finds friendship among the Clan. Ayla's struggles to fit in lead others to question the accepted ways and what \\"normal\\" is.I found the characters easy to relate to despite the novel being set in prehistoric times. The story revolves around fitting in and how much a person can change who they are, or if they should. I will be reading the rest of the series again, and the fifth one for the first time!"},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"This story was great! As I was reading I totally lost my self in the story. The descriptions and well researched information took me back in time and I could almost hear the grunts, the crackle of the fire and smell the meat roasting! Sometimes though, details were a little much and I felt anxious to get on with the story when the author was explaining the tedious steps involved in making a weapon or such things like that. After finishing the book I have a yearning for simplicity. I set out to enjoy nature and nurish my body with the earth.

Jean's descriptive passages really took me to the cave. I felt as if I knew the characters - some I loved and some I hated with passion. Ayla really got under my skin. I re-read it before I read \\"Valley of the Horses\\" to get back into the 'mood'. I have to admit, I re-read each book (all the previous books) before I read the next one. I have been in love with this series and these characters since the first day I started reading this series.I was privileged to meet Jean when her \\"Land of the Painted Caves\\" came out a couple of years ago. She felt like a kindred spirit to me.

I purchased all 4 and I cant wait to read them all."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"I had heard about this book several times before I read it, by people telling me I would like this because of my tastes, I enjoy historical fiction.This book did NOT disappoint! Jean M. Auel's prose is rich and descriptive (perhaps a bit too descriptive for some, but it suited me just fine!) so that it was very, very, very easy for me to imagine the settings, from the hunting grounds to the cave, to the setting of the Gathering of the Clans, and so on and so forth. Not only that, but smaller details also bring this setting to life - the plants that Iza and Creb use in their medicine/magic, the creation of hunting implements or clothing, Clan traditions and ceremonies, and what have you.Life is not easy for Ayla since she is an Other, a Cro-Magnon and the only one in a Clan of Neanderthals. She is adopted by Iza who treats her as her own child, even after she has a daughter of her own, Uba. Ayla is raised to be a medicine woman, and while she lacks the Clan memories, Iza notes that she is quicker to learn, so what she lacks for in inherited memory, she makes up for in the ability to acquire new things. This is noted more than once and not just by Iza, since the wise Mog-ur himself understands that it is this ability to learn that will ensure the survival of Ayla and her species and unless the Clan gain/foster at least some of this ability, they will become extinct even with their inherited memories.Ayla for the most part manages to fit in with the Clan. Her medicinal abilities become respected, and she learns to live with/deal with the intense patriarchal society of the Clan. Most of the men respect her, but every story needs an antagonist, and we get one hell of an antagonist here - Broud, the son of the Clan chief. He is an overall stinker, but he takes most of it out on Ayla because he feels threatened by her despite the fact that Ayla does not try to purposely antagonize him. He does pretty terrible things to her, but Ayla prevails and gains more respect after a particular ordeal.With the richness of setting, characters, and story, this is a book that you simply can not go wrong with. There are five more books in this series, but this one remains the best of them all."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"I read this book around 30n years ago, and have read it several times since. The amount of research that Ms. Auel puts into these books make the story really shine. I had no problem envisioning the settings and surroundings of the Clan and their territory. Sometimes Ms. Auel could get heavy on descriptions, but better than some authors who rush through this vital element of any story. Ayla's struggle to fit in with the Clan and learn their ways is not always easy, especially with the constant antagonism of Broud, a man who hates Ayla for no apparent reason. In the immensely patriarchal society of the Clan, where it is okay for a man to beat a woman, Ayla has a hard time, but there are also good moments, and she finds a place of value within the Clan. This is a book I will never forget, and it is a shame that this enthralling saga came to such a pathetic end in 'Land of Painted Caves', the sixth and final book of this series."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"I am in love with this book and the other books in this series.

I was fascinated by the story, the characters and all the fantastic research that gave a feel of authenticity to the context.Just don't get started with it if you don't have time to read within the following weeks since you won't be able to stop and hop on to the next book. You can skip the last one which does not add anything to story and instead take a plane / train to France to visit the painted caves.Enjoy !"},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"I love the start of a life journey of these characters! They're like old friends to me. I can always count on this book series to be interesting, educational, and to hold my attention without being dramatic or unrealistic- not that there aren't dramatic parts, because their are- but the drama in this series is based on an entire life unfolding rather than a short time span like most books are. The characters are ones I have fallen in love with. This book is how it all started- and the characters are present, if only in memory, for the rest of Ayla's life in the entire series. The stories here are what shape an incredible character. LOVE."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"I am re-reading this book. First read it more than 25 years ago. Fascinating as are the rest of Jean Auel's series. Very well researched and interesting"},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"I wasn't sure how I would like this book as there isn't a whole lot known about Neanderthals and Cro-magnon peoples in terms of their daily lives. Let me tell you, this book hits it out of the park! All my concerns were for nothing and this will be one of my favorite reads of 2011.Auel makes the very distant to us Neanderthals and Cro-Magnon come to vivid life. We get a very believable description of how they may have lived life - from the clothing they wore, to the spirits they could have believed in, the food they ate, how they hunted, and what they may have thought about each other. A vast amount of details would have to have been supplied by the author as aspects such as their belief system will likely never be known - but they felt seemless and believable.As strong as the writing is regarding the culture and setting, the characters are where the writing shines. There is quite a large cast of main characters and even more supporting characters, however Auel constructs all into well rounded characters that you can identify and connect to. Even the supporting cast does not get pushed into the background. One way that you know you have great characters is when their actions or things that happen to them can bring you to tears - and at several points in this novel that happened to me. You can get so emotionally connected to these characters. One of the characters that I loved the most is Brun, the leader of the clan. I really enjoyed how he would weigh all of the options and really tried to do what was best for everyone.I didn't want to put this book down and eagerly anticipated getting back in the car to listen to it - I didn't love that it usually meant I had to be on my way to work though! Although I want to jump right into the rest of the series, I have heard mixed reviews of the other books, so I am waiting until my love for this book dies down a little bit."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"If you enjoy anthropology, archeaology, and learning about the first of mankind on our planet, then you will find this entire series plausibe, and very enjoyable reading. This is a series of books that completely holds your attention through every page. Every book is based on thorough research of ancient sites, tools, and other findings that tell us about the people of yesteryear and how they survived the glacier period. The characters are so well presented that they seem real. Each additional novel is a continual saga from the prior book, so continuity flows very well."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"While the story and characters are good, what really draws me into this series is the information on prehistoric man. Did you ever wonder how people figured out fire or how to tame horses, why one species of pre-human eventually won out over another, how knowledge was passed down, how people spent their days, how they explained biological processes? What customs established in prehistoric times have influenced today's culture? This series gives you insight into all these things and more.There is a bit of fantasy in this novel, but the facts are incredibly well-researched by the author (medicinal herbs!).Once you've read this first book, you will have to read the rest.This is the first historical fiction I have read - it has opened my eyes to the genre.(The later books in the series have more sexual themes, so parents might want to discuss books with their teens who are reading it.)"},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"Cave of the Clan Bear is well written.

Love the ancient period it covers and especially that the main character is a woman. Jean Auel characters are believable and interesting. Great series. The only thing I don't like in the books, is the over description on some things, which, in my opinion, can go over the top. I decided not to read the latest book, after reading the reviews which are pretty poor, as I didn't want to spoil the experience. I am now re-reading the first three books in Kindle."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"The book starts a bit slow but then really grabs your attention.

It was one of a handful of books that I truly loved. Then the sequals sprang and I was thouroughly disappointed. This is a truly great novel, but the other books are not near as good and infact, some are just wretched. I recommend this book and no others. The author never did know what to do with the series. She just repeats things that already happened and the other books barely have plots. However, this book is a must-read."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"the earth children series was a wonderful read,I din'nt want to put it down and I did'nt want it to end.very entertaining.and their is a book 6."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"It's obvious that a lot of research went into the writing of this book, and Auel included just enough factual detail to barely qualify the story as historical fiction. But it is a soap opera - a well-written soap opera - and only time and setting separate this story from modern life. In fact, the characters, and their complex thoughts and emotions, as well as their ability to reason and communicate, seem more advanced than us (which is not saying much, I grant). Ayla is exceptional, almost super-human in every way, and by the end of Book Two in the series I expect she will have invented the hunting rifle, discovered calculus, cured cancer, and opened up day care centers for orphaned and deformed children. Who says blonds are dumb? I've heard from other disappointed people who are big fans of this first book that the rest of the series resembles a Harlequin romance, but I will not find out for myself."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"This book is an incredibly original undertaking, and I have to give Jean Auel a lot of credit for that.What ultimately kept me from really loving the book was the way in which Ayla (sp?) makes discoveries about her environment. For example, she comes to the conclusion that pregnancy comes from sex, not spirits. However, we are treated to no logical thought processes about why she would think that at all- it's somehow just a revelation she has. Auel could have had her say &quot;I had sex, and now I'm pregnant. I don't think it's a coincidence,&quot; which I would have accepted, but instead, every insight she gains in the book just sort of happens. Knowledge doesn't work that way. New insights come from evidence and reason, and Ayla's knowledge NEVER comes that way. Also, new conclusions are often wrong. Aylas never are. She just magically ends up with the right answer about how everything works without thinking it through.My mom has kept me privvy to what Ayla has been up to in the subsequent books (which I was not interested in reading) and it sort of sounds like she's become the professor on Gilligan's Island and is making nuclear reactors out of coconuts or something. I suppose she needs something to write about, so Ayla has to keep making discoveries. It also sounds like it's degraded towards girl porno towards the end of the series as well, which is too bad. Of course, it's not fair for me to comment on the stuff I haven't read."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"This book would be great if it wasn't for the writing. Seriously, the editing process should have pared it down, eradicated some over-used figures of speech, and challenged some of the obvious sci-fi creations that advance the plot.The premise of modern humans and neanderthals having contact and more has been explored quite a bit. Auel does bring an interesting flavor with the story of Ayla, a presumed cro magnon who is mercifully adopted by a clan of presumed neanderthals and the culture shock this brings to all parties.Auel's clan is very human in many regards. Sophisticated language, medicine, tools and hunting help them to survive. A flawed, but coherent mythology and religious structure guides their morals and their strictures. They display many of the human emotions and failings as any modern community, and certainly crave more than simply the basic needs of survival. The politics and personal dynamics that form the plot have a timeless and universal character.Unfortunately, several aspects of the writing style, and several major \\"suspension of disbelief\\" plot devices made it difficult to finish. A few that come to mind:1. The author has clearly done extensive research (or can fake it) on medicinal plants in this era. Unfortunately, it's just not that interesting to most readers given the amount of detail poured into the story. Chapters are interrupted for long discourses on yet another set of medicines and their preparations, when in fact the details add nothing to the story.2. Too many ancillary characters with similar names to keep straight. The tribe boasts an Ika, Iba, Eba, Uba, Ovra - whatever. Many of the characters only appear every hundred pages or so and you just can't recall why they matter. Strangely, the basic motives and traits of the main characters are often repeated, which you of course should know, but these side characters just drift in and out with their similar names.3. The pre-verbal communication is all done with hand gestures, yet they convey sophisticated sentence structures and long diatribes and grand ceremonial rites for hundreds of viewers. This just isn't believable. If anything, a species that has to rely on their hands as hunters, gatherers, and craftspeople would not be able to use those hands for such communication.4. Repetitive figures of speech. \\"Ayla wasn't the only one who...\\" comes to mind (a way overused transition into a new paragraph - when you start to notice it and count them, that's bad).5. There is a completely unnecessary sci-fi aspect to it, dealing with the mental abilities of the clan and in one case, the ability to see into the future (a cringe-worthy montage). Everything else in the story was at least plausible without this addition.One more warning that is a bit of a spoiler, and also not the fault of the author. The book jacket cover on the paperback edition I read states that the clan eventually comes to worship the main character. This is false. \\"Accept and respect\\" would be accurate, but there is never any worship.I'm disappointed by this fact - I would love to know what happens to the characters as the saga continues, but I won't subject myself to that writing style again."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"I'm so sorry to be such a spoilsport, but I found this is a terrible book and a worse series. Leaving aside all the wild inaccuracies - one of the main ones being Auel's portrayal of Neandertals as doltish brutes -the heroine is constantly making one earthshaking discovery after another - shampoo, domestication of animals, law of genetics, sex=pregnancy, and, last but not least, tampax. No one else can figure anything out, but there she is, churning out one Nobel-Laureate discovery after another. I'm sure in one of the later books she will be found making a short-wave radio out of a large rock. It became really maddening."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"This is an outstanding book; the first and by far the best of the Earth's Children Series. In telling the story of Ayla and the Clan, Jean Auel opens a window to the life of our ancestors many many centuries ago. The primitive beliefs and customs, the tribal ceremonies and rituals are fascinating and the play of human relationships between the various characters makes for a very good read. The characters themselves are many faceted (except perhaps Broud, whose persistent villainousness seems more 21st century!) and Jean Auel manages to get the reader in sync with the thoughts and actions of each character. It is educative to see the clearly defined roles people had in those days; the chieftain, the medicine woman, the priest. Against its backdrop of another time and place, the story itself is age old. A newcomer to a group upsets the set norms of existence and questions ideas and rules that the group takes for granted. Some in the group appreciate the challenge, others insist that the norms are set in stone and cannot be challenged. This is a book for any student of human nature. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"The kindle editions of these books are chock full of typographical errors that sometimes make it difficult to figure out what should have been written. The typos made me feel like I'd been gyped on the price of the books."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"Extremely well-written, good plot, characters and Mrs. Auel has done some research. Now here's the bad part. It is anthropologically inaccurate. Mrs. Auel does a beautifully stereotyped depiction of the Neanderthals as stooped, muzzle-jawed, intellectually inferior creatures as compared to wonderful Cro-Magnon people with their tall erect graceful carriage, blue eyes and blond hair. I mentioned this book to my anthropology professor and he said, very succintly, &quot;Burn it!&quot"},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"Normally, I read contemporaries but this series drew me in. Ayla struggles to live when ice sheets were retreating from Europe. She's raised by Clan, people who communicate with body language more than vocals, and makes many mistakes on her way to adulthood. Jean Auel's research at times intrudes but mostly this is a story that completely transports the reader to a long ago time where you root for the heroine and feel the fear and trauma along with her. My bookshelves are few but this series has designated space because I revisit favorite scenes often."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"It's been more than twenty years since I first read _Clan of the Cave Bear_. I picked it up again at the start of a long airplane trip, and was frustrated that the plane landed before I could finish the book. If the test of time is a sign of a book's quality, then _Clan of the Cave Bear_ passes with top honors.I enjoyed Auel's vivid recreation of the landscape shared by our Neanderthal cousins and our Cro Magnon ancestors, I was impressed by her imaginative rendering of what was known about these people's prehistoric technologies and lifestyles, and I was caught up in the interpersonal dramas that unfolded very believably, yet within a radically different culture and worldview. If anything, I enjoyed re-reading the book more than reading it for the first time. Highly recommended.Robert Adler, author of Medical Firsts: From Hippocrates to the Human Genome; and Science Firsts: From the Creation of Science to the Science of Creation."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"I really enjoyed the Clan of the Cave Bear because it was descriptive and interesting. The characters and settings are very realistic. This book brought out every emotion in me and I found it almost addictive. I would recommend the Clan of The Cave Bear to anyone with an open mind, who enjoys fictions stories that include factual information. This book is intended for an older audience. It may be hard for younger children to understand because of the way it is written. The Clan of the Cave Bear is at a reading level of grade 7 and up.What I really enjoyed about this book was that Jean M Auel portrayed the Cave people as being intelligent, with a structured culture, instead of the stereotypical image of Cave people portrayed in most stories. Another aspect of the book i really enjoyed is that the Clan of the Cave Bear is filled with information about the prehistoric area. The book describes detailed facts about how weapons are created, how the clan men hunt and how the clan thinks. What I did not enjoy about this book was that sometimes Jean M. Auel described the setting with too much detail. I thought that the imagery she used was sometimes too descriptive and that there could be more imagination and less facts in the setting."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"This book is the first in a series to capture my imagination. To me, a novel that holds my interest must hold *some* realistic bearing of truth. At the same time however it MUST have a severe overlay of fiction. Believable, but definitely fiction. That's what I love about books. And this series is beyond fact, but it inspires my creative senses and imagination.Gotta love a book like this.

I definitely recommend this series."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"Why did I read this book, you may ask? I shall tell you.My school has this thing so that if you want to be in honors classes, you have to read books from a list over the summer. This book sounded vaguely more interesting than 'Yellow Raft in Blue Water' or whatever, so I decided to get this one.It's about a little girl named Ayla from the Others who loses her parents in an earthquake. She runs away, terrified, into the forest (well, wouldn't you be terrified if a huge crack opened in the earth and swallowed your whole home?)About a week later, she collapses on the ground from being dehydrated and from an infection on her leg from a cave lion. A lady from The Clan finds her, and she gets accepted into the Clan's tribe.The Clan is a group of primitive humans that have brains formed so that they can remember things from past generations, but have problems learning new things. Ayla, on the other hand, comes from a tribe of the Others, a group of primitive humans that can't remember things quite so well, but can easily adapt and learn new things.Ayla forces the Clan to change, and she is influenced by them. She even has a baby from one of the men in the clan...I would give this a PG-13 rating because it describes in detail how exactly Ayla was... blessed... with her child."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"I love this book in the &quot;Clan&quot; Series. The characters are fresh and exciting, the story is new and bold, the details are fascinating and exquisite. To read how the people of prehistoric time could have lived and communicated was a great treat. The girl Ayla adapts and grows to live among the Clan people, but never really gives up her inner self which is freed to develop in the later books. This particular book is excellent as a stand-alone story and should be enjoyed by itself, since the rest of the series leaves much to be desired."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"The Clan Of The Cave Bears is a story of a young girls journey from a homeless child to a young woman raised by a people different then those biologically related to her. Ayla was five when her people were killed in a devastating earthquake. After wandering alone for weeks she is found unconscious by a medicine woman of a homeless Clan. The leader of this Clan sees her as a pet project for his sister Iza, the medicine woman, and believes she would die even with her help. After being nursed back to help she is raised in the ways of the Clan by Iza and her brother, Creb. After a series of events leads the leader's son to an intense hatred of her, Ayla's life takes a different turn than she imagined. She struggles to cope with her differences between her and the people she loves and for acceptance of the Clan. The book takes you through age five to her early teenage years. Jean M. Auel never fails to show the changes in Ayla's personality and thoughts and she becomes a woman. The people of the Clan change as well: Ayla changed their lives forever giving them a unique status when they join several Clans for the Clan Gathering.Ayla discovers many different things, that extend well beyond her own inventions and into cultural differences of her foster-people and her. Her difference from the Clan extends well beyond appearance, but that is conquered by her love for her foster parents, Iza and Creb, changing her and their way of thinking forever. As the first in a series of five books this is a wonderful beginning to the life of Ayla, a young girl lost in the woods of her differences to her \\"family.\\" I found this book wonderful to read and could not wait to read the next in the series after this one."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"This is one of the few books that I've read *many* times. It's one of my favorite books. It tells the story of Ayla, that, due to an earthquake in her childhood, is adopted by a group of people that are both like and unlike her. In order to fit in to her new society, she must go against her own instict. She learns to hunt, though it's forbiddin, and she learns to heal..because her family thinks that this is the only way she will have any value in the patriarchal society. She is raped at a young age, and bears a child, which she nearly loses.Many people are critical, because Ayla is TOO perfect, and discovers too much. Well...so what? It's fiction. She isn't perfect in every way, and she is full of self doubt, and frequently makes poor decisions in her life.Ayla is a strong character, and Jean Auel is a great writer, and the imagery in her books is fantastic. They are well researched and enjoyable. I loved it!"},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"The main reason I was interested in reading Mrs. Auel's Earth's Children series was the unusual setting. There are very few fiction books that deal with the beginning of men as a species.Auel's work must be praised because she was able to picture a very vivid Neanderthalian clan; most of what we know today about neanderthals is speculation based on anthropological findings, since they lived in pre-historical times. Auel's researched is very complete and extense, and it shows in her book. Characters, situations, huntings, clan-dealings, everything is easy to imagine and follow as we read, because tha author's style of writing is smooth and visually powerful. This story is, obviously, just another speculation, but a very interesting one.The main character is Ayla. She's not a Neanderthal; she comes from the Others, a different sub-species, more advanced physically and mentally. Ayla lost her parents in an earthquake when she was very small, and was found and rescued by the neanderthalian clan. There, in spite of her differences, she struggles to be accepted and respected as a member of the clan.Auel's book is good because the characters are deeply developed, not only Ayla, but most of the clan people as well. There's a little difficulty for the reader to get acquainted with the unusual names and the function of each clan member, but once past that the reading is great. There's not much action in the story, but it never drags on. The main feature is, no doubt, the relationship between Ayla and the rest of the clan.I hope the other books in the series keep the good writing.Grade 8.8/10"},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"Clan of the cave bear is about a Cro-Magnon girl named Ayla.

The story is based on actual archealogical findings. The character Creb is a medicine man who has severe physical deformities. An actual neanderthal skeleton was discovered that apears to have the same deformaties that Creb has. The story is fictionalized but it is amazing how they cancreate a culture based on a few artifacts.

It look interesting, so I picked it up, took it back to the Best Western we were staying at. In the three days that followed, I finished all 700-something pages of the book, craving for me. When we returned home, I got &quot;Clan of the Cave Bear&quot; from the local library. It took me one and a half days to read the cinderclock sized novel. I was hooked. Since then I have re-read the entire series, but &quot;Clan&quot; remains my favorite. Ms. Auel has done a fantastic job of protray her Cro-Magnon character Ayla, who is adopted into the Clan, a group of Neanderthals, an ancient race who fears and avoids the newcomers with their ingenious thinking power. Ayla is one of the &quot;Others&quot;, the Cro-Magnon peoples who would evolve quickly into humans as we know them today. Robbed of her home and family in a violent earthquake, the child Ayla wanders aimlessly around the terrain of ancient Europe. Finally she passes out in fatigue after being attacked by a cave lion, the animal that would later become her totem. The Clan was robbed of their home and families as well in the same quake, and are now searching for a new cave. The Clan happens upon injured Ayla, and would have left her lying there if it hadn't been for Iza, the medicine woman of the Clan. She rescues the girl of the Others and nurses her back to health. Soon she is accepted into the Clan, and into Mog-ur's fire. Creb, the Mog-ur, finds himself bonding to this strange girl. However, she has much to learn about the Clan before she is truly accepted, and she has found an enemy in the form of a young man, Broud, the son of the leader's mate.

Free of the commen stereotypes that plague so large of percentage of modern literature, this book has everything going for it. The writing is excellent, the characters believable, and the plot exciting. The story centers around five year old Ayla, a human being, who, after losing her family to a natural disaster, is reluctantly taken in by the Neanderthal Clan, and slowly nursed back to health. As Ayla grows older, many members of the Clan are increasingly disturbed by her strange tendancies and quirks, which rise to the surface no matter how hard she tries to be a proper clan female, and the question is; can Ayla conform to her new suroundings, and, more importantly, does she want to? This is an excellent book that will make you laugh, cry, and, for a short time, feel as if you too live in prehistoric Europe. This book has some disturbing subject matter, including a violent and graphic rape scene, so I have to say I wouldn't recomend this book or it's sequels to anyone younger than sixteen or seventeen."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"Now I'm that kind of a person who usually goes against the stream and rates a 5-star rated book with 1 star. But despite this fact, I'm rating this book 4 stars, which happens very rarely (unless you're talking about Tolkien, of course).The book has some small problems. Auel does burden the reader with lots and lots of unuseful (for me, at least) information. Sometimes, her narrative stops and gives way to a 4 page lecture on different plants and stuff. Sometimes Auel gets too carried away and her plot gets a little strange. So in order to read this book and enjoy it, you have to know how to skim through books. When you see a plant lecture coming, just skip it and go on. If you take these lectures out, you will get a very gripping book.I must admit that the author had the needed effect on me. When I'm supposed to be nervous, I was nervous, and when something interesting and important was going on, I just couldn't tear myself off the book.Most of these low-star ratings are from people who can't skim through boring material. Believe me, I couldn't do it before, and that's why I hate so many books which don't deserve it. Try reading it at least, if you get through the first 100 pages and you still don't like, then don't try going further - it won't help."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"Auel deserves all the hype that goes to JK Rowlings. A test of a good writer is the ability to sustain the quality of the writing across a series and the richness and reality of the world in the story. Auel does this in the latest novel. My only disappointment was that the series ended with the latest release. I'm only doing Amazon reviews on great stories and skilful writers."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"[ ... ]Few writers ever do as much homework as Jean Auel did to produce this book and its sequels. The story of a homo sapiens five-year-old girl's wandering alone in the wilderness after an earthquake killed her family, rescued by a Neandertal band based on real archaeological discoveries, and raised by them, with problems with one bully who ultimately drives her away from the clan and from her son, is famous world-wide and really needs no further reviews, but how could I not review this book? My husband asked me once why all the intelligent women he knows--and he finds women very boring unless their IQ is over 130--love Ayla. I answered, \\"She's our mother.\\"He then read it for himself and figured out what I mean.My brother, who is one of the most brilliant oilpatch engineers of this century, keeps her books in his office rather than in the family library, but he loves them more than his wife does.Highly recommended for anybody old enough to read it. As my father once told the librarians when I was in junior high, \\"This is my daughter. She MAY read anything she CAN read.\\" Everybody's daughter, and preferably everybody's son, ought to read at least Clan of the Cave Bear, whether they go on to read the rest of the series or not."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"This review is for the entire Earth's Children series. I purchased the set from Pristine Books through Amazon.com. Overall I was very impressed with this seller, and would certainly order from Marguerite again. I received the order quickly, and all five books were carefully packed. Upon arrival I was very happy with the last three books of the series - they were first editions and in excellent condition. I was initially disappointed with The Clan of the Cave Bear (it was a 2001 rather than 1980 printing) and The Valley of Horses (it was a 1982 printing as hoped but the maps on the inside of the cover were discolored). I emailed the seller through Amazon and Marguerite responded promptly to my concerns. She went out of her way to replace both books, and I am now very happy with them (both are early prints in very good condition). Marguerite shipped the replacements at no additional cost and paid for the return shipping of the original books. The first two books of this series are apparently more challenging to find, so if an early print or first edition is imperative to you I would recommend you contact the seller prior to placing your order. If Marguerite does not have them in stock I'm sure she will do her best to find them for you. As for the books themselves, the series is wonderful!"},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"I reread this book recently after having read it for the first time 15 years ago and I enjoyed it again. The setting is somewhere in Eastern Europe about 35,000 years ago. The premise is that 2 divergent human species occupy Europe at that time. After a horrible earthquake, the medicine woman of the Clan of the Cave Bear finds an orphaned and injured young girl of the \`Other' type of humans. Ayla is cared for and loved by the aged and scarred priest Creb and his medicine woman sister Iza who act as her parents. But she looks different and her way of thinking is different than the ways of her adoptive people, (presumably Neanderthals, while she herself is Cro-Magnon?) and she struggles for acceptance.The story covers approximately 9 years of Ayla's life from the age of 5 until the age of 14. Although we are lead to believe that she was born to people that are taller, more agile and more innovative than the Clan people, Ayla is the only person of her kind that we encounter in this story. The traits of Ayla's people are determined based on her fragmented memories and her own emerging talents as she grows. The Clan people are stockier and stronger than Ayla and communicate mostly with sign language while Ayla recalls communicating verbally.The Clan people rely heavily on inherited memory and have clearly defined gender roles, which Ayla continually grapples with. She cannot restrain her curiosity and she is constantly challenging the rules with her aberrant behavior. Ayla wants to learn to hunt with a sling, but it is forbidden. She learns the art of healing from her new mother, but because she is not a birth daughter, the members of the clan have reservations. She has a grasp of mathematics and the gift of sight that would make her a good priestess, but that path is not open to women.We have all felt out of place and therefore everyone can identify somewhat with Ayla. I liked Ayla's spirit and the way she excels at everything she sets her mind to. I particularly loved the herb lore and descriptions of tribal living in the cave. I like learning how the clan hunted, clothed themselves and managed to live through winters. The religious ceremonies were nicely drawn and the funeral descriptions give a sense of the spirituality of our evolutionary forefathers. A warning to readers that there is some sexual violence in this novel.Recommended."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"it is the 2nd book i read from this series(i read the 5th book first)..it is certainly the best book of the series and i am rather disappointed by the quality of the other 4 books after i read this, it talks about the life of ayla in the clan(considered animals by people), her unusualness, and her life there, and it does not have the scenary description like in her other 4 books, a truly must read."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"I've re-read this book yet once again. And it was just as good this time around as it was the first. Great interaction between characters and moving story. Thanks for the great read."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"This is one of the most different books of a series that I have ever read before and I truly LOVED it! Clan of the Cave Bear is action-packed,and very engrossing all the way through from beginning to end.The story centers around the little girl, Ayla, who loses her family in an earthquake and is left alone all by herself at 5 years old trying to survive. She becomes ill and survival becomes almost impossible. Finally, she sees a cave, and sees acave lion. She gets away, but then passes out unconscious.The Clan is hunting and they see her. Yet, most of them don't want to help her because she is not one of &quot;THEM,&quot; she is born to the &quot;OTHERS.&quot; However, Iza, a member of the clan has a heart and takes her with them, whether the other members like it or not. She helps Ayla to get back on her feet, but they wonder where she comes from.The Clan about has to take her in, against many of their wishes with the exception of Iza, who has always loved her. The Clan adopted her a ways into the story, but not without hatred by some. Especially Broud.Ayla learns Clan ways of living. Women are subserbviant to men, ALWAYS. Yet Ayla at times rebels and gets many punishments along the way. Broud, is the one who most of all, HATES Ayla with a passion and is always making constant trouble for her.Ayla does learn many skills along the way in this first book of the series so that she can survive on her own. don't wish to tell too much here in the review though, as to ruin the story for some of you who are looking to read the book. As you read along you will see how the whole story ties in together with the basic facts I mentioned above."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"I loved this book from the very beginning all the way to the very end. I laughed and cried and got mad and then recovered and then did the emotions all over again.A good read is a book that allows the reader to learn (as I definitely did about prehistoric times and about botany) and also to love the characters like Creb, Iza, and of course the main character Alya. To also get mad when things aren't going for the character's we love and to cry when they go so wrong that we feel for it too our hearts.This is the best book I have read and I am serious. I am already on page 200 of the next book to read after this one. &quot;The Valley of the Horses&quot;. I love it also and can't wait to see what is going to happen next! What a wonderful series! See ya on this review board on the current book when I am finished!:)"},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"The mysteries of the first book in The Earth's Children series are a magnificient way to keep the readers coming. It lives up to it's cover, it's reviews , and its promise. I highly reccommend it. I hope the final book is as good as the first. I no longer trust Jean, after The Shelters of Stone, but I still have hopes of the final installment."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"I read all of the four books in this series. They were so good, I couldn't stop. I can really relate to the struggles of the characters. They are all so real. I know this summer I will read them again. You should do the same."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"it amazes me that after so many years and so much exposure that this book is still in print. the only story i have ever read that is worse than these is Moby Dick. the only thing worse than those 2 books are the movie adaptations. i'd rather pull out my own fingernails with red hot pliers than to read the cave bear again. a insanely long and over written pile of trite tripe.'a festering bag of fish entrails' is too kind a review for this load of sewage. if anyone tries to make you read this book, slit your wrists and fling yourselve from a cliff first - it will be less painfull."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"In this book, you travel back in time to a world without the knowledge we have today. In some cases it was better back then. The world was fresh, unspoiled, and there were a group of people that called themselves:The Clan Of The Cave Bear. Ayla, the beautiful heroine, is left orphened in a strange world after her &quot;tribe&quot; gets killed by a natural disaster. As Ayla grows, she strugles to learn the ancient ways of the clan. She then has a son. When there is a new leader, he banishes her. To find out more details read the book! Even though I started the series when I was in the sixth grade, last year, I love this series, and have already finished it. I'm dying to read the next one."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"I think this book is very well writen. I have read every book in the series and this is my favorite. You find yourself caring about Ayla and her adopted family. I would like to read a book about what has happened to the Clan since Ayla's departure."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"I have read all 4 books in this series and I can't get enough. Jean Auel is a literary genius. I am an herbalist so all the medicine woman information keeps me in its grip with extreme facination. Im dying to read the fifth book. Ayla, your my hero! Lanita"},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"The Clan of the Cave Bear, along with the rest of this series by Jean M. Auel have been an incredible adventure....full of history, strength, and information. Ayla is prime example of heroism in any age. I am just wondering when the next novel in the Earth's Childrens series will be out"},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"IT'S GRIPPING,KEEPS YOU GLUED TO THE BOOK AND I SINCERELY PRAY THE SAGA CONTINUES!!!!"},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"My book is called The Clan of the Cave Bear. The author of this book is Jean M. Auel. I would say that this book is fabulous. Also from a one to ten rating, I'd have to say that this book, at least deserves a top ten. The whole story takes place in the time of the cave men and cave women, which really amazes me. It sounds so amazingly beautiful where they live. It is so much nicer to read a book like this one because it lets you imagine their world and what it was like back then instead of reading a book which leads you to thinking all about the cities and all of the bad things in this world. Therefore, this book takes me away, and I think that's one of the neat things books can do for you.The whole story is about a young girl named Ayla and all of the things she goes through and experiences after the loss of her parents . After a while of barely surviving, another clan comes across Ayla and finally decides to rescue her. Ayla is about seven at the time. Ayla is from a clan with very different ways as opposed to this one and she speaks their language. As Ayla continues to grow into a woman she finds herself very different from the other women in their clan. She is very strong and skilled. She loves to do things that only the men are allowed to do, like hunting. She's even better than the other men are. At first, she is beaten for even talking about these things.I really enjoyed reading this book. I think that this is a book that everyone should read because it teaches you so much. It is a very interesting book. In some ways, it lets you experience things you might have never experienced, just by reading this book. Even though it's about things so long ago, it still seams so realistic. Whether you're interested in it because it takes place so long ago and it has to do with the cave men and cave women, or for the survival in it, or then the spiritual and down to earth ways about it, whatever the reason, it's well worth it."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"they are really splended! i just hope that jean m auel can write the follow up to the last one..."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"Ayla is an unusual heroine. We meet her at the age of five when a natural upheaval separates her from her family. The reader is treated to a new world of experience as Ayla adjusts to her new adoptive family. An engrossing read which will have you reaching for the next volume until they are all read and then you will wait impatientlly with the rest of us for Ms. Auel to finish the next entry."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"Ms. Auel has done a hell of a lot of research to write a series of books as this. Although set in story form, if you disect this book you see the tragedy in the struggle to survive just day by day. Ms. Auel is OK in my book."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"I got VALLEY OF THE HORSES (book 2) by accident from a book club (I didn't say no on the card) and started reading it. I got hooked, kept it and ordered the first book (CLAN OF THE CAVE BEAR) and now I regularly check the new release section for the next installment (say, isn't it about time for the next one)! I rate this series right up there with Tolkien (LORD OF THE RINGS) and Herbert (DUNE) for creating a wonderful world of fantasy, except this one could be true! Jean Auel has all the detail and research of Michener, but reads much easier. A first rate author with the kind of flare, phrase and narrative that Erica Jong displayed in THE FEAR OF FLYING. You feel like you are there and living the adventure with her."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"This book is really one of the best I've ever read, not so much because of the story line but also because it is so well researched and offers an interesting, if not new, idea on where we all came from, nothing really matches this book as far as how faithful it is to history and it (and it's sequels) really provide a lot of fun for a long time to come due to 2 more books still on the way from the author."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"I read this book in the seventh grade. I somehow managed to...skip over parts, so when I read it again, I got a whole new storyline. I have managed to read it at least once a month, and I rant about it incessantly. Just ask my friends."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"To write a book set entirely tens of thousands of years ago and not make it a bunch of flaky porn full of scantily clad cavefolk is a feat in itself and it is one that Jean Auel accomplishes with style. Truthfully, you could juxtapose this story into almost any time period and it would speak just as clearly of a person's struggle for individualism in a narrow society. Auel is incredibly imaginative in her descriptions of the Clan's customs, communication, and other folkways, as is her creation of characters with names such as Creb, Iza, Brun and Broud. At the same time, she writes with such intelligent awareness of anthropological fact, taking digs at places like Shanidar Cave and creating colorful human lives from bones."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"I read this, the first in the Earth Children Series, and was immediately hooked! These books are written with such attention to detail, and are so obviously well-researched that you really get a good visual and feel for what the early human experience may have been like. (Some items are obviously not plausible, but they are few and far between.)Yet, even with the full attention to detail, and somewhat lengthy descriptions of the surroundings, the books are easy to read and enjoy. They are a true pleasure and my only complaint is that I am still waiting for the sequel six years after having read the series!"},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"I read this book for the first time while in college. It was purely for entertainment purposes, but it brought out a sense of who I am as a young woman. I mean, before this book I had many personal feelings of inadequacy, but as soon as I read this book, I felt a bigger sense of self. I STRONGLY recommend this book to other young women trying to find an identity."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"I just read all four books in the series again, and I think they are exceptionally well written. I urge everyone to read them. One small word of warning. Leave a couple of weeks in between books. I say this because, as with all sequels, there is always some inevitable repetition of some key facts. This gets to be a bit boring by the third book, and downright annoying in the fourth. So give yourself some time, you'll enjoy them much more."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"I read Clan of Cave Bear in 1984. I was forever changed , I have come to relize this more over the years. I of course have read the series with the anticipation of all Jean Auel followers do. I have waited years Jean. Is there going to be a sequel?? Where are you? Where is Ayla? Are there future books from you? Devoted fans want to know."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"I have read this book so many years ago, and after reading the other reviews, I can still remember, like it was yesterday, everything about the books! I have to get them out again and read them. Thanks for bringing back the great memories of Ayla !"},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"This is the first novel I ever read way back in middle school. Yes, it was a little mature for me, but i fell in love with the story, no, legacy of Ayla. I'm in college now and the entire series is still simply sensational to me! Her strength, determination, and modesty is an example for us all. Whenever I have the urge to read something and have no new novels, I return to this or one of the other novels in this series. It keeps my memory fresh for when the fifth comes out. And by the way...I've been very patient for the fifth &lt;moreso than anything else I can remember&gt; And would be so very delighted to see its release."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"This is a story of total humanity.

The medicine woman called Iza took her in as her own.When Ayla starts getting more mature, she starts to do man stuff, which is forbidding.What will happen to Ayla? To find out, you have to read the book!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"I must say I enjoyed this book ALOT. I have also read the sequals Valley of the Horses and The Mammoth Hunters. They are all fabulas books, They have great story lines and once you start reading it you wont be able to put it down. The only thing that I have to say that is negative towards the book is there are a few graphic sex scenes, if your planning on letting your child read these books I would advise reading through the book, beforhand and taping shut all the pages with anything \\"dirty\\" on them. Besides that the books are EXCELLENT. I began reading them when I believe I was 12 and I've fallen in love with them! I must say that I think waht \\"The nagel\\" said was very immature, Saying it would better to slit your wrists and fling yourselve over a clif is better than reading this book is pathetic, your entitled to your own opinion but, and I know its just a figure of speech but its a VERY poorly thought out one. I don't Mind people not liking the book, but you dont go and say you would rather slit your wrists than reading it again its just ignorant.If your looking for some very good literature, then I would definetly suggest reading this series!-Fiona Moodie, 14"},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"Like author Eric Wilson, I'm re-reading this series. Why? Because I miss Jean M. Auel's characters. They inspired me to go on a journey with them in Jr. High, after the birth of my first son in 1985, and now. I walked through a bookstore and recognized them as 'old friends'. Since I knew the ending, I read it this time with a clear eye on Auel's style. The novel's strong setting and physical descriptions are what really draws the reader in, as well as the interaction of the characters. I was just as entertained as the first time I read it, maybe more, since I now realize all the hard work that goes into writing a book.Chrissy K. McVay'author of 'Souls of the North Wind'"},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"The author Jean M. Auel wrote this book to take you back to the cave days. The author gives you a vision of the past through her writing. She writes in such great detail you can almost feel as if you were there with the characters. The Clan of the Cave Bear is changed with the presence of a new comer to the clan that is a female and looks totally different from the rest of the clan. Ayla is from the others and is faced to adapt to the new customs of the clan and it becomes a long tough journey for her. Ayla does things that women can't do and is faced with death if caught. Ayla is tall with blond hair, colored yes and is very smart. I give this book two thumbs up because it's very well written. It's good from beginning to the end. You will be able to vision how cave people lived during that time. It was a difficult life style and it's so amazing how they survived. Trust me you won't want to put this book down because it is full of adventure. I don't read much and I was able to read it, finish it, and enjoy it as well. Give it a try you will not be disappointed."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"This is one of the better book series out there.

Excellent series in which I've anxiously read every book."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"I was only ten years old when my mom urged me to read this beautiful work. It was a little overwhelming at parts, but I've never regretted. The pure soul that Auel gives her characters is something that has been achieved by few other writers I've read. The work and passion that she has put into this world she's re-created is astounding. Although scientific findings have discounted many characteristics of the Clan (such as the intact hyoid bone found recently, indicating that Neandertals had full spoken language) the idea of this amazing species of hominid is compoletely engaging. And after reading this, who doesn't want to suddenly be as intelligent and powerful as the amazing Ayla? A wonderful book, which (in tandem with its follow-ups) inspired a great number of obsessions in me."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"The Clan of the Cave Bear Crown Publishers, 2002, 468pp., $29.95Jean M. Auel ISBN: 0-517-542021The Clan of the Cave Bear is an extremely emotional novel. You will have mood swings all throughout the book. At one point you will be excited for a successful hunt, then crying over a tragic death in a family.It all starts with a little, blonde-haired, five-year-old girl, Ayla, living with her mother in prehistoric Europe, 25,000 years from today. A terrible earthquake kills Ayla's mom and she is left alone. She ventures away from the constant aftershocks for a new home. She his hanging on the thread of her life in search for a miricle.Jean Auel has a very descriptive style of writing. I see metaphors and personification all through the novel. She sometimes switches from scene to scene every chapter. She also writes cliffhangers. It really motivated me to read the next book, and then the whole set of books. There are five books in all.I recommend The Clan of the Cave Bear to anybody who enjoys a novel full of magic, tradition, and adventure. It might not be suitable to younger children, it has a lot of violence and adultery related items.

The struggle for life. What is more important? Instinct or adaptability? Both have benefits and both have downfalls. But, historically and PREhistorically, mind has always won out over brawn, and speed and agility... This fictional novel depicts the lives and the emotion and the humanity of those that came before us and the struggles they may have dealt with. Some of the antics of our heroine, Ayla, may seem too ridiculously heroic and comic book character like, BUT the author is trying to envisage evolution for her reader, making neccessary some grand gestures. The mixing of neanderthal and cro magnum species is a unique and thought provoking setting. The driving force of this epoch is the humanity and the creativity that has set apart and driven mankind through the millenia. Ironically, a must read for hard science fiction buffs... as an understanding of where we came from....a glimpse, a picture of what may have been, sets the stage for where we are going and what we are capable of overcoming."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"As a teen I loved this book, and it was my first read over a couple hundred pages.

Who then adopt her and raise her as her own. This little girl, as she grows up, learns about survival and life and love through the new family she has found.

It's well written and researched. The herbs Iza uses are still used nowadays. Not only is the book captivating, it is very educational as well."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"This book was absolutely brilliant!!!!! i went on to read the whole series!!! recommended to everyone over 15 and likes a good read."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"Jane Auel was an unknown beforeThe Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children, Book One). She created a series that will go down as the best-loved, most-read in all of historical fiction. The main character, Ayla, is a Cro-Magnon girl taken in by a medicine woman from the Clan--a small band of Neandertals. The setting is tens of thousands of years in the past--the time when modern man and neandertals shared a sparsely populated Ice Age earth.No matter how hard she tries, Ayla cannot fit in with the clan. She is tall, lanky, and blond where they are short, stocky, and dark. It is refreshing how Auel never imposes modern man as superior over their close cousins. Rather, the Clan is portrayed as equally intelligent, but culturally distinct. This parallels very nicely with myriad differences in nationality, race, and religion today.In Book One, Ayla learns the traditions and complex language of the Clan from Iza, a medicine woman who ranks as first among all women. She has trouble adjusting to a fiercely hierarchal and patriarchal society. Broud, the son of the Clan's leader, has a passionate hatred for Ayla. He forces her to do unspeakable things in an attempt to bring upon a death curse that would purify the Clan of this outsider.The sole drawback of Clan of the Cave Bear is that Auel reiterates descriptions of characters in exactly the same way--distracting from of the narrative's richness. This is not merely a flaw from a debut novelist. Needless repetition is a trait that permeates all six books of the Earth's Children series.Lack of outstanding writing is more than made up for with Auel's impressive research and storytelling ablities. Earth's Children is a testament to the unexplored possibilities of a genre that lacks mainstream consciousness among the reading public. 4/5 stars."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"I listened to the audio of this book and the narration was decently done. For some reason I had put off reading this book for years, but I am glad that I finally read it. This book is long and the story is told in a very simplistic way yet woven in are historical facts. It is a historical fantasy book but yet had such a realistic feel to it. Jean M. Auel had me emotionally invested in Ayla and her relationship with people in the Clan. Her struggle with the bullies and despots was gripping and beautifully developed over time. My only complaint is the very closure of the book. I loved the development and the victory that Ayla accomplishes but the ending was heartbreaking and I wish it could have been done differently. I appreciate how Auel set the ending up so we would have faith that the characters would be okay, but I still was heartbroken.Despite the heartbreaking ending it was still a victory for Ayla and I was happy for her. I am glad I read this and I recommend it to people who enjoy historical fantasy or survivalist themes books."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"This is the first book in the \\"earth's children\\" series(I think there are six now)It is also far and away the BEST.Great character development and interesting culturalexploration.I loved this book..the rest of the series..not so much"},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"It will be difficult to keep once step ahead of ms aurels.

I .intend to read it again next year"},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"I read this book years ago and had an urge to re-visit it. Once again, I enjoyed the anthropological slant to the story- even though it's conjecture based on studies. It's interesting to think about how early societies must have formed, behaved, planted the seeds fot our modern society. I never read the rest of the series but will continue this time, although a science-minded friend of mine said that the story lines become more soap opera-y as the books progress."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"I very much enjoyed book of one this series. It gripped me and I had a hard time putting it down. This was when I was reading hardbacks and not kindle versions, so I was pinned under this book for many nights and all night long. :) While I would suggest this book to many people as it does cross genres I may not suggest the 2nd book in the series which got to much like a history book for me. I would love to see a new movie made for this one."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"This book is about very early humans (before homo sapiens) and their way of living & governing themselves. I don't know how much of it is true, but it is very engrossing."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"I read this book a few years back but couldn't resist reviewing it now that I have an Amazon account.Jean Auel is one of my favorite authors. I have all her books in hardback. The reason I am so attached to these books is that the details she interweaves into the story line really brings it to life. The descriptions of the plants and their uses, the feel of living in a cave, these are the things make Clan of the Cave Bear great. I know the author does at least a year of research before each book and it really shows.The plight of Ayla, her constant feeling of being different and insufficient, her struggle to please those she loves, this is something everyone can relate to on some level. I look forward to diving into the Painted Caves very soon!"},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"I read & review books on this site & if I enjoy it I give it 4 or 5 stars. However as entertaining as those books are very few have left such an impression on me as has this book. This is a thoroughly enjoyable faction book which focuses just as much on plot as it does on the period & setting which for the most part is fairly accurate. (although not perfect)I found this a joy to read as did my Dad whom I recommended this to. Life in neanderthal times doesn't particularly intrigue me until I started reading this book.Very Highly Recommended."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"Although no one can truly go back in time and put themselves into the mindset of a Neanderthal, Auel comes close. I thoroughly enjoyed being swept into a world both alien and familiar--a world of frustrating customs stacked up against the protagonist. Her rationale for the clan's customs was amazing, and it created a pleasantly disturbing dissonance in my mind: at times, the clan's customs were so strange as to be almost alien. At other times, their behavior rang of our own way of thinking, suggesting a common element of humanity even in our most primitive relations. Ayla is a sympathetic protagonist, and it was the development and resilience of her character against the rigid rules of the Neanderthals that made me want to keep turning the page."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"For some reason I downloaded this book to my Kindle even though my genre is mystery and thriller type books. At the time it was offered for free and something about the description and reviews prompted me to get it. Well downloading this book was one of the best decisions I have made.I was hooked on the first two pages of reading this book and have not stopped until briefly last night when I finished it and had to pay for and download book two of this series. I could not go on to other books in my Kindle, literally hundreds of them now, without continuing the stories in this series.The Clan of the Cave Bear was facinating to read with characters and storylines so real and well written I found myself going through all kinds of emotions along with them, especially Ayla, the main character. They came to life in this well written novel so well that I had to keep reminding myself that it was after all a novel, a work of fiction but one with well researched historical information many thousands of years ago.No matter what types of books or genres you like to read, I can pretty much guarantee you will find this book as fantastic as I have."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"An interesting premise for a story and told fairly well. A orphaned human child taken in by a clan of neanderthals who roamed the world at the same time as our ancestors. Some Interesting ideas about our pre-historical past and how we may have developed. Overall I enjoyed the story and am looking forward to the next book in the series."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. The author holds your attention, so you wonder what is going to happen next. I loved it!"},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"Jean Auel's &#34;Earth's Children&#34; series is a wonderful picture of what neanderthal and cro-magnon life in vivid detail and beautiful prose. I love all of them, but it all started with this book!"},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"Finished reading this last night. Amazing story!!! It was a bit difficult getting through the 1st chapter but after that, I was good to go! Totally imaginative, riveting, touching & pretty much leaves you with a kinda obsessive focus even when you're not reading. I loved the language; can't remember the last time I read a book that taught me SO many new words!!! & the story line? good grief....... I totally had NO idea the book was going to be that intense! or amazing! It's one of those moments where I realize & appreciate that you really cannot judge a book by it's cover/name. Some things you just MUST read! Auel is so descriptive and thorough in her writing. I'm so happy I came across this series... it realllllyyy makes you THINK and pulls on all your emotions. If you're reading this on your kindle, you will truly indulge in and love the dictionary! Every few pages I will hover my kindle cursor over a word and get the definition. Good stuff!"},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"The Clan of the Cave Bear by: Jean M AuelI have a new and greater respect/understanding for women who write on subjects of this type. My second reading of this book was 10-years after the first time I read this most excellent writing. (2nd reading more enjoyable and harder to put down.)Research, personality, writing style:(a gift from God), to place word after word in such an interesting and enjoyable visual web is beyond something special. I reserve such praise and gratitude to few \\"Writers\\" I am acquainted with.To quote J.M. Auel's publisher Bantam: \\"Ayla, (main character} for in her blood flows the future of humanity.\\"Auel's 2nd Book: \\"the Valley of Horses\\" a must read, is even better. Judge for yourself...Those of you that do will be most richly rewarded.My daughter (Free Lance Writer) Jackie M Johnson is now writing her 3rd Book to be published. 3-cheers for the women."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"Hands down, Clan of the Cave Bear was one of the best books I've ever read, and it changed the way I write and think about the world. Jean M. Auel's research into her subject is amazing, she actually describes ancient technology with such accuracy and detail that you could repeat the experiments yourself. Nothing is cheesed up or flowery, you feel like you could be looking through a hole in the fence that lets you peek into Ayla's world. Some may argue that long descriptions of making medicine, cooking or other aspects of daily life are boring, but it added to the realism for me.Characters such as Creb, Ayla and Isa may have simple names, but they are in no way simple. Each is multi-layered and interesting, and it's impossible for me to pick a favorite to read about. Even Broud, the main antagonist, has his likeable moments, and he's one character that's easy to love to hate.Auel manages to pull off a strong heroine without falling into the same trap so many other authors do in making their women Mary-Sues. Auel is realistic about Ayla's hardships and shortcomings, like the fact that, compared to the Clan, she is an incredibly slow learner, very ugly and taller than most men.The world in which Ayla lives is so well fleshed out that it feels tangible. The rituals, the manner of choosing totems and the living arrangements of the Clan are interesting to read in of themselves, but the detail in which they are described paints a clear picture. Auel even describes the louse treatment the clan uses, and the ritual for marriage and mating.In all, I'd recommend that everyone should read this book at least once in their lives. (That is, once you are old enough to get past the very blunt and graphic details that Auel portrays.)"},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"I have enjoyed reading this book and the entire series. It gives an educated glimpse into history. I am not a scientist and cannot verify any of the things written to be true; but anyone who has even a slight interest in prehistory ,or just a good story, should look at these books. I have always been a fan of series books and these have a good continuity and satisfying endings. There is a great deal of mysticism running throughout and should be taken \\"as is\\", that is, conjecture on the part of the author. The sex scenes can be embarrassing but the story supports the attitudes of the people as just another natural human condition."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"If you have someone with reading difficulties, this is a great way for them to learn how to read. By reading and listening the get to enjoy the story while listening."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"Thanks for very prompt service. Used book in excellent condition. Have read book before many times but misplaced original copy. A book I will continue to treasure."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"This story while not being for young children, is a wonderful trip into prehistoric times. It is a fiction for both sexes, as both my son and daughter loved reading and listening to the audio cd's."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"This book is an incredible story. The characters are interesting and endlessly sympathetic. Dont believe the negative reviews. It is extremely well written, historically interesting, and anyone who believes Auel portrays the neandrothal race as simply stupid or scapegoats is not reading it thouroghly. My sister is an anthropoligist, and she says that even though there are some small leaps made, it is highly believable from a scholarly point of view. Overall it is the beginning of one of the best series I've ever read. I cant wait for the sixth book!"},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"A bit difficult to start. But once I got past the first chapter I was hooked. Pre-History Fiction - never thought I'd enjoy it, never thought I'd read it. Jean Auel did a wonderful job with her vivid writing style; just what I need to get through any book. Loved it!"},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"This book was very well done. It keep me interested every minute. It was set during early man. It was a chronicle of a young child that lost her family during an earthquake. She was a homosapin taken in by cavemen. It was filled with interesting facts related to communication, man vs woman, customs, tool making, and cavemen vs noncavemen. I could not stop listening. I was so into it I bought the follow up book. This was not a book I would have purchased. A friend recommended it. I am so glad I listened to her."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"I loved this book! I finished it in 3 days, I just couldn't put it down. The story traps you immediately, and it deals with subjects such as equality of the sexes and racism. The characters come alive in your mind, and even though some notions are a bit fantastic (like the genetic memory of the Clan), which doesn't make it very credible historically, still the story in itself is enthralling. I can't wait to read the next one!!!"},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"Who'd a thunk it! A riveting story about cave dwellers. You follow the life of Ayla, a cro-magnin girl, orphaned by an earthquake and saved by a group of different humans, the Neanderthals. By the end of this part of her story (there are 5 books, so far) you are drawn into her dangerous and complex world, where such a simple thing as a smile is seen as a threatening gesture and where men dominate the culture completely.Ms. Auel puts a great deal of descriptive narrative into her work and brings this foreign world to life, making it easy for the reader to picture what it must have been like to be alive in this primitive environment. Then she layers her tale with full details of the culture these people followed; their spirituality, their tribal organization and even the celebrations and sorrows experienced by the clan. My favorite book, all time. Which is why I bought the audio version, it makes my daily commute much more enjoyable. PS. I have all 5 books on audio and actually look forward to my drive time."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"I really enjoyed the Clan of the Cave Bear because it was descriptive and interesting. The characters and settings are very realistic. This book brought out every emotion in me and I found it almost addictive. I would recommend the Clan of The Cave Bear to anyone with an open mind, who enjoys fictions stories that include factual information. This book is intended for an older audience. It may be hard for younger children to understand because of the way it is written. The Clan of the Cave Bear is at a reading level of grade 7 and up.What I really enjoyed about this book was that Jean M Auel portrayed the Cave people as being intelligent, with a structured culture, instead of the stereotypical image of Cave people portrayed in most stories. Another aspect of the book i really enjoyed is that the Clan of the Cave Bear is filled with information about the prehistoric area. The book describes detailed facts about how weapons are created, how the clan men hunt and how the clan thinks. What I did not enjoy about this book was that sometimes Jean M. Auel described the setting with too much detail. I thought that the imagery she used was sometimes too descriptive and that there could be more imagination and less facts in the setting."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"What impressed me most about this book was Ms. Auel's ability to create believable settings in a world so different from the one we live in. She must have written volumes of backstory, because unlike many novels (even novels set in familiar times) these characters feel like they inhabit a world that existed long before the novels first word, and will continue to exist long after its last."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"This has definitely become a cult classic. I really liked the book the first time around, and it is a compelling story, but it definitely has some flaws. One of the biggest is Auel's writing. Her story ideas are good, but the execution is not great. Oh, let's face it, she writes like a tenth grader. An imaginative tenth grader, to be sure, but a tenth grader just the same. With that in mind, the best audience for this book is the high school crowd. Ayla has that whole teen rebellion thing going. As I've gotten older, she keeps getting less sympathetic. Seriously, it almost seems like she goes out of her way to get into trouble, and that whole &quot;she was different, she couldn't help it&quot; line just sounds like an excuse for her lack of self-control. Just because one has the ability to break every rule of their society, doesn't mean one should, but she's smart,blonde and pretty, so we'll build a series around her.&lt;sigh&gt;"},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"WARNING! If you start on this book you'll probably be just as captivated as I was and move on to the others. BIG MISTAKE! Once you've read the 2nd book you'll be hooked.....& then comes the trouble.First let me say that I'm a sucker for all types of adventure stories and that the adventures contained in the \\"Earth's Children\\" books (4 of which I've read) are fun and hard to resist; that's why they've been so popular.The problem is the writing. Jean Auel is a terrible, I repeat TERRIBLE writer who came up with a good, fun idea. Some Amazon reviewers criticize her work because her main characters are \\"Stone-Age Super Heroes\\". I say: \\"so what, that's one thing that makes them fun & exciting\\". Who cares that her 2 protagonists invented just about everything useful to help push man (and woman) through the Stone Age? Who cares that they have a natural compassion, sense of equality and pacifist philosophy that can only be matched by Jimmy Carter? Who cares that their personal hygiene is up to 20th century standards even though they lived 25,000 yrs. ago? These books are historical, FICTIONAL adventure stories.However the \\"historical\\" part is where Jean Auel gets into so much trouble.Auel tries to overcome her poor writing ability by making two additional HUGE errors. The first is by repeating and rehashing in every book, circumstances, events, information and experiences (not to mention sex scenes) to a degree that is so beyond exasperating it absolutely ventures well into nauseating.Her second monumental blunder is caused by her extensive research in the Botanical, Anthropological and Archeological fields. For some reason beyond my limited comprehension, Jean Auel must think that the more banal historical minutiae she includes in her fictional \\"super-hero\\" adventure stories, the more credibility she gains as an author. She could not be more wrong. I can only describe my frustration in reading the 4th book with the analogy of what they say about men who drive fancy, expensive cars...... they're trying to make up for a \\"short\\"-coming they know they have.In each book these two problems get worse and worse. By the end of the 4th book you'll be tearing your hair out.....I promise! Again, not because the story itself isn't enjoyable but because the repetition and plant and landscape information & descriptions are so tedious and cumbersome that they take most of the pleasure out of plot. After reading reviews of the 5th book, my impression is that it's just as bad as the 4th.Jean Auel doesn't realize that MOST of her readers ARE NOT going to start with the 3rd, 4th or 5th books. Most people like to start at the beginning. She also has NO concept that those same readers are there for the plot and characters, not for the research. But if we can learn a little about the evolution of the earth, it's human, animal and plant life development and value along the way....GREAT!In comparison, when we pick up a Harry Potter book, we acquire some knowledge on magic, folklore, myths and legends. But that information is not what captivates us. It's the excitement of the characters, their interaction and the plot. If we wanted text book information, we wouldn't be reaching for a fiction novel, would we? You and I know this, luckily for her, J.K. Rowling knows this but unfortunately Ms. Auel doesn't. Because of this, the \\"Earth Children\\" popularity will not stand the test of time.I guess my biggest question is \\"Where are the editors?\\" Does Auel put up the money to publish these monstrosities? The \\"The Plains of Passage\\" is 760 pages; it should and could have been cut by 250 pages.If you want some truly GREAT adventure stories or series' reach for The Leather Stocking Tales, The Scarlet Pimpernel, The Sackett Stories, The Wrinkle in Time Quartet, Harry Potter, The Adventures of Alan Quartermain or The Martian Tales, Discworld, Horatio Hornblower or The Master and Commander Series anything by Robert Louis Stevenson, Alexander Dumas or Jules Vern. My list is almost endless.I'll grant you that anything written in the 18th or 19th centuries are more difficult to read but they are SO much more rewarding. However, there's still plenty of truly great adventure writing for you to enjoy from the 20th century.In short the \\"Earth Children\\" Series just doesn't measure up. As much as I love Ayla and Jondalar, I don't think I'm going to read the 5th or upcoming 6th books. If I do, not only will I mostly just be skimming the pages without quotation marks but the books themselves will be read between classics, dramas and adventures written by authors who have an understanding of not just what their readers want but rather what their genre requires."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"...you're really missing out!First off, let me announce to those who are not aware that BOOK FIVE IS COMING OUT IN MAY 2002!... The entire series is excellent, but you MUST 'begin at the beginning' with COTCB. Jean Auel's carefully detailed prehistoric world - how they hunted, worshipped, cooked, and lived - is endlessly facinating to me. The characters really come to life and this - the first book in the series - sets the tone for the next three books.I almost envy those of you who have not yet read them - you're in for a special treat!"},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"Never I have read a book which brought out such strong feelings of emotion. A tale of humanity, love, hatred, jealously and conflict. Whilst reading this book I lived and breathed the lives of the earth's children. I smiled when Ayla became accepted by the Clan, laughed at the thought of the children tugging at Brun's beard, felt awe and love for Creb's wisdom and compassion and cried at Iza's last words of love to Ayla. Words fail to describe a book which I'm sure will be remembered as a classic of our time. Better than any history lesson could ever hope to achieve this tale of humanity brought our heritage to life. Please MS Auel put your readers at rest and bring on the fifth book."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"The story of Ayla and her adoption by a tribe of proto-humans is a compelling one. One wonders, while reading this book, if events such as this might have happened once long ago, and bones found of a young boy by archaeologists which were half human and half Neanderthal seem to suggest it did happen. And in this tale, too, one can see the possibilities of how the other proto-human species might have been different from homo-sapiens, and this is a good look at how a culture might have developed that would make it difficult for such a species to survive the coming cataclysms of earth. While Ayla is an exaggerated figure, more of an archetype of what the newer human race represented against the older Neanderthal, I did find her likeable.However, while I did find the story itself compelling, at many times the writing got in the way. This book would have been well served by a copy-editor who could have clarified sentences and cleaned up grammar and punctuation. The constant activity of my \`mental editor' as I read through sentences and mentally re-phrased them, or placed correct punctuation where it should have been, or took it from where it obscured the words made it difficult to really get into the book. I think this story would have seemed so much better if it hadn't been for the cumbersome nature of running into so many errors through the text.Perhaps in later editions this has been corrected; the copy I read was an older one.The ending left me a bit cold. While I was satisfied at some developments, it didn't seem like a true ending. Yes, I understand that this is a trilogy, but this book doesn't stand alone, and without the book following it, I'm left with a sense of incompletion. I kept expecting/hoping that perhaps \`The Others' which are mentioned throughout the book might show up at some point, that she might see one of her own kind...but no, I suppose that's for the next book."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"This novel was gripping. What can I say... I couldn't put it down. And that is probably why I am sitting here at 12:30 at night wishing that I had the sequel. It has an unbelievable cast of characters; Ayla, the orphaned Homo sapien child with spirit, pride, and the unique ability to shed tears and laugh, Iza, the Neanderthal medicine woman who begged for the clan leader to take her in, Creb, the crippled old holy magician that agreed to provide for them both, Broud the heir, a neanderthal male chauvinistic pig who is driven slightly insane (at least that is my perception) by everything that Ayla does and represents, along with a host of other, equaly intriguing memorable characters too numerous to meantion.In the society these people live in Men are entirely dominent. In an almost animalistic structure, the lowliest male is socially higher then the highest female. This might infuriate a great deal of the women who read this book, except for the fact that Auel as author manages for the deeper meaning to come across. She shows that the Neanderthals are a dying race, so set in their ways, so psychologically unable to change that the dominence is no longer a Slight. It is the Way Things Are. But Ayla, as a child of the newer species, is not totally able to come to terms with this. No matter how obedient she is, there is something about her, her pride and confidence, that shows through. And this angers our antagonist Broud to no end. Because he knows, deep down, that she is more than he is.CLAN is full of struggle and strife and all that good stuff. Will the strange child be allowed to stay? Will Broud break her spirit? What will happen when Iza has her child? Will she have to leave the hearth of Creb? And if that happens who will take Ayla?This novel spans more than a decade and I as the reader felt that it did every moment justice. If it were a meal I would be content right now. But man, I have to get my hands on the next one. This one ended with such a cliff hanger! -Eli@"},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"THE CLAN OF THE CAVE BEAR is undeniably an enjoyable read, but it has its share of flaws: the plot, for one thing. Perhaps inventive in 1980, it now seems familiar. The problems Ayla runs into and their solutions are predictable. Nothing shocking ever seems to happen.However, the setting is an innovation. Anyone interested in prehistoric life will delight in the richly detailed, painstakingly researched descriptions of Neanderthal life. It is these accounts that separate CLAN from other stories of survival and belonging and constitue much of its appeal. However, details of prehistoric life cannot engage the reader forever. Auel seems obsessed with the most minute details of clan life, and page after page of description about herbal remedies, the process of toolmaking, strange fauna, etc. soon begin to read like essays: Auel seems to want to dump as much information as possible onto her readers. As a result, the actual plot is interspersed with long, dry, boring passages of description that have little significance to readers not interested in archaeology.Auel's narrative style is interesting. Instead of using POVs, she assumes an omnipresent narrative and relates CLAN in a fashion that reminded me of informal storytelling. The approach works surprisingly well, increasing the &quot;prehistoric feel&quot; of the book. However, Auel makes it impossible to become completely absorbed in the setting by scattering the book with anachronisms. Perhaps excusable in the narrative, the words stick out like sore thumbs when used by characters in dialogue. It's difficult to accept the Neanderthals as prehistoric men when they use words such as &quot;menstrual cycle&quot; and &quot;arthritis&quot;.Still, CLAN OF THE CAVE BEAR is a fun read. The characters are well-drawn. Ayla especially is sympathetic, likable, and a worthy protagonist. Her relations with the clan members are real and moving, and there are some genuinely emotional scenes.Anyway, CLAN makes a good afternoon's entertainment, although it didn't leave me with much of an impression. For anyone interested, know that although there is some resolution at the end of CLAN, Ayla's story is far from over: we are left hanging. If you're the sort that hates to be left in suspense, consider having a copy of the next book in hand."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"What a marvelous book. I loved the journey this novel took me on and the prehistoric setting was so beliveable.Jean M. Auel is a wonderful story teller and it's a colourful and wonderful world she's given us in this novel, setting it in the ice age.It was gripping, reading about Ayla's journey from a young child to adulthood and the trials she faces living with the Neanderthal tribe who found her.There is everything one could ask for in a novel, adventure, fun, danger, jealousy and love and romance.I especially liked the extensive research J.M.A. has done, and her detailed knowledge of plants and natural remedies used by the medicine woman and passed down to Ayla, was extremely fascinating.I have read the entire series and must say it was riveting.There are 5 books in all:1:The Clan of the Cave Bear2:The Valley of Horses3:The Mammoth Hunters4:The Plains of Passage5:The Shelters of Stone"},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"This book is an excellent choice if you want three things: a great heroine (in the form of Ayla), an epic adventure (this is the beginning of a long series), and lots of fascinating insight into the ways of prehistoric man and the Neanderthals. I had never read a book based in prehistory and I was pleasantly surprised. The author's careful description of the tribe's skills held my attention, and I truly enjoyed watching the human girl, Ayla, become a woman among a Neanderthal tribe. I recommend this to high school students and older."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"I first read this book when I was around eleven years old, couldn't put it down, and within four months I had read all four of them (Cave Bear, Valley of Horses, Mammoth Hunters and Plains of Passage). All four books are beautifully written and they create a very believeable ice age world. Don't be put off by the number of pages, all of those pages are needed and none of them are dull.While it's true that it's quite fanciful to think that one woman would have been the first person to do all the things that Ayla does (if you read the books, you will know what I mean), the series is, after all, a work of fiction. I think it's that fancifullness (is that a word?) that makes Ayla's story so enjoyable.Clan of the Cave Bear, by itself, is a good book, but I find the next books more interesting. If you read part of Cave Bear, and think at all that you'd like to skip to the next book, don't. I wouldn't advise trying to read any of the other books without having read the previous ones. There is so much information and... feeling, that would be lost if you didn't read the whole series, in order.So, if you're looking for a book that can take you away to life as it was thousands and thousands of years ago with main characters you can cheer for (and a bad guy that you'd like to see thrown off a cliff), you will probably like this series."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"This book is part of a very moving series about what ancient history could have been like for the cro-mags as they moved in on the neanderthals (cavemen). This book is very touching and is filled with descriptions that show evidence of her extensive research about what prehistoric Europe might have been like. It's also a good escapist story for bored people or college students like me to read in our spare time. Actually I'd recommend this to anybody whos willing to take the time to read it."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"I saw the movie and was not interested in reading the book. My sister gave it to me and promised it was a good book and that I would love it. She understated! I couldn't put it down. I immediately purchased the rest of the series. I read the entire series over the summer of 2000 and am going to read it again this year. I yearn for the fifth book, but I understand the author is very ill and I wish her well.Besides being an absorbing adventure, this story is painstakingly researched. Ms. Auel's knowledge of healing herbs and plants is impressive. It was also interesting to learn how primitive people probably foraged for food and what kinds of things they may have eaten (water lily tubers, for example) I was thoroughly entertained and got an education at the same time. My favorite kind of read."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"I'm sure everyone already knows the plot, so I'll skip that. this thoroughly - researched, impossible - to - resist book is my favorite book ever - and, since I read over half an hour every day, that definitely is saying a lot. One of those books that, very so often, you feel the urge to read it over and over again until you're sick of it (at least for now!) I love and admire the characters, especially (of course) Ayla. The rest of the series goes just the tiniest bit downhill, but they are still some of the best books ever. Other great authors, if you have some time on your hands, are Linda Schuler,Lynn McKee, Kage Baker, Marrion Bradley, Michael Crichton, Tamora pierce...ah, forget it. there are too many to list."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"TCotCB was fantastic. I fell in love with Ayla, and the rich descriptions of the surroundings and life. Jean M Auel did a wonderful job of researching the lives of the Cro Magnan man, and about herb lore. But, more than that, JMA weaves a beautiful and captivating story of a little girl who tries so hard to fit in.... I laughed with her triumphs, and still cry with her tragedies everytime I read it."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"This book will truly go down as one of the most epic novels of the past 20 years. This book takes you away to another time and place and will leave you fascinated with human history, with the Neanderthals, and with the history of civilization. This book is deeply researched and fascinating. Yes, this book, as with its 3 sequels, has depictions of sex and emotions that hard-core scientific types may find unfitting in a description of prehistoric man. But Auel brings a human light to a people who for most of us, are nothing more than bones scientists dig up. I really think that this book is a must read. I read it first as a teenager when it first came out and 9 years later, I am waiting for the fifth (and final?) installment in the series, and this book is a captivating must-read. Even now after having read it half a dozen times, it has an almost mystical quality to it, and it will transport the reader to a different world."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"What can I say ! When my boyfriend recommended this series to me (he's read it twice), I was indifferent. I'd seen the film years before &amp; it was o.k, but the book really was something else ! I couldn't put it down until I'd finished it &amp; then I'd run straight out to buy the next one. The characters &amp; descriptions are so real you feel like you're reading a history book written by someone who was there. Ayla the main character is what most women would like to be, intelligent,gutsy,&amp; completely captivating ! Throughout the book you can't wait for her to grow up because you know she is going to be a woman like no other on earth. This book is: informative, romantic, angering, gut-wrenching, &amp; will leave you wanting more ,more, more ! And guys, this isn't just a book for the girls, I've seen far more men reading this than anyone. Believe me, I've had people run up to me in cafes, on the beach, on buses, everywhere, &amp; all over the world to tell me that they also have read the book &amp; how brilliant it is. This book gives you an insight into how the world really was &amp; how life could have developed into what we are today. Please read this book or you'll regret it when everyone else has !"},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"I can't say enough about this book. It is about two prehistoric stages of man (one is on its way out, one is on its way in). The lesser developed man (\\"the clan\\") finds a little girl from the more modern man whose parents have been killed in an earthquake. They take her into the clan and raise her as their own.The story itself is interesting and urges you to read on. But it's the research that's fabulous. I learned more about prehistoric times reading this entertaining work of fiction than I did studying it in high school and college. This is an excellent example of making good use of research.I highly recommend this book to prehistoric history buffs and anyone who simply loves to read good fiction."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"My sister got me hooked on Auel's series over 10 years ago and I've read all 4 of the current novels at least 3 times/each. I am impatiently awaiting what I believe may be Auel's best book ever, as Ayla returns with Jondalar to his home in what is now present day France. I look forward to seeing how Auel will again weave prehistoric facts into her beautiful fictional story. If you're not convinced that you'd like a story of prehistory, let me persuade you to give The Clan of the Cave Bear a try. I too was skeptical of liking this type of book, but after 3 chapters, I was hooked. Auel's literary greatness is, I believe, her ability to make us believe wholeheartedly that what the characters did in these books not only COULD have happened, but DID happen."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"this book, and the rest of the series, came to me in a collection from a friend. i picked it up for some summer reading and read a book every several days until the end of the series. difficult to put down. i got very absorbed in the story. enjoyed the elements that were clearly related to joseph campbell's work. really enjoyed the sex parts too! reading about life lived that directly, that plainly, helped me to see how good i have it here in the u.s. if they didn't find food they didn't eat. i go to the suburban grocery store up the street and can choose from 13 kinds of apples (out of season!) and reject them for the slightest blemish. one night, during the third book or so, returning home late, my headlights caught five deer in the front yard. my first thought was--FOOD! WE'LL EAT! (and i'm not even a hunter). the later books seemed to suffer a little. perhaps victims of success? ............ though i'd buy the next one in a second! hats off to ms. auel."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"The first 6 chapters of the book may seem boring to the average reader, but the story gets more appealing to the point you can't put the book down, mostly around the 10th chapter. Though the character names may be confusing and hard to remember, the book does have a name and description for each character either in the front or back of the book. As the story moves through the chapters, you will find yourself more familiar with the characters and who they are. I found the detailed descriptions of how the characters lived with Mother Nature fascinating! The reader will begin to appreciate modern life and fantasize what it must have been like living in the great outdoors. In addition, Jean Auel is not shy about detailing mating rituals and such. All her books will fascinate the history hater as they move through time, teaching the reader the ways of the people while following a love story written with great fire and passion. Steep yourself a cup of home made tea - mix some sprigs of anise, cinnamon, cloves, allspice, fruit peel grinds, and honey and kick back and read her well written visually detailed books."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"WHEN WILL #5 COME OUT? THERE HAS TO BE A #5. I WILL READ EVERY BOOK YOU WRITE IF THEY ARE LIKE THE &quot;AYLA&quot; JOURNEY."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"I had heard so much about the Clan of the Cave Bear, and Valley of Horses, they had been on my 'read someday' list. Recently I picked these two up cheap at a library sale and, despite the daunting length, was all set to escape into a well-researched, engaging tale of the early days of humankind. I did not get very far. The first book began with an utterly absurd premise, that the 5-year old girl loses her mother because the little brush shelter of theirs, in which the mother is residing, is swallowed up when a great earthquake shakes the surroundings and finally opens up the ground beneath it into a huge crevice, which then closes up behind it.That's right. There are so many believable ways for a stone-age child to lose her mother: Mom could be killed by any of countless large predatory animals, the impetuous girl could have fallen into a river which she was warned to keep away from, a flash flood, etc. And at the first sign of an earthquake, why did the mother not race out of the tiny hut in search of her child?I almost stopped here, but decided to continue. In another page or two I learn the small child has no idea how to find food in her world, and in danger of starving. (Did Mom go out hunter-gathering while the child stayed in the hut watching cartoons?) In a dangerous prehistoric world, outnumbered by big, hungry predators, most likely the mother would not have let her only child out of her sight, and the presumably bright child would have surely picked up some useful information over the years about what is edible. Every mammal on the planet teaches its babies what to eat and how to find or catch it. Children in aboriginal cultures are already caring for their smallest siblings at the age of this helpless young protagonist.With so many glaring plot holes in the first few pages, I could see no reason to commit a massive portion of my valuable time to this writer's work. It is obviously enjoyed by many readers but it completely lost me by page 4 or so."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"lets see, young blue eyed, pretty and in every way superior CroMagnon Ayla manages to transcend her brutish, Neanderthal counterparts and invent fire, discover the cause of pregnancy, invent the wheel, and all with some magical process of thought that the author just bestows upon her.Silly, fatuous and and a literay hash."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"This book came within a week of when I ordered it.

Smart girl looks for smart bloke, tries to overcome the nogoodniks, and keep everything going along and not collapsing. Has a few bright ideas for stuff along the way."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"This is my favorite book of all time.Lots of reviewers are complaining about the scientific accuracy of the novel. Hello! The book was written in 1984! That was 20 years ago! Science changes every day.Besides, watching a national geographic special on neanderthals doesn't may you an expert on human evolution. So unless, you're a physical anthropologist or a microbiologist. Please be quiet.The Earth Children's series has impacted my life in two ways: It's why I minored in lingustic anthropology in college (I actually wrote a paper on the Neanderthal language) and why I got a dog (Wolf is the best).Ayla is amazing, I suppose a little too amazing at times, but she is really a symbol of major milestones in human evolution and culture (domestication of animals, usefulness of flint in starting a fire, the idea that sex makes babies, and an explanation for the extinction of Neanderthals (they intermated with modern Homo sapiens).My favorite Earth Children's in order...1)Clan of the Cave Bear2) The Mammoth Hunters3)Shelters of Stone4) Plains of Passage5) Valley of Horses (just get through this, it's worth it)"},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"This book is a work of art ! As the main character in this story (Ayla) grows you feel you are with her, discovering and growing as she does. You feel the hopelessness of what her life seems to be becoming, and the strength in her as her iron will pulls her though. Her strength is remarkable and her discoveries a bit unbelievable but all worth the while. I have read this entire series, over and over again. I recommend this book to anyone who wishes to escape their reality, and try to see what life could have been like so many hundreds of years ago."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"I think my title says enough."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"Thats right, you must be prepared to spend the next month reading this book and the other 3 sequels. If you have any doubts whatsoever about reading this book, I recommend that you squash them right now.The aim of a book is to involve yourself with the characters, and this certainly happens. The enduring story of a young girl, seperated from her people, and forced to live in a society that doesn't accept you, really appeals to many people. (Face it, everyone has experienced unwantedness before). The main characters likeable, and the &quot;bad guys&quot; are hateable. The quality of writing makes the even scenery and small details interesting, for a book with a lot of archeological research. Jean M Auel creates aa new/old world that many of us never begin to think about, but this book creates a glimpse into our past. Utterley believeble and intensly realistic make &quot;The Clan of The Cave Bear&quot; is easily read for such a long book, and I guaruntee not a disapointment. Can't wait till the 5th installment of the series comes out."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"I have just read the Dutch translation of this book and the three next ones. They are all very good written, I couldn't stop reading, and because of my busy job I unfortunately couldn't read them as fast as I could, so it took me a month.Normally, I don't like romantic books. But these are of a very different class, and I consider myself to be very cynical (hey, I even write this review).What impresses me are not just one major point, but a lot of things. The depth of the characters, the broad description of the surroundings and the way of life, the humour, the change of pace in the storylines, the good continuity and internal consistency, the many details and still an eye for the whole story.In thick books and series of books, the details often are not consistent with the previous chapters and books. I couldn't find such inconsistencies here.The stories are written in such a way, that I often felt like Ayla. I could see the people, the nature, the animals, in my imagination. It's nice to go further than the books go, like imagining what happened to any survivors of the earthquake, or how Durc is developing into manhood, or how Broud might be dethroned as leader of the clan.The only minor point I can think of is the description of the sexual intercourse, which happens a lot over the four books. Some older women I know personally made me clear that it is very special to have it described as this in good books as these.It is indeed quite emancipatory for women, to read about a girl that dares to do things that are not commonly accepted. When she grows up, she becomes a self-aware woman, almost a hero like Odysseus, inventive, brave, strong, beautiful, smart and with a pleasant character. Who wouldn't like to be like her?The four books also give me a good feeling about the era in which the stories happen. It almost makes me understand the human race better, it almost makes me a bit less cynical (how is it possible that the human race survived after all the things it went through, after all the atrocities and stupidities...).All in all, I think Jean Auel wrote four fantastic books and I can't wait for her to finish the fifth. And now I know there is a movie about Ayla, I want to see that as well."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"This is a feminist parable with the Neaderthals (almost all the Neanderthal characters are men) representing the male oppressors of the intellectually and emotionally more evolved female represented by the Cro-Magnon, Ayla. I giggled every time one of the Neaderthal characters &quot;made the sign&quot; indicating the command for sexual favors, picturing the short rhythmic fist pumping motion sometimes used by modern males to allude to intercourse. Two stars - one for the sometimes interesting anthropological details - one for the laughs."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"I really wanted to like this book. After a good friend suggested it I decided to give it a go. Big mistake. This book put me to sleep, literally. The description of the land and plant life goes on forever. Takes way to long to get to the plot and it's just not worth the time."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"I like historical novels but this one was hard for me to get in to. Maybe just need to set it down and try again in the future. My mother raved about it, which is why I bought it!"},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"In preparation for the final book in the series coming out, I decided I would reread the books of the series again. I've read them many times and they continue to be one of my favorite collections of books that I've read. Of course its not the most perfect series ever written, but I find it so entertaining that I am able to forgive a lot of its problems.Ayla is a young girl who has been left alone in the world after a horrible earthquake steals her family for her. She sets off alone at the tender age of five and after being attacked by a cave lion and collapsing, she is found by a tribe of Neanderthals who are searching for a new cave after their previous one collapsed in the earthquake. At first they aim to leave her behind, but the clan's medicine woman Iza finds some tenderness for the child and begs to bring her with them. Brun the clan leader decides that she may but feels (and will continue later) like he doesn't know if he has made the right choice or not. Since Ayla is of the \\"Others\\" she doesn't have concept of the Clan's language (which is mostly done through sign) and with Creb's (the clan's Mog-ur spiritual leader) help, Iza teaches her not on the language but how to be a proper clan woman as well. Ayla grows quickly and learns at the same pace and Iza decides that she will be a medicine woman as well and begins to teach her the art. In secret though, Ayla begins learning another skill that could put her in danger with the clan. She learns to hunt with a sling. Such things are forbidden to woman and clan woman would never think to hunt, nor to disobey or do anything that isn't of a domestic art, but Ayla is different and cannot abide by such restrictions. Her secret skills are not the only danger to her however; Broud, the proud son of Brun hates Ayla with a passion and will stop at nothing to make her miserable because of his jealousy. Between him and several other trying instances while she lives with the Clan, Ayla has yet to discover if she is truly in her proper place in the world.The characters in this series are developed really well and every one is important to the story. They all evoke some emotion as well. For example, I can't stand Broud, respect Brun, have affection for Creb and feel that Iza is a motherly figure. Ayla, is a good mix of character and has actions and emotions that are both good and bad and keep her seeming real (this will change in other books of the series but for this one, is done well).The writing is very descriptive but doesn't slow the story down. There is some violence and rape scenes and if this bothers you, you should probably not read this book. I'm sure there are discrepancies with some historical, botanical, etc. facts within this book, but as I don't know much about any of those subjects, it didn't make a difference in the enjoyment of the book for me.Overall I highly recommend the series and even the worse of the books is still entertaining. This edition, Clan of the Cave Bear, especially is one of the better books of the series and a good read even if you don't plan on reading the rest.Clan of the Cave BearCopyright 1980468 pagesReview by M.

I loved the story, I loved the characters and I definitely love that it's a series. I can't wait to see the movie even though I have heard it is not so spectacular.

You can connect with this story in so many ways which says so much about the author's writing capabilities considering the time this story is set in. There are so many instances in these novels where you read something and just have to sit back and go \\"wow\\", and sometimes read it again. The author has such a way about explaining some of the things that we just take for granted in a way that will captivate you and leave you hungry for more!"},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"This book was delivered on time and in the condition advertised.

I felt for every single one of the characters -- even those who were less than desirable. No one character was truly evil nor was any one character truly good. Each developed and matured realistically as to their own personal phyche. By the time I turned the last page page I felt as if these characters had really lived and breathed. I must also say that the ending haunted me longer than any other book I have read. The same can not be said for the next couple of books. The second started off pretty well but then degraded itself by becoming nothing more than a romance novel. The other two quickly followed suite. Other than using them as a sex manual, I can see little value in them.

What she did not tell me was how sensitively written the series was and how visually exciting the words were in the mind. I could not put them down and, in fact, became a bit like Ayla, my bedroom akin to her cave, her isolation a parallel to my own not seeing anyone or doing anything except finishing all four books in a single bound of a few weeks!

It was Jean's first book, also the first in a great series of four books and lastly the first of its class in the now popular prehistory genre. The four novels in the series are &quot;Clan of the cave bear&quot;, &quot;Valley of the Horses&quot;, &quot;The Mammoth Hunters&quot; and &quot;The Plains of Passage&quot;.Set in the transitional time between Neanderthal and Cromagnon, we are told a tale like Kipling's, &quot;Jungle Book&quot;. Only Mowgly is a little girl named Ayla and she is raised by Neanderthals rather than wolves. But this is no children's story.Ayla is an outcast in her adopted tribe and struggles against ostracism and physical assaults. Any thing she can do better than her tribe is frowned on as not appropriate and she struggles to do the things that the rest of them take for granted. Some of these include the obvious displays of great strength but also the clever supposition on the authors part, that Neanderthals memories are passed down through the generations by inherited genetic traits. How can little Ayla ever achieve that.It all comes to a head in the first novel when Ayla has a malformed baby. Not malformed in fact, just a half cast. I wont go into any more detail. Suffice to say that I was hanging out for each new novel in the series and then gobbled each in virtually a single sitting when they arrived."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"I had the misfortune to read the other three books of the series before reading clan of the cave bear but that did not detract from the joy of reading this book.Ayla's story is just that,although the author has written about our ancestors one should not take it as a trueism.Ayla's constant fight for survival and her success inspite of Broud's dislike for her,simply because she is diffrent from him helps push the story along.Their battle of their will continues even after her brutily beats and rapes her.Her decision to leave the clan inserch of her own is out of selfpreservation,leaving her son is hard but so necessary.The book is highly intresting and this authors eye for detail is truly awsom.Keep on Mz Auel.There is a rumor that there is another book in the works.Hurry PLEASE."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"when oh when will jean auel write the next book, we asnxiously await the final chapter"},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"This was an excellent book, probably my favorite of the first four. I read it when I was 11 years old, and have re-read it so many times the book is practically destroyed. However, this book, while I as a 6th grader enjoyed it, is not for the immature child. Think carefully before you tell anyone about the series, especially your child, because it contains a few explicit scenes, which increase as the books go on. Another word of advice- if you don't like a lot of details in a book, don't read this, because the author details surroundings and histories frequently. However, I thought the details were fascinating. Jean Auel is a wonderful writer, and I eagerly await the fifth book."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"In The Clan of the Cave Bear, by Jean M. Auel, I was captivated by the spirit and life of the Clan. At the start of the novel, these people seem almost like savages. By the end I was in tears when Alla lost a loved one. The struggles and accomplishments Alla, the main character, experienced, seemed to be my very own. The story begins with an earthquake that tears a little girl away from the only family and home that she knows. Wandering lost in the wilderness, Alla is chosen by the great cave lion to bear his totum marks for the rest of her life. As the child lay dying of starvation and infection from the giant gashes which the huge cat tore into her leg, Alla passes out along side of a path. The Clan, a group of neandrathal cave people, is searching for a new cave at the time, stumble across Alla's broken body. Isa, the Clan's medicine woman, lifts the child up and decideds to raise her as her own. As the story unfolds, we see the human child, who not only looks different than the people of the clan, but by nature, acts and thinks differently, growing up and trying hard to understand how she can possibly be normal when she looks, feels, and seems so totally different than the only people she can ever remember. This is an exciting, interesting and inviting story that I would recommend to anyone. The book is not really suitable for children under age 14, due to some topics of natural human life that cannot be avoided. However, I don't think that it would be considered offensive to anyone. I personally bought the audio book. This makes it possible to do other things while listening to the story, such as sewing, drawing, computer, etc. IT'S A GREAT BOOK! BUY IT OR BORROW IT RIGHT NOW!"},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"The saga of Ayla is beautiful to follow. A riveting book that makes us look forward to the other series. It is full of heart and compassion"},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"No, really. This book falls under the category of being too well-researched. It reads like an odd combination of margin-scrawled Mary Sue and a Geology textbook. Right in the middle of potentially deep plot twists we are assaulted with a treatise on plants (some of which are not native to Europe, though for all her research the author hasn't got that figured out yet) minerals (pyrite ahoy!) and all sorts of boring details that could have easily been transformed into the main character's observations of her world in a much more subtle and readable way. As they are, it's merely distracting, and pulls attention away from character believability.I can see why this book is so popular, and why the series simply will not die. However, it seems that all the issues that happen in the book (A struggle for a woman who wants to achieve social equality, birth/death/euthanasia of deformed children, the concept of insecure men trying to justify their manhood by raping women, being rejected as an outsider from society, etc) are, to be fair, issues that do, in some ways, transcend all times and places. However, Auel seems to be trying to make a comment on our own society through this struggle in her books by making the Neanderthal men the scapegoats for everything that is wrong in the world.On top of all that, her main character, Ayla, is purposefully set apart to completely walk on water. She sings (wow!) cries (egads!) discovers reproduction, weaves baskets, makes knives, hunts, gathers, invents gloves, wrangles wild wildebeests with her BARE HANDS, memorizes herbs, cooks, hunts, is given equality with the men for a short time, learns everything super fast... oh yes did I mention she hunts? And she doesn't ever, ever have any sort of opposition besides the uninspiring force of society against her, which doesn't work at all for a struggle because she's not from their society in the first place. There is no sense of bringing the people who raised her with her progression either, because the whole society is written to be so stupid and only serve the purpose of making her look better.And while we're on the subject of looking better, can we please, please, for once in the history of published Mary-Sues *not* have a character who is tall, athletic, blue-eyed and with \\"Wavy, thick blonde hair?\\" I don't care how perfect you are, you can't keep long hair (which of course Auel describes as \\"fine\\" earlier on in the book... go figure) free of tangles and healthy and shiney when you're more worried about hunting (oh yes did I mention she can hunt?) and providing for your family.Except they're not her family, and even though we keep getting told that there are others like Ayla, we never see it, and Auel makes many frustrating presumptions upon an ancient society that it is not her place to make. Yes, you can research axes and spears and whatever still remains, but you have no right to assume that these people were really that dumb, especially when the only reason that they are dumb is to, what else, make your own character look that much smarter.Bottom line: This book is written by a well-meaning, somewhat well-researched woman who either has issues with her own gender and status in society, thinks men are all stupid brutes, really really wants to be blonde and pretty and talented... Or all of the above. And when that is easy to see, the rest of the plot, however interesting, just falls flat."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"OK, where to start? The first time I read this I thought, \\"This is great!\\" But I was a shallow reader then, easily entertained, and so I missed many of the (wrong) facts presented here. Only recently I have begun doing my own research on the Ice Age/Neanderthals/Cro-Magnon, and find that Jean M. Auel has very much butchered what could have been a great story.First, the characteristics (hair, skin, eyes, etc) of people are determined by where they live, not only by genetics or evolution. The region where the Neanderthals lived had a cold climate, and so they probably had lighter skin, and fair hair (what Ayla has, except she's Cro-Magnon. Ever notice how the Neadnerthals are all basically tan, dark brunettes?) Besides that, look at animals for another example. A certain species of animal can have many different colors, and so can hominids. Who on earth is to say that the Neanderthals were all dark haired and eyed, whereas the Cro-Magnon were all (*CoughNazicough*) blond haired, blue eyed, and basically the Aryan stereotype?Also, as one reviewer so beautifully put it, Auel sets Ayla up to just walk on water. Indeed, many of the things Ayla \\"discovers\\" were, in all probabilites, known to the Neanderthal. In the time period where both the Neanderthals and Cro-Magnon lived, I don't think that the difference in intelligence was so completely staggering as Auel writes: Cro-Magnon are so smart and civilized, the Neanderthals are savages. Almost like Columbus' perception of the Native Americans. That aside, Auel then makes Ayla a genius, figuring out stuff that probably took many people many generations to solve. Yet it seemed as if she just came up with all the answers at once, which--even today--isn't how the human mind works.Honestly, if you ever want a good idea of pre-historic life during the Ice Age, either do some research, or if you're a fiction buff, rent the movie \\"Quest for Fire.\\" And I agree with the same reviewer who said Ayla was set to walk on water; it does seem as if Auel is using the Neanderthal men as scapegoats for everything that is wrong in our society. Almost like she's trying to make a feminist statement (which in itself isn't bad) but based way too much on conjecture.All said, this book is OK, good for an English book report (tear it to shreds, though!) or maybe for reading on a plane or in the car. Don't waste your time if you're looking for great lit, though, because this certainly isn't it."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"For years, various friends have suggested I might enjoy reading THE CLAN OF THE CAVE BEAR, and finally this summer I did. Auel's tale is speculative. Recent discoveries suggest it may contain some inaccuracies (the Black Sea may not have been salty as Auel suggests), however other findings support her ideas.Auel made good use of her knowledge of medicinal herbs (although some of plants she names are native to North America not Europe where the action takes place). Her use of the extant knowledge of the fossil record, as well as geological and climatic information is excellent. However, her allusions to the sexual practices of traditional people appears to draw heavily on the work of Margaret Mead whose research on the sex lives of adolescent Samoans has been challenged (humans may be too jealous to have ever practiced \\"free love\\").Auel's great gift to the reader is that she enables him to \\"see\\" life as it might have been lived by our ancestor(s) during the last Ice Age. Was it nasty, short and brutish as the 18th Century philosopher suggested, or was it one long sojourn in the wilderness where one could find all the food, medicine and other goods required to sustain a reasonably happy life?Imagine being able to see the vast array of stars that make up the Milky Way. There are only a few places left in the Western United States where one can see the stars without atmospheric pollution. How stupendous it must have been to sit on a hillside at night looking at the heavens when the only light came from the moon, the stars, and a campfire. Is it no wonder our ancestors worshiped the natural world?On the other hand, camping out all winter in a cave has it's downside. Depending on your location relative to the cave entrance you might be pretty damp and cold. But you could wrap yourself in warm furs and campfires would cheer you. Not knowing when the cold would end as food supplies dwindled would be frightening. Viewing a grazing herd of Aurochs or Mastodons must have been awesome. A first hand encounter with a cave lion would be terrifying.Auel doesn't mention the clan of the cave bear by name, but the reader senses they are Neanderthals, and that the \\"others\\" are what we call \`modern' humans. Auel's contrast between the traditional people who relied on memory for survival versus the new people who could think and reason and viewed the world as \\"cause and effect\\" is insightful and profound. But what if the world isn't really cause and effect. What if cause and effect are merely an explanatory principle converted into a religion of sorts. Those who believe in the metaphor may doomed to the Neanderthals' destiny - extinction."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"I loved this book...surprisingly well written.

She is left to wander aimlessly through an ice age harsh barren landscape without clothing or resources. She suffers terribly from starvation, exhaustion, and wounds sustained from a cave lion attack before being adopted by a Neanderthal clan when she was near death. The heroine Ayla is a survivor. She is strong and resourceful. She polishes her survival skills at a very young age and develops many positive characteristics. I was enthralled with her character and the hardships she had to endure. She is an inspirational figure and I thought about her often when writing 'Adoption Detective'. The long wait between sequels was agonizing. Read this book and you will be hooked on the entire Jean M.

I am listening to it now as I take my daily walks only because I bought the cassette tapes for practically nothing. I agree with all the criticism of Auel's writing. I have listened to many florid books after buying them on closeout and I know bad writing when I read or hear it. I have one main criticism of this book - and I don't think any other reviewer has mentioned it. The Cave Bear Clan is supposedly nearly subhuman and the members speak only in sign language. How then do they mentally form and then articulate conplex feelings and reasoning? At every turn some clan member is explaining with complicated twist and turns of reasoning why something is happening. And all of this is done with hand gestures! Amazing! People with this ability to think critically would soon understand the relationship between sex and pregnancy. They would see how counterproductive \\"clan ways\\" are. Ayla lives with the clan for six or seven years and yet no one dies of disease or accident. Ayla's amazing skills are credited with saving those lives that are threatened. Ayla seems to be the only person with any interest in cleanliness and with all of the duties assigned her in the book, she wouldn't have had time to keep her hair clean. I really think today that this is a ridiculous book but I understand the social context in which it was written. Truly good writing survives changes in social norms, but this book is truly dated today. I will finish listening, but I will continue to shake my head and make critical comments to the author out loud as I walk. Let's pat Auel on the back for her feminism and interest in anthropology. Then let's assign her to the vaults of history."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"Excellent Book. The whole Earth's Children series is fantastic. Such a good read you don't want to put it down...."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"After reading \\"The Land of Painted Caves: A Novel (Earth's Children),\\" the sixth and last book in Jean Auel's Earth's Children series, and happily catching glimpses of the more human side to her eventually Wonder Woman-esque protagonist, Ayla, I decided to re-explore the original offering, \\"The Clan of the Cave Bear,\\" to rediscover the roots of my initial fascination with the \\"Clan\\" universe. Even after thirty years, \\"Cave Bear\\" still maintains its high standing in my world of notable characterizations.When Auel first published this novel in 1980, she may have had an educated inkling based on her own extensive research of now known facts regarding modern man's DNA and its relationship to that of Neanderthals. In 2010, biologists, led by Svante Paabo of the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig, Germany announced that by comparing the Neanderthal genome with those of various present day humans, science can conclude that about 1 percent to 4 percent of the genome of non-Africans today is derived from Neanderthals. The implication this presence suggests infallibly that which archeology has not yet proven: that indeed interbreeding between modern humans (\\"the Others\\" as Auel calls those of Ayla's race) and Neanderthals (the \\"Clan\\" or the more derogatory \\"Flatheads\\" again part of Auel's nomenclature) had definitely taken place and that certain characteristics perhaps thought inferior were not in terms of ultimate evolutionary survival. Indeed, the entire premise for \\"The Clan of the Cave Bear\\" is given a scholarly nod with the advent of this newer information. Hats off to Auel and her prescient cleverness!But it is not only her scientific savvy that sets \\"Cave Bear\\" apart from her other stories featuring Ayla. Human drama, whether it be Neanderthal or Cro Magnon, when it is well done, begs for attention, acting as the hub of a wheel of storytelling that is repeated and enjoyed over and over again. Ayla's story is just that, a symphony of human emotions that hit the reader at the basest level, immediately engaging him/her and sustaining interest throughout the highs and lows of the protagonist's journey of inner and outer growth.From the start, Auel presents the five-year-old Ayla, wandering in the aftermath of an earthquake that has not only orphaned her but has set her adrift in a brutal environment sharp with tooth and fang of predators both two and four-legged. No reader can fail to empathize with her plight or her dogged bravery as she stumbles through the void of hunger, illness and an attack by a she-lion. Even when she is discovered unconscious by a pack of Neanderthals displaced from their home cave by the same earthquake, the immediate interplay between Isa, the medicine woman and her two brothers--Creb, the crippled albeit great shaman, and Brun, the Clan leader--evokes the strong desire to cheer when they take her in, fully realizing that this avant-garde decision will cause problems for the routine-minded tribe. As in all good stories, the reader senses the conflicts to come and awaits them with enthused anticipation.Auel crafts an entire Neanderthal societal structure which the reader discovers as Ayla becomes more aware--not only of her Cro-Magnon differences but, of her function as an individual within such a tightly dependent group where tradition, compliance and strict thinking within \\"the box\\" are tantamount to the group's identity. As one would expect from a novel written in the ERA era of the 70s, the idea of a lowly woman pitting herself against the brawn of hairy, bow-legged hunters does enable Ayla to flaunt her more highly evolved brain to great advantage. Nonetheless, in \\"Clan,\\" Auel hones and shapes Ayla's supremacy with a good storyteller's ease. Ayla may eventually become the stuff of legends, but in this novel, she struggles, grows and realizes her path with the same expert finesse as any other literary character worth his/her salt.All this results in a rather unique \\"coming-of-age\\" that includes remarkably unforgettable characters. Auel paints with a palette of primary emotions that depict all the humans whether they share the ancestral memories of the Clan or can quickly grasp the concept of numbers beyond the quantity of digits of one hand. Isa exhibits all the quintessential traits of the world's best mother; her concern and frustration with Ayla's differences and the repercussions of these on her future remind the reader that maternal love remains an undiluted absolute. Creb's fascination with Ayla and his awareness of what her intriguing attributes will eventually mean for the Clan never detracts from the fierce love and protection he feels for the girl. The mutual dislike shared by Ayla and Broud and the contest of wills that ensue between the two of them adds pungent spice to an already tasty stew of human interaction. The leader Brun contributes an intrepid nobility and honor that sets him high on a pedestal where few Cro-Magnons can reach. Indeed, all of the characters add something unique to the mix and despite their guttural names sweetly vocalize and pantomime a full range of all that life, good or bad, ultimately represents.Bottom line? Jean M. Auel's \\"The Clan of the Cave Bear\\" epitomizes modern storytelling at its best. Filled with a rainbow spectrum of human emotions, mindsets and sensibilities, \\"Cave Bear,\\" may depict the struggles of early mankind to survive and illustrate from an ersatz anthropological perspective various aspects of daily life, but succeeds, first and foremost, in its portrayal of the dynamics of family, adoptive and otherwise. Unlike some of Auel's other novels featuring lead character, Ayla, \\"Cave Bear\\" maintains a quiet dignity where small actions and nuanced impressions round out a story filled with the normal roller coaster of emotional development to perfection. In this novel, Ayla wins and loses without becoming the too-perfect super human of the other installments. Highly recommended, \\"The Clan of the Cave Bear\\" was well worth the time revisiting. Sandra Burr performs this audio-book with charm and a wonderfully nuanced voice that gives voice to the characters without being overdone.Diana Faillace Von Behren\\"reneofc\\""},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"I first purchased this book nearly 20 years ago, and each time I re-read it I find new and fascinating things within. There is no doubt that this is a meticulously researched and crafted novel, and we all learn to identify with the waif Ayla as she struggles to survive with her new family.However I must say that even though I have read and enjoyed all the books in the series so far (one just has to know how Ayla is faring!), this is by far THE strongest and best. The characterisations are strong, and the trials and tribulations of the clan believable.

Ayla, the protagonist, is basically your typical wonder child who realizes her destiny as a superior being after being raised by a more primitive tribe. Other characters are also fairly one-dimensional, and I cared about them only fitfully. That being said, Auel's description of the Neanderthal culture, social order, and proto-religion is fascinating from an anthropological standpoint. I was compelled to finish the book out of simple curiosity... and it was worth it. Long, descriptive passages are Auel's cup of tea, and she can be eloquent sometimes. I will probably read the rest of the series at some point--perhaps in a hotel lobby at 3 a.m., where I read much of Clan of the Cave Bear.

I have read others' reviews of this series, saying that starting with the second book, the series becomes nothing more than trashy romance novels. I DISAGREE 100%!! Jean Auel has a tremendous talent for writing human emotions. I believe that Ayla's and Jondalar's love for each other is fitting. So much that it makes me cry sometimes. I, as a teenager, understand what Ayla goes through to feel accepted; I feel her pain.

The plant lore in the books is amazing and fostered my interest in plants that led me to study wetland botany. In my personal opinion the later books contained too much sex and not enough substance.

The story starts off about 35,000 years ago, in ice age Europe with a young 5 year old cro magnon girl, named Ayla, who gets seperated from her family in a series of events that would change her life forever. Young, naked, starving, injured and completely defenseless, the helpless child began wandering until a migrating clan of ancient Neandertal people find the girl unconscies and on the brink of death.The clan, Clan of the Cave Bear, was made up of group of people that deeply worshipped Ursus, the spirit of the Cave Bear. Because of the strict customs and beliefs that made up the society they had lived in unchanged for nearly 100,000 years, they saw cro magnon man, people they referred to as &quot;the Others,&quot; as an outsider that didnt belong in their land.Because the clan was homeless themselves from a similar chain of events and she was deffinently different from themselves, they decide to write the young girl off and leave her to die. It wasnt until the clan medicine woman begged the clan leader to let her help the girl and raise her as her own daughter did luck start to turn for the helpless girl. Though she was very different mentally and physicaly, the whole clan came to accept the girl as one of their own, well nearly everone except the clan leaders son Broad. Though Ayla tries as hard as she can to fit in with the ways of the clan people and follow their firm ancient customs, from the moment he first saw her, Broad hated the young girl and had a lifelong desire to make her life miserable. Through all of the lifelong abuse and downfalls she had sustained, Ayla still found away to remain strong and cope with it all.Jean Auel found away to make this story so descriptive and detailed that it's almost as if it takes you all the way back to ice age Europe. Though very sexually disturbing in some parts and not a book I'd reccomend for any minors under the age of 14 or so, it has a well written plot and a turn of events that make it an incredible story. &quot;The Clan of the Cave Bear&quot; deffinently has my 2 thumbs up."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"This was such a good book!!! It is the first book I have ever read from this author, but i enjoyed it immensly. I fully intend to read the secod book of this series, The Valley Of The Horses, as soon as I can get my hands on it. Ayla is the most wonderful heroine. She overcomes every thing thrown in her path. She has such an independent sprit it is had for her to fit into the customs of the Clan. This causes many problems for her especilly with Broud, the leader of the clan's son. She is taken in by Iza and her sibling Creb, the clans Mog-ur, they protect her aganst Broud. However they cant protect her forever and when Broud becomes the leader of the clan he death curses her and the book ends with her leaving the clan, alone."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"This book is great. Once you read it you will want to read the following books. It is a book you can get a romance reader, sci-fi reader, history reader, etc. or for that hard to buy for person. It can get a bit long winded but is worth the reading. I have read and re-read all the books and am just waiting to read the next. The characters and the situations they and the earth go threw are very interesting. My 10 year old is starting to read the first book. He likes it so far. He is an avanced reader so maybe most children should be older but you never know. When you pick this book up you won't put it down."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"What impressed me most about this book was Ms. Auel's ability to create believable settings in a world so different from the one we live in. She must have written volumes of backstory, because unlike many novels (even novels set in familiar times) these characters feel like they inhabit a world that existed long before the novels first word, and will continue to exist long after its last."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"I read this in a matter of days after seeing the title mentioned in another book and remembering how popular it was when it came out. I was surprised how very much I enjoyed it- historical fiction and romance are usually not my thing at all. I immediately went out and got the rest of the series and ended up reading them all in about three weeks time. This one is the best, very addictive."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"One of the best books I've read. It brought tears to my eyes especially at the end. Strong and touching it made me really think. The book is excellent to the very last word."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"Clan of the Cave bear is a wonderful story which wraps the reader with every sentence. The length Auel went to authenticate her story are admirable and marvelous. I loved how she explored the spirit world and the intricate language used by the clan. The level of research that has gone into this book is amazing. Auel know so much about plants, animal, and herbal cures that might have been used at this time, that you forget she is writing about a pre-historic period which has left us with only bare-bones of what life must have been like. In Ayla, she creates a remarkable character who readers move with through struggle to overcome every trial (of which there are many). At times heartbreaking, often hopeful, this is a truly beautiful novel about the human condition."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"This was one of the first \\"pre-historic novels\\" that I ever read. Although hokey in places and with enough sex to make it appealing to the romance novel readers, it is a fascinating story with a fully-developed prehistoric world and culture. It was great fun to read. If you like Jean Auel, you will probably also like Kathleen O'Neal Gear and W. Michael Gear's books."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"The book and story are wonderful. I attempted to download to my iPod. The tracks, author name of book etc were all mis-identified. It was a nightmare. Clan of the Cave Bear (the first in the series took 7 hours to download and properly identify. Valley of the Horses took almost 11 hours. I'm sure people who ordered books by John Lescroart, Nora Roberts, and author Robb............will be highly surprised when they have Clan oft he cave bear identified as what they purchased. Mammoth Hunters took 8 hours yesterday to down load 5 1/2 tapes and properly identify them and then there was a 'fatal error' half way through disc 6. Although I love the series the recording was less than substandard. I won't bother with the last two in the series. They're too expensive to waste all these hours of 'fixing'!"},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"The Clan of the Cave Bear is in my opinion a very creative story. The story brings out the characters living in the Upper Paleolithic era. The amount of research Jean Auel had done to create this novel is very apparent. The heroine, Ayla is a jewel and I could help but root for her as she struggles to make her place in this male dominated society. A wonderful book and I highly recommend it to every reader"},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"Masterful! The way she describes a race that has been extinct for 30 000 years is astonishing! Their language, beliefs, knowledge and respect for the environment and how they react when a strange human enters their carefully structured society. This book required deep research and a vast imagination. I can't wait to dive in to the other books in the \\"Earths Children\\" series."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"who introduced me to this book. I was a naive child and this book began an incredible journey for me. Buy it, read it and then buy the rest. You'll love them... one drawback I've found would be the detailed explanations about the wildlife. I get a little lost in that but it doesn't detract from this wonderful series. This is book one."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"When I told a friend that I was reading Clan of the Cave Bear, he retorted,\\"What!....that is practically a Feminist Manifesto!Fortunately, his comments did not dissuade me from finishing this most important and ever life-changing book, which is the first in the Earth's Children Series.Written by Jean Marie Auel, Clan of the Cave Bear is one of the most touching and insightful books on human nature I have ever read.Jean Marie's effort is also an excellent exercise in anthological conjecture based on adequate research of known fossil remains and other anthropological research. She also explores the possible etiological origins of homeopathic and sympathetic magic with fiction that is touching, real, and tender.What fascinated me most about Jean Marie's book is how she elaborated on the theory that two human species, namely modern-anatomical humans and Neanderthals, may have coexisted side by side at one time prehistorically.In her writing, Jean Marie explores the nature of prejudice inferring its origins are natural and deeply rooted in our evolutionary past. She treats it however by demonstrating that through love & acceptance, common traits of humanity shared by many cultures, can help even those with great differences between them to overcome their prejudices and still find a way to get along and live together in harmony. Despite her treatise, the end of book one has an interesting twist."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"I purchased this copy of \\"The Clan of the Cave Bear\\" to help complete the set of \\"Earth's Children\\" books. My first reading of it was a library book. I loved the series and decided to own and reread them all. Jean Auel is amazing and I look forward to another book."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"The story of Ayla who grows up in prehistoric Europe during the ice age. She is adopted and struggles to fit in. Being different from the others by looks and mannerisms, as a woman she breaks a forbidden taboo. You can't put this book down once you start it."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"I can only imagine the research and imagination required to bring this book into being. Though I didn't agree with everything in Auel's world, I was fascinated with it all nonetheless. This is a page turner and brain burner as well. Now I have to scramble to get the next one after staying up to finish it!"},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"When my dad first gave me this book to read, it had the orignal cover, and was sort of deteriorating, and I had a feeling that I woudln't really like it. That was definitely NOT what happened! Ayla is a very inspirational character, and it's hard to put the book down once you start it. Unfortunetaly I was on vacation when I started it, so I had to stop reading, but I would have read it in a day! I quickly bought the other books in the series and read, each one better than the next, although the Clan of the Cave Bear was ultimatly the best one. I'd recommend the series to someone over the age of 13. It would be hard to follow if you were younger, and some parts are inappropriate, especially in the following books. This was one of my favorite books, and be warned: once you start, its so hard to stop!"},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"When I read the book, &quot;The Clan of the Cave Bear&quot;, I was stunned. I couldn't believe that someone could create a type of novel that touched me that much. Ayla is the most astounding character in the novel. She learns lessons in that book that should have taken more than a life time to understand. When she was found by the Clan she was near death. Iza healed her and treated her like her own, like part of her blood line. Ayls was not understood by most of the clan but she was loved by most of the clan and she was respected. When she took the sling that she found on the ground and learned how to use it took great courage. When she was cursed with death for using the sling to save a childs life I thought it was unfair, but it was the way of the clan. I couldn't believe that she could survived through the winter in that little cave she had found to practice her sling throwing. It took great knowledge and courage to survive on her own. Broud also affected Ayla in a way that she would never forget. The constant raping when she bacame a woman got her pregnant. When the baby was born she almost died giving birth to the part of the Clan and part of the Others. Everyone thought the child was retarted. The child was supposed to die. It was not allowed to live. But Ayla being so strong decided to fight the system. She was also allowed to hunt because of her strong will to become what her totem wanted her to be. I look forward to see if I will be as fearless and determined as Ayla."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"I STARTED TO READ CLAN OF THE CAVE BEAR AT THE END OF JUNE OF THIS YEAR. I WAS DONE WITH ALL FOUR OF THE BOOKS IN THE SERIES IN ONE MONTH!!! I COULDN'T PUT THEM DOWN. THEY SWEEP YOU UP INTO A UNFORGETABLE JOURNEY THAT YOU WILL THINK OF FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE. YOU WISH YOU WERE THERE RIGHT BESIDE AYLA. YOU LAUGH, YOU CRY, YOU DO IT ALL. I STRONGLY SUGGEST READING THE WHOLE SERIES, AND I WANT THE 5TH BOOK !!! I'M DYING FOR IT!!!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"A historical,adventuress,love story, all rolled into one could'nt put down book. Auel really did her homework, in this epic,(and all the other books in this series I've read all four of them.)Ayla is a heroine, whom you'd love to get to known she portrayed her so real, and a wonderful person.The book might be considered boring to others but, I feel the amount of research put in and gathering prehistoric iceage information wasn't easy for the author.I just wish she'd pull her socks up bit and hurry to finish the last book, I'm sure everyone is eager to know how it all ends."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"What can I say? Obviously most people who have read it think the same as I do, judging by the amount of reviews with 5 stars. I was 12 when I read it for the first time, even though my teacher told me it was too old for me. This book is not too old or too young for anyone. It is filled with the joy and pain of life, and shows that tribulations lead to better time later in life. I experianced Ayla's fear, delight, anger, sadness and despair at finding herself so differnt to those in her life. She is someone we can all relate to. Ayla is the only character who really developed much (and she is developed A LOT, esp. in later books)but she is the one we are all concerned with, and th others are forced to react to her changes. If you haven't read this book, read it. You will never regret it. P.S. You'll cry at the end"},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"I was reminded of how much I enjoyed this book when i read it years ago when the movie came on the Encore channel. It was really great to read. I thought the movie would be the same, but somehow, they did a really lousy job, and the movie reviews pointed out deficiencies which I hadn't really noticed when I read the book, such as: would a woman really get away with breaking all the clan's rules, would one person really invent everything, there has been a long movie convention of tall, blond Nordic people being the intelligent ones over the short, brunette, dirty lesser ones (nazism?). So when you see all these caveman movie conventions written down, you notice that Jean Auel has used them in her book, and it sort of takes away from the enjoyment of it. But I still remember it (the book) fondly, and recommend it. Now if they could remake the movie and do a better job, I'm sure it could be a big hit!"},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"35,000 B.C.A five-year-old Cro-Magnon girl loses her family in an earthquake and is found, near death, after an attack by a cave lion, by a group of Neanderthals. They are the Clan of the Cave Bear. They adopt her and, when she recovers, she tries to become one of the Clan. This series, chronicling the life of Ayla, as the Clan name her, unfolds as, firstly, she grows into adulthood in a society utterly different from the one into which she was born, and then secondly, as a fully mature and much sought after woman, she has to re-adapt to the culture to which she was almost certainly born but has blocked from her memory as a result of the tragedy, loss and trauma she endured as a child.This series really does has everything; joy, sorrrow, hope, despair, humor, imagination and a solid chunk of concrete facts. It is essentially a work of fiction, but Auel has done an incredible amount of research and, as a result, the work is replete with details on the way life could have been three hundred and fifty centuries ago. Although set in a prehistoric world of incredible beauty, sadly now lost to us for all time, it shows us that we are indistinguishable from our ancestors of the last Ice Age, how they had exactly the same basic needs, desires and ambitions that we have now.The characters, and the cultures, in this series are arguably the most highly developed you will find in any books, anywhere. With them we feel the highs and the lows, we share their hopes and their fears, and we cannot help needing to discover the outcome of every single decision they make, no matter how crucial or trivial they may appear, because all of them are vital to the story. We feel as though they are our best friends and that they confide in us as such as they think without speaking aloud to other people in the story. We get to know them as well as we know ourselves and plan what we would do in the same situations.Aside from the obvious entertainment and joy the entire series will provide for all who read it, or listen to it, it teaches us many lessons which are relevant to this very day, particularly about relationships with and respect for people, not only on personal and individual levels, but also on social levels, and within a community.On the surface it may appear to have been written as a throwaway paperback for the consumption of twentysomething women lying in the sun to top up their tan, (sadly it is often shelved as such in bookshops), but, be assured, it most definitely is not. It has been reprinted many times in many countries around the world, and in many foreign languages. This is a clear sign of its widespread and enduring quality and appeal, although I would suggest that it would definitely not be suitable for anybody under the age of twelve and even then I would recommend waiting to about sixteen to fully appreciate the meaning of the book and withstand the impact it will make. I believe that a lot of young people, both male and female, would benefit greatly by reading it, and taking it seriously. I first read the Clan of the Cave Bear when I was seventeen, when I bought a copy that my local library was selling off for a few pennies. I read through it in two or three sittings; I was so engrossed, the pages seemed to turn on their own. When finished I immediately loaned the other three books in the series. I now own all the books and all the cassettes, and in the last three years I must have read or heard each of the (to date) four books at least thirty times. Like millions of others, I eagerly await the fifth volume, and so will you.Thirty-five thousand years ago people just like Ayla, and everybody she encountered during her life and journeys, really were alive and, hopefully, in us they shall live on."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"A thoroughly original novel that takes sci-fi and fantasy genre into the stone age. Even if some of Ayla's super-woman exploits challenge the imagination, you will enjoy the speculation of religious and cultural life in Neanderthal society. Also the natural surroundings are captivating. DO NOT, however, read further in the series, unless you like trashy romance novels. They degenerate quickly, with the Valley of Horses ok at a 6 or so, then the Mammoth Hunters about a 2. At that point I wised up and stopped reading Ms. Auel's filth. Let me know when she finds originality again."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"Originally I did not want to read this for I was not interested in the beginning of mankind. Imagine my surprise, when I found myself unable to put this down, read through the night, called the office asking for annual leave, to continue reading until my eyes literally hurt too much to stay open. I even bought hardcovers for the next books finishing this story (valley of horses etc), somthing I NEVER do. I just could not wait. The insight of how we came to have everything normal to us these days, and the incredible style of her writing will make you treasure this series forever. Are you interesting in history, herbalism, magic, love, romance, sex and crime, animals...it's all here. It will also give you a little more strenght to fight for happiness. Ayla survives everything womanhood is threatend by from the beginning of time, and then some. If she can do it, all by herself, and only come out of it stronger and purer, so can the rest of us :)"},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"One of only four books I could ever give a ten rating to (read the rest of the series to find out the other three). If you are even slightly tempted to read this book, go ahead, for you are surely missing out on something by not reading it. Once you start, you won't be able to stop. While reading this you will be oblivious to what's going on around you, everything else will be put on hold while you are reading it. The story of Ayla that stretches into the other three books is remarkable. The characters are as real as fictionally possible. I read the four books every year or so, just to refresh the great memories and each time I read them I learn something new. My only advice to Jean Auel is to hurry up and write the remaining two novels she promised to write. It would surely be an amazing tragedy if she didn't write them."},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"I found The Clan of the Cave Bear to be a wonderfully written book. It is my personal favorite. The story is about a young girl whose is left alone, by none of her own doing, and must fend for herself. The author writes the book in an extremely moving and realistic way. Although the clan that finds the young girl is one of very few words, Auel portrays their emotions as if they were speaking right into you're own heart. The beginning is not at all slow or hard to get into. Instead, it starts out beautifully, by introducing the main character in a bubbling flow of descriptive words. You will not be able to put the book down once you start reading it, so I'd recommend grabbing a rather large box of tissues before you begin. The book may be a bit too challenging for somewhat younger readers, and has some sections that they probably ought not be reading. I really recommend this book, I loved it and I'm sure you will too"},{"Title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"I originally read this series when they firt came out over 30 years ago.

Innovation is in many ways an intangible quality that resists strict scientific definition. There are no pure techniques that have been identified that will translate from organization to organization with predictably positive results.However, there are certain characteristics that tend to create an environment more conducive to innovative results.In moving in that direction the editors arrange in the book in 4 primary sections:1. Leading the People Who Make Innovation Happen.2. Creating an Environment that Encourages Innovation.3. Changing How You Think About Leadership and Innovation.4. The Practise of Innovation.Every section presents several stand alone essays that come from very diverse backgrounds and yet tie into the primary theme for each section. Most present some insight or nuggets that can be gleaned and applicable in any organization.Therein lies the value to this compendium. This is not a book attempting to provide \\"the\\" answer, but rather one that skirts the perimeter and makes several forays in from which the reader can take the information and tie it into their own particulat situation.Overall, despite having been on the market for more than several years, this information is still current, relevant and will be helpful to most innovation leaders.5 stars.Bart Breen"},{"Title":"Leading for Innovation: And Organizing For Results","review":"Excellent compilation on Leadership attributes for innovation and is a collection of well written articles which made me think and connect to a real world phenomenon.

Arie De Geus says that innovation is one of the cause of short corporate life.2. The optimization of people is a better way to ensure long term survival of a company3. Innovation is a specific instrument of entrepreneurship. The entrepreneur brings in a certain degree of disequilibrium create opportunity to innovate. The casualty rate is high and the chance of survival and success low especially in areas of high visiblity.4. \\"The Innovator Dilemma\\" states the average survival of a new commercial business is 12.5 years.5. At least 45 of the largest corporations have survive the latest innovation destructive storm and survived successive technology waves.6. Innovation needs to be managed. Innovation is capable of being learned and practiced. Why are some companies better a adapting and thriving in the technology storm?7. Surviving companies are those who \\"see themselves as communities with a characteristic culture or ideology, which they combine with a pragmatic pursuit of profits.\\"8. A consensus exist that business is about profits and management has not choice but to maximize profits or shareholder value.9. Companies are working communities based on people. The company needs high learning and innovation desparately. Yet the company is structured like a 19th century industrial company based on assets. The employee receives some of the assets in exchange for talents and contributions.10. Putting profit before people did not work in the old economy nor in the new economy.11. Historically, land ownership was the source of wealth accumulation and more land ownership meant more wealth. The rise of corporation require capital equity to expand and grow. Land was exchanged for equity to be invested in corporation. Capital equity markets grew as corporations grew and wealth was viewed as ownership in the company. When production exceeds demand, savings occurs. Savings were making their way back into production. Adding capital to production processes great increased output. Capital became the critical factor to production.12. In 1999, banks,mutual funds, and pensions surpasses $10 trillion.13. Monies held by savings and institutions was $16 trillion14. Capital markets are a buyers market. Capital is no longer the scarce production factor.15. Going up are capital poor but brain rich companies. Talent is scarce.16. Managers need to make use of talent immediately and increase the learn capacity of the communities.17. Learning will be key to competitive survival.In short, we could see a shift where employees buy land as a wealth accumulator, work at the company to learn new skills, and stay because they like the community they work with."},{"Title":"Leading for Innovation: And Organizing For Results","review":"I enjoyed the format used to present the various segments by different authors.

Mrs Wilson talks about her son's problems making friends, and all the difficulties & obsticles he had to overcome. Some parts were very comical, and there's several things that I could relate to with my own child.

It is more like a journal than advice on how to deal with a child with SID. No reference is made as to what works and what doesn't. Mrs. Wilson uses this as a forum to slam her son's teachers and class mates. She even refers to a 2nd grader as the \\"son of Satan\\"- Nice and very Christian of you....It appears that Mrs. Wilson thinks she's doing something benefical for others but don't waste your money here.

And, she truly invented the modern American advice column.Yesterday I was reorganizing my study and I came across this book and I decided to read it again. What a great idea that was. In a way I'm thankful that most of the MSM has gone to hell in a handle basket, otherwise I never would have been reintroduced to this book.\\"The Best of Dear Abby\\" is just what it says it is, Ms. Van Buren's very best letters, over the course of 25++ years. In it she addresses infidelity, adulatory, honesty, love, education, betrayal, loyalty, priorities and of course S-E-X. Dear Abby is witty, clever and always on the mark. But more than that she's forthright and convincing.What did I learn from this book?Really, I learned many important life-long lessons. First, even though this book is over 27 years old it's still relatable and that's because Dear Abby is timeless. She was the voice of reason who didn't change her values or morals with the times (times may change, but not decent people.) Dear Abby also reaffirmed my belief in the goodness of others and in the celebration of talking out and discussing your problems.I also learned another very important lesson that Ms. Van Buren's book & advice column always resonated: DON'T ROCK THE BOAT! In other words, if it ain't broke don't fix it. And hold on to what you got because even if it isn't perfect it's better than many others! Also, if you have a secret that is better left untold then why open your mouth if it's only going to hurt others? Sometimes (not always, but sometimes) secrets (not lies) are best kept from the people who you're the closest to.

Yes, I love columns, and if you love columns, then this book is for you. But we are all different, and not everybody enjoys columns, so this book would not be for those people.This book was so entertaining, I cannot tell you how much I enjoyed it. It was mostly fun and entertaining, but there were some letters that were sad.

The end listing was whittled to 1000 idioms, provided in an easy to read listing with one real-world example per meaning. There are little cartoons sprinkled throughout.The listing is ranked by frequency, so it literally starts with the following:#1 est&aacute; bien or est&aacute; bueno - All right, good, fine, correct, OK. Example: &iexcl;Est&aacute; bien, haz lo que quieras!As you can tell, examples are everyday, using present and even an occasional imperfect subjunctive tense. For that reason, the text is best suited to second year or higher students of Spanish. Best studied daily in those in-between times: having coffee, waiting for something to download, whatever it is.I bought mine for $0.25 at a used book store maybe twenty years ago, but it continues to impress me as one of the better no-nonsense Spanish texts I own.

This is a remarkable tale of Obolensky's long and varied life - from student to soldier to City stockbroker to soldier again (this time as Lt. Col. in the US OSS in WWII) to hotel impresario in New York City. Married first to a Russian princess and later to Alice Astor, Obolensky was one of those rare 20th c. characters who &quot;knew everyone&quot;. Yet he comes across in print as humble and self-deprecating. He was a leading representative of a civilization that was completely swept away by the 1917 Revolution. This is a good read; it is a pity it is not in print at present."},{"Title":"One Man in His Time: The Memoirs of Serge Obolensky","review":"Prince Serge Obolensky was born to the Russian aristocracy in 1890 in Tsarskoye Selo as a member of a family that had wide connections in both St Petersburg society and on the land. A scandal with his parents when he was a child lead to him being bought up with the anticipation that he would be running his family's farms when he got older. The first world war and the Russian revolution which followed destroyed that plan.This is a very interesting autobiography. Serge moved in the highest circles in Europe and knew everyone who was everybody, and especially in England also moved among royal circles for his entertainment. This book is a picture of vanishing worlds, that of Russian before the revolution, the end of the Edwardian era in England and the grand parties of the inter-war period in Europe when everyone celebrated being alive and surviving hell on earth.However, Serge's story does not stop there. He travelled to Australia and his second marriage bought him into New York high society when he married a daughter of the Astor family and when the second world war came he had a part to play in the American military. This book has next to no memoirs of the Romanovs as Serge was not an intimate of the last court of Russia, but there are surprising number of familiar names that crop up in the book, and for periods of time when he was down on his luck he lived with people like Felix Youssupov and was married to the daughter of Tsar Alexander II at one point. This book gives a good feeling for the times Serge lived in - ones he admits will never been seen again for their opulence and free spending and I'm glad I picked up this book to get a window into these lost worlds."},{"Title":"Mas Que Humano/More Than Human (Spanish Edition)","review":"Por favor, no te importa mi espa&ntilde;ol pobre, pero en serio no soy hispanohablante.

The scope of companies covered is vast, and the reviews are extensive and well written. The only down side is fair values, current rankings are a few months out of date, because publishing is not instantaneous.

However, Larsson's book left many things unsaid. His analysis is too anecdotal, and if I were a anti free-trader (which I am not), then I could by the same token come out and give a multitude of horror stories that are seem to be the result of free trade.Those of you who wish to buy a comprehensive defense of free trade, this book is not for you. This book is rather a good source of stories and vignettes that would be helpful in a bar argument with the big hairy white guy next to you. Instead, I suggest that you pick up Against the Dead Hand by Brink Lindsey; it is much more comprehensive and gives a concise and accurate history of the struggle to &quot;race to the top.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Race to the Top: The Real Story of Globalization","review":"Thomas Larsson's Race To The Top tells the story of globalization and its effects upon individual liberties and personal lives around the world.

An excellent account of how world changes are influenced."},{"Title":"The Race to the Top: The Real Story of Globalization","review":"The book is a good read, however, there is too much focus and evidence on Asian countries. This may be due to the author's obvious familiarity with the region. However, this renders the evidence for his case rather skewed and less colourful. Also, the book gets off the track occasionally and loses its touch with the argument for globalization. Frankly, I am not sure whether I liked the book overall or not as I have a feeling that the arguments could have been put forward in less space. I wish it was written in a more succinct way."},{"Title":"The Race to the Top: The Real Story of Globalization","review":"&quot;Tomas Larsson has produced one of the best cases yet for globalization and against protectionist measures, whether they come from Latin American tariffs or U.S. anti-dumping measures.&quot;- Joachim Bamrud, Latin Business Chronicle"},{"Title":"The Race to the Top: The Real Story of Globalization","review":"\\"Before one can cry Big Mac, Larsson humbles the critic of globalization into silence. Larsson is William Blake's \\"Mental Traveler,\\" taking the reader through \\"a land of men and women\\": the slums of Rocinha in Rio where police are more dangerous than gangsters; a Bosnian mother supporting her blind husband and mentally retarded daughter on sweater knitting. Put down your placard and have a veggie burger, this guy's been there.\\"- Zachary Wales, Business Correspondent, United Press International"},{"Title":"The Race to the Top: The Real Story of Globalization","review":"I had to read this book for a Business course. Larsson meanders through the chapters, dropping and picking up points like a stream-of-concience dictation. While his Pro-globalization points are good, he disregards the arguments against globalization as if they are irrelevant. The point of the book could be made in about half the pages, especially if Larsson would leave politial bashing out.If you want to explore the issues of globalization to make your own decision on whether you agree with it or not, choose something else, or supplement this book heavily. It's a little boring, but may be useful once you have the background on globalization.If you have a background in business, don't waste your time with this book. The arguments are based almost soley on Macro and Microeconomics 101 priciples.If you are looking for fuel to support your Free-Trade fire, this book will provide you with many supportive case studies.

Dave's mother was an extremely, deeply disturbed woman."},{"Title":"A Child Called \\"It\\" and The Lost Boy - One Child's Courage to Survive","review":"The author of this book is Dave Pelzer; it was published in September 1995 by Health Communications Incorporated.In this book the main character is David. The book is based on the horrible things that he has to go through. His mother Catherine also plays a big part in the book because she is the one who is the main cause of his torturing. And other characters who are sometimes mentioned in this book are David's brothers Stan, Ron, Kevin and Russel.In this book Dave talks about the struggles that he had to go through when he was a younger boy. His mom tortured him: she would make him do all the cleaning around the house, she wouldn't feed him and she would abuse him. When teachers or nurses asked him what had happened he always came up with excuses for the things his mother did to him.I had given this book 4 and a half stars because I think this is one of the best books that I have read. It made me keep turning the pages and wanting to read more. The book never really got boring and it stayed very interesting.I think that this book is appropriate for about ages 13 and up because there are some pretty graphic things in the book that younger kids I think shouldn't really read about. And also it has swear words in it, so that's also not good for younger kids. But at the age of 13, I think that they will more understand what is going on in the book, and I don't think there is really a maximum age for people to read this.Senior English Student 2011"},{"Title":"A Child Called \\"It\\" and The Lost Boy - One Child's Courage to Survive","review":"This book is in perfect condition, which I didn't expect with the price being as low as it was. Order and shipment was fast, I received it about a week after I placed the order. I'm quite pleased with this product, and highly recommend it. I like the fact that it has two of Pelter's books combined into one. Thank you so much.As far as the book itself goes, it's a must read for everyone. Denying that child abuse exists is the biggest reason why many are still abused to this day. Knowledge is power, and so I believe that one should educate themselves, and if that means reading about this man's journey, then so be it. I have read the first installment, but haven't gotten any further than that. Yes, it is a heartbreaking story, but we cannot forget that this happened and continues to happen to our children every day. I think for the strength it took for him to write this book, one should at least take the time to read it. You may cry, but at least you will have gained some insight into the life of someone who has been through much more than he should have."},{"Title":"A Child Called \\"It\\" and The Lost Boy - One Child's Courage to Survive","review":"This novel was a two for one. A Child Called It is the narrative of a young boy named David Pelzer, who was severely abused by his mother. It is an amazing read because while you are shifting in your chair, trying not to conjure up an image of what David was experiencing, you find yourself not being able to put the book down; you MUST know how this boy gets away. Unflinching and definitely disturbing at times, this biography certainly isn't for the squeamish...however, I believe everyone should read this to raise their awareness of the horrors of child abuse.The Lost Boy was the sequel to A Child Called It. In this novel we follow David as he bounces from foster home to foster home, all the while grappling to understand why his mother treated him as she did. At this point you've developed an emotional attachment to David and want desperately for him to find some peace. Sometimes heartbreaking and often inspiring, this novel delves into the positive and negative repercussions of enduring such horrendous abuse.Highly recommended...."},{"Title":"A Child Called \\"It\\" and The Lost Boy - One Child's Courage to Survive","review":"Anyone in education should read this book before we encounter this child or one like him in our classrooms.

I think its great that he chose to share his story. I am sure those who did go through it can't thank him enough for letting people know things like this do really happen and its for real.

Even though it is very sad and emotional, it an amazing book to read. It helped me to realize how bad some people have got it. The author is so fluent with his word choice and sentences. He is so descriptive that I could actually picture the events that he encountered. I could imagine him at school, and how he felt when he sat down in the basement motionless. It's almost like I interacted with the author and felt every beating that he felt. It's an easy book to comprehend, but at the same time, it uses very good decriptives and word choice. This is honestly one of the best books I've ever read in my life. I would recommend it to anyone, anywhere, anytime!"},{"Title":"A Child Called \\"It\\" and The Lost Boy - One Child's Courage to Survive","review":"I read this book at the time that I was working as a nanny and soon saw the world in a whole different light.

It was heart pulling, although it is not a book that we should 'enjoy' because of the topic, it was so fantastically written that I could not tear myself away. I read the other two as well and made a start on the self help book, but feeling that I did not go through anything like he did I felt I did not need help with my life.I would recommend all four books to anyone, but a word of advice... make sure you have a box of tissues and more then an hour to spare, because once you start you will not want to put it down, and you will most surely cry.enjoy!!!!"},{"Title":"A Child Called \\"It\\" and The Lost Boy - One Child's Courage to Survive","review":"I think that \\"A Child Called It\\" was a great book.

Naturally the famous are here: Ju87, Me109/110/262, Fw190, He111/162, but the obscure as well: the Bv40 Interceptor Glider(!), the asymmetric Bv141 observation aircraft, and the He100 fighter. The entries (with drawings or photographs) of these one-off variants and technological near-misses make the volume worth owning. Over 150 fixed-wing aircraft, gliders and helicopters are combined with an excellent overview of the Luftwaffe from creation to destruction. Additionally, appendices contain the Luftwaffe's chain of command, and a glossary of Luftwaffe-speak.If you are a student of WW2, and particularly the airwar, then you should definitely try to pick up a copy. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Hitler's Luftwaffe: A Pictorial History and Technical Encyclopedia of Hitler's Air Power in World War II","review":"There are quite a few books about this subject on the market, and I rate this one second best. Top of the market in my eyes is 'Warplanes of the Third Reich' by William Green (672 pages!), but this book can serve as a nice companion or indeed as a replacement if your budget is a bit tight. The main advantage this book has compared to William Green masterpiece is the colour artwork, which is sadly lacking in the Green book. The only thing in which the comparison falls out negative against Green is the amount of information about each individual plane, but there is more general information about the Luftwaffe in WW2 to make this up. Highly recommended indeed."},{"Title":"Hitler's Luftwaffe: A Pictorial History and Technical Encyclopedia of Hitler's Air Power in World War II","review":"Hitler's Luftwaffe is both a narrative history and technical directory of the German air force before and during World War II. The first half of the book is a chronology and analysis of the operations of the Luftwaffe. The last half of the book is a technical directory of the numerous aircraft produced by Germany between 1930 and 1945.In the narrative history portion of the book the authors trace the development of the Luftwaffe, its successes, and its failures. According to the authors, the Luftwaffe was defeated not so much in the air but on the ground; Allied ground forces captured factories and fuel-producing areas and thus limited the Luftwaffe's ability to fight. The technical encyclopedia portion includes data on numerous types of aircraft which flew for the Luftwaffe including fighters, bombers, trainers, assault gliders, transports, interceptors, seaplanes, and reconnaissance aircraft. One aircraft which caught my attention was the Arado 232. This transport plane introduced features commonly found in modern transport planes: a high wing above an unobstructed cargo hold, tail carried high with full-section rear doors, and a level floor at truck height. The more famous planes of the Luftwaffe (the Messerschmitt Bf 109, Focke-Wulf Fw 190, Junkers Ju 87 Stuka, and a few others) are given more attention in both the narrative history and technical directory.In sum, this book is a good balance of historical narrative, analysis, and technical data. The many photographs, color profile drawings, and cut-away diagrams make this book an excellent account of one of the most formidable air forces in aviation history."},{"Title":"Cool Construction (4x4 Series)","review":"The first four volumes in the new 4x4 series, each of which features four works by four comparable architects. The concept of linkage is interesting, the four critics achieve an admirable synthesis, the price is right, and the books are full of useful information, plans and excellent photographs. Sadly, their accessibility has been compromised by a wildly self-indulgent designer who squandered eight pages on headline type, overlaid body type with shadow typography, and jammed in far too many miniscule images and discordant typefaces. Its a lesson in how not to lay out a book and may scare away potential buyers.The persistent will be rewarded by graceful writing, especially by the peripatetic Dubliner, Raymund Ryan, and Catherine Slessor, executive editor of the Architectural Review. For the record, the architects covered are, in order: Antoine Predock, Tadao Ando, Wiel Arets and Ricardo Legorretta; David Chipperfield, Waro Kishi, Eduoardo Souto de Moura, and Tod Williams &amp; Billie Tsien; Jones Partners, TEN Arquirtectos, RoTo, and Smith-Miller + Hawkinson; finally, Enric Miralles, Gunter Behnisch, Mecanoo, and Patkau Architects."},{"Title":"Christ in Song","review":"This text-only hymnal gives translations of hymns that come from a wide range of Christian authors and expressions. Schaff's notes are very helpful (see his notes on Toplady's \\"Rock of Ages\\") in placing each hymn in its historical and theological context. Rhythmic metres are not given, but it's not hard to figure them out. This book came recommended by Kevin Twitt of Indelible Grace Music (Reformed University Fellowship) in a lecture he gave to a church music class. I would recommend this book just behind GADSBY'S HYMNS and HART'S HYMNS."},{"Title":"My Edens After Burns","review":"Incredibe book! It was amazing how I obtained it, considering he only made it for a christmas gift for his loved ones. I reaches very deep and sometimes silly into Val's mind. I didn't find any bats in there! Holds a lot of truth as poetry does, and should be recognized if Mr. Kilmer would be more free about others reading it. As it is it's very personal, great for the openminded Val fan :) Very worth the high cost!"},{"Title":"My Edens After Burns","review":"Val Kilmer definately put his heart and soul in to this book. The poetry is astounding, although sometimes hard to understand if you don't know who he is. This gives you an insight to what goes on inside his mind. His points in the book are made and understood. I like this book very much."},{"Title":"My Edens After Burns","review":"Val Kilmer put much of his heart and soul into his work. You can feel his feelings while reading through the poetry. Some of it may be a bit hard to understand if you do not know the man personally but you get the general idea of what he wants to get accross."},{"Title":"My Edens After Burns","review":"Here is both a story and a review: I met someone online who found a signed copy of this book in a thrift store. The odds? According to info I could find online, there were approximately 900 copies of this book created, so I'd call the odds very, very low of finding this book. But it was found and it was auctioned on Ebay. It went for $4500.At the time, excerpts of this book could not only be found here on Amazon (and, as of this writing you can STILL find some samples of the book's contents here) but entire poems were available to see. Short of buying the entire book, one had to be content with reading the poems online. I did.My opinion: They are odd little snippets of words that didn't resonate strongly with me. Those are the facts. Keep in mind, however, that this author was NOT trying to create a bestseller and that this was akin to a self-published book, a work of creativity by an actor. Also bear in mind that the actor himself took it off the market and one can only speculate why. Also, there is a poem in there dedicated to Michelle Pfeiffer, an actress with which Kilmer had a relationship. So there is that. If you are a film buff who collects rare books written by actors and/or like Val Kilmer, this might be to your liking. Otherwise, I'd save the $900 and up for which it is currently selling and watch Kilmer in one of his many film roles (THe Doors, Tombstone, etc).Triva alert: I believe he is related (distantly) to poet Joyce Kilmer, according to what I could find online. Those who wish to know more about that can try and follow the bread crumbs I tried to follow online. There didn't seem to be much out there. I'd appreciate any more info.He did do a book-signing of this book at The Tattered Cover in Denver because a friend was there and told me so. I confirmed this as best I could. This was many years ago.Not much to go on, I know. But you can see parts of the book here, snippets of the poetry and try to track down more online. I had no luck in rediscovering the page that used to contain all the poetry so I leave you with this information, my recollections of what I'd read before and the historical info.You can also read more about this and the sale of the book for $4500, years ago, at my blog here on Amazon."},{"Title":"My Edens After Burns","review":"I'm astonished that this book is available, but I'm not sure that I am glad. It would be wonderful to be able to read it because it is such a personal glimpse into the author's perceptions and creativity. It is always such a pleasure to see a human being as a human being rather than as a \\"star,\\" to recognize other facets and talents than the ones most publicized and most familiar. To be read rather than seen is, perhaps, more of an homage to human spirit and creativity than to superficiality.I also acknowledge some reticence to invest. If this book were meant to be a personal gift for loved ones, I would be intruding into the author's personal life, subverting his original intentions, and violating his boundaries. I have to stick to my values. If I value the feelings and privacy of the author more than my own interest, I need to refrain.I would love it if the author felt comfortable enough to share this work with the public, but I don't want to disrespect this person's boundaries."},{"Title":"My Edens After Burns","review":"I have never been interested in poetry until I learned that one of my all time favorite actors, Val Kilmer, wrote and self-published his own book of poetry in a very limited edition copy run. Supposedly there were 2000 released, but I've heard rumors like many that there were in fact only 100 published. Either way, the man is a genius in many ways: his acting, singing, humanitarian ventures, poetry writer and most importantly loving father. I was so inspired by his book that I wrote my first poem. It is a bit daunting to read and try to attempt to understand the poems if you are new to this sort of literature, but never the less inspiring. The poems are from the late 80's during his rise to fame including subjects about love, work, nature and more. If you are a Val Kilmer fan and can find one of these limited copies, it is definitely a keepsake! It definitely brings out your intellectual and emotional sides and it's a shame that it's so challenging to find; however I also heard a rumor that this was originally intended just for holiday gifts for his family and friends and if that's true, it's sad that he didn't share it with the world. We need role models and poetry for the younger generation. I was lucky enough to find a copy that was signed and inscribed to someone in 88'; the year I graduated high school. So, for me, it's sort of a 22 year late graduation gift to myself, lol, not that I could have afforded it back then. If you are a fan, do yourself a favor and find a copy before it's impossible."},{"Title":"Soaring, an odyssey of the soul","review":"This book, which I read soon after it was first published, takes the reader on a true journey of the soul. It is written in the first person and allows you to travel with a person who has just died and begins his travels outside the body. It is so well written and so life changing that you feel suspended in space and time while you read it. Its like no other book that I've ever read. The first two times that I read it I cried so hard that I had to go outside so I wouldn't wake my parents. It has such an incredible anointing that it feels like it was written by God Himself.I recommend it highly to those who wish a spiritually trancendent experience."},{"Title":"Color me healthy","review":"Don't waste your hard earned money on this.

In only 120 pages, the authors briefly explain the ancient Egyptian religion and the most important gods and goddesses. They also deal with hieroglyphs and their spelling and translation, reading numbers, and even a little hieroglyphic grammar. There is an answer page that provides a key to the various exercises.

Happy trips to Egypt. Zane Miller--Dallas, Texas"},{"Title":"Hieroglyphs for Travelers","review":"Based on the recommendation on this website, I took this book to Egypt this past summer 2001, and was glad I did. By learning to recognize just a few hieroglyphs and pharaoh names (Ramesses II kept popping up!) the different sites seemed to come alive. I was not just touring famous sites and being lectured too, I was attempting to understand the sites myself. It was really a great feeling. Our tour guide (a PhD student) asked to see the book that he saw me peering into almost every day. And, yes, the copy was sturdy and lasted from Abu Simbel to the interior of the Great Pyramid. Although my cargo pants were not large enough to acommodate it - the book was about 1/2 inch too wide. (Maybe that's the difference between male and female pants?) I thought seriously about trimming the pages so it would fit, but never got around to it.I had not studied any hieroglyphs before, but this book was great even for me. Pretty easy to understand the basics. I wasn't expecting to decipher the Rosetta stone; I just wanted a chance to see if I could recognize something!If you really want to be engaged in your tour, rather than be a passive tourist, take this with you.I only gave it 4 out of 5, however, because I did find a couple of editorial mistakes, and they were not clear about how even the simplest pharoah names could vary, but that's not a big deal."},{"Title":"Hieroglyphs for Travelers","review":"I was surprised that such a small book - it is a pocket guide that is actually pocket-sized! - could hold such an ample amount of information. The text is concise without coming to the point of being enigmatic, and is replete with a quantity of valuable data on inscriptions, translations, etc. In the span of four or five pages are presented the names and cartouches of many of the royalty. Presented as well are translations for other monument inscriptions. As someone who has studied hieroglyphic, I can whole-heartedly recommend this book as an invaluable aid to fill in the gaps. It is 'sine qua non' - absolutely indispensable, for both journeying and armchair travellers to Egypt."},{"Title":"Hieroglyphs for Travelers","review":"There is so much great information in this little book!

I know that would would double the price, but it would be worth it! Secondly, I don't don't think it was necessary to turn it into a text book, with tests. I think that would be very intimidating to the average tourist. However, I do look forward to a further, expanded volume (with tests and color photographs).

My seven year old son was so excited about the book that we quickly located the rest of the books in the series. The characters are very appealing. The themes in the book are important for children (i.e. dealing with conflict, dealing with differences in people, questioning why things are always done a certain way), and they are conveyed through humor, questioning characters, and interesting action. We are hoping that the author and publisher will agree to do more.

It is engaging and fun enough to keep younger readers interested, and beautiful enough to be appreciated and enjoyed many years later. The characters are dimensional and understandable; the plot is gripping, new, and a great deal deeper than it appears on the surface. These books first introduced me to the concept that dragons did not have to be brutal animals OR plush and ridiculous characters. The dragons form an important part of the story without degenerating into sidekicks.The story takes place on the world of Zoriac, in a village that has for generations been defined by the dragonquests--ritual hunts undertaken by the men of the village to \\"protect their families\\" from the threat of the nearby Valley of Dragons. Derek, the young protagonist, desperately wants to go along with his brother Clep and his father, but is still too young to take part. Discovering an orphaned dragonling with the corpse of its mother, the boy makes the decision to take the little creature back to its home--a decision that sparks the ire of the villagers and eventually a perilous adventure involving kidnapping, the last remnants of a species, a barbaric kingdom in the mountains, slaves, superstition, an outcast king, and one boy's journey to teach his people the truth about their predjudices. A truly stirring story!The Dragonling books skillfully replace the required romance aspect of adult high fantasy with the notion that boys and girls can be friends and equals. Apart from that detail, these books have every bit as much scope as the other fantasy greats; I simply cannot recommend them highly enough. I hope that any future readers out there will enjoy them as much as I have!"},{"Title":"The Dragonling (A Springboard Book)","review":"My little girl is a HUGE dragon and dinosaur fan.

It contained the translation of some of Lear's best rhymes rendered in Italian. Each written page was matched by a drawing which pictured the main character of the limerick, in a grotesque and funny way, in garish colours. It was to my mind a small masterwork. We laughed so much at night looking at the book and reading the absurd descriptions of incredible creatures, that those memories are among the sweetest of that period long past. And after so many years I just came to believe that those obstreperous heteroclite old men and women (most are old, seldom are they young) are after all the most realistic one could describe, as this world is just so topsy turvy that what at first may seem most absurd is just the most realistic of the pictures of what exists, body and soul, under a slim cover of apparent seriousness. It is a marvellous landmark in the English tradition of nonsense, which is completely lacking in the Italian culture, of course for historical reasons - but one misses it. But recent history could just show that nonsense, in Italy, is just everyday chronicle. A most enjoyable little precious book."},{"Title":"A book of nonsense","review":"As soon as I read #1 I couldn't help not reading #2.

He liked it but he didn't love it to pieces. The nonsense and silliness certainly appeals to silly little kids, and why shouldn't it? And as far as I'm concerned, it's excellent, and deservedly considered classic children's lit., but frankly, I didn't think it was five-stars great. The conceits and poetry are not always exactly inspired, and the illustrations are pretty crude, although plenty entertaining.\\"The Owl and the Pussycat\\" (which we've read many times) and some of the limericks are definitely five-star selections in any case.At $5, this is a nice cheap edition.

Legal Planning provides practical tips, a place to write notes, and resources for more information. While this booklet does not replace the advice of a legal professional, it does help you figure out what you need to ask and how to go about advocating for your parent(s) in the legal and health care system.

Vidal garnishes his observations of the city and its people with characteristic irreverant humor.The pace of the book is pretty informal with short chapters devoted to the origins of Venice, its geography , the great mercantile Venetian empire which lasted over a millenium ,the flowering of arts : Veronese , Tintoretto, Giorgione , Vivaldi &amp; Palladio were all at some point or another associated with the city . Also interspersed are some observations about Venice which most foreigners may not be familiar with e.g: &quot;There is no sight more beautiful than Venice under a snowfall .Venice is like a once-great beauty who deserves to be seen by candlelight , and the soft light of winter works like a photographer's air-brush on the city's many cracks and wrinkles .Venice is particularly beautiful in a winter mist &quot; etc.Also included is a chapter on the high and mighty who chose to spend some time in Venice : Henry James, Byron, Richard Wagner not to mention that Stravinsky is buried there .This is a good light read and Vidal is an entertaining guide along the way."},{"Title":"Vidal in Venice","review":"Many coffee table books are pretty but have vapid text.Not this one.The pictures are splendid, and the text weaves them all together.

It's the Vidal touch that makes this book far better than the standard coffee table product. Yet, Vidal's perspective never overwhelms the story of Venice, complete with many facts and milestones relating to the city history. He deftly keeps the city itself on center stage from the first page to the last. He is merely a guide, but--one suspects after having read the book--probably one of the most interesting ones, certainly among American writers, in the modern era."},{"Title":"Halloween Parties : How to Throw Spook-Tacular Soirees and Frighteningly Festive Entertainments","review":"I rarely write reviews, but after I received this Halloween book, if you would even like to put it in that catagory, I felt I needed to save anyone from buying it!An avid celebrater of Halloween, I thought that I had to have this boook for my collection--the title itself was SO catchy.

Well, people who know a little about Whitman know that there were many versions of Leaves of Grass (as many as 8 or so) and that with each edition, Whitman was constantly revising and in many ways, neutering his own poetry. By his last &quot;deathbed&quot; edition, nearly all of the earlier controversial material had been obscured or even removed. These &quot;authorized versions&quot; fall short of displaying the true mastery of poetry that Whitman possessedThis is where this book stands above all other Whitman collections. This book fully restores many of his most creative and groundbreaking poetry *in their original forms.* It is like night and day. I was shocked all over again when I read the Calamus section as Whitman originally wrote it. With the veil of Whitman's later &quot;moralization&quot; removed, I saw for the first time the true soul of a genuine American poetic genius. This book gives us back what was once lost.I might suggest that this book, not being a totally complete collection of his poetry, be the perfect companion to whatever edition you currently own. For other poets especially, this book will give you an incredible insight into one of the greatest (if not *the* greatest) American poets."},{"Title":"Walt Whitman: Selected Poems 1855-1892","review":"There was a time I didn't much care for Whitman's poetry -- what seemed to me its self-conscious pretentiousness was a turn-off. (Whitman himself acknowledged that his style was all-too readily parodied.) It was only when, 30 years ago, I heard Rip Torn read it, I began to acknowledge its power and originality. Nevertheless, I was still bothered by an overly self-aware, \\"straining for effect\\" quality -- until I found this collection.Gary Schmidgall has done what should have been done a century ago. His collection, comprising half of Whitman's poems (about 80% of the total number of lines he wrote), restores them to their first versions in the correct chronological sequence.We now hear Whitman speaking to us with his original animal vigor. Whitman himself admitted this: \\"...there was an immediateness to the 1855 edition, an incisive directness, that was perhaps not repeated in any section of poems subsequently added to the book: a hot, unqualifying temper, an insulting arrogance (to use a few strong words) that would not have been as natural to the periods that followed. We miss the ecstasy of statement in some of the after-work...\\"More significantly, Whitman's subsequent emasculation and de-sexualizing -- to confuse and obscure the issue of his sexuality -- is removed. Whitman's originals are often more graphic, more-bluntly sexual. It's easier to see why most critics were offended. It's unfortunate Whitman's changes to \\"Leaves of Grass\\" made it less controversial. Perhaps the Schmidgall edition will encourage libraries that ban \\"Huckleberry Finn\\" to also ban \\"Leaves of Grass.\\"If you haven't read the original, 1855 edition of \\"Leaves of Grass\\" -- as well as Whitman's unsigned (and bluntly meretricious) reviews, and the contemporary reviews of academic critics -- you haven't read Whitman. I was especially moved by the last few pages of \\"Song of Myself,\\" which I had never read.Schmidgall includes a copious quantity of notes, excerpts, and reviews. The material from Whitman's notebooks make it clear he knew exactly what he was doing -- creating a new, original, wholly American poetry not modeled on Classic, European, or British forms -- and why. If America is the land of self-definition, Whitman was the first American poet to make that self-centeredness the focus of his works.This edition is a must-own for anyone with the least interest in Whitman. Or dis-interest, for that matter. You might change your mind."},{"Title":"Walt Whitman: Selected Poems 1855-1892","review":"What are characteristics of Leaves of Grass that are uncommon in literary masterworks? It was originally published anonymously. It was originally self-published. Whitman paid to have it printed & bound. While most books are published and never significantly revised, \\"L of G\\" was a lifelong work in progress, revised repeatedly, changing as the author changed. There are many \\"Leaves of Grass\\" publications for sale. I recommend this version for the following reasons:a) The poems are presented in groupings, showing the development of the poetry collection over Whitman's lifetime, from the brief 1855 first edition, through the many different editions, up to the expansive 1991-92 edition. This edition focuses on the first version of each poem before Whitman's later versions \\"toned down\\" some of his verse.b) In addition to introductory comments, this edition includes the various prefaces, unpublished introductions, & \\"A Backward Glance O'er Travel'd Roads\\" from the original \\"L of G\\" publications.c) It includes Ralph Waldo Emerson's famous congratulatory letter and Whitmans' reply letter.d) It includes contemporary reviews (including those written by Whitman himself) from 1855 to 1891e) It includes a historical timeline of Whitman's life.f) It is a large page format, easy to read, splay out, underline, and write in the margins.g) It includes one version of many of the Leaves of Grass poems. If this version also included many of the revisions, showing the edits of the poems, I would like this version even more (look at Bartleby's online for more information about the various versions of each poem).Leaves of Grass is \\"too much\\" for many people. It can be critiqued as hyperbole and excess. To suggest it is not in praise of overt sexuality would be like suggesting to mothers that babies still come from storks. To suggest it is not about homosexuality and bisexuality would be like suggesting 101 Dalmations isn't about puppies. In fact, when I think of Whitman, the word \\"too\\" is the most common word that comes to mind. He is too ____ (fill in the blank).What inspired this man to create this landmark American sexual and emotional statement? Many things. Paramount among those things was Loss. Loss of old loves: \\"Doubtless I could not have perceived the universe, or written one of my poems, if I had not freely given myself to comrades, to love.\\" and \\"(I loved a certain person ardently, and my love was not return'd; Yet out of that, I have written these songs.)\\" Loss of Lincoln inspired \\"Drum-Taps\\" and \\"Sequel to Drum-Taps\\". Loss of youth, health, & pleasures inspired him to write. And I think he wrote for the 4 purposes George Orwell suggested writers write: Sheer egoism, aesthetic enthusiasm, historical impulse (\\"to see things as they are, to find out true facts and store them up for the use of posterity\\"), and political purpose.Whether or not Whitman's perspectives are correct or good, he said things that most people have feared to say so strongly. His words have been criticized as base, vile, and shameful, but they are also free speech expression. I don't know if I can say I'm a big fan of Whitman, but I can say that I'm glad to live under laws that have allowed him to speak his inner mind. And I promote environments & protections that safeguard such expressions.Following his beloved Abraham Lincoln's assassination, he mourned without reservation, \\"O Captain! my captain! rise up and hear the bells . . . For you they call, the swaying mass, their eager faces turning . . . My captain does not answer, his lips are pale and still; My father does not feel my arm, he has no pulse nor will.\\" As \\"Dead Poets Society\\" so capably conveyed, \\"Leaves of Grass\\" is about passion - unabashed American passions."},{"Title":"Walt Whitman: Selected Poems 1855-1892","review":"To date, I think I own about four different copies of Whitman's grand opus \\"Leaves of Grass\\". One is a deathbed edition, printed in 1922, that is hardcover yet pocket sized and great for a backpack. The second is an 1855 reprint of a \\"first edition\\" sold by a major bookstore chain. The third is another 1855 reprint in paperback. And now the fourth, which is this one, and without a doubt, the best of the bunch!Walt Whitman, throughout his years, wrote and rewrote Leaves of Grass many times, for each subsequent reprint. Much of the later editions of the book become watered down and less potent, according to editor Gary Schmidgall, of which I heartily agree. The final \\"deathbed\\" edition of Leaves of Grass, released around the time of Whit's death, varies tremendously from the rich dance of the first edition, in fact, the first three editions.After reading Schmidgall's amazing book, \\"Walt Whitman: A Gay Life\\", you come quickly appreciate Whitman's 1860 edition of the book, the third, released just before the Civil War. Upon searching for a copy of this book, it's virtually hard to find, and I ended up downloading some of the poetry off the Whitman archives website. But Schmidgall painstakingly has recreated that edition, rebuilding such moving sections of the book like Calamus.It's in Schmidgall's edition that the true genius of Whitman comes alive. He becomes more real, more in depth, and shows more pain than in any other edition I've read. It's too bad that Whit decided to censor his writings as he aged, for he tends to weed out the roses with the dandelions. Schmidgall replants Whitman's glorious garden, and we, as readers, get to reap the visual brilliance of it all."},{"Title":"Walt Whitman: Selected Poems 1855-1892","review":"I was an English major and WW was always one of my top five poets. His work is nearly peerless. That said, the only anthologies of his work that I could find were so academic and over-edited that I never had the privilege of reading his ACTUAL words until I picked up this edition in a small bookstore. I had no idea how 'racy' his poems were, but as you read it you realize how much passion he had for the subjects he wrote about (the body, Abe Lincoln, sex). I'm glad I hung onto my Modern Library edition of his works so I can compare it to this and appreciate how much more 'real' his words come across in this edition. If you've always been a WW fan, buy this, you won't regret it."},{"Title":"Walt Whitman: Selected Poems 1855-1892","review":"Nothing to add to the excellent reviews above--this is the truest and best version out there--but the paperback cover is flimsy and warped almost immediately. I recommend getting the hardback, used or otherwise."},{"Title":"Thuvia, Maid of Mars and the Chessmen of Mars: Library Edition","review":"I think this may be the best of the Mars series. Although Thuvia's emotions are discussed like a man's, she is a character in her own right. She is also given the tough choice between her life and embracing another ruler. The romance in this story also seems more enchanting than the rest of the Mars series, but perhaps it's because we see Burrough's attempt at the woman's point of view through her own thoughts instead of the abstractions he uses to describe previous character's desires, like those of Dejah Thoris. Granted, Burroughs isn't perfect in that his women think and react like slightly more feminine versions of his male characters and do what is expected of them, but the attempt makes his women certainly seem more human than before. In short, this novel is one I would recommend to anyone reading Burroughs for the first time, especially a female reader, because it has both the adventure and fighting his novels always have and realistic characters which they often lack."},{"Title":"Thuvia, Maid of Mars and the Chessmen of Mars: Library Edition","review":"As a long-time ERB fan, I have always favored the Mars series (right behind the Pellucidar series).

Ballantine Books had contracted for twelve covers, in anticipation of two additional volumes (to the ten released so far in book format)from the previously uncollected Barsoomian material. They turned out to fit into one, entitled John Carter of Mars; so, when Ballantine reprinted the series, they substituted this \\"number 12\\" for \\"Thuvia and Komal\\" that had been used on TMoM, volume four of the first printing. It gives a superb view of the interior and controls of a small flyer; and it's especially nice to tidy up another gap in my Mars stuff, now that there's finally a real chance of a John Carter movie before I die."},{"Title":"Thuvia, Maid of Mars and the Chessmen of Mars: Library Edition","review":"This book takes a drastic change in pace from the first three Martian Tales stories. This book focuses on Carthoris, the son of John Carter (who was the main character of the other books). When Thuvia of Ptarth is kidnapped, it's up to Carthoris to save her. Along the way the two wind up in a bizzare lost city where what is real and what is not real is disputed.It's an odd story with the old cliches. Thuvia is the classic damsial-in-distress, nearly being suduced by bad men three seperate times, rescued right before it's too late. Lots of epic sword fighting. The mystery of far-away worlds and lands. It's not as good as the first three books, but it's a fun little chapter in the series. I recommend you read it and decide for yourself."},{"Title":"Thuvia, Maid of Mars and the Chessmen of Mars: Library Edition","review":"It took the first three volumes of his Martian series for Edgar Rice Burroughs to get his hero John Carter, former cavalier of Virginia, and Dejah Thoris, princess of Helium to the point where they could live happily ever after. Satisfied with the combination of romance and pulp adventure, this fourth Martian novel turns to the next generation of Barsoomians. Cathoris, son of the Warlord of Mars and his beloved princess, is but one of two princes and a Jeddak who are seeking the hand of the Thuvia of Ptarth. When she is kidnapped by the sinister Prince Astok of Dusar, the entire planet is about to be thrown into a bloody war and Cathoris has to follow in his father's footstep and deal with savage beasts and phantom armies as he rescues Thuvia and saves Barsoom from a costly war. Of course, by the time he catches up with his beloved, Cathoris finds the situation is slightly more complicated than he thought, mainly because ERB never provides a smooth ending for his couples when he can avoid it.&quot;Thuvia, Maid of Mars&quot; was originally serialized in &quot;All-Story Weekly&quot; in April 1916, which explains the novel's subtext about world war, since one was going on in Europe at that point in time. The original title was &quot;Cathoris,&quot; but apparently when it was published as a novel in 1920 somebody wised up and changed it. Thuvia is not as great a name as Deja Thoris, but it is not bad. In many ways this is like the previous novel, &quot;The Warlord of Mars,&quot; where the hero chases his beloved across the landscape of Barsoom and has to deal with green men and white apes. Fortunately, unlike ERB's Tarzan series, &quot;Thuvia, Maid of Mars&quot; is really the only time that repeats himself like this in the Martian series, which stands out as his best as he proves in the next and most inventive volume in the series, &quot;Chessmen of Mars.&quot;"},{"Title":"Thuvia, Maid of Mars and the Chessmen of Mars: Library Edition","review":"What can I say, its a free book.

This one did not disappoint. Very enjoyable all the way thru."},{"Title":"Thuvia, Maid of Mars and the Chessmen of Mars: Library Edition","review":"\\"Thuvia, Maid of Mars\\" is the 4th of 11 John Carter novels from the pen of Edgar Rice Burroughs. It first appeared in April 1916, as a three-part serial in the magazine \\"All Story Weekly.\\" This is the first Carter novel that does not feature John Carter himself as the central character; he only makes a brief cameo appearance early on. Instead, the action mantle is taken up by Carthoris, Carter's son, but fortunately, Carter Junior turns out to be just as good a swashbuckler as the old man. In this installment, Princess Thuvia of Ptarth has been kidnapped by the spineless Prince Astok of Dusar, which abduction almost causes a world war on Barsoom (Mars). Young Carthoris, in his quest to free his beloved princess, runs across deserted cities, a forgotten kingdom, banths (10-legged Barsoomian lions), ethereal warriors, mucho swordplay, giant white apes, and on and on. As is usual for these books, the amount of action that Burroughs packs into a small compass is quite surprising. Whereas previous Carter books seem to read more like fantasy/fairy tales than science fiction, this installment veers even more to the fantastic, mainly in the use of those phantom warriors just mentioned. These bowmen are called up from the minds of the remaining members of the lost city of Lothar, and have no \\"real\\" concrete existence. However, their arrows can still kill. In this book we also get, for the first time, a nice, detailed look at life in Helium; what the people do, how they live and the like. We also receive a biological explanation of how Carthoris, who was 10 years old but a seeming adult in the previous books, got to be that way. The worldwide peace that apparently prevails at the end of book 3, \\"The Warlord of Mars,\\" is shown in this volume to be not as widespread as was inferred, which makes for some nice tense situations. So this is a good, fast-moving, detailed entry in the series.There are some minor problems of inconsistency and fuzzy writing, however, although not as prevalent as in previous entries. For example, in one scene, Carthoris is said to be fighting a force of a dozen Dusarians; three of these are killed, and so three are left. Huh? Carthoris seems to know exactly where to find water in the dead city of Aaanthor, despite the fact that he has never been there before. Wha? Vas Kor, one of Carthoris' chief enemies, fails to recognize him merely because Carthoris is dirty, tired and covered with blood; this is just a bit hard to swallow. Perhaps worst of all, the book ends extremely abruptly, just as all of Barsoom is about to be plunged into that world war. We never learn the fate of several of the main villains, nor do we see the end of hostilities as the realization of the true facts becomes known. This is a short book, and would not have suffered by the addition of such scenes to make it more satisfying. Still, this is a fun entry in the John Carter series, one that all lovers of fast-moving fantasy should enjoy."},{"Title":"Thuvia, Maid of Mars and the Chessmen of Mars: Library Edition","review":"I first read this book and this series some 52 years ago...I recently dug them out and had another go. They are as fun now as they were then. Burroughs' style is absolutely great and needs to be savored. The books are action packed and certainly reflet a time in our society long past. I feel to understand current SiFi and S&S, you really need to start during this time period. We certainly have come along way, in may ways, but it is very evident that this writer and his contemporaries certainly had a profound influence on what we are getting today. This are books for little boys and girls and thank goodness I have enough of that little boy in me to still enjoy them."},{"Title":"Thuvia, Maid of Mars and the Chessmen of Mars: Library Edition","review":"Don't take the star rating wrong - this is as good as any of the other books in this series, but this edition (Quiet Vision Publishing - paperback, printed in 2000) is the cheapest printing of a book I've ever seen. Only about 20 pages into it, pages started falling out of the back. The type is huge and goes all the way to the edge of the page so your thumbs are constantly in the way while you're trying to read, and there are typographical errors like using two hyphens instead of em dashes. I know they make an electronic version of this book. As part of my job I convert a lot of print-intended content to digital publishing formats, and that's what usually happens to em dashes during that process, so I almost wonder if they just printed out their digital version and bound it. It looks like it was printed on a laser printer (especially the terrible cover illustration which looks like it was drawn by a 12-year old), and the fonts look like they're just PC-standard 'Times'. There are also several footnotes, which in the original edition that I read years ago were placed at the bottom of the page they were referenced from. In this edition they're in the back of the book."},{"Title":"Thuvia, Maid of Mars and the Chessmen of Mars: Library Edition","review":"It took the first three volumes of his Martian series for Edgar Rice Burroughs to get his hero John Carter, former cavalier of Virginia, and Dejah Thoris, princess of Helium to the point where they could live happily ever after. Satisfied with the combination of romance and pulp adventure, this fourth Martian novel turns to the next generation of Barsoomians. Cathoris, son of the Warlord of Mars and his beloved princess, is one of two princes and a Jeddak who are seeking the hand of the Thuvia of Ptarth. When she is kidnapped by the sinister Prince Astok of Dusar, the entire planet is about to be thrown into a bloody war and Cathoris has to follow in his father's footstep and deal with savage beasts and phantom armies as he rescues Thuvia and saves Barsoom from a costly war. Of course, by the time he catches up with his beloved, Cathoris finds the situation is slightly more complicated than he thought, mainly because ERB never provides a smooth ending for his couples.\\"Thuvia, Maid of Mars\\" was originally serialized in \\"All-Story Weekly\\" in April 1916, which explains the novel's subtext about world war, since one was going on in Europe at that point in time. The original title was \\"Cathoris,\\" but apparently when it was published as a novel in 1920 somebody wised up and changed it. Thuvia is not as great a name as Deja Thoris, but it is not bad. In many ways this is like the previous novel, \\"The Warlord of Mars,\\" where the hero chases his beloved across the landscape of Barsoom and has to deal with green men and white apes. Fortunately, unlike ERB's Tarzan series, \\"Thuvia, Maid of Mars\\" is really the only time that repeats himself like this in the Martian series, which stands out as his best as he proves in the next and most inventive volume in the series, \\"Chessmen of Mars.\\""},{"Title":"Thuvia, Maid of Mars and the Chessmen of Mars: Library Edition","review":"It's hard to describe the fulfillment one feels after reading anyone of the books in Burrough's series. The complete dominance of honor, and the constant heroism and adventure in these books is heart warming, as well as thrilling. In this part of the series, somewhat to my dissappointment, John Carter is no longer telling the story, but his son, Carthoris, is. Readers of the first three books don't be alarmed however! Carthoris is &quot;just as good a story teller as his father.&quot; And the story is just as exciting."},{"Title":"Thuvia, Maid of Mars and the Chessmen of Mars: Library Edition","review":"Sometimes I get the impression the John Carter books served as the blueprints for many Star Trek: The Original Series episodes. You have a hero, a girl, and a lost and ancient civilization which threatens to engulf all known space (er, Barsoom) if someone doesn't do something FAST.Thuvia, Maid of Mars, passes the torch from father to son as Carthoris, son of John Carter and Dejah Thoris, pursues the heart of the princess Thuvia. To her secret shame Thuvia returns Carthoris' love, but she is already promised to another. When a rival prince kidnaps Thuvia and frames Carthoris for the deed, the son of the Warlord of Mars sets out to rescue the woman he loves no matter what it will cost him.Undoubtedly the most disturbing but tense part of the story falls in the city of Lothar, where Carthoris and Thuvia must do battle with ancient Barsoomians who possess incredible powers of the mind. And the most unlikely hero of all turns out to be a fignment of a character's imagination. This book is a good demonstration of how Burroughs' world of Barsoom was filled with its own stories, and not just a convenient backdrop for John Carter's adventures."},{"Title":"Thuvia, Maid of Mars and the Chessmen of Mars: Library Edition","review":"More similar in its simplicity to a Princess of Mars than Gods/Warlord. John Carter's son engages in search for abducted Thuvia, while he remains the prime suspect in her abduction. Usual strange meetings and stranger neighborhoods, but this story is a little less frenentic than Gods/Warlord, and both Carthoris and Thuvia are solid characters."},{"Title":"Thuvia, Maid of Mars and the Chessmen of Mars: Library Edition","review":"This is an amazing read! Edgar Rice Burroughs must have had a time machine to write such astonishing works. I had to actually watch the movie \\"John Carter\\" to get turned on to Burroughs works. Save a lot of money by purchasing these works from Amazon. I had mine almost instantly with my Kindle, which I absolutely love."},{"Title":"Thuvia, Maid of Mars and the Chessmen of Mars: Library Edition","review":"This is one of the John Carter series that grabs you and holds you thru to the end with non stop action."},{"Title":"Thuvia, Maid of Mars and the Chessmen of Mars: Library Edition","review":"This is the fourth book in the John Carter/Barsoom series written by Edgar Rice Burroughs. In this story, the son of the Warlord of Mars, Carthoris of Helium, searches for and finds the Princess of Ptarth, Thuvia. As if it is not enough to fight strange creatures, the reader is also introduced to several new characters.This story continues the fighting adventure and fantasy of the series. Although John Carter is not a prominent character throughout this book, Dejah Thoris and John Carter's son is. Since Carthoris has inherited much of the speed, strength, and intelligence of the earth man, the story loses none of its excitement.In my humble opinion, this book loses none of the excitement we saw in the first three books. I like the fantasy the author has created, and this volume adds to that. We are once again introduced to new areas of Barsoom, and new species and cultures. How wonderful to be able to find new life forms when traveling across your own planet. For all the advancement we see on Barsoom, we find the people are sometimes less informed than the average earth man.I am still amazed by the fact that the author had such an active imagination at the time he wrote this series. While rockets and airplanes were not yet usable, he puts us on a planet in the solar system with airplanes and lighter than air land vehicles. His explanations for life on Barsoom is almost plausible. Yet, his ability to show us how to have peace amongst tribes that have always warred could be an example even today. Is peace possible, in the midst of fighting and horrific weapons? I do not have the answer, but perhaps it is something else to think about while reading these fantastic books."},{"Title":"Thuvia, Maid of Mars and the Chessmen of Mars: Library Edition","review":"In \\"Thuvia, Maid of Mars\\", the action in the series switches from the transplanted Earthman, John Carter, to his half red Martian son Carthoris. Thuvia, a princess from an allied city-state, was previously introduced into the series when she was rescued from the land of the dead by John Carter. Now Carthoris has fallen in love with her, as has a rival Prince with a decidedly dark plan on how to win Thuvia and dispense with his rival, Carthoris. Through a clever plot device, Carthoris is stranded in the Martian wilds, pursuing a green martian who has made off with Thuvia.Here is the reason for the missing star. At about this book in the series the plots start to become somewhat repetitive. After three books of John Carter chasing Deja Thoris around the planet to rescue her from this and that abductor, the very same plot is in play here, just with Carthoris and Thuvia instead.Still, the action is fast and furious, and Burroughs doesn't slack up on his ability to describe one action sequence after another, each with a fresh style that keeps each scene fresh, even if the over-arching plot is not. Jules Verne and H. G. Wells get a lot of credit for their inclusion of technologies that eventually came to pass, but don't overlook Burroughs in that regard. Here he does a good job of describing a device much like our current auto-pilots in airplanes.Overall, a fun read. However, if you are trying to read the entire series straight through, you risk burning out on the repetitive basic plot. Therefore I'd recommend that you take a break between reading the first three books before taking up this one, and take breaks every other book or so for the rest of the series. After all, when originally written some of these books were published months to years apart, and those who read them in that manner didn't have the similarities pushed quite so strongly in their faces as we who can finish one and instantly begin to read the next."},{"Title":"Thuvia, Maid of Mars and the Chessmen of Mars: Library Edition","review":"Thuvia, Princess of Ptarth is kidnapped by the minions of Dusar to start a war between Helium and Ptarth. Carthoris, son of John Carter, Warlord of Barsoom and Prince of Helium is the prime suspect, so he rushes headlong into harm's way to rescue the woman he loves, who is promised to another. They stumble onto the city of Lotar, inhabited by a new race of Martians, the fair-skinned, auburn haired people, who can call up armies of the imagination. Carthoris fights his way through beasts and men in his effort to rescue the woman he cannot have.Another great story from one of pulp fiction's founding fathers, Edgar Rice Burroughs. His flights of fantasy inspired a generation of authors. His vision and imagination still present a more vivid and fresh fantasy world than most contemporary authors are capable of. OK, so the morals and values are nineteenth century. That's not entirely bad. Honesty, honor, integrity, courage, self-restraint, commitment, and self-sacrifice are all values worth holding onto, despite the sulky, self-indulgent ramblings of many contemporary authors and most literary critics.Awesome stories from the best of yesteryear's pulp writers!E.

Along the way, they discover another lost city of Mars (things like that happen a lot in these books). If you are interested in early science fiction, this is an entertaining example of the genre."},{"Title":"Thuvia, Maid of Mars and the Chessmen of Mars: Library Edition","review":"\\"Thuvia, Maid of Mars\\" by Edgar Rice Burroughs is the fourth book in the Barsoom series, and it is quite a bit different than the previous books. The first three books focused on John Carter, and his love of Dejah Thoris, but they are barely mentioned in this book. Instead, the focus switches to focus on John Carter's son, Cathoris, prince of Helium, and the title character Thuvia, princess of Ptarth, both of which were introduced in the second book of the series \\"The Gods of Mars\\", but were fairly minor characters in both that and the third book of the series. This book was originally published in three parts in \\"All-Story Weekly\\" on April 8, 15, and 22 of 1916. It was later published in book form in October of 1920.Most of the book deals with things with which the readers of the series are already familiar, such as the different kingdoms of Red Martians, and the warlike Green Martians, but there is one very interesting new development and that is in the ancient city of Lothar, and in particular the phantom bowmen who defend that city. The entire Lothar sequence is certainly the highlight of the book, with the unusual Jav, who is the first Lotharian they meet, and Tario, Jeddak of Lothar. Also, the character Kar Komak who is one of the phantom bowmen is a good addition to the cast of characters.The story is rather simple. Cathoris is in love with Thuvia, as is Astok, Prince of Dusar, but Thuvia herself is already promised to Kulan Tith, the Jeddak of Kaol. Who Thuvia favors is kept somewhat secret, though the reader can pretty much guess. Astok is determined to have her, and so he kidnaps her and frames Cathoris in the process, hoping to start a war and prevent the truth from being learned. Cathoris falls into their trap, and he and Thuvia disappear from the known world. Cathoris does his best to protect Thuvia as she gets passed from captor to captor, while the circumstances of what is going on in their kingdoms is unknown to them.This book falls short of the first books of the series for a number of reasons. Many of the devices used here were used before. One would think that so many plots and deceptions had taken place in the past, that it would not automatically work so easily in making people believe that Cathoris was a kidnapper. The fact is, though, that these hokey devices worked in the earlier books, because Burroughs did a much better job of keeping the action going and telling a complete story. This book is much shorter than any of the prior three, and the ending feels like it is cut at least a chapter short as only some of the issues raised during the story end up being resolved. One never really gets to know Kulan Tith, and so his actions in the end feel empty of significance, a mistake which Burroughs did not make in the earlier books.For those who were content with the first three books, there isn't enough here to justify coming back to it, but for those who want more, it does add something to the series. I am only going to rate this one two stars, because I feel it is significantly weaker than its predecessors, but for those who are big fans of the series, you probably will still get something out of it."},{"Title":"Thuvia, Maid of Mars and the Chessmen of Mars: Library Edition","review":"I enjoyed this story as much as the other Barsoom books by Edgar Rice Burroughs. However I wouldn't recommend this non illustrated version. The typeface and spacing of the novel in the kindle edition made the book difficult to read.

I would highly recommend this book, not only to families like my own, who have been personally touched by one of these diseases, but to gastroenterologists, nurses and others who care for patients with Crohn's or Colitis. It is truly an educational read for all.Also recommended: 'Ask Audrey' by Audrey Kron"},{"Title":"Straight from the Gut: Living with Crohns Disease & Ulcerative Colitis (Patient Centered Guides)","review":"First, I wish nobody to need the information about IBD. But, for one who needs it, the current book is not a best place to look for.Obviously, the author's attempts to explain little bit of everything worked, and almost every reader would find in the book something related to his or her case. The problem is that it is so little of information in each topic, that almost nobody would find it really helpful.The author did a pretty good job by collecting people's letters, which could help ones who need to know that they are not alone. Still, news groups, which could be easily found in the web would work much better.And the last, most important: the author is a typical example of conventional medicine approach. If you trust in convention medicine and your doctor, you don't need any book at all - your case is going to make to your doctor so much money, that he or she would be happy to provide you the details (unless of course you'll ask for the cure of the disease). And, if you want to try alternative ways, you would not find any help here, just a couple of standard words, which every conventional doctor would say to you in case you would ask."},{"Title":"Journey Toward Intimacy: A handbook for lesbian couples","review":"My first disappointment with the book came when I realized that instead of focusing on creating intimacy generally, as the reviews and description led me to believe, the book is actually a guide to increasing sexual intimacy. I did decide to keep the book and found that the exercises are good for helping partners or individuals to clarify their sexual attitudes and explore their comfort zones. The book would be more helpful if more information were included; the format consists of short (1-2 page) introductions to the exercises and checklists of varying lengths. In some cases, however, it's unclear exactly what is meant by some of the items the reader is asked to check or leave unchecked, and it seems that a more fleshed out explanation would help most people. Because the exercises are thought exercises, they can't rely on physical experience to help make clear the goals of each. On the positive side, the book could be a non-threatening first step toward opening sexual communication between partners. I would recommend it to couples who find that they have sexual dissatisfactions they are uncomfortable discussing or unable to discuss in a productive way. The exercises are fairly basic, though, and for couples who are more practiced in communicating, they may not be as helpful."},{"Title":"Journey Toward Intimacy: A handbook for lesbian couples","review":"This book was exactly what my partner and I needed to help us to overcome our tendency to stay in a comfortable rut. Our long-term relationship was harmonious, but it lacked emotional intimacy. Over time, I believe this led to a deadening of our eroticism as well. Playfully sharing our responses to the exercises in this book offered us the opportunity to get to know each other in new, deeper ways, helping us to move beyond our anxieties about authenticity. The result has been exciting, validating, and very much worth the journey which has led us into passion we've never known together."},{"Title":"Old And New Testaments (Brittingham Prize in Poetry)","review":"When friends of mine were arguing recently about whether to raise their new baby with or without a conventional religious education, I gave them Lynn Powell's Old &amp; New Testaments. In Powell's hands, the Bible stories and verses, mysteries and perils learned in childhood become a vital myth that colors and deepens almost every aspect of daily life, for both the child and the adult she becomes. One is tempted to conclude that the conditions of a Baptist upbringing are necessary and sufficient to make a poet-that this is the school all poets should go to. Of course, the material is well served by the observant imagination of the child Powell was and the keen intelligence, humor, and sure-footed craft of the adult poet who has clearly found her metier.Powell's book, winner of the 1995 Brittingham Prize in Poetry, is organized in four parts representing the Old and New Testaments of the title, but not in the expected order: Genesis, Song of Solomon, Revelation, and Job-the beginning, the idyllic time, the end, and finally, returning to the Old Testament's most timeless book, Job, the existential present.The poems range over childhood and family, illness and age, marriage and parenthood, love and marital conflict, with biblical and daily-life texts interwoven in the most natural and immediate way. At the outset, in &quot;Nativity,&quot; we realize how compatible the Bible stories are with the domain of childhood and the imagination. The poem's structure (a sestina) reflects the interplay of contradictions and opposites, and their many mutations, that will continue throughout the book and that is inherent in the story of Jesus. It begins:Some parents shy away from the body,but we hush up about the cross-rereading our daughter the story about Jesuswe most believe in: motherand father kneeling after the hard birth,humbled by the exhaustions of love.In its alternations and ringing-of-changes on the six repeated words (most of which are different tones of the same, muted vowel), the unstrained sestina suits well the alternations of, and variations on, its ideas. The words Powell commits the poem to-body, cross, Jesus, mother, birth, love-prove up to the task, able to sustain the poem's progression of meaning. This is partly because she lets them assume many forms: As the narrative moves through the six stanzas, &quot;birth&quot; alternates with &quot;death,&quot; &quot;Jesus&quot; with &quot;Christ&quot; and &quot;God.&quot; &quot;Mother&quot; becomes &quot;Mommy,&quot; and also the poet's mother to whom she whispered, &quot;I think God would have picked me as Mother/Mary if he'd sent his son right now&quot;, and finally both &quot;Mom&quot; and the &quot;Mary&quot; whose part the child has taken. The cross takes on varied meanings, as an adjective (Herod, jealous and cross), and later, part of the sweet, vivid picture of the poet's baby son, enlisted as Jesus in his sister's play, &quot;a prop, lovingly swaddled in blue dish towels, his head criss-crossed/with paisley scarves...&quot;There are many more poems that deserve mention for the arresting pictures they paint, their observant juxtaposition of the sacred and domestic, their transparent, playful craft. Powell's world is a world where the implications of the imagination are taken seriously, and where we're reminded that the Bible is as fertile a source for intelligent, lively contemporary poetry as Homer or Dante. In showing us this world, Powell has created a remarkably unified and satisfying book"},{"Title":"Old And New Testaments (Brittingham Prize in Poetry)","review":"Lynn Powell, Old and New Testaments (University of Wisconsin Press, 1995)Wow. This is some seriously fine stuff.Lynn Powell's first book of poetry (which won three awards, including the Norma Faber First Book Award) is a testament in every sense of the word. Don't bother trying to tell the Biblical literalists, however. Powell's volume focuses on the earthly, and how the spiritual relates to it; this is the kind of stuff capable of making a person understand how the physical and the spiritual are intertwined, not exclusive.The four parts of the book go through four aspects of life (birth, sensual awakening, marriage, and death), emphasizing the beauty and harmony of each, the spiritual aspect working with, but never dominating, the physical:\\"Oh God, keep me a mediocre Mary!Dilute my children's love with selfishness,let them refuse the treacherous kiss, never knowthe miserable cup.

Why there are people suffering on the streets and other don't ? Is there a real justice ?

And, to me, this book brings me back to that peaceful, transcendent, truly wild place. I use it as a meditation book in the early morning. I have five that I read - the first four are about peace for me, human person, and they certainly have their place. But this little book I read last because it puts things in perspective and reminds me that I am not the center of anything at all. I buy them in quantity and give them away. It is such a beautiful book. The quotes are outstanding and are from some of our most eloquent naturalists, et al, and the peace that emanates from every reading can only be experienced, not described. It's wonderful."},{"Title":"The Earth Speaks","review":"This book is what to read when you have run out of steam, and just don't know what to do with yourself anymore. It brings the best of your outdoors side out and lets you not forget the most peaceful places on earth. It also has stories and quotations that one would want to live by. It is amazing how it can make you feel, I do not know quite how to explain it. All in all, it gives motivation, reason to be, and expresses nature in ways not seen everyday. And the best part about it is, it is a collection of the most wonderual writers one could find!

None of us are borned to be failures. Situations and circumstances toss us around so, and buffet us about so, until we lose our fight, our will to try, and to win. But, George Clason takes us back to Babylon, and ancient city known for its' wealth, and culture. Arkad, the central character of the story, would be known as a Bill Gates, or an Admon Cashogi, or a J.

Rolling Stone Press Editor Holly George-Warren and clothing designer Michelle Freedman have produced a luxe look at Western garb that is more Las Vegas than Laredo.The iconic American cowboy typifies our country's spirit to many, from New York City sidewalk stompers who have no saddles but don boots to diamond encrusted Grammy award winners who twang with the best of them.So, for those attracted by the lore and lure of ranching days, here is a photographed filled bow to all garb Western. It begins with the practical clothing needed by scours, traders, and ranch workers, then details how early movie stars such as Tom Mix, Gene Autry, Dale Evans and Roy Rogers spurred a popular trend in cowboy wear.That vogue was to later influence British rock musicians and high end fashion designers such as Ralph Lauren.&quot;There's a little bit of cowboy in everybody,&quot; the foreword states and that would be seem to be true as the pages of How The West Was Worn reveal glimpses of tastefully displayed silver buckles, jauntily worn Stetsons, and rhinestone embellished rigs that never saw a range.- Gail Cooke"},{"Title":"How the West Was Worn","review":"A colorful and comprehensive examination of American style at it's most iconic - the authors have done a wonderful job telling the story of how cowboy duds came to symbolize America the world over.

The book is gorgeously presented, expertly written and endlessly entertaining, the photography is beautiful, and the interviews are rare and revealing. From the plains and frontiers, to Buffalo Bill to the Hollywood Cowboy, Country &amp; Western, Rock &amp; Roll, the current fashion craze, the authors leave no cowpie unturned as they reveal how the cowboy hat became our collective unconscious. The most complete record of the lives and work of N. Turk, Rodeo Ben, and Nudie to date. How did the famed North Hollywood rodeo tailor get men in the 20th century to wear fanciful embroidered and rhinestoned creations, that became more and more elaborate in a competitive fervor to outshine each other?(And how did Keith Richards cause him to draw the line?)

As it happens, most of the book is devoted to a character analysis of Judith. In a nut shell, Judith knows that she is an ugly duckling with incredible brain power. We don't see any real attraction developing between Luke and Judith until the last quarter of the book. And then when it does, the author's analysis of Judith is vindicated for she is accepted by Luke because of her brainy self rather than her looks. The most tragicomedical line of the book must be when Luke agrees with Judith that she is not beautiful. Disappointingly for me, just when I'm getting interested in the story in the last quarter of the book, the plot reaches its climax and comes to an end. The story is dry and tends to drag on.

Various sets of them were collected and published in book form both during his life and after his death. Trying to determine what works are in what collections is difficult - most works appear in more than one collection, some works appear under more than one title, and some collections appear under more than one title.To aid readers, in this review I've listed the works in this collection, with notes indicating other collections they have appeared in. Where a work has appeared under more than one title, I give both titles separated by a slash.Table of Contents:&quot;The Necessity of Chivalry&quot; / &quot;The Importance of an Ideal&quot; (1)&quot;Equality&quot; (1), (2)&quot;Three Kinds of Men&quot; (1), (2)&quot;My First School&quot; (1)&quot;Is English Doomed?&quot; (1), (2)&quot;Democratic Education&quot; (1), (2)&quot;A Dream&quot; (1), (2)&quot;Blimpophobia&quot; (1)&quot;Private Bates&quot; (1)&quot;Hedonics&quot; (1), (2)&quot;After Priggery - What?&quot; (1)&quot;Modern Man and His Categories of Thought&quot; (1)&quot;Talking About Bicycles&quot; (1)&quot;On Living in the Atomic Age&quot; (1), (2)&quot;The Empty Universe&quot; (1)&quot;Prudery and Philology&quot; (1), (2)&quot;Interim Report&quot; (1)&quot;Is History Bunk&quot; (1), (2)&quot;Sex in Literature&quot; (1)Notes:(1) also published in &quot;Essay Collection &amp; Other Short Pieces&quot;(2) also published in &quot;Compelling Reason&quot;Recommendations:The current collection is an odd one - generally, Lewis's shorter writings can be classed by subject as either Christian or Literary, but this collection is of Lewis's topical writings, which do not fall easily into either category. Given that their topicality has now aged about half a century, this is hardly the most valuable set of writings Lewis has left us. Most readers of Lewis can safely pass.For those Lewis readers who can't get enough, this collection does have merit, but I would suggest that such folk instead get &quot;Essay Collection &amp; Other Short Pieces&quot;, which, as of the time of this writing, is available from Amazon UK but not Amazon US. That collection consists of about 130 short works by Lewis. It includes everything in this collection as well as almost all of his Christian writings (Lewis's Literary writings are, however, sadly under-represented in that collection).If you love Lewis but your budget does not run to &quot;Essay Collection &amp; Other Short Pieces&quot;, then you can go ahead and get this collection. Its only other overlap is with &quot;Compelling Reason&quot;, a collection that nobody should get."},{"Title":"Present Concerns","review":"This book is a slice of Lewis' mind. As a compilation of essays between 1940-1945, you would think that it would be dated. Yet, Lewis characteristically merges the timely with the timeless, which makes this tome a book for all seasons.Each chapter is an isolated essay, but all revolve around the themes established in \\"Abolition of Man.\\" These include the elimination of absolute values, the effects of literature on character education, and so forth.Intermixed with these heavy and pressing topics, however, are two essays, \\"Hedonics\\" and \\"Talking About Bicycles.\\" There are about mere pleasures and the simple delights of existence. You can taste and feel his sense of life and his sense of delightful please in common day things. Lewis is no curmudgeon, but something else-a mixture of rugged Elijah and tender Elisha.Lewis, as a literati, amateur historian, and an ex-pagan, has a good eye for decadence. Indeed, his was a warning voice that SHOULD have been headed. We are so far downstream that it would take several C. S. Lewises to effect a turnabout. This may be impossible, but at least we can start with ourselves.This is not the best book for Lewis neophytes. Start with the anthology \\"A Mind Awake,\\" and stick with the \\"Five Classics,\\" and \\"Abolition of Man.\\" Then work your way through \\"Weight Of Glory\\" and \\"God In The Dock.\\""},{"Title":"Present Concerns","review":"This is certainly not one of Lewis' more important books (it was published only some 20 years after his death), but unlike some of the other posthumous essay collections, most of what it does contain is not to be found elsewhere (at least in the easily obtained collections). Lewis rarely attempted to take a position on contemporary political topics, which makes some of the essays more interesting than they would be otherwise. At the very least, they show that Lewis was more interested in politics than his careful attempts to avoid political questions in his other books would indicate. From his autobiography, one would get the impression that he never read the newspaper; while \\"After Priggery -- What?\\" doesn't dull his criticism of newspapers in the slightest, it does make clear that he read them from time to time.The best essays in the book -- \\"On Living in an Atomic Age\\", \\"Democratic Education\\", and \\"Equality\\" -- do touch on themes which he has addressed elsewhere (Miracles, Screwtape Proposes a Toast, and The Four Loves respectively) -- but they also introduce new material and develop these themes in different directions. I'd never heard \\"inequality\\" in education (one could also use the word \\"standards\\") praised specifically for the effect that it has on the uninterested student: but Lewis does so, and does so quite well in my opinion.Other essays seem to cover material I have not elsewhere encountered in Lewis. He takes a surprising but quite reasonable stand on Britain's censorship laws in \\"Sex and Literature\\" and on \\"Prudery and Philology\\". And some of his philosophy of education is expressed in \\"Is English Doomed?\\" and \\"Democratic Education\\". Other essays, like \\"Blimpophobia\\" and \\"A Dream\\" are more clearly targeted to the England of WWII.In all, it's an interesting work, but the die-hard Lewis fan will find more value in it than someone looking for a good introduction to his thought."},{"Title":"Present Concerns","review":"This collection of writings about a variety of topics (published for the first time in book form) was a pleasure to read. Walter Hooper has done his usual fine job of editing these essays, which partially answer the question, &quot;Well what other sorts of things was Lewis interested in besides literature and theology?&quot; As the title suggests, the things that caught Lewis's attention continue to be present concerns for our world today."},{"Title":"Present Concerns","review":"With the recent Narnia movie, cranking out Lewisiana has almost become a cottage industry. With the plethora of titles, one is hard pressed to know where to begin. Some reviewers consider this book a bit of flack shoved off on the gullible public hungry to read more. I take the opposite tack.While most of the recent Lewis- related titles take his work out of its historic context, attempting to relaunch it as relevant in our own, this book goes the other way. It's firmly anchored in the era of WW II when Lewis wrote, and entirely concerned with the state and future of Britain. Thus these essays are for modern readers not \\"present concerns\\" but rather windows into the past.Each of these nineteen essays appeared in British newspapers, and most of them still hit hot buttons today. It's arguable whether Lewis wrote \\"down\\" to news readers, but he had an uncanny knack of connecting with readers even when he couldn't socialize with them. For instance, he remarked that he didn't care for the society of children, by which he meant he was uncomfortable in their social circle. But that didn't stop him writing seven of the most beloved kids' books of all time, nor of keeping up lively correspondence with them.Lewis' views on the censorship of books (he was against it) become particularly notable in context. He wrote at the time that D.H. Lawrence's novel, Lady Chatterly's Lover was the subject of obscenity trials, and expressed his opinion forcefully in the essay included in this collection (He alludes briefly to this view in his excellent book about reading, An Experiment in Criticism). Like that book, this is not one of Lewis' best sellers, but readers may be surprised to find how much in our day these topics are still present concerns."},{"Title":"Present Concerns","review":"Did C S Lewis ever write anything that wasn't thought provoking? I got this set of short stories mainly for his essay on the need for Chivalry today. It lived up to all I had read about it. We need young men who are both gentlemanly and savagely protective. If lacking one or the other character qualities, they are either \\"milk toast\\" or barbarian. The balance is needed in true manhood today."},{"Title":"Present Concerns","review":"I am trying to read almost everything Lewis wrote. This was a collection of essays about politics, war, school, and other miscellaneous topics. As a fan of Lewis, it was interesting to see some of what Lewis thought about these other issues.But I don't really recommend the book. If you like Lewis, this is not his \\"usual\\" fare, and some of what he writes no longer applies to our culture and our current economic/political situations.Now, having said that, his essay on \\"Democratic Education\\" should be read by every parent, teacher, and politician in the country. As a Professor, he understood what education should be, how it should be accomplished, and has much to teach us about our own educational system today."},{"Title":"Present Concerns","review":"I do not own this book, and am not reviewing it. But there is a quote from the essay \\"On Living In An Atomic Age\\" that is going around once again, following the London bombings of July 2005. I am putting it here on Amazon so interested parties Googling to find the source of the quote might have an easier time of it:\\"If we are . . . going to be destroyed by [a] bomb, let that bomb when it comes find us doing sensible and human things--praying, working, teaching, reading, listening to music, bathing the children, playing tennis, chatting to our friends over a pint and a game of darts--not huddled together like frightened sheep and thinking about bombs.\\"--C.S. Lewis"},{"Title":"Present Concerns","review":"I recently gave a copy of this slim book to the person on this planet whom I most respect. It's easy to overlook a book like this: the essays are short and they don't advance our understanding of Lewis's faith to any appreciable degree. But what words of wisdom we find therein! Our civilization possesses no one of Lewis's caliber today, and a reading of this delightful book should sadden as much as it enlightens."},{"Title":"Mom Kills Kids and Self","review":"\\"Mom Kills Kids and Self\\" was an unassuming book I saw on the library shelf. Intrigues by the title, I picked it up and opened the cover. The book sucked me in with the first few pages. Our main character, never named, has returned home to find his wife has killed herself after murdering their two sons. What unfolds afterwards is looking through the eyes of a man driven to insanity by this act. His behavior and actions are strange and unexpected as his thoughts fantically trace back through time, trying to find the cause of his family's death. Everything in this story is juxtasposed, from his perspective on his wife's life, his boy's lives, and from his own life, from his work, aand from his philosophy on women. The story kept me captivated, I recommend this book to anyone who would enjoy a combination of King and Vonnegut."},{"Title":"Mom Kills Kids and Self","review":"He has the eye and ear of an advertiser. Quick with the headline but totally lacking in content.A suit devoid of body and soul ."},{"Title":"Mom Kills Kids and Self","review":"As an aspiring writer I am aware that this book has its flaws, but I love it regardless. The story haunts me. I can go years without touching it, but still I think about its unnamed protagonist often. And when I do go back to the book, the ending leaves me utterly flabbergasted each and every time; this even though I have never forgotten what happens.The funny thing is, I have tried reading another book by Alan Saperstein, and I found it truly dreadful and put it down soon after picking it up. But there is something about Mom Kills Kids and Self that I just cannot get enough of. It is a chilling experience, to see inside a man's head as he goes insane--as he lives inside his house alongside the bodies of his wife and children for days.I love the thought of someday publishing a book that reaches a wide audience, that makes a lot of money. But then I think about this book, and I know I would give up that fame and fortune just to know that my work has touched someone so profoundly as this one has touched me."},{"Title":"Raymond Chandler: Later Novels and Other Writings: The Lady in the Lake / The Little Sister / The Long Goodbye / Playback /Double Indemnity / Selected Essays and Letters (Library of America)","review":"...and that's maybe a hyper-opinion though not an overstatement. The best here lives up to his name, and the worst is usually better than everyone else. And that's all you need to say."},{"Title":"Raymond Chandler: Later Novels and Other Writings: The Lady in the Lake / The Little Sister / The Long Goodbye / Playback /Double Indemnity / Selected Essays and Letters (Library of America)","review":"For that elusive title of \\"Greatest of All Time\\", in the field of mystery fiction, Raymond Chandler would get more than a few votes. I don't know if I'd give him that award, but he'd definitely be in the running. It wasn't merely the quality of his writing, which though over half-a-century old, still reads better than most modern mysteries; it's also the fact that Chandler was a pioneer, building on the foundation of hard-boiled predecessors like Dashiell Hammett to bring mysteries out of the gentle drawing room puzzle-solvers and into the real world.The Library of America has assembled all of his seven novels along with some other material into a two volume set. The first volume was five-star material and the second volume - the topic of this review - may even be better.The \\"Later Novels\\" compiled here are The Lady in the Lake, The Little Sister, The Long Goodbye and Playback, all featuring private eye Philip Marlowe. I have written separate reviews for each book, but as a set, they work wonderfully both individually and together. Reading them together helps you see the slow but certain evolution of Chandler the writer, culminating in the near-perfect The Long Goodbye. Playback, which follows it, was written when Chandler was near the end of his life, and the wear and tear shows.Like a good DVD boxed set, this volume comes not only with the novels but plenty of extras as well. Biggest of these is the screenplay for Double Indemnity (based on the James Cain novel), a movie which some consider the best film noir ever (I like it, but personally, my vote goes to Out of the Past). There are also a series of essays, including perhaps his most famous piece of nonfiction, The Simple Art of Murder. The essays and letters included give some insight into Chandler, a man who recognized what made great writing and seemed to find little that measured up to his standards. Marlowe himself often comes off as cheery compared to the cynical yet often brilliant opinions of Chandler.This book is over a thousand pages long, and there's not a bad page in the bunch. If you're a fan of mystery fiction - or even fiction in general - and have been avoiding Chandler because he is an \\"old\\" writer, avoid no more. This remains some of the best writing around."},{"Title":"Raymond Chandler: Later Novels and Other Writings: The Lady in the Lake / The Little Sister / The Long Goodbye / Playback /Double Indemnity / Selected Essays and Letters (Library of America)","review":"Chandler, Later NovelsThis volume contains the other novels, essays, and selected letters of Raymond Thornton Chandler who wrote many of the \\"private eye\\" novels that were popular from WW I to the 1960s. His novels told of the power and corruption of the ruling class in the Los Angeles region. (The reader can judge the relevance of these stories to their own locality.) This volume contains four novels: \\"The Lady in the Lake\\" (this title came from a Sir Walter Scott novel); \\"The Little Sister\\"; \\"The Long Goodbye\\"; and \\"Playback\\" (his last novel). There is a screenplay for \\"Double Indemnity\\" (the book is better than the movie, as is usually the case).The \\"Selected Essays\\" has five articles: \\"The Simple Art of Murder\\" (contrasting life to art); \\"Writers in Hollywood\\" (about life as a screenwriter); \\"Twelve Notes on the Mystery Story\\" (his comments on the ingredients for a good mystery story); \\"Notes on English and American Style\\" comparing language and culture); and the \\"Introduction to \\"The Simple Art of Murder'\\" (his comments on mystery stories and writers). There are \\"Selected Letters\\" which tell about Chandler's life, his comments on mystery stories and writers, and about his fictional character \\"Philip Marlowe\\" (taken from an Elizabethan writer). These letters are informative.The \\"Chronology\\" summarizes his life events from 1888 to 1959. [Does this description sound like a character in one of his novels?] The \\"Note on the Texts\\" provides information on the novels. \\"Notes\\" provides an explanation about details in the novels (a \\"Capehart\\" was an expensive brand of radio).

The quality of both volumns is great: it's library quality. It only contains the more public stories and novels and essays. To find the ones Chandler did not want well known you have to look elsewhere (he cut them up and put them in the novels you see the this set). The only criticism I have is that the Notes and Chandler Time-line are both a little weak. There are lots of slang and arcane jargon of the 30s and 40s that should have been defined. Only a small number of entries are found. But, if you want to read the master, this is it. Just buy both volumns and then look for the \\"lost stories\\" of Chandler to fill in the gaps."},{"Title":"Raymond Chandler: Later Novels and Other Writings: The Lady in the Lake / The Little Sister / The Long Goodbye / Playback /Double Indemnity / Selected Essays and Letters (Library of America)","review":"Chandler is arguably the best detective story writer out there. If you expand this genre to all mystery writers, he would still be one of the best.Detective stories aren't as common as they once were, but if you look at the offspring of the Pulp magazine once so popular, television, they are still as popular as ever. Chandler was one author who defined what a detective story was. This book contains four novels:The Lady in the Lake, The Little Sister, The Long Goodbye, and Playback. These are wonderfully entertaining stories that contain the archetypical hard-bitten detective, Philip Marlowe. After reading these stories you will forever see Marlowe in every detective story you see or read, from Magnum to the latest TV cop. How can you not love an author who sums up Modern American Capitalism with lines like these? \\"We make the finest packages in the world, Mr. Marlowe. The stuff inside is mostly junk.\\" Or an author who in the early 50's, (50 years before the current 'Queers Dress Up' shows) so presciently wrote, \\"The queer is the artistic arbiter of our age, chum.\\" Or his comment on a speech by a politician, \\"He did not bore us with any facts.\\"These books are not just riveting, fun reading, but full of thoughtful quotes like the above.Chandler also is must-reading for his understanding of criminality, venality, human nature, Southern California, Movies, American culture and American relationship dynamics. I hate to use the word \\"classic\\" to describe stories that are just so plain fun to read, but I find it hard not to.This volume also contains a screenplay, Double Indemnity, and a few essays and letters. The essays \\"The Simple Art of Murder\\", and \\"Writers in Hollywood\\" should be required reading for anyone interested in 20th century culture, movies, and literature. Just a few tidbits more. Chandler on English Mystery Writers - \\"The English may not always be the best writers in the world, but they are incomparably the best dull writers.\\" Chandler on boredom - \\"There are no dull subjects, only dull minds.\\" Chandler on critics - \\"The average critic never recognizes an achievement when it happens. He explains it after it has become respectable.\\"My only criticism is that the plots are contrived and sometimes complicated. But such criticism is like complaining that the Mona Lisa would be a fine painting if only it were of a different size.Chandler is simply wonderful, funny, cynical, and yes, - respectable."},{"Title":"Raymond Chandler: Later Novels and Other Writings: The Lady in the Lake / The Little Sister / The Long Goodbye / Playback /Double Indemnity / Selected Essays and Letters (Library of America)","review":"Contained in this volume are the last four (of seven) Marlowe novels, the Double Indemnity script co-written with Billy Wilder (including lines that were cut), his famous essay on &quot;The Simple Art of Murder&quot;, one on &quot;Writers in Hollywood&quot;, another titled &quot;Twelve Notes on the Mystery Story&quot;, and finally &quot;Notes (very brief, please) on English and American Style&quot;. Couple these with thoroughly entertaining and sometimes revealing letters to friends and fans, and you can't miss.In one of these letters he even discusses fellow hardboiled writer Ross Macdonald's (here called John, as he hadn't changed his name yet) The Moving Target, which cribbed some ideas from The Big Sleep and Dashiell Hammett's The Thin Man.The novels themselves? Classic Chandler - enough said. If you'd like to know why you should expect the best in hardboiled detective fiction, well, read 'em all, or at least one. (If you're planning on that course of action, try the first in the series, The Big Sleep, included in a similar volume called Stories and Early Novels: Pulp Stories/The Big Sleep/Farewell, My Lovely/The High Window.)Bottom line, this is required reading for anyone who won't read just anything but at the same time doesn't limit themself to Anna Karenina."},{"Title":"Raymond Chandler: Later Novels and Other Writings: The Lady in the Lake / The Little Sister / The Long Goodbye / Playback /Double Indemnity / Selected Essays and Letters (Library of America)","review":"First, let me say that there's a separate volume of Chandler's early novels. As much as I liked this volume, I actually enjoyed the earlier novels just a little bit more and suggest starting there. I started reading one story and wound up going through all of them in both volumes in the space of a few months. I also wound up reading and enjoying all the Dashiell Hammett stories, but I give Chandler a slight edge.I won't try to list all the ways these novels are great and entertaining, but here's one thought that hasn't been mentioned in other reviews. Chandler is excellent at presenting a hero-character who has to worry about money and making a living. Indeed, Chandler makes this issue integral to the character's persona and to the plot line. Yes, the books are escapist in so many ways. Yet, in this respect at least, they are far more realistic than almost all of the fiction, and much of the non-fiction, these days."},{"Title":"Raymond Chandler: Later Novels and Other Writings: The Lady in the Lake / The Little Sister / The Long Goodbye / Playback /Double Indemnity / Selected Essays and Letters (Library of America)","review":"While Hammett may very well have carried the modern hard-boiled mystery forward into the light, Chandler defined it. Of the two, I think I prefer Chandler most. Chandler better than anyone else set the standard for the genre, and laid down the rules to which all the great mystery writers of today rigorously adhere. Here, in brief, is the mystery writer's credo:'But down these mean streets must a man go who himself is neither tarnished nor afraid.'As Chandler remarked in his classic essay, The Simple Art of Murder, Hammett rightly deserves the title of Founder of the modern mystery because he succeeded in giving murder back to the kind of people who commit it. So what kind of person goes up against the kind of people who committ murder? Chandler responds with Exhibit A: Philip Marlowe.Chandler's Marlowe resonates in my favorite mystery romps, the Spenser series, and the archetype also finds its way into more than a few 'Good Cop' dramas.I enjoy the escapades of Philip Marlowe simply because the wry cynicism, coupled with the tough moral fibre to get to the bottom of any affair and see justice (or at least some sort of closure) served, makes for truly fascinating escapist reading. Each of the books in this collection, as in the collection preceding it, amply deliver on this score.If you happen to acquire this masterpiece, never let it go. These are classic books, and will never become dated. I personally prefer The Long Goodbye to The Big Sleep, and found the former a longer and more satisfying read. In every story of both collections, there is to be found a depraved tapestry of gilded greater Los Angeles society, quite literally ripped from the headline news of the day. Most mystery fans will love the idea of an honest man in a thoroughly dishonest world, on a righteous quest for justice.Once you get this triumph of American literature in your hands, mix your favorite drink, disappear to a quiet place with a comfortable chair (with good lighting), and enjoy the Great Master at work. If only more writers could write like this, then I would not need cable TV..."},{"Title":"Raymond Chandler: Later Novels and Other Writings: The Lady in the Lake / The Little Sister / The Long Goodbye / Playback /Double Indemnity / Selected Essays and Letters (Library of America)","review":"I started reading the older novels for a baseline comparison with what I read today. It's also more fun to review a book that doesn't already have hundreds of other reviews - simply in order to avoid repeating. I have a variety of interests but detective novels (well written) have always appealed to me because so much human nature was involved. Even what was supposed to be \\"Fiction\\" likely turns up as \\"Truth in Exercise\\" somewhere along the line - crime and ingenuity are constant companions and the best of the novelists turn that to distinct advantage when striving to entertain us with their own concept of it.Take Raymond Chandler. Even though he is out of the past, Mr. Chandler is a \\"must read\\" if you enjoy detective tales, written, detailed, enhanced to the 9th degree with excellent exchange of dialogue that never misses a beat or a connection to his plot. He \\"sculpts\\" his story - not only of the face of the detective, but of the out-of-the ordinary characters that detective, Phillip Marlowe, meets along the way as well. Marlowe himself is a tarnished hero, but his Chandler-Given basic instinct in his own integrity give us hope as we read; there are a few left to be counted on even through the human frailties. He even throws in a casually undertaken, but carefully worded sex scene or two now and again for heat. A sign of his times emerge in the way the the sex scenes are delivered, but they are quite effective in their undertaking, nonetheless. Maybe that will continue to be \\"part of the charm\\" of the older books; their \\"stern and structured\\" editors served to make them clever rather than graphic in their technique. (Perhaps I should hasten to add that I don't see anything wrong with literary license of today's more graphic scenes, either. A good book is a good book in any era).They are all excellent but in the interests of length, I am focusing on \\"Play Back\\" in this review solely because one unexpected scenario really captured my imagination. In \\"Play Back\\", a sudden, unexpected burst of independent thought occurs in an exclusive hotel lobby with an old man - a character on the side - who somehow comes front and center even though he has not played much of a part in the whole up to that point - who was one of the \\"chosen few\\", born wealthy, built to stay that way, and had nothing more to do but keenly observe the foibles of the others around him, of which he became extraordinarly fine-tuned. It is finesse - the element that sets certain writers apart from the others - and which I have noticed present throughout the books by Chandler I have read; is a remarkable set of ideas the old man in the lobby bounces off the taciturn Marlowe, who is more interested in the immediate whereabouts of an individual he is purusing than in the interesting conversation of a man past his own time.The story starts, of course, with the detective, Marlowe, being hired through an attorney, which gives him \\"privilege\\" to operate through many jurisdictions and precincts of law enforcement as he begins to place the pieces of the puzzle. The attorney is acting as go-between for someone else who wishes the protection of client confidentiality. Marlowe is hired to find a specific girl on the run whose identity has changed - but is offered little else in the way of firm details to go on, which continually prompt him to wonder if she is being located or simply stalked with intent to harm. The girl herself is an unaccountable enigma; part vamp, part sensible but vulnerable, part criminal element within which she exposes and switches off and on as he encounters her. She is the unwilling but unapologetic reason behind several \\"train wrecks\\" along the way, which Marlowe considers just part of his day's work; and money never motivates him. He is immune to the lure of the green and therefore is his own man at all times, finding the truth becomes much easier for him because the haze is absent from his eyes.Chandler's books are carefully contrived intrigue waiting for the reader who wants more than a dime novel delivered with their action. And \\"Library of America\\" is a true and worthy champion of literary causes - a refusal to allow the best to die simply because time passes."},{"Title":"Raymond Chandler: Later Novels and Other Writings: The Lady in the Lake / The Little Sister / The Long Goodbye / Playback /Double Indemnity / Selected Essays and Letters (Library of America)","review":"C-L-A-S-S-I=C HIGH/low notes.

This draws our adventure of the mysterious Hollow Kingdom to a satisfying close. The author seemed notably more comfortable with herself and the tales and maybe it was that the first two books gave her great practice to make a nearly faultless final adventure.Following the death of Marak, Catspaw takes his place as king, preparing to marry Miranda, a human girl raised to be Catspaw's wife by Marak himself. But things quickly don't go as planned when elves return to the kingdom and an offer of an elvish bride pushes Catspaw to renig on his promise to Miranda.Miranda flees the kingdom once she is aware that she's being set aside and all that she was raised to do was for naught. The tales takes a spinning trail through Miranda's plight as she leaves the goblins and finds the elves... or rather the elf lord finds her. Either way, this book certainly redeemed the whole saga with its climatic ending and surprising and pleasant twists.Had the ending of this book not been so gratifying, it would have suffered a lower score. Readers may find Marak Catspaw and Nir the elf lord too irrational for their own good and that in itself causes much conflict between the two races. What also made this book enjoyable was the underlying hint of racism and prejudices. The elves think the goblins barbaric and vice versa. Both peoples saw themselves as the better race and saw all faults and weaknesses only in their enemy.Five bright stars for closing the story of the Hollow Kingdom with a bang. Dunkle proved her mettle in this book and she may just find a niche as popular fantasy writer alongside Sharon Shinn and Robin McKinley."},{"Title":"In the Coils of the Snake: Book III -- The Hollow Kingdom Trilogy","review":"I love this series, I really do. But the second and the third books of this series, in my mind, have steadily declined. Maybe I was too much involved with Kate and Marak's story to want anything else. But I feel that the writing is less impacting. I haven't read such a good teen fiction fantasy series in a while. In the first book, the story was captivating and it drew you in, and a major plus, the characters didn't say stupid things, and romance and kissing wasn't a deluge in the book to add something interesting. But I just didn't feel that way with the subsequent books. Mind you, this book can stand on it's own, but I've placed the first book on a pedestal."},{"Title":"In the Coils of the Snake: Book III -- The Hollow Kingdom Trilogy","review":"If you enjoyed the first two books in this trilogy you will fall in love with this book! In the Coils of the Snake kept me quessing about the ending throughout the whole book! Better than the second book and almost just as good as the first. If you enjoy fantasy, love, and a good story I recommend that you read this book! I promise that you won't be able to put it down!"},{"Title":"In the Coils of the Snake: Book III -- The Hollow Kingdom Trilogy","review":"If you're looking for a fairly light but enjoyable read, In the Coils of the Snake fits the bill pretty well.I'll admit I have some problems with Dunkle's work: I think she has the seeds of some excellent ideas, but doesn't develop them as far as she could have, which ends up weakening her work overall. That and she has a tendency to ignore internal consistancy on small but important things, which drives me batty.First off, Dunkle ended Close Kin with heavy, hit-you-over-the-head-with-the-point-foreshadowing that Til is Bad News, and will cause severe trouble for Catspaw in the future.Fast forward to In the Coils of the Snake: we find that Til continues to be a witch supreme, but now she's left the kingdom for the human world and spends her spite on her daughter, Miranda, earmarked by Marek as Catspaw's bride. What happened to the foreshadowing at the end of Close Kin? Did Dunkle just forget about it?Another quibble: Miranda goes on and on about how Til has abused her--but where's her father in all this? Neither Miranda or Dunkle seem to pay him much attention, though we know from a flashback that he's still alive and hasn't fled the household to get away from his harpy of a wife. So why--if Til's abuse of Miranda is so obvious and frequent--does he never lift a hand to help his daughter? Why, through her frequent bouts of abuse, does Miranda never wonder why her father doesn't try and stop her mother or even seem to think about him at all?It's little things like this that tend to drive me wild, because it shows a lack of concern for consistency and lazyness--it's not that hard to keep track of things like this.Other then that, the book's plot is fine, but thin. It's basically \\"here are the goblins, here are the elves, there are big misunderstandings and Miranda has trouble adjusting to Elf life, but everything's fine in the end.\\" Catspaw continues to be an arrogant, essentially unlikeable jerk, but the narrative does call him on it at several points. Looking at Til's character through the whole series, she's basically a waste of space; what exactly was the point of having her, beside being needed to birth Miranda and mess with her head? So she could cause Kate some angst and have vague threats that she's going to be a threat to goblins thrown around, which are never fulfilled?Kate is Kate and remains awesome. Miranda is difficult, but mostly likeable, and Lir, while a nice and slightly quirky guy, doesn't really have a lot of substance to his character--though Dunkle's elves are the classic \\"play all day, no cares in the world\\" type, so it's not really that surprising.Overall, In the Coils of the Snake falters somewhat but it's still a light, enjoyable read despite the flaws."},{"Title":"In the Coils of the Snake: Book III -- The Hollow Kingdom Trilogy","review":"...still highly enjoyable. Both Miranda and Arianna are well-drawn characters who react quite differently to their new situations. This book gives us more of an insight into the world of the elves than the previous books, but the world of the goblins and humans suffers because of it. Kate, my personal favorite character, is barely in the book at all, Sable is demoted to a plot device, and Emily, who was the focus of the second book, is mentioned in one scene and then disappears completely for the rest of the story. Though this book is a great end to the series and a fine stand-alone volume (Marak Catspaw is great and Seylin is still one of the best characters in the whole trilogy), I would still have liked to have seen more of an attempt to tie the stories together. I would also have liked to have had more of the humans' world also. How many years have passed since Kate and Emily left their family lands? There was less of a sense of time with this story than the previous ones. Still, I really enjoyed the book and I'm sad to see the series over."},{"Title":"In the Coils of the Snake: Book III -- The Hollow Kingdom Trilogy","review":"Sorry, but only 2.5 stars. Such a disappointment. I LOVED book 1The Hollow Kingdom: Book I -- The Hollow Kingdom Trilogy. I \\"liked\\" book 2Close Kin: Book II -- The Hollow Kingdom Trilogy: 2. However, despite some interesting and captivating scenes, this is a boring YA fantasy-romance. More romance than fantasy, but not even much romance.Best were the opening chapters, with a longish yawn in the middle and a wordy info dump about ancient elvish history bogging down what MIGHT have been a much stronger finish. Mind you, some parts were good.Not enough happens. Little to marvel at and fret over. I wanted some captivating tension. I wanted acts of heroic daring-do.Instead, it's poor pitiful Miranda, sad and sometimes mad (not mad enough). And poor scared Arianna, hiding, always hiding from her new husband, Catspaw. She can magically feel people's thoughts but not enough to discern an evil intent to mutilate and disfigure from...a harmless intent to cuddle and kiss. (Huh?) Add to these stirring plot lines some immature posturing between the newly crowned Goblin King and the mysterious Elf Lord, and -- hey presto! -- The Coils of the Snake (no coils. No snake, beyond a mini-scene with the adorable Charm, from book 1).As this story opens, the beloved Goblin King of book 1 is dying (sob). I was intent on that entire scene in the crypt, especially how Marak and his beloved Kate interacted. I also appreciated the notion of measuring out your strength to the last breath, then lying down to peacefully sleep (echoes of Thanatopsis). Well done! A great beginning!But as the story plays out, Seylen becomes the unsung hero, even though he is a secondary character. I found no primary character to adore. Not even Catspaw. Just not enough time with him, for one, and his characterization was uneven. I liked Nir, but ditto. (Dunkle made the same mistake in book 2, creating two romantic relationships, and dedicating insufficient attention to each one.)This is primarily Miranda's story. Despite growing up with Marak's fatherly love for her -- or because of it, in some sense -- she is a desperately needy 17-year-old girl. Her childhood was no picnic. Far from it. At 17, just when she thinks life is looking up, she endures two more heartrending losses. Miranda rebounds by falling for a father figure, someone to replace her beloved Marak -- a MUCH older \\"man\\" (based on the text, I infer that he is 40-ish).NOTE!! The needy heroine engaged in self-mutilation (little cuts) to gain a sense of control during her miserable childhood, and thinks about cutting herself (and killing herself) when her world falls apart AGAIN as a young adult. However, she eventually decides to forevermore scorn such cowardly acts.PROBLEMS with this series as a whole: Kidnapping is an accepted practice; such forced marriages work via Stockholm Syndrome effects. Also, the author created a false dichotomy where beauty is synonymous with weakness and laziness, and ugliness is synonymous with strength and hard work. She needed to iron this out more than she did. 3) Dunkle puts humans in the dark for ever, and yet never addresses the salubrious effects of sunlight (vitamin D, general well-being, sleep-inducer).THEMES in this book: Destiny, courage, suicide, self-mutilation, self-pity, tolerance for differences -- even appreciation of complementary strengths."},{"Title":"In the Coils of the Snake: Book III -- The Hollow Kingdom Trilogy","review":"The thrilling conclusion to a great series. I was elated with how things turned out, yet disappointed that it had ended. If you enjoyed the first two you will love in the coils of the snake!"},{"Title":"In the Coils of the Snake: Book III -- The Hollow Kingdom Trilogy","review":"I do like these covers. The rich, sometimes earthy tones aptly reflect the individual themes of the books, in my opinion. Plus the style of artwork keeps the characters sort of dreamy and vague and I am therefore free to go on picturing them however I please and that is always a good thing. IN THE COILS OF THE SNAKE continues the story of the goblin court and its longtime enemies the \\"we're one step ahead of extinction\\" elves. This third and final volume in the Hollow Kingdom trilogy takes place thirty years afterClose Kin: Book II -- The Hollow Kingdom Trilogyand begins with the unthinkable.Marak is dead. *sob*And as if that isn't enough, we find out that all these years he has been secretly grooming a young human girl to be his son Catspaw's bride when he passes the crown to him. The girl, Miranda, is now living in the hollow hill with them and is utterly bereft now that her one friend (and father-figure) is gone and she is expected to take up the mantle of queen to a young and inexperienced king. Her fragmented life becomes further complicated when, on the eve of their wedding, Catspaw puts her aside in favor of a young elf of impeccable pedigree. The move is without malice, as Catspaw faces a stalemate with the elf lord Nir. Nir offers the young Arianna as part of a peace treaty between his people and the goblins. When Miranda finds out her entire purpose in life no longer exists, she refuses Catspaw's offer of sanctuary and runs away. Right into the clutches of the elf lord, who finds her a very useful sort of hostage indeed.This book held everything I hoped for the conclusion of the trilogy. The story splits its time between Miranda and the elves and Catspaw's difficulties wrangling his elf bride and his attempts to subvert Nir's plans. I wasn't as attached to Catspaw as I was his father (Marak was The Top), so I was not as invested in his story. But Miranda was a lovely, sympathetic character and it was a pleasure to watch her find a place where she felt at home at last. I was also glad to finally find a truly noble elf in Nir, after the painfully vicious and unhappy band inClose Kin: Book II -- The Hollow Kingdom Trilogy. And I had to smile at how frivolous the goblins thought the elves and with what disgust and horror the elves, in turn, viewed the goblins. In the Coils of the Snake also, rather notably, has a proper ending, perfect for the book itself and for the trilogy as a whole."},{"Title":"In the Coils of the Snake: Book III -- The Hollow Kingdom Trilogy","review":"I forgot how much I liked the first book until I read the third book in this series. Miranda is the main character in this book. She lives with her mother who is abusive to her. She does not have any friends, either. The only person that she feels a connection to is Marak, the goblin king. The goblin king told her that she will be the next goblin kings wife, and he grooms her to be a goblin queen.Once Marak dies and his son Catspaw becomes king, Catspaw has 300 days to marry. Miranda moves from her abusive home into the lavish elf queen quarters. Meanwhile, Catspaw looks forward to marrying Miranda, but he meets an elf woman with extraordiary magical abilities. Catspaws duty is to get the best queen for his people. Miranda has no idea that there is another female that could take the role of goblin queen.The characters were well developed and the plot was good. From my description, it sounds something like \\"Days of Our Goblin Lives\\" or some soap opera. However, I am a picky reader, and I liked this book. Unlike other readers, I didn't notice any anti-feminist issues, nor did it offend me in any way, and I am female."},{"Title":"In the Coils of the Snake: Book III -- The Hollow Kingdom Trilogy","review":"I can't think of a better way to end a trilogy than this. I loved the first book of \\"The Hollow Kingdom\\", was reasonably pleased with the second, and now must say that the quality and magic of this third installment compares to the original. Similar emotions of love and despair and choice are brought forth in an imaginative and gratifying way that still has its originality--while the first book dealt with the choice between a human world and that of the fantastic, this deals with people utterly unsure of where they belong, desperate for a real choice.Dunkle's writing is still as lush, simple, and poetic and always, still conjuring up a rather Victorian aura that nods to all the old myths and legends of \\"the little people\\". And yet this particular story has grown to something more akin to what Tolkien would have written for young girls had he ever taken such a genre. Call me crazy, but I relish the clear problems of elf society (too many authors have praised it beyond the ridiculous.) But it is nice to see a few good elves that give plausibility to the story of war and prejudice.The feminists, however, will not be pleased. I hate to say it, but part of me loves the idea of being kidnapped by a roguish goblin to his underground kingdom, and indeed these are books about women who are pretty much at the mercy of the males. And yet... they all strike me as powerful, remarkable girls who always truly have a choice of their fates.Wonderul storytelling to a truly romantic tale. Thank-you!"},{"Title":"In the Coils of the Snake: Book III -- The Hollow Kingdom Trilogy","review":"At first the book seems depressing, and the heroine gets on your nerves, but if you stick with it for a few chapters you get totally sucked into the story. The characters are vivid and realistic, the story line is full of unexpected twists, and the ending is perfect! You even start to feel sympathy and relate to the heroine and she looses her annoying ways. I loved this whole series, it's one I will be rereading many times and I would highly recommended it for the more mature reader."},{"Title":"In the Coils of the Snake: Book III -- The Hollow Kingdom Trilogy","review":"There wasn't nearly as much drama as in the first one. I don't think either the second or this one could ever meassure up to it, but it wasn't a bad story, either. Dunkle jumps far into the future to the death of the king and the crowning of Catspaw. If you are hoping to revisit Emily or Kate, forget it. They are hardly mentioned at all. Instead, the author introduces us to a new character, Miranda. Miranda, apparently, had been promised from before her birth to the goblins when Marak decided to release Til to the human world. Miranda is Til's daughter. Til's temperment does not improve from the second book, being that most of Miranda's childhood consist of her mother berating her to her siblings and staff. All that Miranda has to look forward to are the weekly visits from Marak. Finally, when she turns 17, her death is staged and Miranda is taken down into the goblin city to wed Catspaw and become a queen, only, the day of her wedding she is told by Catspaw he can't marry her. Instead Catspaw must marry an elf girl with great powers. You see, a tribe of elves showed up and according to their treaty with the goblins, they will give the elf girl in exchange for peace.Miranda, runs off thinking she would kill herself, but instead runs right into the arms of Lir, the elf lord, who decides to make her his prisoner.So you see, much different plot and characters, but still an interesting plot line. I think you'll enjoy it."},{"Title":"In the Coils of the Snake: Book III -- The Hollow Kingdom Trilogy","review":"I LOVE THIS SERIES! THe third book has a huge surprise right at the beginning and it is a tear jerker. The book goes on and is a great ending to the series. I love Merek!"},{"Title":"In the Coils of the Snake: Book III -- The Hollow Kingdom Trilogy","review":"As an avid and insatiable reader with a tendency towards fantasy, I have hit my fair share of male-dominated literature. Heroes, not heroines, are prevalent. I understand and accept this, but it is nice to have female role-models in my preferred reading. So I was overjoyed at the prospect of reading a new series which focus on women! I have happy memories of Tamora Pierce's novels and young adult fantasy tales. Perhaps this would add to my collection of books to share with my daughter eventually! Sadly, the further I read into this series, the more depressed I became. I rate the entire series as a whole with three stars because the writing is very solid, the characters are personable, and my own personal quirk; the story is NOT the traditional 'hero - quest - action - happy ending.' I am very taken with the writing, and the style of the tale. However, anyone with strong feminist tendencies will NOT enjoy this series, as the main theme is that of weak women, either through nature; portrayed by elven women, or through environment; displayed with shocking forthrightness by the 'human' sisters and eventual girl-children showcased in the story). These women, time and again, are captured, kidnapped, stolen from their family/culture/preferred reality in order to be forcibly (in yet another brutal and shocking scene from the story - the wedding itself is a horrid travesty) wed to creatures dependent on outside blood to \\"strenghten\\" their genetic line. Despite this brutal introduction to the men of the tale, hardly any time passes before the women (perhaps weak in emotional control and mental powers as well? It's certainly suggested in the storyline) fall helplessly in love with their husbands, and proceed to aid their brutal adopted culture in inflicting the same fate on other helpless women.In a way, I was almost anguished at the quality of this series. It BEGS you to like it, with lyrical prose and a gifted ability to show feeling as well as sense of place. To use such skills to portray a tale so deeply against everything modern women STILL fight to gain... it was saddening. The final straw was the author's website, where she commented that the tales were meant for her own teen and college aged daughters!Read and enjoy, but THINK about what the author presents for you to accept."},{"Title":"Manjack","review":"I can't believe they finally put something like this on audio. It is a very unique audio book which goes to the heart of the matter and never lets up until the last word is read. The stories are well written though some are better then others. The best is Phone Sex track two on CD 1. It truly is funny and quite sexy at the same time. Bob vickery has a talent for showing the erotic side of men on men attraction but also the humorous side as well. His description of the sexual acts are vivid although somewhat repetitive in nature. There are six gay erotic stories presented here read by various male readers who really are the stars of this production. They really get into it; sighing and moaning and exclaiming where appropriate. I really enjoyed listening to them and what fun it was to listen to this kind of stuff while riding a bus or having coffee in a shop. Some of the stories even aroused me thanks to the reader's ability to put me in the middle of things. I was literary laughing out loud with \\"Phone Sex.\\" Mr. Vickery also makes sure that safe sex is the standard of the day and thus where penetration is concerned all the men are wearing condoms. As enjoyable this audio book was there are a few minor complaints. The stories on a whole while exciting are quite vanilla in nature. There isn't even one three way story in the whole book. Mr. Vickers rarely strays away from the buff torso types with flaring big knobs. A better variety of bodies would have given the anthology a more realistic feel. It's not just the buffed muscular men who have sex after all. These types may be Mr. Vickery's forte but they are not the only gay men in town. On a positive note he at least dispenses with penis size say for the last story. It is left up to the listener's imagination to determine how each man is hung although he does a fine description of each man's body. I found this audio book a refreshing and welcoming product which was long overdo. I hope this is the start of a new trend to put erotica on audio and to make more gay books available in this format. Highly recommended but not for the prude. This book contains two CDs and features various narrators which deserve applause."},{"Title":"Manjack","review":"I've been a big fan of Bob Vickery's since his \\"Cocksure\\" and \\"Playbuddies\\" books, and I love the fact that he's offering his stories on CDs now. It's a great idea to have actors narrate erotic stories, and I just wonder why nobody else seems to be doing this. All six stories are hot, and it's hard to choose which one I like the best. Maybe \\"Giving Phone\\", a story about two guys on a phone sex line (with all the sound effects) getting more and more into their dirty talk. \\"Brother John's Traveling Salvation Show\\" is good too, about a drifter who trades sex for rides, and the clueless high school wrestler in \\"Helping Rufus\\" is not only extremely sexy, but funny too. The other stories are great too. I've been listening to Manjack in my car, and it makes the commute to work a lot more fun."},{"Title":"Manjack","review":"I have been reading these one hand friction books for awhile.

This book explains new insight on Jesus' parables, taking in consideration of the Lord's geographical location and culture.It took me a while to read this book. Why? Because this is the type of book that you may want to meditate after reading it. Its not something that you read and let bygones be bygons.This book particularly focuses on what our actions should be as Jesus' followers. It addresses issues like greed or Me-society that we often ignore. I'd like to stress out that Jesus pointed everything plainly for us. This book only reminds us to go back and look deeper within ourselves and question if God is really what motivates us in everything we do.I love this book and will give it to friends I know. Please pray for me so I can share it to others as well, and also put the Jesus' words into action.Thank God."},{"Title":"The Parables: Understanding What Jesus Meant","review":"The first Sunday School class I ever taught was on the parables.

It's still, to my knowledge, the best book out there on the topic of Jesus's parables. There are so many gems in here that I often stop and just relfect and marvel at what I just read. I can't say that for most books: Christian or secular.Inrig is like a gifted preacher, making the Bible come alive and relating its messages to modern-day life in a practical-yet-interesting fashion. Reading this, I would often think, \\"Wow, am I lucky to have found this book; it is fantastic.\\"I used a lot of material from a lot of books that \\"semester,\\" but Inrig's book gave me the most material.

His fresh, biblically aware presentation of twelve parables is just what the doctor ordered for the reader who wants to understand what Jesus' parables meant in their moment and what they mean for today. His style is a model of clarity.I am team-teaching a Sunday school class and had nothing to do with the selection of this text.

It's a little slow at the start, but once things get moving, it become worth the wait. In fact, this was a book in which its ending justified its beginning. It's a fantasy story which reminds us that all fantasy stories do not have to be about Tolkien and such. Every review I see of this book likens it to Alice, Dorothy, and friends.

It's a wonderful attempt to rescue that world from extinction, by giving the reader a new tale to loose his heart to.

Exactly what I wanted."},{"Title":"Degrees of Guilt: Miranda's Story","review":"The notion of three different books by three different authors about the same story, each from a different character's perspective is new to me. I'd enjoyed the Diary series, and thought it was worth picking up the three books just to see how well the concept worked.I actually thought the books by the other two authors were better than this, but only by a small margin. They are all excellent, and reading the same story three different times never got boring because they are all so different, while remaining consistent.In many ways it's so true of life - we really don't know what's going on in other people's heads, especially when it comes to subterfuge and illicit behavior.Three different authors, three different characters, three different styles, one terrific story."},{"Title":"Degrees of Guilt: Miranda's Story","review":"Review by Gigi HoffmanMiranda Sanchez is (what she thinks) a boring high school senior--honor student, editor of the school paper, athlete. She decides to stop being so stuffy and loosen up a little. Her mom, who prefers to be called Shelby, is always telling Miranda to lighten up and have some fun, so Miranda sets out to do that. She begins drinking, starts going to parties, and has fun with her good friend, Kyra. However, Sammy, Miranda's friend and kind-of crush, objects to Miranda's new partying phase.Miranda is confident she has everything under control. She's practically a grown-up, after all. But her partying leads to a big disaster with Sammy, leaving her distraught and heart-broken.In Carlson's book, the story is told from Miranda's side. The writing seems straight from a teen's perspective and tragically realistic. I really felt Miranda's pain and wished that the ending could have been different, but like Miranda discovers, sometimes life doesn't work that way."},{"Title":"Degrees of Guilt: Miranda's Story","review":"This books is very very awesome.Miranda is a supposed good-goody, and when she's told to \\"lighten up,\\" she does so.

RIGHT IS DEAD","review":"The first story is a novella, the tale basically of a Holly Golightly type named Melba Toast who uses men for their money, and her female friend and admirer who is not sure she can or wants to become like Melba. This story and the rest of the short ones are quite different from the ones of Jaffe's usual innocent, naive heroine who has limited insight to her own behavior. The tone is more real, the women are more realistic, and the stories are just more well-written overall. I would recommend this book over any other Jaffe book."},{"Title":"Foghorn Outdoors: Northern California Cabins and Cottages","review":"This is the book I've been looking for! My husband and I like to hike, fish, and generally hang out in beautiful places...and sometimes we just don't want to sleep on the ground or pack a car-load of camping equipment. This book tells me where we can get our outdoor fix and a bed. We know Northern California well but there's lots of places that we didn't know about covered in this guide. The ratings and activity icons make it easy to see how plush or funky the cabin is and what are the nearby outdoor activities. This would be a good gift for Mother's Day or Father's Day."},{"Title":"Foghorn Outdoors: Northern California Cabins and Cottages","review":"I found this book to be an excellent resource. Not only does it provide a wealth of information about available cabin and cottage rentals in northern California, but it provides concise and helpful information concerning recreational opportunities available near each cabin or cottage. I found the book to be well written, easy reading and very user friendly, and I was astounded to learn that there are so many cabins and cottages available for rent in neat places. If you enjoy more privacy than is afforded in motels and bed and breakfasts, you need to own this book."},{"Title":"Foghorn Outdoors: Northern California Cabins and Cottages","review":"I own Tom's camping books and really value them. I bought this book to find cabins for me and my wife to get away to. This is covered in fairly good detail but I take exception to the inclusion of KOA camps that have cabins. I also did a quick web search for a cabin in the certain area and found several not mentioned in the book. While he doesn't claim this to be an exhaustive book I think more options should have been listed in certain areas. This is a good introduction and exposure to what's out there. But you need to do some personal digging to find your own gem possibly not mentioned here."},{"Title":"Foghorn Outdoors: Northern California Cabins and Cottages","review":"This is a sensational book! I don't want to sleep on the ground. I want a bed and privacy. My husband wants to go fishing and golf. This book gives us the opportunity to do trips together and make both of our desires come true. So far we've tried three of the cottages, and they were just as Stephani &amp; Tom said they were. Sounds like they have the dream life!"},{"Title":"An Exposition of Hebrews","review":"This exposition is Arthur Pink at his best. There is no such thing as a bad commentary by Pink. I own 90% of his published writings and in my opinion this is his best work. The Hebrew writer (which Pink makes the best argument I've heard for Paul's authorship) intended for this epistle to show the physical things of the Old Testament as a shadow of the spiritual things in the New Testament. Pink masterfully follows this theme! Mission accomplished! This is definitely written at a college-reading level and a &quot;must read&quot; for every minister who has put his faith in Jesus the Christ."},{"Title":"An Exposition of Hebrews","review":"This review concerns the one-volume commentary, ISBN 0-8010-6857-6.I mainly purchased Pink's commentary because almost without exception, the recently-written commentaries cited his work. I am not seminary-trained; I teach a SS class. This commentary is a great resource for me.Pink wrote this in the mid-20th century, and of course used the KJV for his work. I don't use the KJV, but I found this didn't hurt the use of Pink's work much at all. There were a few sections that had lost a bit of utility, but for the most part, the commentary was valid for the ESV that I use.This commentary is not a scholarly work, and there are no uses of greek or hebrew in the text. It is an expository commentary, and this makes it accessible for those without training in biblical languages (such as myself). Where original languages are referenced, they are transliterated.Pink is not Arminian in his outlook, but unlike some of the older non-Arminian commentaries, he does not follow Calvin or Luther blindly. His work differs from theirs in several places, such as chapter 6. On the whole, the commentary follows the doctrines of grace very well and has no mix of semi-Pelagianism in it.Pink does not include a bibliography, which helps keep the volume uncluttered. Extensive bibliographies are available in newer commentaries (see Word Biblical Commentary, for example) which are more inclusive due to their recent date of publication. He also does not include chapter notes, but cites his sources by name within the chapters. The book is over 1300 pages, and all of it is expository material, so you won't go wanting in any section of the text.This is not a stand-alone commentary; you'll want a more contemporary one to go with it (for reasons stated above), but for sheer volume of exposition on a difficult but critically important book of Scripture, this commentary is a must-have for the student or teacher of the Bible. God has blessed the Church with learned men through history, and A. W. Pink is certainly one of them; I recommend this commentary to one and all."},{"Title":"An Exposition of Hebrews","review":"I started reading Pink about 5 years ago and hav'nt found anything bad yet. I believe his treatment of Hebrews was Exceptional but before you start you may want to finish up any books you have already started. Very indepth!"},{"Title":"An Exposition of Hebrews","review":"This commentary is a must for any serious student of the book of Hebrews. Pink is peerless in his insights and thoroughness."},{"Title":"An Exposition of Hebrews","review":"While Pink's commentary is exemplary, there are, in the first nineteen pages, at least five errors in references. As I have not checked each reference in those pages, I am unsure if there are any more errors in the first nineteen pages or the rest of the commentary. It is probably an editing and not a content problem, but is distressing and would be quite confusing to someone who didn't take the time or have the resources to search out the correct references. The ones in error make no sense in the context."},{"Title":"An Exposition of Hebrews","review":"Just the book I need for a thorough study of Hebrews. Binding and printing great, shipping prompt."},{"Title":"An Exposition of Hebrews","review":"I've always liked Arthur Pink's works but this work on Hebrews stands out as one of his best. At over 1200 pages this commentary is very in depth and densely packed with wonderful insight and thorough exposition. He takes each chapter and unpacks each verse phrase by phrase and word by word. This is no lightweight commentary. Dr. Pink has worked hard to give us a true gift and treasure. Dr. Pink goes in depth without being dry or technical and challenges the reader by offering thought provoking application questions. I am a lay Bible teacher and I found this work very helpful and easy to understand. This commentary should be on the shelf of every serious Bible student."},{"Title":"An Exposition of Hebrews","review":"Good material will aid in lesson preparations; everyone needs insites from godly writers.

Her poems link classical Arab characters with current day capitalistic trends (\\"Zuleika meets the Marlboro man across a delayed green\\"), and are punctuated, in the book's first half, with sometimes hilarious, sometimes poignant Hijab Scenes, where the author encounters everyday prejudice but moves beyond self-pity and anger to humor and celebration. The result is charming and ultimately empowering. The first third of the book tells the plight of the immigrant- the Arab Muslim in particular- and uses the metaphor of landing on the moon. The second third is an ode to women and womanhood, and made me lift my head a little higher when I left the bookstore (this book under my arm.) The last third is a beautiful dialogue on political currents and events, and the poem in which Matisse characters come to life is jaw-dropping. The poetry collection offers something rare and brilliant as a stone: an intellectual journey from which one emerges with voyager dust."},{"Title":"E-mails from Scheherazad (Contemporary Poetry Series)","review":"&quot;E-mails from Scheherazad,&quot; by Mohja Kahf, is an excellent addition to the multiethnic body of U.S. poetry. A short bio at the end of the book notes that Kahf was born in Damascus, Syria, came to the U.S. as a child with her family, and has attained the rank of associate professor at the University of Arkansas.Kahf's poems cover a number of themes: the immigrant experience in America, cultural difference, women's issues, war, violence, and poetry itself. There are several poems that deal with the issue of the veil traditionally worn by Muslim women. A good representative poem is &quot;My Grandmother Washes Her Feet in the Sink of the Bathroom at Sears,&quot; a striking story of cross-cultural tension.Kahf's language is passionate, sometimes witty, and always clear and accessible. Her poems are richly spiced with many cultural references: to Wal-Mart, Robert Frost, Lt. Uhura, the &quot;Rubayat&quot; of Omar Khayyam, MTV, etc. She is particularly searing when reflecting on living in a post-9/11 world. Her compassionate but critical eye captures both the joy and tragedy of life. Highly recommended for college classes, book circles, or individual reading."},{"Title":"E-mails from Scheherazad (Contemporary Poetry Series)","review":"This is a beautiful, moving, witty poetry collection which I recommend to all readers, and to women readers in particular.

A Badass first collection; Kahf wins my vote for poet laureate."},{"Title":"E-mails from Scheherazad (Contemporary Poetry Series)","review":"Mohja's work is a joy to read, even when it is bringing tears to our eyes.

Beginning with a historical overview of the evolution of philosophical materialism and how it relates the history of science. Then he explains how this underpinning of the methodology used by Karl Marx, Frederick Engels, and V.I. Lenin in the Science of Society. He explores both the strengths and limitations of the Dialectical Method and Science as used by these pioneers. Then he explains the relationship between the Physical Universe and life on Earth, Evolution of Life on Earth, biology, consciousness, society and the meaning of life. Without a God life is a celebration to be treasured in, not an affliction to be suffered. Death is a conclusion of life not the major focus of life, as religious philosophers would have you believe. This book ends with one of the most beautiful commemoration of life I have ever read."},{"Title":"Art Spiegelman (The Library of Graphic Novelists)","review":"And I only paid $23 for it. Thankfully the boys at Alternate Universe in Milford, CT are decent people and let me exchange it for a book of Krazy Kat.I'm a pretty huge fan of Spiegelman's work. I even have \\"Breakdowns\\", published in 1977, NOT 1997 like this book seems to believe!Aside from other errors, it was largely padded. He spent nearly a page explaining what the Holocaust was. Furthermore, the information on Spiegelman was mainly gleaned from his comics. That basically means any fan of Spiegelman won't learn anything new. There were some interesting quotes and a few tidbits taken from various interviews with Spiegelman, but it was really nothing new to me.Its redeeming qualities were a few photos I hadn't seen before, but the images were primarily panels from comics of Spiegelman's. It also was a fairly extensive summary of the history of comic art, but that's not exactly why a person would buy this book.Sorry Mr. Forget, but I was unimpressed."},{"Title":"Las aventuras de Gato-gato: The Adventures of Gato-gato (Spanish and English Edition)","review":"Gato-gato is a true feline philosopher!

Bloomfield's &quot;Language&quot; was perhaps the first work of linguistics I ever read, and the principles laid down in it are good and enduring. For linguistics, it's even relatively easy to read, which is saying quite a bit. The emphasis on Amerindian languages may date the text for some readers. I've read the book a number of times, and never without marveling at the treasure house of knowledge it contains. If you have even a passing interest in languages and their development, you should read at least some of Bloomfield."},{"Title":"Language","review":"It's in very good condition when it arrived. I really like it.

It should be noted that since it was originally published in the 1930s, some of the information may be out of date, but most of it isn't. The field of linguistics has expanded since then, but this book is still very relevant, especially the parts relating to borrowing, language change, philology, etc. This book is also great in its scope. It's detailed and gives examples, but it reads well and gives a good introduction to a broad field."},{"Title":"The Health Insurance Primer","review":"I am the general reviewer and editor as well as an author for this text. This book represents the collective efforts of many insurance industry experts as well as staff of the Health Insurance Association of America (HIAA). Our objectives at the outset of this project focused on making this book &quot;reader-friendly.&quot; Chapters are short, terminology is well defined, and topics are very organized and logically placed.We realize health insurance is a complex subject. We attempted to put our familiarity with the subject matter aside and place ourselves in the role of the consumer. The text is written to appeal to those with minimal to moderate knowledge of health insurance matters.This book is appropriate for a wide group of readers. We envisioned audiences well beyond the insurance industry to include students, medical providers and their staffs, attorneys and paralegals, those employed in state and federal government, and even the casual reader who seeks to increase their knowledge of such an important subject.For those wishing to take the exam associated with this book and sponsored by HIAA, an outstanding study guide was designed. The guide will greatly assist the student preparing for the exam. It is comprehensive and covers the majority of testable concepts in the book.I highly recommend this book to anyone seeking to broaden their knowledge of the health insurance field. Reader feedback is welcomed and will be considered in future revisions."},{"Title":"John Roach, maritime entrepreneur;: The years as naval contractor, 1862-1886","review":"The book is subtitled \\"The years as naval contractor, 1862-1866\\" but in fact it covers the whole life of Roach, from his birth to a struggling Irish working class family, his migration to the US at the age of sixteen and his years as an employee of James P. Allaire, his later career as proprietor of the Etna Irons Works and Morgan Iron Works before he even owned his shipyard, and then through his years of shipbuilding until his death in 1878. So it's a pretty comprehensive biography.After the first few chapters on his early life and career though, the book concentrates mostly on his political struggles, of which he had plenty. His first lesson in politics came shortly after the Civil War, when by selling machine tools to the US Navy he inadvertently thwarted a scheme by two established machine tools firms to sell tools at an inflated price. The two disgruntled firms then attempted to get the Roach sale reversed by lobbying Congress, accusing Roach of the very same sharp practices they themselves had planned. Though Roach in the end managed to extricate himself without too much damage to either his reputation or pocketbook, the experience taught him the importance of influence in Washington and he thereafter became a committed lobbyist himself. Ironically, so successful was he at the game that towards the end of his life it came to damage rather than enhance his reputation and business, as his opponents accused him of corruption and of profiting through political patronage rather than by honest endeavour.While the political intrigues are certainly informative and interesting, I personally would have liked a little more information about his shipyard, the ships he built there, and his business dealings in general. The author does state at the outset though that much data about the shipyard has been lost, so it may be he included as much as was available.The most glaring omission though, and one for which there can be no excuse, is the total lack of information about the shipyard's activities after Roach's retirement. Given that the yard remained in the hands of the Roach family for another twenty years - which is actually longer than Roach himself ran it - a few paragraphs at least, if not an additional chapter, would surely have been appropriate, if only for the sake of completion. Alas, there is literally scarcely a word about the yard's activities after 1887. Even the indexed list of ships built by the company, which is very welcome in itself, stops there. For that reason, I cannot give this book the five stars it might otherwise have earned.Otherwise though a worthwhile and interesting tome for anyone with an interest in Roach in particular, or in shipbuilding or late nineteenth century U.S. politics in general."},{"Title":"French Music for Accordion Volume 1 (Mel Bay Presents)","review":"my first objective was to find a book of tunes with a very classic French cafe sort of sound, and this book is great as such. the copyright dates on a lot of the tunes are from the 50's or earlier, and some more recent... all the tunes have that classic sound, and there's a good number of waltzes, though i'd be happy to find another book of more waltzes (volume 2? not sure if it exists...).even if you can't play accordion the melodies can be useful and the chordal accompaniment is not hard to determine and adapt for instance to guitar or piano, though a basic understanding of how chords are indicated on accordion music is needed (not hard to find on line).i just started on accordion and my left and right hand coordination is not up to par for these pieces at all yet. the individual parts are not too hard if you already read music and have a bit of piano experience, but combining the parts on accordion is gonna take some serious work for me. i've practiced the melodies slowly and enjoyed them but i guess an experienced player could make a nice show of some of these pieces, they don't seem watered down at all. i can enjoy just playing the melodies or working on just the left hand chords though, and this collection gives me plenty to strive for and also can be useful for other instruments wanting to play French cafe style melodies. nice price too, and if you're looking for some classic old French cafe vibe, you found it."},{"Title":"French Music for Accordion Volume 1 (Mel Bay Presents)","review":"I have thoroughly enjoyed Mr. Hallar's arrangements. They are well done. Not at all watered-down, as one reviewer pointed out. Yet they are within reach for an intermediate player. I was so impressed with this book that I bought Vol. 2 as well. Vol. 2 is even better - maybe a notch up the difficulty scale with more modulations to unfamiliar key signatures and so on. But every piece has a nugget of worthwhile learning or two for you mind and your fingers as well as being fun to play and enjoyable to hear. Intermediate players - buy this book (and Vol. 2) and your listeners will thank you. Teachers - check this book out and thrill your students with some fun pieces to work on."},{"Title":"French Music for Accordion Volume 1 (Mel Bay Presents)","review":"In a classic case of my eyes being bigger than my stomach, I purchased this book during a buying binge of sheet music, assuming I would be able to blow through these songs in a bout of musical cosmic inflation. I had been playing for a few months, and my confidence was brimming over along with my credit card balance.Alas, this is a great songbook, but not necessarily for beginners. There needs to be a fair amount of dexterity with playing melody chords and reading difficult key changes. I was able to simplify a number of the pieces by mentally excluding some of the harder harmonies, but it's still hard going for a newbie.I would recommend this as a fantastic collection of French music that, if played well, will recreate the sound of sitting in a Parisian cafe on a summer's day. I would also recommend getting about a year of training and practice (perhaps using some lower level Mel Bay books I have reviewed earlier) before taking on this collection."},{"Title":"French Music for Accordion Volume 1 (Mel Bay Presents)","review":"My skill level is probably plain old \\"intermediate\\"--andthis colors what I have to say about this book.I have been very pleased with this anthology.

In between these years, the historically closely tied cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul grew from a \\"collection of huts and shanties\\" to a major national and international center of commerce. With the phone system, up-to-date plumbing, and electricity the cities brought in in the latter 1800s, they began to more and more resemble other major American cities. Wills meticulously follows the rapid growth of the two cities by focusing on the activity of the most important individuals in the area of commerce and the economy. She is methodical and complete in describing their outsized activities and the results of these, for the most part passing over their personalities and personal lives. Even the author's notes over 40 pages are worth going through for the facts and comments found in many. Wills is an assistant professor of history at Brooklyn College, CUNY. What her book lacks in color, it more than makes up for in substance and thoroughness. It's the fundamental economic history on Minneapolis and St. Paul in the middle decades of the 19th century."},{"Title":"Miss Pickerell Goes to Mars","review":"One in a series of charming science adventures for youngsters. Miss Pickerell goes to visit her pet cow one morning and finds a rocketship in the pasture! It's a mission to Mars, and a curious Miss Pickerell finds herself accidentally locked inside! The science is a tad bit dated, being written in the 1950's, but the adventure and fun will introduce scientific concepts to children and may even awake an interest in science. There are many other Miss Pickerell books, in which she visits the Arctic, space stations, lunar colonies, and goes diving in an atomic submarine! Charming fun and adventure with a science backdrop is all too rare. Though a bit out of date science-wise, Miss Pickerell's adventures are sure to be treasured by youngsters.

The backdrop is an imaginative future America (patterned after the Post-Civil War U.S.) where the mining of a power source called &quot;Color&quot; has created a tear in the fabric of reality. Entropy runs rampant and we get an idea of what would happen if the War between Chaos and Law spilled over into OUR world. But the perspective is fresh and incorporates some modern physics such as &quot;fractals&quot; and &quot;scale&quot; to add a degree of science to the fantasy. Even the Gods of Moorcock's Pantheon have been recast as both players and characters in a hugely complex RPG called the &quot;Game of Time.&quot; After a somewhat slow start, I found myself really sucked into this book. It's a tough read and can be confusing at times, although it pulls itself together nicely towards the end. It's basically a fresh spin on classic Moorcock. The sheer creativity of &quot;Blood&quot; shows why Moorcock was, and still is, one of the pioneers in Fantasy/Fiction."},{"Title":"Blood","review":"Okay, it's not the Cornelius books (my personal favorite), it's not the Elric saga, it's not really even Corum, but hey's this is Michael Moorcock we're talking about here. What we seem to have here is Moorcock attempting something new with his tried and true concept of Law versus Chaos and the multiverse and spinning it into something different. So we're faced with a drastically different South where the war between those two opposing factions has basically spilled over onto Earth. Into this comes a bizarre cast of characters such as Jack K (not even attempting that last name), Sam Oakenherst and the Rose, who all wind up being sucked into the Game of Time, whether they want to or not. The book turns out to be highly confusing in parts and the beginning is quite slow, introducing the characters and barely moving the plot forward while doing so. However once everyone gets together and things start happening, the book takes on an almost breakneck pace, almost like it's trying to compensate for the sloth like start. Ideas fly fast and furious around here even in the slow moments, and it sometimes feels like Moorcock is trying to cram several books into one. Surprisingly, I found myself actually caring about the main characters, especially the driven and passionate Jack. Toward the end the book takes on a careening quality, not at all helped by the rather strange Corsairs of the Second Ether sections, which, while good at introducing situations and characters that will become important later in the book, are deeply weird and border on incoherent. The book is almost contradictory, on one hand his descriptions and situations (especially the Second Ether) are almost brilliant in conveying the strange nature of these places, but sometimes you can barely figure out what's going on because so many ideas are being thrown at you for what seems to be little reason. It's a readable, highly enjoyable book which seems to polarize fans something fierce, judging by reaction. Some of that might be because this is such a radical departure for the multiverse concept and something he would run with in other books, but with a little fine tuning, a pretty good book could become a near masterpiece. Give it your time though and you'll find many small rewards to be found."},{"Title":"Blood","review":"This book represents a new departure for Moorcock. It is the first book in which he began to amplify and rationalize his ideas about the Multiverse, drawing on Chaos math as created by Mandelbrot. At the same time it looks backward to the entire Eternal Champion saga, further amplifying and resolving that! If you read this sequence beginning with FABULOUS HARBORS, going on to BLOOD and winding up with THE WAR AMONGST THE ANGELS (maybe take a peek at Moorcock's Multiverse graphic novel!) you will IMHO get a far more coherent picture of the multiverse. Given that Moorcock is telling a multitude of narratives (he once said that an ideal story contains as many narratives as words!) and exploring an extraordinary idea in a classic 'hard science' way, yet also, as in the Cornelius books, DEMONSTRATING the thought processes of the kind of people who would live in such an environment, how they would form relationships, achieve personal stability and so on. Another life lesson for the 21st century ? Urban life requires constant minor shifts of identity and perspective, just as work demands increasing response to immediate stimulii, just as good games do. Moorcock is one of the few writers to celebrate the coming age and isn't a bit scared by the prospect of conventional literacy being under threat. He is already discussing alternatives, as he did in the Cornelius books -- predicting what the technology does and predicting what the technology can do to make human life and love rich, profound and -- totally HUMAN. What always marks Moorcock, in his imaginative fiction as well as his social fiction, is his focus on humanity. Ultimately it is why he stands head and shoulders above most of his contemporaries and is doomed, like Leiber, Dick and Ballard, to name a few, to be forever ahead of his time. Get these books while they are still around. You might not completely understand them now, but you will!"},{"Title":"Blood","review":"MM's &quot;Blood&quot; is likely not everyone's cup of tea.

The confusion however is part of the ride,and by the end of the novel the confusion is washed away andeverything makes sense. The plot revolves around one JackKaraquazian, a gambler in the future of a world which israther different to ours, and the people around him.Exploitation of a new energy source has caused reality tostart breaking down. Allowing an access to another world,the second ether, where roles are assumed and thepaticipants take part in the game of time. This is a verywell written book, and the prose flows beautifully. Adeceptively quiet start leads onto a riotous display ofcolour and imagination, as the novel is played out to itsnatural conclusion. Its originality may take a few bysurprise, and it is difficult to find reference points inother fiction. It is classified a Science Fiction/Fantasynovel, but it has many elements of the literary, morenaturalistic novel, whilst incorporating a great deal ofchaos theory. Each part is broken up by short segmentsof an &quot;ongoing tale&quot;, the story of Captain Billy Bob Beggand her Chaos Engineers. Very difficult to read, highlycompressed fiction, supposedly by Warwick Colvin Jr (one ofMoorcock's Pseudonyms). As Moorcock states, it is notnecessary to read these to understand the rest of the novel;but, they do explain something of the characters that are soimportant in the latter stages of the book. It would beimpossible to display all the nuances and complexities ofthe novel in a short review like this (or even a longerone).Overall a worthwhile book from a great, utterlymodern, author."},{"Title":"Blood","review":"Blood is a book that seems to have too many interesting ideas. Sadly it never focuses on any one of them long enough to become interesting. Too many elements seem to have been tossed in without having any impact on the story, stretching suspension of disbelief beyond all bounds.

Renee, the main character, reflects through years of emotional confusion, relenting over the 'should haves, could haves, would haves,' only to finally learn that embracing the here and now is really what matters. Ms. Webb's writing style is such that the mind's eye vividly recreates every scene, leaving the reader hanging on to every word.

The music, the language, the relationships; the author made those memories come back to life for me. Memories of a first love, first passions, and the trace lingering of those wants continue on throughout life. Ms. Webb stated exactly how many women, like myself, see our past and sometimes daydream about all the 'What if's?'. This book had me hooked right from the first page and I wasn't able to put it down until every word was read. Afterwards, I was left with a sense of knowing that one can never be truly happy in life until we learn to define our own worth. I look forward to reading more of B.A. Webb's work!"},{"Title":"Standing Still","review":"Renee Callahan realized too late that you can't go back.

So why was she digging into the past?Her thoughts went back to that day so long ago in summer school when she met Mike Palenik. He seemed so not like her or her crowd but there was something about him that drew her to him. They became close even when her friends didn't understand it. It was Mike that was her first love, her first sexual encounter and the father of her first child who died prematurely.She began to relive that past in her mind until she had to see him again.

Her hope was to find Mike and together they would see that they were apart too long. But Renee should have known that she broke his heart and when she left him, he not only moved on he found a new life also.A tale of romance that really isn't one that we are used to. It seems more realistic in a way. I feel sorry for Renee holding all that love for so long and never really able to tell him.

The author displays an unusual, albeit ingenious, imagination that opens the book with Out of Control, a short story set in futuristic Canada 2015. It's difficult to suggest favourite as I enjoyed them all, however, the stories which stand out the most include my literary trip to 1636 Transylvania, in Song of Blood, reading of the Secret Societies in Italy, 1500's, through to the year 3000 B.C, Crete in The Double Axe. Oh yes, then another solar system, Star Crossed and then a final pit stop in a parallel universe, Light After Breath. Should you wish to read from the last tale to first you can, as they are standalone stories, and can be read in any order.What I liked about Guilty Pleasures is that with each tale comes a new premise, amalgamated with historical facts and wonderful, descriptive exposition. Every character is written with a fresh, unique outlook on love and life appropriate to the chosen historical era. This fact alone, hooked me from the first sentence, or at least the opening paragraph of each story. Ms Pita varies the pace of her writing, in a well-planned effort to intrigue and arouse the reader. All in all, Maria's ability to mix the erotic pursuits of her characters with entertaining, sometimes shocking twists and turns, ensures a believable, dynamic ending to each self-contained story. Out of the whole collection, there was only one story where the denouement wasn't quite as surprising (or perhaps interesting) as the rest, but that's not a problem, just a different style.It is clear from Maria's writing, she a talented erotic writer who holds a passionate interest in history and their correlating cultures. Some of her stories are slightly peppered with an S&M; flavour, but more often than not, the true sadistic behaviour of her characters are indeed the main source of nourishment and sexual satisfaction. These stories capture a mixture of cruel, sensual overriding power, and exotic scenes; intensifying the creative suspense of an exhilarating read and all consuming passions, not to be missed."},{"Title":"Guilty Pleasures - Historical Erotic Romances","review":"Maria Isabel outdid herself with this anthology of erotic short stories that span the world, time, and those oh so so naughty thoughts and deeds that make erotica so much fun to read .....The 18 stories covering the authors musings' over the years from Toronto in 2015, Zanzibar in the 1800 to Egypt in 1000 BC are also so varied,from the gentlest of stories such as 'The Bride of Christ' where the author totally captures the sweet innocence of the erotic daydreams of a young nun in Portugal in the 17 hundreds, to 'Song of The Blood' a HOT 'no holds barred' erotic, deadly and blood filled sexual perversion of a warrior prince and his 'pit bull on steroids' wife, in Transylvania in 1636.For my particular tastes, 'Secret Societies' from Italy in 1500's is probably some of the best erotica that the author has written.....very much on par, if not better than the best of Eururopen erotica authors over the years....Avery very enjoyable diversion for any mood ....

To my shock, as wonderful as Whips & Whispers was, this book was absolutely awful. The stories are extremely short and barely erotic. On average, they contain about 90% set up (bland discussion of the characters, scene, etc) and 10% \\"action\\" - sexual or otherwise. The interactions between the characters are minimal and superficial, left almost entirely to the reader's imagination. When a story begins to show promise, it ends - leaving the reader to tell any actual story (a task typically assumed by the author).After reading Whips & Whispers, I am beyond shocked by how disappointing this book is. I also purchased Angela's Wolves, figuring that I could take a chance for $0.99. Sadly, Angela's Wolves shared the same flaws as this book: all set up and detail, minimal story that ends after the very first page that finally shows promise. Literally, my responses to the final pages (in Angela's Wolves; the final paragraphs of each story in this book) were \\"okay, this is finally going somewhere good, I will continue reading after all,\\" and then, less than one minute later, \\"or it's just stopping, before actually telling a story.\\" Again, beyond disappointing.I strongly advise that you do NOT buy this book. Based on Angela's Wolves, I strongly recommend that you not buy ANY of Pita's cheap books ($3 or less). I suggest you proceed with caution before buying anything from Pita, with the exception of Whips & Whispers, which I recommend as one of the better books in this genre."},{"Title":"Guilty Pleasures - Historical Erotic Romances","review":"I love historical novels, and that's what I thought this book was, with the added bonus of naughtiness.

Too bad Wade procrastinated too long before signing the contract for the house of his dreams. When he arranges to meet the real estate again, Edie Brand shows up as well. His efforts to sandbag her purchasing the house backfires, and now she's moving into the house he wanted.Edie left L.A. when her contract as a lingerie model was fulfilled. Speculation abounds, but tabloids failed to trace Edie back to her hometown. She's kept a low profile, but the stalker that drove her out of L.A. finds her, leaving a &quot;gift&quot; of handcuffs in a plain box in her mother's kitchen. She doesn't tell anyone of the numerous &quot;gifts&quot; and letters the stalker sent, or just how threatening they have become. The threats drive her out of her mother's house and into a place of her own so she can protect her family from lurking danger. And now Wade has taken it upon himself to protect her.Book two of The Oklahoma All-Girl Brands miniseries continues the excitement with pizzazz in BRAND-NEW HEARTACHE. Maggie Shayne presents a vividly realized, fast paced novel with extraordinary characterizations and a terrific plot. When opposites clash, Edie and Wade find that have quite a lot in common, beginning with hidden interest stemming all the way back to high school.

It was difficult to warm up to the hero and heroine - Edie, a former lingerie model is cold and colorless, she returns to her home town and buys up the property that Wade has always wanted because he ticked her off. This is neither adult nor endearing. He, on the other hand, is your typical alpha male who, in this case 'jerks' off while looking at her layouts in lingerie. Not an attractive trait either. These two people are just not likeable and Edie is so dumb, it's scarey - while she's being stalked, she buys an isolated piece of property. The scene where her sister is being tortured is far too explicit for a category romance and more appropriate to a mainstream thriller.

There seems to be such a rich mine of material here that Appelfeld could work with, but the satire dumbs it up, telling us how to feel. He shys away from making direct statments about the characters or their setting. When you have two dimensional characters, there is little for the reader to do but accept them at face value or not.Perhaps it is the \\"message\\" of the book (a term I hate, since fiction does not have a message, but multiple messages). The characters are drawn in largely negative tones, making it appear that they deserved their fate. In the difficult venture of creating a medium to portray the Holocaust, perhaps this is an angle we don't need.And I write all these things knowing the Appelfield has something to give us.

I liked his style of writing with a story told from a different point of view."},{"Title":"Badenheim 1939","review":"Aharon Appelfeld's beautiful and highly polished novel, Badenheim 1939 was originally published in Hebrew in 1975. Although the Holocaust forms both the historical backdrop of the novel as well as its imaginative focus, it does so from behind-the-scenes and, as such, is subtle and implicit in its assertions, all to its enormous credit.Badenheim 1939 is set at an Austrian vacation resort during the spring of 1939. A seemingly unremarkable assortment of middle-class Jews on holiday have gathered at Badenheim, only to later be united by what would become history's most atrocious turning point. The &quot;Music Festival&quot; resort of Badenheim will, soon enough, become a place of Jewish detainment from which the only exit will be via forced transport to Poland.The vacationers, however, for the most part, remain in blissful unawareness of what is to come. Spring is in the air and summer is about to blossom; the Jews spend their days strolling the hotel gardens, visiting the cities caf&eacute;s, sampling strawberry tartes at the local pastry shops, engaging in sports and bickering, gossiping, bargaining and complaining, much as any other vacationer. The mounting horror, which every reader of this sensitive and elegant book will realize, is made all the greater by the fact that it is a horror the characters simply cannot, or will not, see.Badenheim 1939 is written with an artistic subtlety and insight with which most modern readers remain sadly unfamiliar. Appelfeld's concern, in this book, is with the prelude to the German catastrophe and not with its actual occurrence. The author, himself a Holocaust survivor, makes virtually no mention of the Nazi atrocities and shows no interest in the graphic portrayal of the brutalities committed. Appelfeld is certainly not oblivious to the facts, he simply has chosen to place his focus elsewhere. In Badenheim 1939, the Holocaust is an incipient threat rather than a full-blown horror.Appelfeld's prose is more akin to lyric poetry than to narrative fiction and shows a tremendous gift for rhetorical restraint that is rare among writers. This is a beautiful and quiet tale, exquisitely told with imagery, understatement and indirection. The effects of the narrative accumulate and change in much the same way the seasons do, in increments that are minimal and yet extraordinarily moving. This is history, but it is history perceived at its most mundane. In this remarkable manner, Appelfeld creates something of extraordinary beauty and yet, manages to intensify the tragedy.In the end, Appelfeld's characters do, of course, suffer the horrors that befell all Jews, of every nation, whether directly or indirectly. The genius of Badenheim 1939 lies in its projections of a gradual, incipient menace and its portraits of Jewish reactions, which range from ready adjustment to slowly unfolding despair.It is in the space between the reader's knowledge of what is beginning to unfold for the Jews and the latter's own blindness to it that the book registers its most powerful impact, once again doing so without any direct reference to the ovens, the gas chambers or the camps. Appelfeld's artistic beauty lies in his amazing ability to suggest rather than describe. Giorgio Bassani was able to do something similar in The Garden of the Finzi-Continis but Appelfeld is, perhaps, the more superior.Rarely has the tragic end point of Jewish fate been invoked no clearly and disturbingly and yet so indirectly. We come away from Badenheim 1939 as though from a finely-rendered tone poem, complete with the knowledge that we have been absorbed into a special moment in time and in feeling; in this case, the moment just before the trains departed for Poland, the final pause before the end."},{"Title":"Badenheim 1939","review":"Badenheim is a quiet, idyllic holiday town in Eastern Europe. The 'leader' of the town, Dr Pappenheim, is busy preparing for the annual festival, writing letters and sending telegrams to beg and plead for musicians and artists from Vienna.While the preparations are under way, the Sanitation Department begins quietly undertaking a rigorous inspection of each and every house and shop in Badenheim. Among the many questions asked is how many and who of the residents are Jewish. The vacationers and locals alike think nothing of the questions, nonchalantly confirming or denying their religion, and returning to their food, their wine, their entertainment. Here and there, a few people discuss the increasing powers of the Sanitation Department - they have just recently closed the Post Office - but nobody seems to mind. Badenheim is quiet and peaceful, and that is how they like it.Time passes. The impresario, Dr Pappenheim, is still writing letters, but he senses that they are going off into the void, never to return. A few - very few - letters are still allowed into Badenheim, but for the most part, the Sanitation Department has closed off the city. Guards are posted to deny entry or exit to any man, woman or child of Jewish descent. It happens so slowly that nobody really notices, but at one stage, almost all of the non-Jewish people have gone, and of the tiny trickle of visitors allowed into Badenheim, every person is a Jew.There is a quiet horror to Badenheim 1939. Throughout this very short book, it seems as though with each page, the oppression and terror of World War II is approaching the Jewish people of Badenheim, but they never see it. With every freedom slowly being denied - the shops are closed, the gates are sealed, outside communication is forbidden - the reader is left to wonder if this time, if this time when the Sanitation Department closes the pastry shop, say, will they understand? But they never do. Everything happens over such a long period of time, and so quietly, that nobody really seems to realise when they are suddenly trapped, except for a few minor characters who are slowly going mad, the cracks in the calm facade they have wrapped themselves in widening with every minute.This book is most effective because we know what happened to the Jews post-1939. We know where they are going, and what will likely happen to them. The Sanitation Department assures them that they will be transplanted to Poland, and everything will be fine. They believe because they have to believe. Towards the end of the novel, the razor wire, the guns, the dogs all make an appearance. To ignore what is happening is suicidal, and yet they do. After all, how could a race of people imagine that they would be persecuted in such a terrifying manner? Surely, their minds would shied away from such horrible information, from the mere idea that a man - a country - wanted to eradicate six million of them? And yet, that is what happened, and that is how the novel ends, a perfect, bleak, dark ending that is all the more horrifying for how completely reasonable every single tiny little step leading up to their incarceration inside a derelict train, headed, presumably, for Auschwitz.Badenheim 1939 is a powerful book because it shows how easy it is to accept something unacceptable, if it is presented in small, reasonable, easily palatable pieces. None of these characters are overly bad, or good - they are absolutely normal. They squabble, they argue, they love, they laugh, they sing, they cry. In fact, throughout the entire novel, nothing untoward happens to any of them - except for the encroaching holocaust."},{"Title":"Badenheim 1939","review":"Aharon Appelfeld, one of Israel's greatest writers, has had only a handful of his 40 books translated into English. It's too bad. Then again, it's too bad Appelfeld didn't write \\"Badenheim 1939\\" under the pen name \\"Albert Camus\\" --- if he had, this 148-page novel would be taught alongside \\"The Stranger\\" and regarded, rightly, as a modern classic.Appelfeld is a very unlikely writer. But then, it's remarkable that he's alive. Born in Romania in 1932, he was a quiet boy, an only child. He was just 8 when the Nazis shot his mother and deported him and his father to a concentration camp in the Ukraine, at which point they were separated for twenty years. Aharon escaped to Russia, where he was a shepherd. In 1944, at 12, he joined the Russian Army. When the war ended, he made his way to Italy and, finally, to Palestine. He spoke so many languages he couldn't express himself in any. And he had only a year or two of schooling. But he managed to enroll in college in Jerusalem and, soon after, to begin writing stories in Hebrew.Appelfeld has one great subject: understanding what happened to his people. \\"I'm dealing with a civilization that has been killed,\\" he has said. \\"How to represent it in the most honorable way --- not to equalize it, not to exaggerate, but to find the right proportion to represent it, in human terms.\\" What kept him from depression, bitterness, suicide? \\"I've never been an angry person. This is what saved me.\\"\\"Badenheim 1939\\" --- the first of Appelfeld's books to be translated from Hebrew to English --- is a modest, precise, even-handed tale. As it should be; this is a simple story, of a single season in a resort town favored by Jews. As the novel begins, Spring has arrived. So have the musicians. And the first tourists.Dr. Pappenheim is the local impresario; he's all bustle. Expect to see him at the Post Office, sending telegrams and opening letters. But this season is unlike all others. For one thing, the Sanitation Department has increased powers --- it's now authorized to undertake \\"independent investigations.\\" For reasons not made clear, these investigations include the construction of fences and rolls of barbed wire. Appliances appear, \\"suggestive of preparations for a public celebration.\\" The visitors to the resort expect \\"fun and games.\\"And, indeed, the office of the Sanitation Department is starting to look like a travel agency, thanks to the new signs: \\"The air in Poland is fresher\\" and \\"Get to know the Slavic Culture\\" and \\"Labor is our Life.\\" There's plenty of time to think about those signs; walks are now forbidden, guests must stay on the grounds of the hotel. It's a nice break in a dull day when the Sanitation Department puts maps on Poland on sale.The Post Office closes. Just as well. No mail is arriving --- and who knows if letters are getting out? But more people suddenly show up, all of them Jews. Here for the Music Festival? Apparently not.And now it's Fall. The cakes of summer are no more. Ditto cigarettes. Lunch is barley soup and dry bread. Concern? Bad dreams? Of course. But no one can really believe that what is happening is more than an inconvenience. At worst, a mistake.At last a train appears at the station. An engine with four filthy freight cars. The last paragraph shows how the worst thing you can imagine can be sold to you as something else. How easily you and yours can be lost. And, in one of the greatest sentences ever to end a book, how you can go to your doom still believing it's all going to be okay."},{"Title":"Badenheim 1939","review":"A beautifully haunting tale of people oblivious to the impending doom of Nazism. This book is a must read for everyone; Jewish or not; as a reminder that complacency is as dangerous as ignoring the lessons of history"},{"Title":"Badenheim 1939","review":"Badenheim is a an Austrian resort town whose denizens are almost all Jewish. This short novel describes the reactions of the residents of the town as preparations are made to deport them ' to the East'. It describes the gradual series of changes in which the town is slowly closed down, and its residents denied their privileges and enjoyments. A number of characters stories are highlighted including the Impressario Pappenheim who has for years organized the Music and Dramatic Festivals in the town.The story of a half - Jewish waitress who identifies with the Jews and who injures herself in desperation is also told. Also an assimilated writer who mocks Herzl and Buber and worships the satiricial Karl Kraus is despicted. Most of these characters are living in the delusion that they are about to be deported from Austria to go to a better life in the East, in Poland. Appelfeld is a master of depicting these small games people play with themselves, these small self- deceptions which keep them from facing a horrible truth.In the end the town closes down and the residents and vacationers of Badehnheim are taken away. When four old dirty trains hook up with them they still refuse to see the reality. And the concluding thought of escape is that they must be going 'on a short journey since the cars are so dirty'.Assimilated Jews, often self- hating but even more often painfully human in clinging to delusions of their own normalcy and safety are the subject of this work. It is all prelude to the Disaster and Destruction the Shoah which is to destroy them all."},{"Title":"Badenheim 1939","review":"At first blush, it seemed that author Appelfeld is spotlighting the ignorance of humanity to impending terror by making fun of the characters. But further analysis reveals that Appelfeld in fact was a child when this stain on humanity's history was unfolding. His elders were in fact hiding their heads in the sand, but then so was the entire world. He may in fact then be crying out and trying to understand why the children were betrayed by the only people who could have any influence in trying to save themselves and their children. If his family and friends acted as fools, then that is the way that he portrays them. And just in looking at his writing style, I think that he is outstanding with straightforward sentences, clean dialogue, and implied conclusions."},{"Title":"Badenheim 1939","review":"This is the third book by Aharon Appelfeld that I've read. The other two are memoirs (\\"The Story of a Life\\" and \\"A Table for One\\"), and in both of those I felt I'd come upon treasure. \\"Badenheim 1939\\" is, in the sense of having found treasure, no different for me, but of course it is a novel - based on intense reality.I have read a number of the other Amazon reviews, loved most of them, and cannot hope to match them. I would just like to add a few thoughts of my own.When the original book in Hebrew was first published in Israel, some people attacked Appelfeld, saying he was \\"blaming the victims.\\" He was appalled that anyone should think this. In just the same way, I must object to one of the Amazon reviews which says that Appelfeld's portraits of the characters are \\"satirical\\", that he \\"dumbs them down.\\" I did not experience this at all in my reading of this marvellous and tragic story. The characters are simply human. I recognize parts of all of them, and particularly of the impresario, Dr Pappenheim, who has spent a lifetime at the frustrating task of trying to organize summer festivals and being let down by artists he reveres, so that at first in the season of 1939 he does not stop to realize that the \\"letting down\\" is greater than usual; the answers to letters are actually non-existent; he is attempting to communicate with a void in which Jewish people are no longer recognized. When he does realize, he simply clings to hope. The surprise here is that, the Anschluss having occurred in May 1938, it was an entire year later that Austrians began rounding up \\"foreign\\" Jews and unceremoniously dumping them over the border into Poland, via Slovakia. It is also surprising that Jews were permitted to travel - but obviously such \\"permission\\" was granted with a purpose. One is made aware, though, that while they may not have been collected and dumped prior to this, the Jewish people of Austria had lost literally everything during the spring and summer of 1939, and many were on the verge of death, as evidenced by the pastry cook having to bury the dead shortly after their arrival in Badenheim - these \\"strangers\\" began wandering into town at summer's end, just at the time when Hitler was launching his invasion of Poland. Perhaps this was what he was waiting for before starting his physical extermination of Europe's Jews on a gigantic scale. These people in Badenheim, at their final summer festival, would not have been sent to Auschwitz in 1939, as suggested by one of Amazon's reviewers: Auschwitz did not then exist as a camp of any kind for Jewish people; nor were any extermination centres (specifically for Jews) extant as early as that, although the Nazis had for a while been murdering thousands of Germans they considered \\"unfit for life.\\" In the summer of 1941, Himmler decided that Auschwitz would be one of the new Jewish extermination centres in Poland, and he notified the future Kommandant, Rudolf Hoss, to that effect. This is not to say that Jews were not immediately targeted upon Hitler's invasion of Poland; they were. In 1939 the people of Badenheim were possibly shoved into some crowded little ghetto upon dismounting in Poland from those filthy freight cars, and very probably would soon have died through starvation, shooting or illness. And so the final words of the book are portentous: They did indeed have \\"not far to go.\\"Such portents are scattered throughout \\"Badenheim 1939.\\" An example is the massacre of fish in the aquarium, by blue fish which seemed to be swimming around peacefully: one morning there had been a massacre; all the other fish were dead. The blue invaders had killed them. This is followed by Karl's obsessive concern for other newly introduced fish: Will they live? Another instance is when Pappenheim, noting that his artists are not turning up, says something to the effect that if he had \\"known things were going to turn out like this,\\" he would have made \\"other arrangements.\\" But he continues hoping. Aharon Appelfeld injects these moments with such subtlety that they could go unnoticed, if not for our hindsight.Combined with the portents are moments when Appelfeld uses his own experiences from childhood. In all his literature, he is unable to stray far from his childhood and adolescence; he repeatedly intertwines past and present. There are times when Trude, the chemist's wife, experiences terrible fear, nameless, \\"a fear which is not her own.\\" This takes one back to Aharon, as a seven year-old in 1939, sitting on the floor of his parents' house, crying inconsolably because he is \\"afraid of the lions.\\" There were of course no lions, and the fear felt by the child had been somehow picked up from the adults who were desperately trying to find a country that would take Jewish refugees. A hopeless quest in 1939. The fear was not the child's own; he was suffering from the fear of others, for others.All this is written with a quiet beauty and subtlety that I have never before encountered in a lifetime of books.It is this subtlety that brings me to my argument: The Jewish people in Badenheim during the spring and summer of 1939 were not \\"oblivious\\", as so many Amazon reviewers claim. They were enjoying themselves, yes, and had been perilously doing so since the Anschluss of May 1938, but every single one of them - except perhaps the Polish child prodigy - was aware that each free day could be their last free day. Even in the face of impending horror, Jewish humour comes to the fore, and for me this shows how very aware they were of the danger and finality inherent in their situation.The arrival of the Sanitation Department (how apt, from a Nazi point of view, for the \\"cleansing\\" of their Aryan Europe) comes as no great surprise, and no-one could have been silly enough to imagine that reams of barbed wire and concrete pillars were there to enhance a summer festival. The registration of Jews is also taken in stride, as is the gradual revelation to each other of the musicians' Jewishness: \\"Do I have the honour of addressing an Austrian citizen of Jewish origin?\\" asks Samitzky, in an exchange with Frau Zauberblit which leads them to the decision that they \\"will soon be able to hold a family celebration.\\" \\"Did you ever doubt it?\\" asks Frau Zauberblit. Of course they knew! And humour came to their aid. At the time of registration, Appelfeld writes that \\"A distant dread settled in the eyes of the musicians.\\" Pappenheim attempts to jolly them out of their gloom with \\"I should say that the Sanitation Department wants to boast of its important guests and is thus writing their names down in its Golden Book. Isn't that handsome of them?\\" In another incident, Pappenheim suggests they all belong to the \\"Order of Jewish Nobility.\\" They joke, because their fate is sealed, and there is nothing left but humour, which can lead to hope. This is a very Jewish reaction. I have seen it again and again in Israelis attacked by Arabs, in Israelis who have read the Arab Charter, and in Jews facing naked anti-Semitism.A number of reviewers have hinted at the stupidity of these Jews having a good time, suggesting that they did not know what lay around the corner. I believe that they were far from stupid, that they knew exactly what was happening, and were living from day to day enjoying every moment that they possibly could. Aharon Appelfeld seems, for me at least, to illustrate this to perfection in his exquisite, understated prose, in his humour, in the inexorable driving forward of the story to its end. How are the two robberies from the pharmacy, in the first instance by two despairing men looking for toxic substances, to be explained other than by the fact that the Jews knew? The second break-in was for drugs of any kind, to relieve the stress or to kill themselves if possible. Is this not an indication that they knew? The Jewish \\"strangers\\" being herded daily into town, while there were no newspapers and little mail: Could any Jewish person have been oblivious?Finally, what could Jewish people in Nazi Austria have done, other than what these did? Escape was impossible. Jews were being rounded up throughout the country and segregated into \\"Jewish\\" areas such as Badenheim, to await deportation. Sentries stood at the city's entrances; soldiers and police searched houses and towns, dragging Jews out and holding them without food or water until they could be thrown out, with the assistance of Monsignor Tiso of Slovakia, into Poland. What these Jews of Badenheim did was the most sensible of all options: They stayed together and enjoyed themselves until the last possible moment. With maybe a bit of hope in their hearts, indicated perhaps by the musicians' thieving of valuable objects from the hotel. Wicked, but hopeful!To my mind, \\"Badenheim 1939\\" is as much about the resilience, courage and humour of Jewish people as it is about the sinister presence of Nazis and the ominous, inexorable approach of the destruction of Europe's Jews.A brilliant, under-stated, never-to-be-forgotten book by Aharon Appelfeld."},{"Title":"Badenheim 1939","review":"The story took place right before the Holocaust began, at a Jewish vacation resort. One day, the local authorities shut the place down, but forced those visiting to stay in the resort. Over time, they brought many local Jewish citizens to live within the now guarded gates of the resort.The people in the resort initially thought they were pretty damn lucky. They were able to remain at their favorite resort for free! Authorities brought in cases of food, medications and other necessities and the 'guests' all had themselves a grand old time. As time went on, they started to get restless and worried. The food stopped coming in and they began to live on the luxury goods being kept in the cellar of the main dining hall. Eventually they were fighting one another for food and raiding the stores within the resort.The story was haunting and uncomfortable to read. Of course you know what's going to happen to these people, so as you read their initial thoughts of excitement at staying in the resort, you're filled with dread. Throughout the story they remained full of hope, even in the last pages as the trains came to take them away to the concentration camps.I'd recommend this book to those with an interest in history or the Holocaust but it really was a disturbing book that isn't for the faint of heart."},{"Title":"Badenheim 1939","review":"Aharon Appelfeld did not include the date in his title for this novel, written and first published in Hebrew. To the name of the fictional Austrian town in which the action is located, he instead added the information Ir Nofesh, which Gabriel Josipovici in his Introduction (best treated as an afterword) tells us means literally City of Leisure, but more colloquially Holiday Resort or Spa.To specify the year is to spur recollection that it was in 1939 that the Second World War began. Appelfeld presumably did not want that. His story is of the temporary ghettoization of Badenheim, preparatory to transport of its Jewish residents to Poland - no doubt ultimately to die in the death camps - but he makes no mention in his story of contemporary or recent political developments, and reveals only by degrees that all his principal characters are Jewish.Some of those characters are only half Jewish; some have married out, converted to Christianity, or renounced all religion; some hold exalted positions in academia, the army, commerce; some are mere children; two are the town's middle-aged prostitutes. There is an unborn infant. All are imprisoned in the town and, but for those who, as the months pass, are interred in the makeshift cemetery, and Frau Zauberblit, who is taken back to the sanatorium from which she escaped,* all will ultimately join the long-awaited transport - \\"all sucked in as easily as grains of wheat poured into a funnel\\".Appelfeld is rather fond of Badenheim. It is set in pleasant countryside; the hotel and other facilities are comfortable, if just a little dated; the same goes for the cultural program laid on for summer visitors; and the strawberry tarts are irresistible. Appelfeld relishes Badenheim's residents too. Their reactions to imprisonment and the prospect of deportation vary, but for the most part the Kafkaesque escalation of the powers and activities of the Sanitation Department are accepted without question, and the uncertainties of the longer-term future never confronted. Life's trivialities go on as ever; are even nurtured as a means of evading serious thought.Presented in large print over only 148 pages, this is a short novel and, on the face of it, an easy read. The hard part follows reflection on the dark matter that flows beneath the surface, that forms a lake beyond the perimeter fence. We too can evade such thoughts if we wish, but we will be very much the poorer if we do.* Frau Zauberblit, we might guess, is destined to become a victim of the Nazi euthanasia campaign, an early experiment with Carbon Monoxide asphyxiation and covert cremation."},{"Title":"Badenheim 1939","review":"Badenheim 1939 is the first book of Appelfeld's that I read, many years ago.

I really enjoyed it."},{"Title":"Mr. Timothy : A Novel (P.S.)","review":"Just kidding...i don't think louis bayard is a thief for taking the characters from 'a christmas carol' and creating a sequel. Afterall, scrooge is a minor character here and tiny tim's 'not so tiny any more, that's a fact.' Bayard expands from the point of what became of timothy cratchit after scrooge's conversion. He was as good as his word and looked after his clerk's children, especially timothy, who got all the best doctors, private teachers, and a regular allowance, even in his adulthood. The stipend does not allow luxury, but gives Timothy a rather leisurely life.so what does become of tiny tim? he still has a limp, lives in a brothel, and has become the protector of a reluctant young girl, who apparently has come to the attention of a pedophile ring. for allies, timothy has colin the melodious (ok, maybe bayard did steal the artful dodger and renamed him) and a one-handed sailor named gully. his father has recently died, but timothy still sees his ghost (or at least thinks he does).Timothy is a torn character: he knows he is fortunate to have scrooge as his benefactor, but at the same time abhors his reliance on him; he misses his father, but also remembers his faults. Bayard pulls you in thinking everything must have turned out rosy, but it's not so. I was thoroughly engrossed with this book. I think he captured 1860's london wonderfully. His characters, each and everyone, is fully depicted and engaging. And the book is full of mystery and thrills besides. A masterful work...i hope timothy's adventures continue."},{"Title":"Mr. Timothy : A Novel (P.S.)","review":"Being a big fan of A CHRISTMAS CAROL, I was eager to pick this book up and see where Bayard was going to take Tiny Tim as an emerging adult.I didn't expect what this story had to offer, but as Bayard was loyal to Dickens, he shows us another dark facet of England. The collection and sale (in effect) of very young girls to the upper crust of society. And Mr. Timothy Cratchit as its unlikely hero.The language of the book remained true throughout - and the combination of characters fit all the roles I would have expected in a Dickens tale. And while the story itself sometimes stuttered with strange asides tossed in to create time for other things to happen or to show which character was on which side - it wasn't the story itself I found myself taken by.I particularly enjoyed the italicized letters that Tim wrote to his deceased father. The language and ideas of a life overlooked, of the love one might feel for one's parent not realized until it was too late. Of Tim as an adult trying to realize who he is going to be and not having his father to help him through this hardest of times. And realizing how much irritation and anger and impatience he spent on his father when alive as he is haunted by his father's ghost out of the corner of his eye. All of this as Bayard takes Tim on a journey to seek his own family, his own home.Tim's letters to his father were the icing on the cake that made me truly enjoy this book and this one line in particular cemented Tim's missed feelings - \\"You had spent months, apparently, determining this configuration -- poring over maps, consulting with omnibus drivers, timing every leg of every day's journey. Had I been older, I would have realised: here is a man who wants to come home.\\""},{"Title":"Mr. Timothy : A Novel (P.S.)","review":"Mr. Timothy by Louis Bayard has a fascinating premise -- a character we all know and love, grown up and a different person, trying to solve a mystery. I was never a great fan of A Christmas Carol, but I do love mystery novels, and I decided the concept was interesting enough to read this book.The mystery of the book is not lacking, nor is the action when it actually moves forward. Bayard, through Mr. Timothy's voice, gives excellent detail of what is happening and what Mr. Timothy is seeing and feeling. Mr. Timothy himself is a fascinating character; far more melancholy than one would expect considering how he was in his youth. The explanations for this are plausible and indeed were quite interesting at first. Mr. Timothy's interactions with the town and the people he meets are also interesting at first.Unfortunately, the book does have flaws. Its major flaw is its flow. The book deals predominantly with Mr. Timothy's thoughts, with letters to his dead father inserted in-between the story. However, ultimately, the book takes far too long to go anywhere. Mr. Timothy spends much of his time wallowing in sorrow over what is occurring and making half-hearted attempts to solve the problems. Thus, by the time the plot picks up and the novel has the chance to get interesting, I was already bored and struggling to finish the novel. I did not care about if Mr. Timothy resolved his personal issues; I just wanted to finish the book and move on to something else.Furthermore, while the characters start off promising, as the mystery continues, they slowly degenerate into stereotypes. Mr. Timothy constantly tries to have the two children who help him stay behind, even though they refuse every time and have proven to be valuable. This behavior seems odd anyway when Mr. Timothy never seemed to care much about the boy, and at one point showed no signs of growing to like him. Mr. Timothy then in the very end describes the mystery in the typical detective fashion, making me wonder when he became one. The boy himself, while starting off interesting, quickly appears to be another wild, brave Huckleberry Finn. The girl is tough and refuses to not be involved in the situation despite the danger to her life, which while not overly stereotypical, is not uncommon either. Other characters are similarly lacking in glitter, with the revealing of their motives somehow dull, though in the beginning the characters are interesting.Finally, the characters are clearly invincible, particularly Mr. Timothy. They survive every harm or tragedy that befalls them, and while it is good luck the first few times, it becomes redundant and unrealistic after a while.These are the book's only flaws. The action, once it picks up, is quite interesting and relatively well-detailed; there were only a few moments when I couldn't figure out what exactly was going on. The mystery itself tied together well and generally seemed well thought out as a whole. The explanation of how Mr. Timothy came to be who he is, and the aftermath of his family and Scrooge after A Christmas Story, is also interesting when it doesn't just seem to interrupt the story. The portrayal of the Victorian era also seemed relatively accurate, though I do not have enough research in the subject to say.Ultimately, the book wasn't bad, and it was an interesting read for roughly the first half. However, the story dragged on for too long, destroying my interest and keeping me from enjoying it as much as I should. I would recommend the book for a look at what may happen after A Christmas Story, but there is still plenty to be desired.Happy reading!"},{"Title":"Mr. Timothy : A Novel (P.S.)","review":"I got no traction at all in this book.

He jerks you around, but it is not gratuitous: the story is always moving forward.In the end, the story is one of real charity and kindness.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Mr. Timothy : A Novel (P.S.)","review":"I really enjoyed this novel the characters were great and I wasnt sure where the story was heading but when it started to resemble the movie 'taken' about halfway through it got very interesting."},{"Title":"Mr. Timothy : A Novel (P.S.)","review":"I stumbled on this book and was intrigued by the premise. I often wonder what happens to characters in books outside of what we are told by the narrator. In \\"Mr. Timothy,\\" Louis Bayard addresses that question about Tiny Tim of \\"A Christmas Carol.\\" This was fascinating to read because it raises questions about every well-loved, heartwarming tale we all know. Sure, the characters seem to be one thing on the surface, but what is really going on with them? What will they be like 15 years later?I thought the writing style was excellent - Bayard does a great job of invoking language that is appropriate for the setting. Be prepared for some tough vocab, though. The story is complicated and well-developed. Some of the characters are interesting, but others seem unnecessary because they aren't looked at in enough detail to be significant. This is the kind of book that requires the reader's full attention; don't expect to read this at super-speed or while distracted or you may find yourself missing important bits of the plot.I think describing this as a literary mystery is accurate (\\"thriller\\" is too strong). There is enough intrigue for mystery fans and enough depth for people who are into straight literary fiction. Regardless, I really enjoyed this and will be reading more of Bayard's novels."},{"Title":"Mr. Timothy : A Novel (P.S.)","review":"As readers or, like myself, avowed non-readers of the various novels that purport to be sequels to the great novels (think &quot;Scarlett&quot;) can attest, it is usually a fool's errand to attempt such a thing. But, once in a great while, o.k., probably never before, someone pulls off the trick. That someone is Louis Bayard. Mr. Timothy is, as we realize early on, none other than Tiny Tim Cratchitt, all grown up under the, probably less than we expected, tutelage of his &quot;Uncle&quot; N (for &quot;neezer). He is, at 23 trying to find himself after a life less than splendid, by taking up living quarters in a brothel in the seedier section of London (No, don't bother re-reading that. You read it correctly the first time.) Into his life comes, among other things, a child thief not unlike a certain &quot;dodger&quot;, a frightened (and with good reason) 10 year old Italian girl, several corrupt policemen, a one-handed body retriever, a &quot;Columbo&quot;-lik detective, and some of the most horrendous villains ever written. All of this is recounted in almost magical prose, with a period feel that few other modern authors even approach. &quot;Mr. Timothy&quot; may not be anyone's original idea of how &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot; might continue, but it is absolutely true to the realities of the time and place in which it occured. Indeed, its portrait of London and its people are nothing short of Dickensian. Read this, savor it, and then... readit again!"},{"Title":"Mr. Timothy : A Novel (P.S.)","review":"It is a risky and difficult task to take on a famous piece of literature. Everyone who falls in love with a book likes to imagine how the story continues after the author decides to leave it. A writer who challenges a reader's imagination does so at his own risk. Failures are legion. But that is just what Louis Bayard has decided to do with Mr. Timothy, a novel based on characters from Dickens' A Christmas Carol.As the title suggests, the story focuses on Tiny Tim Cratchit, now grown-up and healthy except for occasional twinges in the leg and a slight limp. Despite the support of the still living and reformed Scrooge, Tim is cast adrift upon the death of his father, Bob, and has thrown his lot in with a group of prostitutes where he earns his room &amp; board by teaching the madam to read and write. While there, he becomes entangled with a young, troubled girl. In the process of trying to save the girl he discovers a ring of slavery and murder.It's quite a plot!--not original but deftly handled and interesting mainly because of the risks he takes with character. Here are characters we know--the Cratchits, Scrooge--who Bayard has made his own without losing touch with the foundations Dickens has laid. Despite the happy ending we might have imagined at the end of A Christmas Carol, Bayard has not hesitated handing around death, weakness and despair to the Cratchits along with strength and goodness. He is not catering to his readers but challenging them, particularly rabid Dickens fans like myself, and he succeeds. Whatever I ultimately felt about the plot, I totally believed that this is what could have become of the Cratchits. Because of that, I enjoyed this novel immensely.And Bayard has added a cast of new characters almost Dickensian in scope and many--Gully, Colin, Philomela, and a host of others--just as memorable. Intertwining these characters and their stories with reminiscences of how the Cratchits got from Dickens to now, Bayard has created a powerful piece of fiction. Having no knowledge of Bayard's other work, I had no idea what to expect from him but I am very pleased with the result and I think any reader, Dickens fan or not, will find a good read here."},{"Title":"Mr. Timothy : A Novel (P.S.)","review":"Tiny Tim is tiny no longer. He is a twenty-three year old man who no longer needs a crutch to walk. The only sign of his childhood malady is a pronounced limp that hurts at certain times of the years. Haunted by his father's death, he has distanced himself from the rest of the Cratchits and even his uncle Ebenezer Scrooge. He lives in a brothel teaching the madam how to read and when his money runs out, he looks for treasures to be found in the Thames River at low tide.One day he finds the dead bodies of two young girls that have a brand on their upper arm, the same type that he saw on a dead child in a London alleyway. When Philomela, a ten year old girl, comes into his life trying to escape a wealthy and powerful aristocrat, Timothy finds that to keep his own humanity he must rescue her from those who branded her and put them out of business.This dark Victorian Gothic is a moving and powerful tale of where good and evil resides side by side in London of 1860. Louis Bayard has written an outstanding morality thriller that has Mr. Timothy risking his own life, time and time again to help a poor and helpless orphaned girl who is already hardened by the knocks life has thrown at her. Timothy finds an unexpectedly ally in a street smart urchin who is wise beyond his years and refuses to let the evil that lurks around each corner get a grip on him.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Mr. Timothy : A Novel (P.S.)","review":"Timothy Cratchitt, now fully grown with his crippling childhood infirmity reduced to a limp and a chronic ache in bad weather, is sadly mindful of his financial dependence on his uncle. Somewhat disappointed in himself for that, he lives in Mrs. Sharpe's brothel, earning his room and board by teaching the madam of the house how to read. He and his dear friend, Captain Gully, scrape together spending money by trolling the Thames for lost treasures and even by recovering the corpses of the odd suicide or murder victim. With the help of a brash, resourceful young street urchin, Colin the Melodious (who also happens to be an exceedingly talented boy treble), Timothy rescues Philomela, a terrified young Italian orphan girl, on the run from an unscrupulous aristocrat who runs a brutal child sex/slavery ring. Using Timothy's powerful and eloquent first person narration, Bayard pulls us relentlessly through a deeply atmospheric Victorian crime story that, oddly enough, will charm readers at the same time as it thrills and horrifies them.The charm arises out of Bayard permitting us to witness Timothy's personal growth as he sadly comes to a realization that, as a young crippled boy, he was entirely self-centred and self-pitying, unaware of his father's strength, self-sacrifice and intense devotion to his family. In an obvious reference to Mr. Timothy's forerunner, Dickens' Christmas Carol, Bayard uses the device of ghostly sightings of Timothy's father and conversations or letters to his deceased father to reveal Timothy's contemplations on his personality, the realization of the magnitude of his losses, the maturation of his relationship with his surviving family members and his uncle \\"Neezer\\" and, ultimately, the release of his father's spirit to its final happy rest.The thrills arise out of hair's breadth escapes, high speed chase scenes (believe it or not!), and Timothy's relentless pursuit of Philomela's abductors to the heart of a crime ring whose perversions will run chills up and down the spines of even the most-hardened readers! The story is driven by extraordinarily well-developed characters, realistic dialogue and quintessential 1860 Victorian London atmosphere and settings. As with any novel that purports to be fundamentally Dickensian in character, there are some positively hilarious comedic moments as well that, rather than distracting from the overall story, simply add to the astounding development of its characters.This novel is a treasure!Paul Weiss"},{"Title":"Mr. Timothy : A Novel (P.S.)","review":"Hopefully, you have not yet read the editorial reviews for this book. If you haven't, please don't do so. They share too much of the story, and are almost a spoiler.As you might know, the title of this book comes from Timothy Cratchit, the Little Timmy from Dickens' A Christmas Carol. Timothy is now a 22 year orphan and lives independently. He is not the cheery little kid from years ago, but kind of a bitter young man. Ebenezer Scrooge (known now as Uncle N), transformed by the Christmas incident of years ago, is a kind and caring old man, looking after Timothy and his siblings.With this background, Mr Bayard develops a mystery thriller. By random reasons, Timothy finds the bodies of two dead girls. Led by the suspicion that both deaths are related, and trying to protect a mysterious third girl he mets, he sets himself to find out what's going on. Who is killing the girls? Why? How to stop him or her?In summary, this is what this work is about.What I liked about this book?- It's a nice thriller. Not full of surprises but, in my opinion, solidly built. After a while you will not want to drop the book, you will want to get to the end and find out all about the crimes.- It's a creative work that takes well-known characters from Dickens and builds a new layer of personality above them (or, putting it in another way, uncovers to the reader some aspects of the characters' personality that were not explored by Dickens)- Mr Bayard has written it reflecting the language of the times. It creates an special ambiance for the book.What is it that I did not enjoy?- The first 80 pages required some extra effort on my part. It takes a while to get used to the language Mr Bayard used (which becomes a plus as the book builds the story). He also takes some time to set it up. As a result, it has a cumbersome and almost boring beginning. Get past through it, and the book becomes quite enjoyable.I recommend this book to anyone that:- Read A Christmas Carol and is open for a follow-up in which the characters have grown, gotten older and changed- Wants to read a fine thrillerI only suggest you not to read it if you don't have the patience for the first 80 pages, or if you are not willing to see changes in the personalities of the old novel's characters.Good read!"},{"Title":"Mr. Timothy : A Novel (P.S.)","review":"I confess that I bought this book because of the gimmick, i.e. Bayard's taking the characters of Dickens' Christmas Carol and then telling us what happened to them in later years. But on reading it, I was surprised and pleased to find that Bayard has produced a novel that is far more than a mere gimmick, showing us Dickens' so-familiar characters through a different perspective, fleshing them out in intruiging ways and then adding in new characters of his own. We see things now through the eyes of a very different Timothy Crachit, a young man who proclaims himself \\"Not so tiny any more, that's a fact\\" in the opening line, struggling both to find his way in the world and to define himself after having spent a lifetime of being defined by others, first by his father and later by Ebenezer Scrooge, whose \\"help\\" Timothy now desperately longs to escape.Here Bayard shows his real mastery, delving deep into Timothy's psyche and showing us a character who sees himself as a character, trapped in narratives not of his choosing: \\"As a narrator, of course, I'm still feeling my way, but I do have quite a lot of practice being narrated.\\" On top of everything else, Timothy is haunted by his recently deceased father, Bob Crachit, in a manner both original and compelling.Added to these familiar ones are a cast of marvelously drawn new characters: Mrs. Sharpe, the brothel mistress who rents a room to Timothy in return for his teaching her to read Robinson Crusoe; Captain Gully, the boatman who dreams of Majorca (when he isn't cursing his neighbor's cats) and with whom Timothy occasionally goes trolling the river looking for bodies; the enterprising street-urchin Colin the Melodious who knows in his heart that Timothy cannot manage without him, and the resourceful young immigrant girl Philomela, around whom the mystery of the novel centers.I cannot praise this book enough. It is much more than a gimmick or a mere mystery as it deals with issues of family - those we're born into and those we later make on our own - of identity, and of coming to terms with the ghosts that haunt us. And the cast of characters are truly memorable and will stay with you long after the read itself. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Mr. Timothy : A Novel (P.S.)","review":"Remember one cold winter's night, a cute little muffin perched atop his father's shoulder,wishing God's blessings upon everyone he met? This Tiny Tim, who helps the reformation of one of literature's best loved misers, has long deserved a tale of his own, and Louis Bayard has granted this request in \\"Mr. Timothy\\".This story's yarn starts at a Tiny Tim of 23, young man, nearly healed leg thanks to the benevolence of his evergiving \\"Uncle N\\". Just burying his father Bob Cratchit, Timothy ventures out in the story to make a name for himself, and his own mark on society. Pulling up digs in of all places a bordello, in which he earns his room by teaching its grand madame the fundementals of reading. Like his uncle, he's haunted by his own ghosts, in the form of his father, whom appears randomly throughout the streets of London through Tim's eyes.Soon, dear Tim meets a waif, the irrepressable \\"Colin the Melodious\\", a nine year old, streetwise urchin who becomes Tim's Dr. Watson, in the case of several girls found dead along his neighborhood streets. For awhile, the branding of a letter \\"G\\" on their forearms is the only clue Tim has, until he meets another waif, Philomena. Beautiful of face inspires Tim to help her, along with a lack of English that hinders him, Philomena is the unwitting center of a mystery that only Tim's pernaciousness will crack.Bayard's writing is both true to the mid-ninteenth century style of Dickens, and enjoyably brisk. Having command over both slower scenes that develop the story, and faster, action packed scenes that become real page turners (one involving a carriage that was simply amazing), Bayard makes this story come alive and a truly enjoyable read. It does take awhile to adjust to the words he uses, and from time to time, his exacting descriptions of 1860's London were a bit much to fuss through. Rest assured, you'll be on your way in the story in no time flat.Do all of our beloved characters of literature grow up? Peter Pan? Tom Sawyer? Tiny Tim? Perhaps, perhaps. This Tiny Tim certainly will not let you down, and you'll enjoy your time spent in London with a cast of characters richly drawn and realized in \\"Mr. Timothy\\"."},{"Title":"Mr. Timothy : A Novel (P.S.)","review":"Tiny Tim from Dickens \\"A Christmas Carol\\" is now all grown up and living in a whore house.

It's not a sequel to A Christmas Carol, as some readers assume. It's a great thriller that makes just the right use of its source material, slyly dropping in details that are a delight if you know your Dickens, but in no way detract if you're just reading it as a tightly contructed historical thriller.Remarkable. Definitely a writer to watch."},{"Title":"Mr. Timothy : A Novel (P.S.)","review":"This book was recommended to me by one of my male friends who is a fairly discriminating reader. I was enthralled in the story and the setting from the first chapter and was sad when it was over.

It was a good read!"},{"Title":"Mr. Timothy : A Novel (P.S.)","review":"I picked up this book unsure of what to expect, and what I found was not what I pictured a tale about Tiny Tim to be. In the end, I think that's to Bayard's credit--this is the story of Grown Up Tim, still grappling with the ghosts of his childhood in that vague way we all do, knowing something isn't quite right but somehow unable to really articulate why.I had a difficult time getting into the book--the first quarter was challenging because I didn't feel like I knew Tim at all and I didn't understand exactly what was going on. Once he started writing letters to Bob Cratchit, I felt his character really came alive and I became more engrossed in the story. And once the mystery really started rolling, it was difficult to put the book down.Though I have some criticisms of the book, my overall feeling is one of great admiration for Bayard's writing, for the characters he created, and for the journey I completed in reading this book. I was left longing for more--more of Tim's and the Cratchits' backstory, more about the future of Tim, Philomela, and Colin--and that is the highest praise I can give a novel."},{"Title":"Mr. Timothy : A Novel (P.S.)","review":"I love the atmosphere in a good Victorian (or faux-Victorian) mystery or thriller. MR. TIMOTHY is a very interesting and well-written entry in this genre. Perhaps the masterpiece, top-of-the-line faux-Victorian I have read is Charles Palliser's THE QUINCUNX but I have been very entertained by MR. TIMOTHY. It presents an excellent character study of the adult that Tiny Tim might have grown to be, is loaded with fascinating Dickensian characters of all walks of life (from men of the peerage to thieves and prostitutes) and the story and characters are so well drawn that you feel you're seeing what's happening, not just reading about it. And I love the ending. That could not have been better, IMO."},{"Title":"Mr. Timothy : A Novel (P.S.)","review":"Did you ever wonder what may have happened to Tiny Tim, the Cratchett family, or old Mr. Scrooge?

I had read the PALE BLUE EYE by the author and enjoyed the mystery with Edgar Allen Poe-so I thought I would give it a try. I am glad I did!The first quarter of the book is rather slow going, but if you stick with it, you will be rewarded with an exciting Dickens-type tale. I especially liked that Timothy had grown into an adult that you would have never imagined from reading CHRISTMAS CAROL and it still worked.

I first learned of it in a mini-review in an entertainment magazine. I wonder that it didn't get more press during its initial release, because this is a book that deserves its place on a shelf with the classics, including those of Dickens himself. I don't suppose it's giving too much away to say that Tiny Tim has lost his father Bob Cratchit, an initial irony that pervades the entire novel, while his benefactor, Scrooge (never referred to as such)remains alive. This is a Victorian murder mystery, a meditation on fathers and sons, and a deeply moving second act for one of the most adored fictional characters of all time. Highly recommended, and high time some trumpets blow to herald this fine piece of literature."},{"Title":"Mr. Timothy : A Novel (P.S.)","review":"Usually I am turned off by an author who rides the coat tails of a previous work of fiction, especially a work as famous as \\"The Christmas Carol\\". Mr. Bayard did a fine job in describing the evolution of the characters lives and create an interresting & fast paced plot in such a way as to make this work very satisfying indeed. There were morals and life truths added and I had some different observations from the other reviewers but will allow the readers their own fresh experience. I recommend this book."},{"Title":"Mr. Timothy : A Novel (P.S.)","review":"The market has recently been deluged with authors trying to out-Mitchell Mitchell, out-Fleming Fleming, or out-Conan Doyle Conan Doyle. Most of these are nothing more than pulp fiction. Bayard's Dickens parody, on the other hand, complements the original in many ways.MR. TIMOTHY does justice to Dickens in the way Bayard handles the grown-up Tim. Besides the limp, this Tiny Tim is nothing like the original. He's a cynical chap who's disappointed in himself for taking Scrooge's money. He's reduced to working in a bawdy house, teaching the madame how to read and write.The plot is rather predictable. Bayard has transplanted a repugnant 21st century curse to the 19th century, pederasty. A young girl is found dead, branded with the letter &quot;G&quot;; then another girl is found with the same brand on her upper arm. The cause of death is unknown but the dead girls have frazzled, bloody fingernails. A homeless waif, Philomela, seems a likely candidate to become the next victim, and Tim becomes her protector.Like Dickens, Bayard does his best work with minor characters. There's an Artful Dodger named Colin the Melodius, who serves as a sidekick to Tim. Then there's Gully, a retired sea captain who trolls the Thames for dead bodies. Timothy sometimes moonlights for Gully. Like Dickens, Bayard gives each of these minor characters a memorable characteristic. In Gully's case it's cats. His landlady is a cat lover; she has dozens of them, and they drive Gully crazy. But without a good villain you don't have much of a story and there's a good one here, in razor-wielding ex-policeman Rebbeck.Timothy is also haunted by the ghost of his father. He sees him everywhere, but when he tries to make contact the man transforms into a stranger. Philomela has the same affliction. It's nice to think that our fathers watch over us, even after death.Sure, some of this is a little hokey, but then again so was Dickens."},{"Title":"Mr. Timothy : A Novel (P.S.)","review":"Mr. Timothy is the story of a grown up \\"Tiny Tim.\\" With his Uncle Ebenezer's (or Uncle \\"N\\") help, Timothy became a man with a slight limp and a great education. Uncle N's help left Timothy with a sense of always wanting something greater than circumstances allowed. After his father's death, Timothy finds himself adrift in Victorian England. He takes residence in a brothel and pays rent by teaching the madam how to read. Traveling through the foggy streets of London and trolling the Thames River for dead bodies with his friend Captain Gully, Timothy discovers the remains of two terrified 10-year old girls with the letter \\"G\\" branded on them. After rescuing a homeless, terrified similar girl named Philomela, Timothy is determined to solve the mystery of what is happening to these young girls. With the help of his young street friend, Colin, the trio has a terrifying and thrilling adventure.While this novel was slow at first, once I got into it, it was hard to put down! The mystery and adventure were thrilling and had me so enraptured I was reading it in the snow outside while my two sons played. I also was intrigued by what happened to Timothy as he grew up and the entire Cratchit family. It was very interesting to ponder what exactly Scrooge's help after A Christmas Carol would do to this family. I loved the Victorian detail. I could see Timothy walking the rough streets of London. Bayard does Dickens justice by not only having a thrilling mystery, but also writing about the tough life that children and working people faced in Victorian London.Overall, if you love Dickens, Victorian London, or just a good historical fiction thriller, I highly recommend this novel."},{"Title":"Mr. Timothy : A Novel (P.S.)","review":"Sometimes it's better not to know what happens to a fictional character after the book in which he or she appears ends. This is the continuation of the life of Tiny Tim, all grown up now and just about free of the physical problem with his leg. While this book is not badly written, and the characters well-drawn, it seems that it takes an awfullly long time to get to the point of the plot. Several times I felt like putting the book down, but I kept on reading in the hope that it would imprve. It does improve, and once it gets started it moves along briskly until the end.

Bayard does a great job of describing Tim's life in 1860 London and his descriptions are detailed enough without being over-bearing.Unlike THE PALE BLUE EYE, which I thought was just a bit too long, this book gave me everything I needed in the story and my interest never wavered.

Timothy sees the ghost of his father wherever he goes, and must eventually come to terms with not only his father's death but his own adolescent behavior and the stresses that Scrooge's generosity put on his family. (Scrooge, though appearing, is never named in the text.) At times the narration slips into sentimentality, particularly when dealing with the father theme. Counteracting this, though, are moments of sensuality and some sensational action, especially a fight on the roof of a racing hansom cab.One thing Bayard does particularly well here is to evoke a vivid, sympathetic character in first person. Timothy's personality clearly has aspects beyond what this text chooses to explore, and though this isn't the kind of book that normally has a sequel, I'd be glad to read one.The language does occasionally slip into anachronism, but I found the errors trivial.Definitely recommended."},{"Title":"Mr. Timothy : A Novel (P.S.)","review":"What initially drew me to this book was the expanding story of Tim Cratchet (tiny Tim of a Christmas Carol). When a Christmas Carol ends, you feel that everyone lives happily ever after because Scrooge uses his money to make everyone's life infinitely better.

He is now grown up and dealing with the tragedy of his father's passing, accepting money didn't make everything better, and finding the courage to help a small girl he barely knows.While I found this book to be very good, I only gave it 4 stars out of 5 because the mystery/suspense story wasn't very original.

An international child-bride kidnapping plot helps Timothy grow beyond the child who owed everything to Ebenezer Scrooge, but we still can hear him say, \\"God bless us, every one!\\" The characters are more flawed and likeable than Dickensian models, the villains are the epitome of evil, and we get to see Tiny Tim become \\"Not so tiny any more.\\""},{"Title":"Mr. Timothy : A Novel (P.S.)","review":"Hurrah for Mr. Bayard!

Ending is extremely touching and beautifully written a la Dickens; also loved clues of Tim's true sexual orientation: point did not dominate but made perfect sense. This one deserves the Masterpiece Theatre treatment--not the usual American-produced lard.A wonderful, multi-tiered read."},{"Title":"Mr. Timothy : A Novel (P.S.)","review":"This book is the continuation of the story of Tiny Tim but as an adult. The part where we see who Tim really is, as opposed to who Tim's parents wanted him to be, was by far the best part of the book. The \\"mystery\\" though was just silly; there is no way that someone in England at that time when confronted with a child rapist wouldn't have murdered him on the spot. And Tim not doing so went completely against who the author had developed as Tim's true nature. There were actions such as this one throughout the book that seemed obviously placed in order to drive the plot forward. Exasperating and annoying."},{"Title":"Mr. Timothy : A Novel (P.S.)","review":"Although Bayard's attempt to imitate Dickensian language and style, he falls short by having a complex, canonized character reduced to a two dimensional shadow of his former self. Initially, Mr. Timothy Cratchit is believable as he strolls thorugh dark, dreary London in pursuit of his dead father's ghost and rememberings of the past. In the end, he resembles something more akin to the protagonist of a Grisham novel with a bit of Anne Rice twist thrown in. When the book and it's characters fall into post-modern literature, we lose any real flavor of the original inspiration for this piece, A Christmas Carol. This book is about as hollow and faded as the year round decorations in &quot;Uncle N's&quot; house...Worth reading if only for Bayard's attempts to extend the life and story of the Cratchit family we all grew to love as children.

That fateful Christmas when young Tim hobbled around in wretched style, old Ebenezer Scrooge spent a fitful night with three ghosts who taught him some hard lessons about stinginess. Now, Louis Bayard shows us Timothy Cratchit in his 23rd year, grown up yet still quite a charmer. And &quot;Uncle N,&quot; despite some unwise money handling, pledges a monthly stipend to Tim and demands very little in return --- just the occasional visit.It is the 1860s, and young Mr. Cratchit has found himself lodging in a bawdy house, tutoring the madam in reading in exchange for the room. He leads a comfortable life, his crutch cast off long ago, leaving him with a limp and some residual stiffness. The only thing haunting him now is his father --- recently dead --- who accompanies him on walks or appears atop stone walls with one leg swinging down or perches himself out on a pier with a fishing pole. Tim composes letters to him, searching for peace from every infraction a child commits against his father in a lifetime. In so doing, he writes some very eloquent words. He comes to understand what the dead need from the living, and what the living seek from the dead.One day, shortly before Christmas, Tim happens upon a small corpse, that of a child in her preteens, branded with a grotesque &quot;G.&quot; Not long after that, he is confronted with another. He can't leave it alone. He finds himself enchanted by the mystery and engrossed in the chase.As Timothy is dealing with his personal ghosts, he catches a glimpse of a girl fleeing through the streets below his window. Their eyes meet for the briefest of moments, but it is long enough to send him in search of her. Colin the Melodious, a shifty youthful character whose trustworthiness is questionable, teams up with Timothy in the quest --- for a fee, of course. Surprisingly, maybe even for Colin, the nocturnal waif is found, a foreign child named Philomela. A bond is quickly formed and the three begin the arduous task of unraveling the mystery of the branded girls while they themselves try to stay alive.As with A CHRISTMAS CAROL, the story takes place one ancient Christmas, with the fogs of London shrouding the streets with the eerie unknown. If any thriller can be said to be heartwarming, this spellbinder from Louis Bayard is just such a thriller. Throughout its too-few pages, Mr. Bayard's characters stay true to themselves and to their time, showing great complexity and some well-placed irreverence. They come fairly alive on the pages.I had never thought of Tiny Tim in his 20s, but Bayard's imagination has blessed us with an excellent look at the fellow as a young adult and fashioned a superb tale at the same time. And if Dickens were here to read MR. TIMOTHY, I believe he might smile broadly, even chuckle, well pleased. It is cleverly written with just the right combination of droll wit, sidelong glances at 19th-century London and headlong suspense.--- Reviewed by Kate Ayers"},{"Title":"Mr. Timothy : A Novel (P.S.)","review":"Mr. Timothy is a wonderful achievement for Louis Bayard, and is full of rip-roaring action set to a wonderfully \\"literary\\" style. Mr. Timothy takes us on the journey of Timothy Cratchet, who with his trusty companions Colin, the Melodious and the enigmatic Philomela, works to break up a sinister pedophile ring reaching high up into the British aristocracy. Bayard has recreated the world of grown-up Timothy Cratchet - the crutch-wielding tyke from Charles Dickens's A Christmas Carol - who is now a \\"mostly able-bodied\\" 23 years old residing in a London whorehouse in exchange for tutoring the madam. He struggles to wean himself from financial dependence on his ancient \\"Uncle\\" Ebenezer Scrooge, and is haunted by the spirit of his late father--a man whose optimism and strength the son feels himself incapable of imitating.We first encounter Timothy, during the Christmas season of 1860. He's vexed by the discovery of two dead 10-year-old girls, each branded with the letter \\"G\\"--one found in an alley, the other fished from the Thames River by Cratchit and his \\"diamond in the rough\\" best friend Gully. What follows, is a tale of horror and a wonderfully breathless flight through the teeming markets, shadowy passageways and the rolling, sinister foggy London of the 1860's. Bayard brings the sights, sounds and smells of 19th century London vividly to life: The smoky, stinky atmosphere of London pubs; the claustrophobic feeling of Mrs. Sharpe's brothel; \\"the kitchen grease, the rat droppings and the spit-laden gin\\"; the muddy streets of London with the \\"shattered frothing cisterns, and the wrenched-off water spouts, clogged with black ice.\\"Totally atmospheric on substance and tone, Bayard reinvents Dickens for the modern reader, and provides us with a very clever story that is perfect for Christmas. You also don't need to have read A Christmas Carol or know anything about the story to enjoy this novel. My only criticism is that I wish Bayard had included some gay content in his story - even a subplot involving a gay or lesbian character would have sufficed for showing us what life may have been like for our community in 1860's England. Nevertheless, Mr. Timothy is a wonderfully inventive and a meticulously researched read.Michael."},{"Title":"Mr. Timothy : A Novel (P.S.)","review":"This book was well written... sometimes. I often found myself wandering while reading it (which is not something I do often) I love books set in this time period so I was sad that I did not like this book. The book started clearly and I knew what was happening and then it got muddled and I would get lost and then found for a chapter and lost again. As I sit right now... I am not entirely sure what was going on in this book. For the readers who can not stay focused do NOT buy this book, for the advanced readers, I would check with the library. This is not one I would spend my money on."},{"Title":"Mr. Timothy : A Novel (P.S.)","review":"Tiny Tim, who dresses out at roughly 5 feet 8 inches in this 'sequel' of sorts to 'A Christmas Carol' is certianly no shrinking violet...at least not in the mind of author Louis Bayard.I am very much a fan of novels that take well-established literary, historical, or film characters, such as Elphaba in Wicked, and give them either a backstory or a 'future' story and tell us more about them....as long as the author either has the imagination to really wow readers with deviation from the tried and true, or can simply write a continuation of the tried and true with plotting that remains true to the character. In my mind, Louis Bayard has accomplished the latter for Tiny Tim with this novel.'Orphaned' now (with both parents having died) and finding himself short on siblings compared with his childhood, Timothy Cratchit dwells in the 'underbelly' of London in his early twenties. He resides in a brothel, teaching the Madam of this establishment to read...at night he trolls the Thames, a la 'Our Mutual Friend' with his friend Captain Gully...and he sees the ghost of his father, Bob Cratchit, everywhere he goes....haunted by a feeling of things unresolved with his father.Mr. Timothy finds himself drawn into a web of betrayal, torture, and murder as he discovers the bodies of two young girls on the London streets...and uncovers a sinister, sadistic plot involving other girls of a similar age. But that's really the most I can give away of the plot that propels this story along. Suffice to say that, along with the mystery element of the tale, author Louis Bayard serves up a cast of characters worthy of Mister Dickens himself (Colin the Melodious, Philomela the orphan girl, Captain Gully the river-trawler, etc.) that certainly provides intrigue and entertainment along the way.While I would have loved a novel of a similar size as 'Drood' (one of my favorite alternate-history works involving author Charles Dickens or his creations), you can't have it all. What I did find in this work was a very enthralling, entertaining story which, though much darker in tone than the cheerful, feel-good ending of 'Christmas Carol', is a very satisfying read.A wonderful Victorian mystery, full of twists and turns, and chock full of suspense, this thrust back into the world of 'Tiny Tim', while not so tiny anymore, is one I will definitely recommend to others."},{"Title":"Mr. Timothy : A Novel (P.S.)","review":"Bayard is not Dickens, but his characters and plot propelled me around Victorian London. As a character, Mr. Timothy is drawn with a complexity that defies prediction of his actions. The two children he partners with feel true, with the charm and courage that Dickens gave the children he wrote about. One cares what happens to all of them, and I assure you, much does happen. I found myself savoring the last few chapters, dreading that time when I would reach the back cover and part company with this fascinating group."},{"Title":"Mr. Timothy : A Novel (P.S.)","review":"Charles Dickens, English literature's unmatched character creator, managed to conjure up the most romantic, sweetly sick, maudlin personality ever to poke his tiny head into our Christmas celebrations. The Cratchit dinner party with Tiny Tim's banal \\"What a goose, Mother!\\" is more than enough to turn the cranberry sour on us. I imagine a much older Timothy Cratchit would cringe hearing the tiresome family stories of his infant self, as we all do when our parents, in a flush of narrative nostalgia show our naked-bottom photos to their friends.Louis Bayard assists Tim Cratchit in finding his own voice and getting some dignity, as well as revenge, in the recent thriller Mr. Timothy. Fed up with being a product of someone else's pity, idealization or philanthropy Tim, upon the death of his father Bob, found his way to the gritty side of Victorian life. Living in a whorehouse, paying his rent through reading tutorials with the resident Madam, Tim acquired an autonomous start, out from the velvet grip of the Cratchits and Scrooge.Robinson Crusoe the book he and the Madam are studying foreshadows many of the themes found in Mr. Timothy: rebellion, autonomy, tortured conscience, and dangerous adventure. Growing up is neither a neat nor tidy process; it requires genuine struggle, true integration of values, and the accepting responsibility. Tim's grown-up life is lived in vital contact with others but not under their shadow. He holds his own among the girls of the trade, those who manage them and those who exploit them.Timothy's maturation is not limited to self-development but extends to genuine care for others less fortunate. Two Victorian waifs Philomela an Italian orphan and Colin a neglected songster and thief are younger prot&eacute;g&eacute;s of the maturing Tim who \\"fathers' them without placing them in his shadow or making them extensions of his own story. While children in their relationship with Tim they nonetheless retain their dignity as individuals.Getting out from beneath someone else's narrative is hard enough but a more difficult feat is doing so while still maintaining respect and understanding for those who have wrongfully treated you. Interspersed in the action are Tim's ghost letters to his father. They acknowledge Bob's flaws and the strange life of the Cratchits, as well as, the deep regret and gratitude that Tim develops for his father and step-uncle Ebenezer. Being a surrogate father puts his own childhood in a more nuanced perspective.Fathers, origins, the maltreatment of children and the creation of broader more humane definition of family are the Dickensian themes that weave their way through the perambulations of Mr. Timothy's dark plot of smuggling, exploitation and murder. Bayard's redrafting of Dickens's Tim Cratchit is more than a self indulgent, postmodern exercise in outfoxing the classics, it is a legitimate help to any reader hoping to deepen and make contextually significant a time-honored modern myth."},{"Title":"Mr. Timothy : A Novel (P.S.)","review":"Mr. Timothy is an engrossing tale from start to finish.Beautifully crafted, the story and descriptions of 1800's London flow like colorful poetry.Dickens leaves Tiny Tim as a tyke,wishing everyone blessings on Christmas.Bayard continues the tale with an adult, crutchless Tiny Tim, who boards in a brothel and fishes corpses out of the Thames for a bit of pocket money.If you haven't yet read Mr. Timothy, head to the nearest library today--check it out, or buy it, but don't miss it!"},{"Title":"Mr. Timothy : A Novel (P.S.)","review":"Just came across this review I wrote after reading Mr. Timothy in 2007. I didn't remember enjoying this book so much.For once the book lived up to the accolades of the critics. A very good read, as the Entertainment Weekly review stated:\\"There's not one throwaway sentence in this fabulous ...mystery.... Shimmering, knock-your-socks-off language...a subtle character examination, and a page turning plot, one truly engaging book.\\"If an actor can carry a major movie cast, then the writing in this book carried a story that was average. I will admit though, the ending touched my heartstrings. I believe it's ending may have been the emotional climax of the story. The writing was wonderful.The writer, Louis Bayard, used words and sentences to illuminate every crevice of the characters, their settings and circumstances. Not many books ending so subtly can give me as surprising a jolt as Mr. Timothy did.Each supporting character made an impression. Colin the artful dodger, Philomela the survivor, Gully the sailor on land, and stealing a chapter while coming to the rescue of Mr. Timothy was Squidgy. Chief Magistrate Squidgy. The same Squidgy that was into S&M; at Mrs. Sharpe's house of ill-repute, Mr. Timothy's dwellings.Yes, this Victorian novel would have done Charles Dickens proud.It's made me want to watch \\"A Christmas Carol\\" once again just to see Tiny Tim and his father during those times.For those critics who found the story uncomfortable in its dealings with child prostitution and 1800's vice, stop being prudes. It is what it is. Life has not been a box of chocolates for everyone; many poor folks suffered back then, suffer today and will suffer in the future. That is life.Again, I can't remember reading sentences that rang so poetic yet easy to understand and fit perfectly into the story. The writing flowed and brought the characters and the times to life. With the 384 pages of small print it felt like you were reading a huge 900 page novel, like when I read The Crimson Petal and the White. But this story kept a good pace and didn't drag in parts. Sure it may have been kind of predictable but you knew all would end well. Again, the writing brought so much joy to it that you wouldn't mind if the story just went on and on.Hats off to Mr. Louis Bayard for such a well written and soulful book.Mr. Timothy."},{"Title":"Mr. Timothy : A Novel (P.S.)","review":"All I can say when I read an extraordinary book that I mistakenly discovered is Wow! Mr. Timothy is one of those books and Louis Bayard is one hell of a fine writer. In the age of empty-headed Hollywood-esque tripe it is refreshing to find an author with a flair for craft and a talent for storytelling. Mr. Timothy is the latter account of Bob Crachitt's young lame son Tiny Tim from Dickens' A Christmas Carol. Late 19th century London. The corpses of little girls showing up with the letter G branded onto their flesh. Dark. Stunning. Gritty. Bayard takes us on a jouney through the teeming city and spares no expense in making the reader realize what life in that day in that city was really like. No sugar glaze here. Stripped back and raw, like an open wound is what Bayard is going for. And his crafted words are so Dickensian, so relevant, that not a single breath is wasted on nonsense. Not since mark Frost's The List of 7 or Caleb Carr's The Alienist have I been this riveted in a period piece. Extraordinary! He reminds me of a budding Dan Simmons and that is a great thing!Dig it!"},{"Title":"Mr. Timothy : A Novel (P.S.)","review":"Author Louis Bayard takes a long, hard look at the child character Timothy \\"Tiny Tim\\" Cratchit of Charles Dickens' \\"A Christmas Carol\\" and constructs a fully realized and completely plausible adult version, complete with neuroses, uncertainty and the directionlessness of young adulthood. Mr. Timothy, as he is now known, lives a dissolute, aimless life on the fringers of 19th century London society, or at least he does until he repeatedly spots a young homeless girl who, for reasons he doesn't fully understand, seems to call to him.The life of the girl rapidly intertwines with that of Mr. Timothy, and before long, the title character finds himself deeply enmeshed in a web of depravity, deceit and danger, involving not just sinister, corrupt policemen, but a chillingly charming aristocrat, and potentially, even some he thought to be friends.On top of all that, Mr. Bayard writes in gorgeous sentences that are simply a joy to read, and while there are some cliched characters here that keep the book from reaching a full five stars, \\"Mr. Timothy\\" remains a worthy, thoroughly enjoyable read."},{"Title":"Mr. Timothy : A Novel (P.S.)","review":"The title character in this Victorian-era thriller is none other than Tiny Tim of Dicken's \\"Christmas Carol.\\" He has outgrown his cane and is trying to outgrow the financial aid of \\"Uncle\\" Ebenezer. He now lives in a bordello and in his spare time helps a friend dredge bodies out of the Thames, searching pockets for any leftover trinkets. When Timothy discovers the bodies of two dead girls with similar brands on their upper-arms, he becomes an amateur sleuth in a yarn that brings to mind The Alienist. This is a fun updating of a well-loved literary character that is also a page-turning mystery."},{"Title":"Mr. Timothy : A Novel (P.S.)","review":"I read this novel over a year ago. I confess I picked it up being curious about what the author had planned for one of the most loved literary characters in English literature. To be honest I never expected what I got. For that reason,the popular perception of the main character and the nature of the plot, I thought a forewarning might be beneficial for potential readers.The author does present his story well but like Caleb Carr in The Alienist-and consider this a spoiler-it deals with one of harsh and unsavory realities of the underworld of the Victorian age-child prostitution(where for a time the age of consent was as young as 12 and virginity was a commodity to be bought and sold) and all the ugliness that may imply to the modern reader. Banyon does not take a Dicken's approach. Some of the images may be too graphic for the sensitive reader and those uninitiated into this kind of Victorian world and writers like Carr,who I do think is a masterful writer."},{"Title":"Mr. Timothy : A Novel (P.S.)","review":"This book will be most appealing to those who know least about 19th-Century England. It's an entertaining story marred by scores of obvious mistakes--Bayard undertook the very ambitious project of writing in Victorian English, and his language often rings false to my ears. A typical example is the use of \\"fall\\" for autumn, which is quite rare in British English except for the expressions \\"spring and fall\\" and \\"fall of the year.\\" And his Cockney characters add an \\"s\\" to infinitives, which I have never heard of in any dialect of English. Bayard also seems to think that a belief in the Trinity is characteristic of \\"papists\\" as opposed to Anglicans.Of course, lots of people won't notice or won't care about such things, and they should find Mr. Timothy engaging, if somewhat conventionally melodramatic toward the end.
