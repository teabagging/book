If you are thin AND apple shape (can not loose weight!), you are doom to have more cardiovascular risk than pear shape women PLUS all the esthetic problems (trouble finding clothes, you are not in the \\"norm\\" -most women are pear shape, apple fat distribution is really ugly) so I would love if those professionnals would come one day with a real solution to this problem for women!!!"},{"Title":"Apples & Pears : The Body Shape Solution for Weight Loss and Wellness","review":"Excellent information, easy to read and understand. I am a nurse who stays up on current research, and this information is cutting edge evidence based! This book is filled with practical advice for applying the information to improve your health (by reducing your risk factors)Dr. Savard actively promotes patient advocacy and this book gives very clear advice about approaching your doctor about your health concerns, while informing you about what your concerns should be.What I especially love is that she describes the research in terms that the average person can understand which helps the average person make up their own minds on what the research means."},{"Title":"Apples & Pears : The Body Shape Solution for Weight Loss and Wellness","review":"When I first read this book I was all fired up to get started. Then I had another baby. Have not looked at it since. I did add soy to my diet and am keeping my waist below the 35 inches for risk of heart issues.

Apples & Pears gives us scientific, proven information on how to live a longer, healthier life. Dr. Savard presents the information in a straightforward, no-nonsense way that makes even the doubters among us say, \\"I can do this!\\" Just before I read the book, I was told that I had an extremely high CRP level.

Could it be that you need to manage your stress and then think about losing weight?Further, the diet she advises for apple types is high in grains and fruit, which many people don't do well on. I'm an apple type, and I do best on lots of vegetables, less grains and fruit.I would recommend The Metabolic Typing Diet instead. Also, if you are under stress, please investigate the herbs holy basil (which can help limit the negative effects of cortisol) and ashwaganda (an adaptogen).

Losing weight, however is the same ole excercise, low cal diet, etc. She tries to suggest what foods each type should avoid and I did not really buy that."},{"Title":"Apples & Pears : The Body Shape Solution for Weight Loss and Wellness","review":"As a sportif healthy female, I have always pooh-poohed diet trends and health guidelines. I couldn't be bothered having someone dictate a cookie-cutter approach to women's health. Honestly, Dr.Savard's book is user-friendly and easy and fascinating to read. I bought copies for my two teenage daughters. We are having fun deciding if we are apples or pears. Moreover, it is advice that really makes sense to me and discusses not only physical health but mental health. Easy steps to follow which food groups are encouraged or discouraged according to your body type and which diseases one is prone to as an apple or pear. Thank you.

After processing,the proteins contained in soy are so denatured and useless to the human body,not to mention some of the carcinogenic by-products that result from the production of soy foods.DO NOT fall for the belief that Asian cultures have subsisted on soy foods for ages, they have not.In fact, most Asian cultures eat a lot of pork and chicken,they have never in their history replaced traditional foods with soy.Organic free-range chicken,turkey,cornish hen,beef,venison,lamb and pork should be classified as elite foods on the meat lists.Lowfat(1%)organic hormone free milk should be classified as an elite food on the dairy list.And contrary to popular belief,butter should also be included as an elite food item because of the butyric acid that it contains,it has a history of obliterating malignant cell lines in the colon and also contrary to popular belief the short chain fatty acid has minimal effects on LDL cholesterol.I have studied nutritional biochemistry for 10 years and the soy producers are hyping a product that has a reputation of being questionable in many human and animal studies and conveniently making these claims to the US dept of Agriculture and the FDA without presenting all of the scientific evidence."},{"Title":"Apples & Pears : The Body Shape Solution for Weight Loss and Wellness","review":"This book was such an easy read that it was fun.

Looking back on the hundreds of women that I have treated in my medical practice, I now see this very clearly. Before reading Apples and Pears, I didn't have that kind of perspective. This book is one of a kind in that it is truly revolutionary, yet based on hard science. As a physician, I will recommend Apples and Pears to all my female patients, so that they'll have the tools they need to improve their health while they learn to love and accept their bodies.

With the insights and well researched wealth of information offered in Dr. Savard's book, I am eating and exercising with a better understanding of how my activities and choices affect my health and well-being.

This book is a MUST READ!!!"},{"Title":"Apples & Pears : The Body Shape Solution for Weight Loss and Wellness","review":"If you're an apple shape you won't feel very good about yourself after reading this book. The book goes into detail about all the various apple related health problems - cardiovascular, reproductive, even psychological (apparently, apple shapes suffer from more stress and depression - yet pear shapes suffer from more body image problems?!?) Additionally, there seemed to be a lot of words of encouragement for pears and virtually none for apples - and since apples are apparently at such a higher risk for all of these unpleasant conditions (again, everything from psycholgical to hormonal to vascular) aren't we the ones that need the words of encouragement? It didn't make me feel too good to read that even if I lose as much weight as I possibly can (and do it in the healthiest manner possible), I'm still an apple shape and therefore still at a higher risk for the above said problems. I find that hard to believe.If you're pear shaped and don't like your body, read this book - I guarantee you'll feel better about yourself after. If you're apple shaped, DO NOT read this book. It will only make you feel worse. If you're an apple who has struggled with your weight for years (like me) you most likely know that carrying excess weight around your middle is not healthy - you don't need to read a whole book devoted to explaining how bad it is.If you're an apple shape looking for advice on whittling your waistline, read The Abs Diet instead."},{"Title":"Apples & Pears : The Body Shape Solution for Weight Loss and Wellness","review":"I picked up this book when I was frustrated over hitting a plateau and couldn't understand why things weren't working. Afterall, I was exercising five days, sometimes six, a week. I was eating low-carb and not getting to my goal. I've always known I was an apple girl, but I didn't know what to do with that information. Dr. Savard's book really put me at ease and opened my eyes! I now have real, honest advice that is not another gimmick. And it's about so much more than your diet...it's about your overall health as a woman. I've lost half an inch around my waist and I feel less cranky and tired. I'm relieved to know that apples can have healthy bread and eat fruit! So, it's an apple a day for me. :-)"},{"Title":"Apples & Pears : The Body Shape Solution for Weight Loss and Wellness","review":"I've never been so happy about my big thighs!

After reading this book, I wander around looking at women saying to myself... you're an Apple, Apple, Pear, Pear, Pear... it's so fun.Learn what you can do to protect yourself, your family and your friends.

I've now cut out the cheese and other high fat products, returned to eating my oatmeal and fruits (but still cutting out white flour and sugar!) exercising more with strength training, and I feel completely different.

It is truly ground-breaking in positioning body shape as both a predictor of medical risk and guide for many medical and health decisions and choices for women. The book synthesizes an enormous amount of research on women's health and \\"connects the dots\\" as it relates to the fundamental issue of body shape. Not only is the book a wealth of empowering information, it is written in a disarmingly engaging style. It feels like you're in a private conversation with Dr Savard, sitting in her office, reviewing and discussing your personal health history, concerns and priorities! I believe we will see the influence of Dr Savard's work on many levels, including in the offices of many enlightened physicians throughout the nation."},{"Title":"Apples & Pears : The Body Shape Solution for Weight Loss and Wellness","review":"The program in this book is so easy and produces great results. I have been on it for 8 weeks and have lost 3.25 inches around my waist, 7 pounds and lowered my cholesterol by 33 points. It is easy to read and understand with simple charts for knowing what to eat. No more measuring or counting calories. The concept is to concentrate on losing inches instead of pounds for optimal health. I thought that I had no choice but to be a fat apple after gaining 1\\" in waist size for each pound gained after menapause. I thought this was my heredity and destiny, based on the body shapes of my mother an aunts. Not so, I am finding out.

I was intrigued by the way Dr. Savard approached the issue of nutrition and wellness. Instead of convincing me to hate my body and then try to change it, Dr. Savard helped me to understand and appreciate my pear shape which, in turn, motivated me to want to work on my body.

I strongly recommend Apples and Pears to all women who want to have a healthy long life."},{"Title":"Apples & Pears : The Body Shape Solution for Weight Loss and Wellness","review":"1. First I only gave this book 4 stars because the printing of the type was very poor. I have never seen a book that didn't have solid black type. It looks like the printer was running low on ink and didn't want to change it.2.I loved that the authors worked very hard to make woman feel better about the way they look. Especially pear (curvy or hour glass figured)woman.3. There is a lot of medical jargon in this book and at times its hard to follow when that part does not apply to you. However I feel like I could have started reading the diet portion of the book first and save the medical stuff for later. The medical stuff is very helpful and should be read, its just most of us want to get down to the diet part.4. The diet is easy to follow and forces on whole foods. The book looks at the psychology of what makes us overeat and how to quit. The book gives a list of foods you can have an unlimited amount of. Which is wonderful for me because I found a few things that will satisfies my need to crunch or my need for sweet foods. There are a few prepared foods the diet suggests but for the most part in wants strictly whole foods.5. I wish there was an online forum so that people can take about their ideas and consurns with the diet but I have not been able to find one."},{"Title":"Apples & Pears : The Body Shape Solution for Weight Loss and Wellness","review":"A must read for anyone concerned about their health, fitness, and yes, their apperance. You know; what looks back at you when you stand in front of a mirror. Dr Savard's vast knowlege, unique perspective and sound logic are a delight to explore and comprehend. The book also reeks of genuine understanding and good will. I especially enjoyed the apple/pear metaphor as it pertains to my shape, my unending dead end weight loss schemes and my great need (quest) for a sense of permanent well being. By the way, I'm a pear and having that basic understanding, knowing that simple fact, has permitted me to recognize why I am what I am and where I can go from there. Now, that's empowerment. But much, much more importantly, the book has given me a better personal understanding of myself, and perhaps, a better sense of foregiveness and understanding of things I can and can't change.

I was absorbed by the mystery, and by the author's obvious knowledge of the art and the art world. A real page turner"},{"Title":"Harmony In Flesh And Black","review":"The Publisher's Weekly review above gives you the jist of the plot of Harmony in Flesh and Black, and hints at the strange prose. I won't bother with further plot detail, but you should be aware of just how weird this prose it. Here's an example. Our hero has just walked in to a copy store:\\"Two seedy academics of the male persuasion, burning their own midnight oil, were already waiting, and Fred was behind them. Each was burdened with extraordinary complexity in his approach to the copying experience.\\"To me this is the kind of writing that even a vanity press should turn down. Male persuasion? Complexity in getting a document copied? I love novels that deal with art, but struggling through this creative writing class reject was a teeth grinding experience. The sort of book that once you put it down you have a hard time picking it up again. My copy of the book was a Phoenix library discard. It was in pristine condition, and never had been checked out. I'm impressed by the sophistication of the citizens of Phoenix."},{"Title":"Harmony In Flesh And Black","review":"Art with its sublime beauty should inspire people to be better. Paradoxically, art also attracts those who are obsessively interested in control and others who want money and power. The art itself often suffers amid the cross-currents that those who are drawn to art bring.Harmony in Flesh and Black is excellent at exposing the darker side of human nature as expressed in the art world (although not among artists themselves). If the novel had focused solely on that message, I would have liked the book better. There's an intriguing story line about appreciating hidden beauties that can best be revealed through research and well-aimed speculation.But the book becomes mucked up with a very sleazy fellow who never saw a fast buck that he didn't like. I found myself feeling dirty from having read about this character. I admire writing that can make me have such a strong reaction . . . but I don't have to be attracted to that kind of writing.The book has a crime and a mystery to solve, but I felt that the mystery element detracted from rather than added to the book. The art mystery and maneuvering would have been enough for me."},{"Title":"The Life and Epistles of St. Paul","review":"From the first paragraph of their introduction: &quot;The purpose of this work is to give a living picture of St. Paul himself, and of the circumstances by which he was surrounded.&quot; Actually, they did far more than that modest sentence indicates. Either Conybeare or Howson (or both of them) personally walked and sailed everywhere that the Apostle traveled!

I have read and studied this book over and over many times during these past years. I still find it edifying in any facet of my ministry and teaching. It has opened up the world of the times of Christ and the Apostle Paul's world, helping me to better understand the civilization which gave birth to the Church age. It is not an easy book to read, and a dictionary at hand does help clarify the thinking of these writes. Based on the available knowledge and information of their day, their research is impeccable and presented in an understandable format. This is not a book for just anyone, nor someone who is only interested in a cursory look at its presentation. I highly recommend it for a serious student of both The Bible and its History of time and places. When you consult the list of \\"Contents and Chapters,\\" and the \\"Appendices,\\" you are immediately led into a small study unto itself. The writers are chronological with subject matter that is apart from the basic book. The uses of notes are excellent for clarification and searching the Scriptures to substantiate the writings.

This is not casual reading. That being said, I have found it to be one of the best biographies of Paul.

For instance, he imagines Tarsus and says this sun rise was the same sun rise Paul saw when he was child. Stuff like that. And he goes on the speculate on what Paul could be thinking. Don't we all like to do that from time to time? I'm not a religious person, I'm a beliver yet a humanist. But I like to dig into the first years of Christianity just for fun and curiosity. I cannot believe a whole civilization was crafted based on what happened during that time."},{"Title":"From Fort Henry to Corinth (Campaigns of the Civil War)","review":"As told by one who served under him.Manning Force was an officer in the Union Army that moved south into Tennessee at the beginning of the Civil War. This army was involved in the fighting at Fort Henry, Fort Donelson, the carnage at Shiloh, and finally entered Northern Mississippi at Corinth - which began the initial phase of the march on Vicksburg.Force later went on to serve under Sherman at Atlanta, and during Hood's desperate counterattacks was gravely wounded. However he survived and later became a prominent judge and politician in his native Ohio.Along with a number of other former Union Civil War officers, Force helped write the multi-volume \\"Campaigns of the Civil War\\" series in the early and mid-1880s. The series became extremely popular with that generation which was beginning to forget about the Civil War.Even after over 20 years, General Force was able to provide his reads with a sense of the scope of Grant's plans in the spring of 1862. He also sheds light on the operations and generalship of John Pope, who was then a rising star in the Union Army by his successes at New Madrid, Island Number 10, and Corinth - only to fail fast when he went east to confront Bobby Lee later that year. Here Force shows that Pope was NOT the braggart or ne'er do well later Civil War histories made him out to be, as his campaigns along the Mississippi were just as successful as Grant's were, though he faced considerably less resistance.Force honorably sheds light too, on Grant's opposite - the well-respected and reluctant Confederate Major General Albert Sidney Johnston, quoting much from the late General's son's biography. Forced south after the fall of Fort Donelson, Johnston turned around and surprised Grant at Shiloh Church (Pittsburg Landing) only to be mortally wounded in a description by Force that is pretty terse rather than the dramatic tales of how he could have lived had a tourniquet been applied. With Johnston's death, and the arrival of Union reinforcements, the Confederate surge collapsed - and the Union armies was able to clear western Tennessee and North Mississippi of their foe. With his military experience, General Force was able to illuminate much of the action and tactics involved during this major battle as well as the other campaigns mentioned in this work.This reprint has the original tiny lettering and ink maps of the period, so it may be a bit difficult to read, as all of the books in this series are. Still, it is a major account of the Shiloh Campaign, and a wonderful addition by a former serving officer in the Civil War enthusiast's bookshelf."},{"Title":"From Fort Henry to Corinth (Campaigns of the Civil War)","review":"My Great-grand-father Samuel Carson Smith was with the 12th Iowa Volunteer Infantry from 1861 until 1866.

The 12th Iowa held the center of the line at the Hornet's Nest at the battle of Shiloh and I'm looking forward to From Fort Henry to Corinth's accounting of a very controversial history of this battle. My grandfather was also wounded at the battle of Corinth and I'm hoping to find if there is any accounting of his participation in that campaign in From Fort Henry to Corinth. I'm extremely excited about the new information I've read in this book! From Fort Henry to Corinth has already enlightened my knowledge of my grandfathers participation in these campaigns. From Fort Henry to Corinth is the best history of this period that I've found so far!My great-grandfather also fought in the Blackhawk Uprising in Minnesota 1856-1859 (?). He was under the Command of Albert Sidney Johnson who was killed at the Battle of Shiloh, so my great-grandfather fought with Albert Johnson in the Minnesota campaign and also against him at Shiloh. These comments may not be totally accurate, but this is the story passed down to me by family."},{"Title":"From Fort Henry to Corinth (Campaigns of the Civil War)","review":"This book is for those interested specifically in the early part of the Civil War, when Union forces were just beginning their push into Confederate territory.It follows the movemtents of the Army of the Tennesse and Army of the Ohio, providing specific details of what went on in various divisions.The battles are logically, in chronological order, and the index (more than a dozen pages!) provides easy access to details."},{"Title":"Eating Your Way Through Luke's Gospel","review":"Robert Karris has written this book not for scholars, though he is one himself, but for continuing education students, and it is marked by what he calls \\"serious levity.\\" Eating Your Way through Luke \\"first emerged from the oven of lively classroom discussion\\" at Catholic Theological Union in Chicago, Karris explains. After a brief overview of eating rituals and food and drink available to Jesus and his disciples, the author turns to Luke's gospel with its theme of food. Here, before listing more than 75 citations of his own, he urges us to read through the gospel in one sitting, making notes of food references. This activity is designed to overcome misunderstandings stemming from lectionary-only acquaintance with scripture.As a good teacher, Karris provides historical insights and spiritual reflections on Luke's food theme. He continues the \\"motif\\" of serious levity with such chapter titles as \\"Jesus, glutton and drunkard, friend of toll collectors and sinners.\\" The style and scope of these chapters is what one would expect, enlightening and interestingBut the final part of the book contains a surprising bonus. Now that we have gone through Luke's gospel finding, examining, and interpreting themes, Karris point out, we have the ability to do the same with other scriptures. He helps us get started by supplying his own results from \\"trawling for the theme of food\\" in the gospels of John, Mark, and Matthew. Thus, we find ourselves in possession of a totally fresh and imminently accessible resource for individual and group study of the New Testament."},{"Title":"Eating Your Way Through Luke's Gospel","review":"In the Gospel of Luke, Jesus is going to eat, eating, or coming from eating - so contents Robert J. Karris in his fascinating book, Eating Your Way Through Luke's Gospel. In the Gospel of Luke, the reader sees how important food was in the earthly ministry of Jesus - and if food and eating meals was of great significance for Jesus, ought it not be for His followers?Karris' book is amazingly comprehensive for such a short book (109 pages).Karris begins by exploring what the people of Jesus' time would actually have been eating and how they would have been eating and with whom - wonderful background information for preaching or researching.Then, he looks more at the theme of food in Luke by examining the passages and Greek words used.The third chapter looks at Jesus as glutton and drunkard, friend of sinners. The fourth, Jesus as guest, host, and teacher. The fifth, Jesus' petitioning of food, and food imagery in the parables.In the sixth chapter, Karris gives and overview of the theme of food in Matthew, Mark, and John - quoting Scripture at length.In the seventh, he explores the relationship between women and food in Luke.In the eighth, he addresses how eating serious, dangerous, and joyful - in context.An appendix correlation the books pages to the Gospel readings of Lectionary Cycle C. This makes is very easy to find explanation of the food passages in his book when they arrive in the preaching cycle.Each chapter has a good-sized selection of works for further reading, and the book has its own selected bibliography.The one assertion that I had trouble with was when he stated that when Jesus said, \\"do this in remembrance of Me,\\" He was not merely referring to the Passover or the Lord's Supper, but to the fellowship of all meals. I don't see how one can interpret the text that far.Even so, this is an amazing and helpful book for any interested in the topic of food in Luke, Jesus' interaction with food, and preaching and researching the texts that concern food in Luke (especially). He has done a great deal of work to put together his presentation and to provide further resources. I highly recommend this book to all preachers and to all interested in food in Christian context."},{"Title":"Eating Your Way Through Luke's Gospel","review":"Robert Karris' slim book is anything but \\"slim pickins\\" on the theme of food in the New Testament gospels. A recognized scholar on scripture topics, including an important book on Luke, Karris here presents rich fare for those interested in understanding the importance of food in the first century A.D. world of the gospels and in reading on Jesus' meals in a richer context. Karris writes for a general audience in a lively and entertaining style. Additionally, I have used this book for background in two of my graduate school scripture courses. As I wrote in a previous review: He has fashioned a 'meal'that provides enticing and nourishing food for thought, meat for good homilies, and staples for a life of Christian discipleship.\\""},{"Title":"Eating Your Way Through Luke's Gospel","review":"I used this book as the basis of an adult study. As I tried to outline the chapters, I ran into some trouble. The themes did not seem to be consistent. I was puzzled about the main thesis of the book. While the fist chapter discussed food, the direction then veered toward hospitality and inclusiveness. The author presented discussion but failed to draw either theological or literary conclusions. As a result, the book was hard to read as a cohesive whole. I still puzzle at the main main point and question the purpose of the teaching. Some good material can be extracted but it is not well organized and takes a considerable degree of work on the part of the reader."},{"Title":"Eating Your Way Through Luke's Gospel","review":"Actually, I tossed the book after looking through it for a couple of hours. The writer seems to have to stretch awfully far in his conclusions, and nothing is very clear.

More often than not the word \\"hear\\" appeared as \\"here.\\" The author has no clue how to use an apostrophe to to denote a possessive as opposed to just a plural word. Very annoying throughout the book. Weak story line with a random ending to it. Cannot recommend this book."},{"Title":"Stoner","review":"I must first state that I have had the pleasure of knowing the author for many years. However, his writing prowess was a side I never knew until I read the book. He gives an in depth look into the life of a vietnam war soldier.

Recently, I picked up this book of Mertons' (mostly bacause it was one of his books that wasn't intimidatingly huge ) and after reading a few chapters, I was surprised to find it was simple to understand (even for a 22 yr old!) and yet very challenging to my faith.Although Merton may be labeled as a &quot;Catholic writer&quot;, his writings deal with real-life issues ANY Christian can learn from - if you want to GROW in your spiritual relationship with God, READ THIS BOOK! It will **challenge** you and refreshen your faith! The chapers are small enough (2-3 pgs) to read a little each day....Most of all, I enjoyed this book because it addresses a common question I often ask: How can I be holy for God in my &quot;normal,&quot; everyday life (i.e. without becoming a nun!) .... Merton answers this question to my satisfaction, to say the least!"},{"Title":"Life and holiness","review":"This tiny book is the best introduction to Merton's writings. Merton, a Trappist monk, discusses Catholic spirituality in a deeply powerful way, and completely avoids the use of theological jargon. But even though he avoids jargon, he still conveys powerful theological ideas: theological seminary ideas like the Incarnation of Christ, justification, and priesthood ordinations all become living realities in his writings. It's easy to read but by no means light reading. He had a unique gift.Though written from a Catholic perspective, this book is for ordinary Christians of all faiths. It discusses not just the life of prayer, but also the active life. He talks about how Christians can genuinely make their work and their political participation part of their sacred sphere. We'll surely be reading his work for another century; and we'll need it."},{"Title":"Life and holiness","review":"As always, Merton is concise, unsentimental, and challenging, but at the same time, passionate and full of Christian love. Unlike many of his books, which speak mainly to the religious contemplative, \\"Life and Holiness\\" is written for the lay person. How can we we lead truly Christian lives in the hustle and bustle of daily life? What does it really mean to have faith, hope and charity in our hearts? In terms of vocation, how do we know what God wants us to do? Are we aspiring to holiness, or are we just trying to get by in our faith? What are the consequences of just trying to get by? In a world so full of seemingly insoluble social problems, what can we do to really change anything? How can we have deep authentic faith without turning our backs on the world? These are just some of the difficult question Merton tries to answer with his usual insight and common sense. I think this book provides excellent help for anyone seeking to put his/her life in a better, more faith-filled perspective."},{"Title":"Life and holiness","review":"Thomas Merton never ceases to amaze in his ability to express, in concrete, down-to-earth terms, how to incorporate a robust Roman Catholic spirituality in an active, contemporary life. Although he was writing as a monk, Merton's call to personal holiness in the active, non-monastic life is incisive, convincing and completely on point. Merton explains in clear terms how one can, and indeed must, maintain deep, active concern for the events that surround us, and be an active participant in these events, in order to cultivate and fully develop our individual capacity for personal holiness. A tremendous work, highly recommendable for anyone seeking guidance regarding how a passionate spirituality can be integrated into an active and busy life."},{"Title":"Life and holiness","review":"While I have read many of Merton's other books, they seemed to have been more targeted toward a life of contemplation and clergy. The voice of this book speaks more to the average person with a emphasis on living every day in Jesus's name.\\"Life and Holiness\\" is a somewhat intimidating name to give to a book. Most of us have the realization that we are far from sainthood. While we might strive to be good Christians, classifying ourselves as holy may be a stretch. Knowing our weakness as humans, Merton writes about living everyday life. Through the sacraments, charity, prayer, and faith, we move closer to the perfection that God makes us capable of achieving. Having already been chosen by God to follow, we are already making strides on the path.While the book is targeted toward the Catholic faction of Christianity, Christians of all denominations can take benefits from this book. Some readers may not follow the focus in Catholicism in certain sections, but these discussions are to be expected from a Catholic Trappist Monk."},{"Title":"Life and holiness","review":"Thomas Merton (1915-1968) was a Trappist monk of the Abbey of Gethsemani, Kentucky, as well as a best-selling writer, poet, social activist, and student of comparative religion. Tragically, he was accidentally electrocuted while in Thailand at a conference of Christian and non-Christian monks.He wrote in the Introduction to this 1962 book, \\"This is intended to be a very simple book, an elementary treatment of a few ideas in Christian spirituality. Hence it should be useful to ... anyone who wants to acquaint himself with some principles of the interior life as it is understood in the Catholic Church... the book emphasizes what is at once the most common and the most mysterious aspect in the Christian life: grace, the power and light of God in us, purifying our hearts, transforming us in Christ, making us true sons of God, enabling us to act in the world as his instruments for the good of all men and for his glory.\\"He states, \\"Christian holiness in our age means more than ever the awareness of our common responsibility to cooperate with the mysterious designs of God for the human race.\\" (Pg. 10) He later adds, \\"sanctity is not a matter of being LESS human, but MORE human than other men. This implies a greater capacity for concern, for suffering, for understanding, for sympathy, and also for humor, for joy, for appreciation of the good and beautiful things in life.\\" (Pg. 24)He argues, \\"The man who simply 'works for' God exteriorly may lack that interior love for him which is necessary for true perfection. Love seeks not only to serve him but to know him, to commune with him in prayer, to abandon itself to him in contemplation.\\" (Pg. 52) He adds, \\"To be a Christian then is to be committed to a deeply mystical life, for Christianity is pre-eminently a mystical religion.\\" (Pg. 58-59)He asserts, \\"Of what us is it to hold seminars on the doctrine of the Mystical Body and on sacred liturgy, if one is completely unconcerned with the suffering, destitution, sickness, and ultimately death of millions of potential members of Christ?\\" (Pg. 90)This brief book is a real spiritual \\"gem,\\" and will interest not only those studying Merton, but anyone interested in spirituality in general."},{"Title":"Life and holiness","review":"I haven't completed this book yet but it is proving very interesting. It was received in good shape and very fast."},{"Title":"New England StarWatch: The Essential Guide To Our Night Sky","review":"I recently bought a new telescope, rekindling a childhood interest, and looked for an introductory but not childish star book to go with it. New England StarWatch fits that role perfectly. Its full-page monthly star charts help you get oriented and find things. These are simple and clearly printed; the spiral binding and black-on-white format make them useful outdoors. Elsewhere, descriptions of individual constellations (organized by season) include lists of \\"celestial goodies\\" such as double stars, nebulae and galaxies to look for. Beautiful full-page color pictures show how such goodies might appear if you owned the Hubble Telescope, but Lynch also provides practical advice about whether binoculars, a small telescope, or a large (amateur) telescope is needed to see something. I've had fun evenings searching out the sights Lynch describes, and knowing that the fuzzy gray blob in my scope is a glimpse of that awesome red and purple cloud in the book.The star charts, photos and constellation guides with \\"goodies\\" have been worth the price of the book for me, but there's quite a bit of other material as well -- a well-illustrated basic astronomy course, and also some wry retellings of constellation myths. Seasoned amateur astronomers would find this book too basic, but I recommend it for others who are newer to the game, and starting to find their way around the stars."},{"Title":"Wake Island, the heroic gallant fight","review":"Duane Schultz's &quot;Wake Island,&quot; is an excellent account of the lost cause that bought American forces in the Pacific a little breathing space in the immediate aftermath of Pearl Harbor. Like the battle of the Alamo, the fate of the American defenders of Wake Island became a rallying cry during subsequent encounters. This is not an epic work, checking in at just over 200 pages. But it is exciting and well written military history in the fine tradition of Stephen Ambrose and Cornelius Ryan. It is also an excellent tribute to the brave Americans who fought vallantly against hopeless odds to stem the tide of the enemy in the Pacific."},{"Title":"Wake Island, the heroic gallant fight","review":"This is not a bad little book on the topic. It does not have the detail of a Stephen Ambrose book, but the author does keep the story moving and before you know it you have completed the book.

At first, his slovenly appearance gave a bad impression. He was tall, skinny with a big head and dressed in badly wrinkled, ill-fitting clothes and size 14 boots, he large hands detracted the audence with his gestures and old-fashioned oratory. As his speech progressed, \\"his face lighted as with an inner fire, his personal appearance, his individual pecularities and his outlandish clothes were forgotten, as he proclaimed, \\"let us dare to do our duty as we understand it.\\"As the War commenced, he was caricatured as Don Quioxote with General Ben Butler as Sancho Panga. Another cartoon from Frank Leslie's illustrated newspaper shows Jefferson Davis' nightmare: \\"Lincoln had been elected for another term.In this book by Keith Jennison, the reader will find Lincoln's jokes wry comments anecdotes and humorous stories all combined. He used humor by telling diverting tales during theWar years \\"to help him escape his almost unendurable burden.\\" While president, a doctor's exam showed that he had smallpox. \\"God,\\" he said, \\"now I have something I can give to everyone.\\"After one of his amusing stories from his youth in Indiana \\"about a raccoon's fate,\\" he said, \\"If Jeff Davis and those other fellows will only get away (on their own), it will be alright.\\" But, as we know, it didn't work out that way. After April 14, nothing was alright for anybody, and Jefferson Davis did not get away. Henry J. Raymond, editor of 'The New York Times,' compared Lincoln and Shakespeare (woe of 'Lear,' tragedy of 'Hamlet,' humor of 'Merry Wives of Windsor,' and merriment of 'A Midsummer Nights Dream': this is as true of Mr. Lincoln as it was of William Shakespeare, \\"the capacity to tell and enjoy a good anecdote....\\"Jennison appreciated Lincoln's humor when he was a copy boy for Carl Sandburg, just completing ABRAHAM LINCOLN: THE WAR YEARS.

Harlan. It was immediately recognized it as a one-of-a-kind historical gem. In the April 2002 issue of National Geographic, the magazine featured Harlan's extraordinary maps recreating the natural landscape along the Missouri River as seen by the Corps of Discovery on their outward and home bound journeys in 1804 and 1806.It was my priviledge to write the NGM article. I've watched Harlan and historian James Denny at work in the field and cannot underscore enough the enormity and significance of what they have accomplished with their monumental work-- Atlas of Lewis and Clark in Missouri. It includes 27 detailed computer-generated maps developed from early 19th-century survey documents that digitally replace today's Missouri River with the historic river as it was when the explorers passed through territorial Missouri.The maps depict the course of the Corps of Discovery, precisely locating their campsites and stopping points, as well as landscape features noted by the explorers in their journals. Profound changes in the Missouri River's course over the past 200 years due to flooding, earthquakes, meandering and alterations by the Corps of Engineers to improve navigation have rendered it impossible until now to accurately match the descriptions in the explorers' journals with locations along today's river.Harlan and Denny's atlas with its richly researched and beautifully written accompanying 70,000 word essay provides readers with an extraordinary window on a landscape thought until now to be lost. Little has been written about the work of surveyors who mapped the Missouri between 1815-1819 between St. Louis and Kansas City, a decade after the return of the Corps of Discovery. Using 21st century computer technology, Harlan has brought their detailed landscape observations collected in handwritten field notebooks alive again. The result is a collection of beautifully presented and historically accurate maps that match up precisely with Lewis &amp; Clark's journal entries.Authors Harlan and Denny know the landscapes they present in their atlas firsthand. Lewis and Clark scholars and affectionados across the country have sung their praises from the moment the maps and atlas were released. Both are in high demand across the state and beyond its borders. This is an atlas to be read, savored, and revisited by Missourians and anyone else in love with exploration. This labor of love and talent is as close as one could hope to ever get to experiencing the Missouri River as the Corps of Discovery did 200 years ago. Bravo Harlan and Denny for giving us back the lost Missouri River of Lewis and Clark!"},{"Title":"Atlas of Lewis and Clark in Missouri","review":"This monumental book by James D. Harlan and James M. Denny is a remarkable feat of cartographic reproduction of the journey of Lewis and Clark up the Mississippi from the mouth of the Ohio River to the mouth of the Missouri River and then up the Missouri River to the Nebraska/Iowa border in 1803 and 1804, followed by a commentary on the return journey through Missouri in 1806 in addition to four map plates illustrating the historical land cover of the Missouri River valley in what is now the State of Missouri. The creation of these maps by James D. Harlan represents a painstakingly detailed analysis of original survey maps of the river cross referenced to Lewis and Clark journal entries to create as close a representation of the Missouri River as it passes through what is now the State of Missouri in the time of Lewis and Clark as is likely to ever be achieved. The beautifully reproduced map plates are accompanied by a thorougly researched and spledidly written text providing a highly readable, clear and coherent description of the journey through Missouri by James M. Denny. In my estimation this book will be the book all past as well as future attempts to describe and cartographically render any portions of the Lewis and Clark journey will be measured by. The authors, as well as the University of Missouri Press are to be commended for this amazing book."},{"Title":"Atlas of Lewis and Clark in Missouri","review":"This book was exactly what it advertised itself as: an ATLAS of Lewis & Clark's journey through what is now the state of Missouri. The authors Harlan and Denny painstakingly researched and reconstructed the channel of the Missouri River and vegetative cover based on expedition field notes and those of the government township survey of 1816. There were no such government surveys of Kansas, Iowa, Nebraska, etc. until decades later. By then, the Missouri River had already altered course extensively from what it had been in Lewis and Clark's time. This explains in part, why this edition was concerned only with the state of Missouri.Without traveling back in time, this book gives you as close a picture of the landscape as is probably possible. As an Atlas, it naturally relies far more on maps than text to show landmarks noted by the expedition, and where they camped. It is actually an excellent companion piece when reading the original journals as transcribed by Moulton or even the Biddle edition of 1814. Ample information is provided to follow the progress of the Corps of Discovery from St. Louis to the Iowa line. Especially if you live near or are familiar with the Missouri valley of today. it is interesting to contrast and compare what you see today to what it was like back then. For aficionados of Lewis & Clark or westward exploration, this is an attractive, very well written, easy to follow Atlas."},{"Title":"Atlas of Lewis and Clark in Missouri","review":"This book didn't arrive until December after I ordered it prior to the publisher's announced October release date (no fault of Amazon).This should have been a clue that something was wrong with it. I am sorry to say I'm very disapointed with the &quot;Atlas&quot;. I thought it would be a scholarly book with quality maps and images. Instead it is a bloated, oversized coffee table book printed on glossy paper that will probably end up on the remainder table. The plates are decent enough except that they cover only a small part of the huge pages. The maps probably have detail in them somewhere but they too have such small print that one needs a magnifying glass to read them. It gets one star for the map pockets on the inside front and back covers. Too bad they only hold more glossy too large/too small maps. I would advise anyone to forego this book and instead spend the $60 they'll save on one the Moulton U of Nebraska editions."},{"Title":"Counselling for Toads: A Psychological Adventure","review":"If you are interested in counselling and have a soft spot for the exuberant, exasperating, funny and irrepressible Toad - the riverbank celebrity in Kenneth Grahame's Wind in the Willows - you will find Robert de Board's book absorbing, amusing and informative. On a belated visit to Toad Hall, Mole finds the formerly splendid gardens overgrown, the once grand entertaining rooms and guest rooms closed up, and his erstwhile hero and friend Toad reduced to the state of embarrassed and unkempt hermit in his own kitchen. What will happen now that Toad's bonhomie has bottomed out? Will the wildwooders will finally gain the upper hand? And, worst of all, is the riverbank to lose its most colourful character?Relating his discovery to Ratty, the riverbank friends decide that there is only one road left for Toad to travel; the path of self-discovery and personal development through counselling. But de Board's book is touching and engaging rather than po-faced or pontificating, as it traces this most life-changing of Toad's adventures. In keeping with the best of humorous writing, Counselling for Toads, is serious at heart. This is likely to make it especially palatable to those with a healthy streak of scepticism about the value of therapy. de Board gives an excellent introduction to the aims of counselling, the nature of the therapeutic relationship and the nuts and bolts of Transactional Analysis. While it is easy to read, it does not shy away from technical terms where these are necessary.Discover the roots of Toad's penchant for adventure as he tells Heron, his counsellor, of his childhood and his relationships with family and friends. Toad's encounter with therapy turns out to be an education not only for this deserving hero, but for all those who would be close to him."},{"Title":"Counselling for Toads: A Psychological Adventure","review":"I loved this book.

The Ithaca, N.Y., establishment now publishes books in the name of the collective.\\" Publishers WeeklyThe is the 11th cookbook from Moosewood Restaurant. A friend recommended this cookbook for simple suppers after a busy day. I had forgotten how delicious the food from Moosewood cookbooks are. These recipes are made from everyday ingredients that you have in your home. Cooking something good makes us feel good and sharing it with family and friends is a double heaping of love.The cookbook starts with pasta, giving directions on how to delect and cook the pasta. My favorite pasta is the 'Pasta with carmalizecd onions and blue cheese- yummy!The second addition is 'Sauces, Curries and More'- the roasted vegetable curry is delicious and very easy to make.'Beans and Tofu' follows with the most wonderful 'Shortcut Chili' and 'Lemon Herb Tofu'.'Egg Dishes' and Poached Huevos Rancheros' are so in demand at my house.'Main Dish Grains' and 'Main Dish Salads' follow with seventeen of the best recipes.Tomato Tortilla Soup is the first soup I tired from the 'Soups' chapter and I will make it again soon. We are a family who loves soups.'Sandwiches, Wraps and & Rolls' are next. The Cheesy Spinach Burritos are to die for. I made the very easy Blender Tomato Hot Sauce to pour over tenm and this may be the very best recepie in the book.'Fish', 'Side Grains', 'Side Dishes', and 'Side Salads' round out some of the very best dishes.'Dressings, Condiments' & 'Seasonings' and 'Sauces & Spreads' give us the answser to any of the toppings we need.'Desserts'- caramel custard is the big hit in my house. However, you have21 new desserts to try.The cookbook comes to the finish with 'The Well-Stocked Pantry'. this includes everything that you need to make anyone of these recepies.This is my favorite cookbook of the season- so simple, so reliable and always good!Highly Recommended. prisrob 03-09-09[ASIN:0609802410 Moosewood Restaurant New Classics]Moosewood Restaurant Cooks at Home: Fast and Easy Recipes for Any Day"},{"Title":"Moosewood Restaurant Simple Suppers: Fresh Ideas for the Weeknight Table","review":"This book (from the Moosewood Collective, NOT Mollie Katzen for those who remember that controversy) is perfectly named. It contains recipes for simple suppers suitable for the weeknight table. I can not remember making anything from this book for company. But lemon herb tofu gets made more weeks than not for us (also good with tempeh vs. the tofu). If you get the liquids at the proper depth (adjust the pan size or the amount of liquids), the pan glaze is even better than the tofu. Pine nut crusted fish is another regular (at least once a month). Come to think of it, maybe we need to have more friends over.PS. It is not a vegetarian (much less vegan) cookbook. But it has enough vegetarian and vegan recipes to be of interest to people who are -- if you are comfortable cherry picking the ones you will eat."},{"Title":"Moosewood Restaurant Simple Suppers: Fresh Ideas for the Weeknight Table","review":"After getting this book and having such great success with the meals, I felt compelled to write my first Amazon.com review ever.My husband and I went to a cooking class in town with one of the Moosewood founders (can't remember his name...oops!). He prepared a few meals out of this book that were very tasty. I loved the freshness and international spin on the meals - Vietnamese noodles, variation on gado-gado, etc.We got the book based on how impressed we were. My husband is already a cook, but me...well...all I can say is I'm good at doing the wash up after meals. However, I've made 6 recipes from this book that were all simple as promised and also delicious - even with me cooking! I really like the Lemony Couscous with Chickpeas, esp. for the summer. My husband even commented on how good the meals have been. That's something with my cooking (hey, I'm not knocking myself down - I'm just a realist.)Someone wrote this was very basic, but the name is \\"Simple Suppers\\" - what do you expect? It really may be too basic for a seasoned chef, but for someone who needs a fast, fresh, delicious meal and has beginning - intermediate cooking abilities, I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Moosewood Restaurant Simple Suppers: Fresh Ideas for the Weeknight Table","review":"I own 6 or 7 vegetarian cookbooks, but they've always seemed too daunting and I've never been able to get into them. This is the cookbook that finally broke that pattern. All the recipes are feasible on a Wednesday night--the recipes are quick, easy to follow, and have common ingredients that can be found at any grocery store. We've loved every recipe we've made and have even served them at dinner parties, where they get rave reviews.My only complaint, like other reviewers, is that there's no nutritional information.

I ended up returning the book the same day. Many (majority) of the recipes used processed food items and were of the basic everyday throw your food together design. I love simple, good food recipes but this book was similar to the grocery store checkout line type. I would highly recommend the original Moosewood cookbook and the Low-Fat Moosewood cookbook but not this one as it lacks in originality and in using fresh, healthy ingredients."},{"Title":"Moosewood Restaurant Simple Suppers: Fresh Ideas for the Weeknight Table","review":"Moosewood Simple Suppers have transformed a career woman who lived in fear of coming home to cook into a gleeful culinary queen.

Has a wonderful \\"ingredients to have on hand\\" section which I love. I love the fish section because though my husband and are are attempting to be vegetarian he refuses to give up fish so it is great to have a vegetarian cookbook that also has a fish section.

Any cookbook that comes along that says \\"simple\\" and doesn't rely heavily on cream of mushroom soup is one I'm interested in. I like illustrations of terms that are exotic (to me): dice as opposed to slice or mince. Then, the world of spices, where the experienced cook speaks with authority of different kinds of paprika, when to me paprika is what you sprinkle on deviled eggs. Then, recipes that speak of garlic which can be minced, pressed, unpeeled, peeled....All that said, Simple Suppers isn't simple for me. The recipe for Indian potato salad with cilantro omelet called for scallions (does that mean onions are fine to use?) and a quarter cup of cilantro, an herb, I know, since I looked it up and found out that the seeds of the plant are called coriander and the leaves are cilantro. What's the difference between sun-dried tomatoes in a plastic bag vs. those packed in olive oil? Who knew a difference existed? Is it simple to cook with fresh cilantro?Someday I will find the perfect cookbook for our family. One that begins with a simple, illustrated definition of terms, one that doesn't use exotic vegetables like Swiss chard, that doesn't make a big deal about whether or not you used salted or unsalted butter, that doesn't presume too much. The best cookbook I have is Mark Bittman's How to Cook Everything. He does tell you what cilantro is and the different kinds of paprika. This cookbook is daunting because it's huge, 1044 pages, and intermixed with easy recipes like Wheat Berries with Walnuts are recipes like Pheasant Stewed with Dried Fruits & Vinegar.I think I will donate all my cookbooks but Bittman's to the library and make a list of Bittman recipes that are low in fats and sugars that are easy to cook."},{"Title":"Moosewood Restaurant Simple Suppers: Fresh Ideas for the Weeknight Table","review":"Thought I would love this book, as I've loved Deborah Madison's newest, Vegetarian Suppers. This book was a disappointment--lots of simple recipes, but nothing that sounded like hey, I've got to try that! You probably have recipes similar to these in the book if you have a few vegetarian cookbooks anyway. I brought this one back to the store (a rarity for me--I'm a cookbook fiend!)."},{"Title":"Moosewood Restaurant Simple Suppers: Fresh Ideas for the Weeknight Table","review":"I own all of the Moosewood books, and this one is already a favorite (along with Cooks at Home and Daily Specials). Simple Suppers reads like an updated version of Cooks at Home- the recipes are straightforward and easy to prepare, but original in the combinations of flavors and textures. Green Bean and White Bean Gratin contains green beans, pureed white beans and whole white beans layered with cheese and breadcrumbs for a filling winter meal. Navajo Stew combines roasted sweet potatoes with black beans and a quick blender tomato-chipotle sauce. Tortilla Melts are quick sandwiches of roasted mushrooms with pesto, tomatoes, and cheese. I made all of these in the past week and my husband and I both liked them a lot- good, unfussy food.My only quibble is that it would be nice if nutritional information had been included. Many of the recipes are decidedly not light as written, but could be lightened fairly easily."},{"Title":"Moosewood Restaurant Simple Suppers: Fresh Ideas for the Weeknight Table","review":"If you're looking for food that's healthy, tasty and easy to prepare, I don't think the Moosewood cookbooks can be beat. While I've only tried a couple of recipes from this new cookbook, they've both been good and simple to put together, and I'm looking forward to trying many more. I love to cook, and I love to try new dishes, but I'm also interested in staying slender and in not spending too much time in the kitchen: Moosewood achieves all of that for me. I especially appreciate their \\"serving and menu ideas,\\" in which they make suggestions for what you may want to serve with the current recipe to make a whole meal -- very nice for entertaining. If you don't own any Moosewood cookbooks, the \\"Moosewood Restaurant Cooks at Home\\" is probably the one to start with. With that one and this one together, however, you'd have a formidable collection of recipes. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Moosewood Restaurant Simple Suppers: Fresh Ideas for the Weeknight Table","review":"I purchased the Moosewood Restaurant Simple Suppers cookbook for our daughter who is vegetarian, She prepared 5 of the recipes for us during the time she was home from college over winter break and we loved all of them.

I received this cookbook as a gift last Christmas and cannot stop trying new recipes! I have a zillion vegetarian cookbooks, and usually i end up with one or 2 favorites per cookbook before i move onto another new book. Not so with Simple Suppers!! There are so many recipes that I want to try, and every single one has come out delicious! It is rare for me to use a cookbook where i love every recipe i try, and where every recipe tastes different (a problem with early Moosewood- I can still tell when a recipe is from an old school Moosewood cookbook!)I agree with an earlier reviewer that a lot of these recipes are so simple, it seems like you shouldn't need a recipe... but I figure, if i haven't thought of it and it's that simple, I appreciate someone sharing it with me!This is also an excellent cookbook for anyone who always wishes they had time to cook healthy, \\"from scratch\\" meals every night after a long day at work!"},{"Title":"Moosewood Restaurant Simple Suppers: Fresh Ideas for the Weeknight Table","review":"This cookbook is perfect for people like me who eat fish, grains and lots of veggies, but no other \\"meats\\".I love the way they make suggestions for side dishes to go with their recipes.

I also bought 3 extras to give for gifts because I liked it so much. As a cook, I want simple, quick, delicious and healthy meals for my family. This cookbook offers all that!This is a great cookbook for both the seasoned cook and the beginner. The recipes are interesting but very easy and quick to prepare. I also like the suggestion box at the bottom of each recipe that tells you what to serve with the recipe so that you aren't just serving random dishes together. Very user friendly and lot of fun to cook with!"},{"Title":"Moosewood Restaurant Simple Suppers: Fresh Ideas for the Weeknight Table","review":"I love all of the Moosewood cookbooks; unfortunately I have to say that this one is my least favorite.Still, it gets four stars because all of the recipes are exactly as advertised: fresh and simple (mostly) vegetarian meals that you can throw together for a hungry family. They are also all delicious -- again, something you can count on with any Moosewood cookbook -- and provide a lot of variety in flavors, textures, and types of meals included. The authors also make suggestions for menus as well as including tips and ideas for parents, which is a plus.My complaints with this particular cookbook are mostly little petty things, like the fact that the photos of the Collective members and the hand-made, folksy artwork have been mostly replaced by glossy color photographs. Also, these are not complex, stunning culinary creations -- they are all *very* simple -- which of course is part of the charm of this book. You don't have to spend an hour or two on a meal with this cookbook; it is most definitely a \\"weeknight\\" sort of cookbook. While this is most excellent for beginning cooks, if you already are relatively experienced you don't really need a recipe for some of these things. Like the Poached Huevos Rancheros -- delicious, but do you really need a *recipe* for that?Despite my complaints, I still recommend this book, especially because it rounds out the rest of the Moosewood Restaurant collection by providing a simple, inviting set of recipes for the rushed cook."},{"Title":"Moosewood Restaurant Simple Suppers: Fresh Ideas for the Weeknight Table","review":"I initially got this book for my boyfriend to learn how to cook with, and he's been enjoying it, but we both agree that the recipes are ultimately very bland. I typically suggest he double the spices, herbs, and other condiments used to flavor the dishes to start, and after cooking five different dinners with the suggested side dishes, I think our new standard is going to be to quadruple them. Perhaps the best example is the dinner I just finished cooking, the Szechuan Silken Tofu, which called for only 1/4 tsp. of Chinese garlic-chili sauce as flavoring, along with 1/2 tsp. soy sauce, 1 tsp. vinegar, and 1/4 tsp. sesame oil, if I recall correctly. All this, plus some cornstarch, dumped into a cup of water and cooked to make a \\"sauce\\" for 16 oz. of tofu. I increased the chili sauce to a tablespoon, and probably could have done two before I noticed some heat.This cookbook has a great premise, and I really like how there are suggested pairings of a side dish and desert for each dinner, but I don't like having to heavily modify things all the time."},{"Title":"Moosewood Restaurant Simple Suppers: Fresh Ideas for the Weeknight Table","review":"I love looking through cookbooks but am regularly frustrated because the delicious recipes detailed and photographed within invariably fails by:1) Having a list of ingredients that I would never otherwise have in my home;2) Requiring cooking techniques or instruments that I do not own and can't justify buying;3) or as I am a vegetarian in a house of meat eaters, not offering enough recipes that I can share with the rest of my family...(My husband has been known to stop eating something once he learns that certain ingredients are in it ...coconut, mushrooms, cauliflour!)To my everlasting delight - Simple Suppers offers an abundance of easy to make, meals that I don' have to worry about serving to my family - and by this I mean - \\"I spent THREE hours and $50!! to make that meal, what do you MEAN you won't even TRY it!!!!\\"The Contents are as follows with one or two recipes that I will try over the next few weeks:Pasta - Fettucini with Walnut Pesto, Pasta With Carmelized Onions and Blue Cheese, Pasta with Olives Piquant...Sautes, Curries, & MOre - Spicy Potatos and SPinach, Baked Stuffed TomatoesBeans & Tofu - Sesame Tofu with Spinach,Egg Dishes - Poached Huevos Rancheros, Savory Bread and Cheese BakeMain Dish Grains - RarebitRisotto, Spinach Polenta Topped with TomatoesMain Dish Salads - Southwestern Black Bean Sald, Warm French Lentil SaladSoups - Tomato Tortilla Soup, Italian Bread and Cheese SoupSandwiches, Wraps, & Rolls - Spinach Cheese Burritos, Broccolini Cheddar MeltFish - Po'Boy Sandwich, Asian Braised Fish with GreensSide Grains- Brilliant Yellow Noodles, Green RiceSide Dishes - Baked Acorn Squash Crescents, Sesame BroccoliSide Salads - Broccoli Tomato Salad, Wilted Spinach Salad with Pecans and AsiagoDressings, Condiments & Seasonings - Pineapple Chutney, Cranberry Chutney, Chipotle MayonaiseSauces & Spreads - Blender Tomato Hot Sauce, Red Pepper Butter SauceDesserts- Caribbean Sauteed BananasThe Well Stocked PantryGuide to Ingredients, Tools & TechniquesDelicious!"},{"Title":"Moosewood Restaurant Simple Suppers: Fresh Ideas for the Weeknight Table","review":"I'm a big fan of the Moosewood Restaurant cookbooks.

The only minor problem I've had is that the chipotles in sdobo sauce that I bought (used in many recipes) were outrageously spicy and I had to take drastic measures to make the chili edible.

The work's intent is to be \\"an Account of the Change in the Minds and Hearts of a Majority of the people in the Thirteen colonies\\" (ii). Its narrative focuses heavily on the imperial policies of the British Government and the misunderstandings that permeated communications between the Colonies and the Mother Country.This learned work contains much that is useful to any serious scholar of the American Revolution. There is a chronology of events followed by thirty-two chapters of narrative. The book concludes with 27 appendices and over two hundred pages of notes and bibliographic entries. The organization of the work is a cause of confusion, as the reader is required to skip back and forth between the main text and the back matter in order to keep the narrative flowing. The exhaustive notes show that Knollenberg has consulted primary and secondary sources in both America and England. They provide the reader will a clear guide for obtaining additional information.British and American relations had begun to decline during the period of the French and Indian war. Imperial policy repeatedly provoked a sharp outcry from colonists and generated increasing bad will on both side. The failure of the British government to recognize that the colonies were viable entities with their own goals meant that the imperial bond was irreparably damaged.Growth of the American Revolution: 1766-1775, offers a conventional perspective on the events leading up to the separation of America from England: Imperial intransigence combined with economic divergence of interests. For all its conventionality, it provides such a strong breadth of material and plain style as to make it a useful tool for academics and an enjoyable narrative for general readers."},{"Title":"Growth of the American Revolution: 1766-1775","review":"Very strongly recommended for academic and community library American History collections, Growth Of The American Revolution: 1766-1775 by Bernhard Knollenberg (Professor Emeritus of History, Indiana University) is an impressively in-depth and informative study of American revolutionary history from the repeal of the Stamp Act in 1766 to the outbreak of violence at Lexington and Concord in 1775. Delineating key events and incorporating a discussion of the historiography, Growth Of The American Revolution: 1766-1775 is an expansive and scholarly work so heavily researched that the extensive notes to the chapters take up almost as many pages as the chapters themselves."},{"Title":"Chocolatina","review":"This is a great story for all the chocolate lovers out there.

In fact, I believe that there is little, if anything, positive to say about this book.

I read this book aloud to approx. 15 classes of K-3 children &amp; each and everytime the response was the same, pure joy! Cries of &quot;read it again&quot; are the highest praise for a book. This story contains humor, just the right amount of scary stuff for young readers but above all, creativity &amp; fantasy.

The music is a good intermediate level, and many of the songs have a lot of flats in the key signature. The book has 9 songs: 1. Bearing the Cross 2. Peter Denies Jesus (I know everyone must love this song, but it starts out with one flat and once the best part of the song is over it goes into 7 flats That's not too bad though, because you just have to think about because you flatting everything.) 3. Flagellation (6 flats) 4. Disciples (only 1 flat!!!) 5. Mary Goes to Jesus (4 flats) 6. Crucifixion (only 1 flat and no flats part of the song. This is my favorite piece.) 7. It is Done (4 flats) 8. Jesus is Carried Down (0 flats!!!) 9. ResurrectionEven though some of these songs have a lot of flats, it is not that hard of playing (for a good intermediate level). The songs usually do not include the entire track from the CD in music, but sometimes they do. It is beautiful music, but I suggest listening to the soundtrack before getting this, as you will understand what you are playing. There are also some beautiful pictures from the Passion included. Don't let me discourage you from getting this great music book--- If you like the music from the Passion soundtrack, you will enjoy this too."},{"Title":"MCSE Windows 2000 Network Exam Prep (Exam: 70-216)","review":"If an option for &quot;0 stars&quot; would have been available, I would have chosen it!

This one seemed to escape the final technical and editorial proofreading that I would expect a major publisher to subject books to prior to publishing them. There are numerous figures that are wrong, labeled incorrectly, or both. For example, look at the figures on pages 57 and 58; all three are the same picture, with none of them being labeled properly... There are also a number of lists that have obvious mistakes in them. If that were all, it might not be too bad, but there are other less obvious mistakes as well. I ended up wondering how much of what I read was actually correct, and was left with a realization that you must read this book with a discerning eye. When I checked the Coriolis support page there was no errata for this book. The section on DNS was good, as was the chapter on WINS. Use with caution.

I really loved it."},{"Title":"Month-To-Month Gardening, Colorado","review":"I love this gardening book! It's specific to colorado and it differentiates between those who live in the mountains vs those who don't. It's divided out by months with checklists of things that should be done within that month. The lists are divided out into categories such as \\"lawn\\" \\"trees and shrubs\\" \\"perrenials, annuals, and bulbs\\" \\"kitchen garden\\" and so forth. The \\"kitchen garden\\" list refers to vegetable gardens. There are short blurbs of detailed information on each page dealing with a single topic. The checklists are basic \\"to do\\" lists with references to page numbers where more detailed information can be found if you don't know how to do that item. It also has a good index in the back to find the detailed information when needed whether it's information in the back or the short blurbs on each page. I love that the basic checklists are separate from the detailed information. It makes the information uncluttered and easy to use. Other gardening books keep all the 'when to do it' and detailed 'how to do it' information mixed together making it difficult to figure out what to do when and therefore never getting done at all. This book is so easy to use that it's the only gardening book I really use. I pull it out regularly to make my \\"to do\\" list for outdoor gardening chores. Overall it has good information that's super easy to use!"},{"Title":"Month-To-Month Gardening, Colorado","review":"This is an excellent beginners book for gardening in Colorado. I am buying a used copy of this book for my new neighbors, who have just moved from Michigan to Colorado and are completely bewildered by Colorado's tough gardening challenges and have no idea where to begin. Although I have a library of over 50 gardening books, I pull this one out now and again to consult. This is a very well-organized book, concisely written, so that the gardener new to Colorado's dry, windy climate and extreme temperature fluctuations will have a quick grasp of gardening through the year, rather than be over-whelmed by too much detail. The common names of the plants, shrubs and trees are given instead of lengthy scientific names. The maintenance Tips for each month are very valuable and cover all the areas I've needed in my 30 years as a native Colorado gardener. The design tips are rather limited in variety for each, but gives the beginner some good ideas. Designs range fom border flower gardens to Xeriscape gardens. One of the best features of this book is the \\"How-To Tips\\", which are brief and not very detailed, but can give quick concepts of topics from mulching to watering. I especially like the \\"Best and Worst\\" lists at the back of the book. Although a bit limited in explaining why plants are put on the \\"worst list\\", it could help new gardeners avoid costly mistakes. The \\"What blooms when calendar\\" section is excellent to plan a 3-season garden. The one-page \\"Lawn Maintenance Calendar\\" at the back is very informational, giving exact water measurements, mowing heights, and fertilizer timing and requirements by the month. A very detailed \\"Zone Map\\" is encluded at the end of the book, and maybe should have been better placed at the beginning, so gardeners shopping for plants, shrubs and trees will know precisely what zone to look for on plant tags. All in all, an excellent introduction to gardening in Colorado."},{"Title":"Kallaloo!: A Caribbean Tale","review":"I'm the illustrator of this book and would like to share the following reviews:Children's Literature - Sylvia FirthThe folk tale of making soup from stones or \\"nothing\\" is found in many cultures. This version, set in the Caribbean, is vibrant, funny and clever. Poor Granny is very hungry but has no food or money. When fishing proves unsuccessful, she decides to use a shell as the basis for a pot of soup. At the outdoor market, Granny ingeniously manages to get everyone to contribute something to the soup by convincing them that her shell has magical powers. After the addition of the last ingredient, fungee, the crowd gleefully enjoys the free soup and gives a resounding cheer for Granny and her wonderful kallaloo. The strong, lively illustrations have the feel of the Caribbean and are a first-class addition to the story. As an added bonus, instructions for making kallaloo, either for a crowd or just two, are included on the last page. 2005, Marshall Cavendish, Ages 4 to 8.School Library JournalPreS-Gr 3-\\"\`Lunchtime,' said Granny, \`and me belly bawling.' But her cupboard was bare.\\" So begins this West Indian version of the ever-popular \\"Stone Soup.\\" In lilting language, Granny and her hungry stomach have a conversation about what they are going to do as she sits fishing, but not catching anything. Then she comes upon a shell and decides to make soup with it. She runs to the Market Square crying, \`\\"I find it!'\\" Of course, everyone is curious, especially when she declares that the shell can make soup, and if someone brings her a pot of water, she'll prove it. As the people gather, they each contribute an ingredient until a big pot of savory kallaloo, a Caribbean gumbo, is ready to be shared by all. This humorous tale can be enjoyed alone, but is well suited to reading aloud.

What's particularly annoying is that some captions are printed at a 90 degree angle to the rest of the text, and printed in the margins of the book to boot. The text is also printed too near the book binding, so you have to really force open the book, and in the process, break its spine, in order to read the text on the inside. What, is the publisher trying to scrimp on paper?For a book on photography, the examples of photos shown in the book are nothing to shout about, and the pictures are also miserably small, which make it even harder to appreciate the already-mediocre pictures.While the techniques explained in the book are clear and easily understood, they only skims the surface of photography, and may be at a level suitable only for beginners. Those wishing to hone their skills beyond beginners' level may be better off getting Bryan Peterson's series of excellent photography books on exposure, protraiture and seeing creatively.For the type of information found in the book, it is not worth wading through the unreadable text and layout."},{"Title":"Travel Photography","review":"This is a good book to have as reference. I bought Lonely Planets Travel Photography and they are almost the same. This book is thicker and cover other topic the other does not. Its nice to have though."},{"Title":"Travel Photography","review":"This books has a perfect balance. The beginner, intermediate or advanced photographer will find many useful tips. All the travel photography aspects are covered, not only the technical ones. All the pictures are documented, an exquisite rarity. The writer, editors and publishers of this book should be proud of this little wonder."},{"Title":"Travel Photography","review":"I couldn't agree more to Richards introduction, when he says: &quot;Modern automatic cameras have eased the burden of having to understand what's going on when you press the shutter. However, this often means the process and the variable elements that go into creating a successful image remain a mystery, and cannot be repeated.&quot;To be able to repeat good quality photographs you have (you need) to understand and to control the picture-taking process. I have read this book in one hit -- I couldn't let go -- the text is short and precise, the photographs are stunning and the caption contains the details you need to know to understand the scene.Many pictures have a counterpart to show you what had been improved by using different settings, lense or filter, etc.Travel photography is a super-set of abilities, not only the landscape scene, not only the family album type picture, not only macro shots, but all of it. This book will not let you down, by explaining in enough detail what to watch out for... it covers the lot, from selecting a camera to suit your needs, a suitable type of film, &quot;a guide to taking better pictures&quot;, even how to make money out of your shots, in case you want to.The author concentrates on what is necessary, don't be scared when hearing about filters, one is a must (UV), another is very helpful (Polarizer) and two others are nice to have (find this out for yourself).The book is definitely worthwhile the money... way cheaper than taking test pictures and to find the settings on your own. You still have to take test pictures to test your capabilities, but I reckon you'll save five rolls :-)P.S. Why &quot;A typographic treasure&quot;? -- The layout of the book is excellent, the sections of the book a clearly visible, helping you to find you way around."},{"Title":"Travel Photography","review":"An okay little book with lots of tips and hints on travel photography. The real strength of this book is the coverage of potential subject matter, providing plenty of food for thought. If your a beginner you may find coverage of the basics a bit brief, though there is still useful content in these early sections of the book for all. As an early intermediate picture taker, I found the lens aperture and shutter speed information included with most of the images useful in understanding the scope and context of those combinations selected for the different subjects. If you know your way around your camera equipment and are looking for some inspiration on what to photograph on that once in a lifetime trip, then take a look at this book. It is small enough that you can take it with you without adding too much to the baggage."},{"Title":"Travel Photography","review":"Richard I'Anson has been a professional travel photograph for two decades now and has become a familiar face in the Lonely Planet series through his collaborations with Tony Wheeler,Lonely Planet: Chasing RickshawsandRice Trails: A Journey Through The Ricelands Of Asia & Australia (Lonely Planet Pictorials). His book LONELY PLANET TRAVEL PHOTOGRAPHY first appeared at the turn of the millennium, and this second edition followed in 2004.I'Anson's book covers all the basics of photography, such as choice of lenses and film, setting of such variables as shutter speed and aperature, and when to use a tripod and when not. The book's points are illustrated with dozens of I'Anson's own photographs, mainly from the Indian subcontinent, and the instruction is coloured by his own tastes, such as using natural light as often as possible and avoiding flash. The book succeeds as a general introduction to photography, and I think that my photos are at least slightly better now than before I purchased the book.However, I'Anson's advice is extremely simplistic, as other reviewers have pointed out. There's little here that's specifically about travel photography, and so any other introduction to photography would cover the same group, perhaps even more economically. In fact, on one of the last pages I'Anson gives a list of URLs to websites with publicly available guidance, which turn out to be even more in-depth than LONELY PLANET TRAVEL PHOTOGRAPHY.The book's production is also unideal. It's annoyingly typeset completely in sans serif. That makes it hard on the eyes, and only in a roundabout way did I discover that the author's surname is I'Anson (with i) instead of l'Anson as one might assume. The book is also printed entirely on plates, which is a necessary evil of a book aiming to display full-quality photographs, but which means that the book will add significant weight to your pack.Advance hype was that the second edition of the book would include the world of digital photography. Unfortunately, digital very much seems an afterthought here. The advice is meagre, simplistic (\\"make sure you insert your digital camera card properly\\"), and generally in those spheres of digital that would go out of date most quickly and did. The manual that came with your digital camera probably gives better advice on taking good photos that I'Anson does, especially when so much of the text is taken verbatim from camera manufacturers.All in all, I would recommend LONELY PLANET TRAVEL PHOTOGRAPHY only for those travelers who are going to spend a long time on the road and unconnected, who need all the info packed into one single volume. However, you're going to get through the material very quickly, and wonder why you got such a pricey and heavy book for so very little benefit."},{"Title":"Travel Photography","review":"This gem of a book is probably the best concise guide to photography on the market (and I've looked through most of them over the years). As I am an advanced semi-pro and sometime pro photographer, it would be hard for me to judge how useful this book is to an absolute beginner, but for me it is a handy reference to review before a major trip, reminding me of things I might forget about that are not part of my everyday shooting in Coastal California (such as the advice on ways that you may inadvertantly expose your film to too much heat, and the caveats about damage from sand, humidity, etc., as well as specific exposure and filtering considerations in some of the extreme conditions one encounters overseas).I own the 2000 edition, which I find perfectly well organised, but plan to look at the updated edition this week to see what changes have been made and if the quality has been fully retained or if the guide has been \\"dumbed down\\". What I find particularly useful in the 2000 edition is the moderately well annotated comparison shots. Most photography guides provide silly and useless \\"comparisons\\" of different focal lengths from the same standing position, or \\"artistic\\" renditions that I personally despise such as soft focus portraits, slo-mo waterfalls, etc. This guide is the best I've ever seen for picking appropriate subject matter and shooting conditions for showing the best use of specialised filters (such as 81 series and 82 series) as well as summarising Best Practices and pitfalls of graduated and Neutral Density filters.The book spendds little or no time on subjects such as Black & White, Infra-Red, Ultraviolet lighting, etc. Other subjects are left uncovered as well, and this is entirely appropriate for a book that focuses on the likely types of photography that even a professional photographer would probably engage in during extensive travels. There is an implicit emphasis on the practical considerations of what one brings along on a longer vacation (such as three weeks or longer).My only criticism on the advice is one that is common to most modern photography books, and that is the advice for people to buy zoom lenses. Although the more high-end zooms are now capable of producing sharp photographs and delivering adequate light, those zooms tend to be as heavy and expensive as the fixed lenses that they replace, and my experience with moderately priced variable aperture zoom lenses is that they are unable to deliver the requisite amount of light or minimum focus distance required by most \\"best light\\" shooting (i.e. two hours before sundown in the temperate zone, or half an hour to one hour befolre sundown in the tropics). Also, learning to use a few ideal focal lengths (such as 24, 35, 50, and 105) greatly enhances the development of one's technical and artistic skills; whereas using zooms tends to make one lazy in using the zoom to frame the picture vs. thinking in terms of aspect ratio and which shooting position delivers best lighting."},{"Title":"Travel Photography","review":"Well, what can I add? ... what my fellow readers haven't mentioned yet... and I concur.Why am I giving only 4 stars you may ask? (I would have given 4.5, but this option is not available.) Well, I rate books with four stars when the book is very well written, good quality in word and print AND will be used over and over again.I am a hobby photographer since many years, have taken thousands of photos... and may therefore be the wrong audience. Someone said &quot;a beginners guide&quot;, I agree. I was wondering what I don't know, going through the book twice, comparing the images and advice with my own experience. He is right. I have read it, will put it aside and most likely not look at it again.But if you are new to the field of photography, reading this book will save you rolls of film and will let you learn a lot, in either case: in digital or conventional photography.The book is very nice, a compact format and what I've realised later (when reading it a second time) that this is a Lonely Planet book. Another or an added bonus. They have great photographers (Richard is one of them) and the travel guides are brilliant... so is this guide.The book also revealed the answer to a very important question I had: It's the 24 mm lens, which gives you the most action and coverage. (Just to give you an idea: 30% of the images have been taken with a 24mm lens, another 26% was shot with a 100mm lens. I found that interesting.) A finding which influenced my desire to get one.Happy reading.Regards,Max"},{"Title":"Travel Photography","review":"I admit to being a complete amateur when it comes to photography.

No, you really feel instantly that he talks to you as a friend who's gone through the same experiences and made the same mistakes the reader is making.

Everything about the book was great- the explanations, the pictures used for examples, the format, and the wording.When I first saw this book, it was the cover that caught my eye. The photo, I thought, was quite beautiful, and the book it's self has a good feel- nicely printed on pages that maximise the beauty of the images, nice font and format, catchy colors, and even the feel as you held it.I skimmed through the beggining before buying it, and was enthralled to learn that the book had been written by a real photographer. Anyone can tell you how to do something, but when each tip is accompanied by a beautiful picture illustrated the point, you feel as if you have the evidence that these tips are effective right in your hands.I have since read the book cover to cover once, and excerps of it much more that that. When I gave a presentation on the fundemetials of good photography, I used this book not only as my resource, but as an example of wonderful photographs.This is, indeed, a great book. I have seen a clearly visible increase in the quality of my photographs since I saw this book.

I enjoyed even the concise information on censor formats and it's so up to date it even mentions the micro four-thirds format, it also covers each situation you can find on travel photography such as shooting on different lighting conditions, crowded places, potraits of travel companions, etc and the description of how the example shots were made help you figure out a lot on the exposure/lens necessary to each situation.That's also a great book to read along with your DSLR manual, since it will help you understand most of those functions cameras have nowadays but just the pros know how to use it.

Sure, Adam Smith isn't the most interesting author - in fact, I had to drink lots of coffee to get through this book - it's just that it's a deep book that's withstood the test of time.I really can't add more to the number of reviews on the book. It's a 200+ year old book that predates the words capitalism and economics. I lack the economics and financial understanding to really absorb the book and able to regurgitate something meaningful. However I found myself rereading passages because they made sense, and it seemed like Smith foresaw that would happen to the US, not just post-Independence from England, but modern-day US. It's just a deep and complex book.The Kindle free copy is the complete book, and it's got that same weird left indent/formatting issue that basically has the left margin pushed in a tab's worth.

He is truly one of the most important individuals in history. Henry Ford and others have taken his ideas and theories and put them into practice.Great read."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations","review":"Adam Smith (1723-1790]) was a Scottish social philosopher, political economist, and one of the key figures of the Scottish Enlightenment. He also wroteThe Theory of Moral Sentiments. This book was first published in 1776, interestingly enough.Smith noted in the \\"Plan of Work\\" that prefaces the book that among the \\"savage nations of hunters,\\" the people are often \\"miserably poor\\"; while among civilized and thriving nations, \\"a workman, even of the lowest and poorest order... may enjoy a greater share of the necessities and conveniences of life than it is possible for any savage to acquire.\\" The First Book addresses the \\"causes of this improvement, in the productive powers of labour,\\" while the Second Book treats \\"of the nature of capital stock, or the manner in which it is gradually accumulated\\"; the Third Book deals with the circumstances regarding the establishment of towns, rather than of the country; and the Fourth Book deals with various theories of political economy.He begins the book with the observation that \\"The greatest improvement in the productive powers of labour... seem to have been the effects of the division of labour.\\" He cites the example of pin manufacturing, in which a single man could perhaps make one pin a day, \\"and certainly could not make twenty.\\" But by ten persons dividing the labor, they are able to make 48,000 pins in a single day. (Pg. 3-5)He frankly acknowledges that \\"masters\\" (i.e., employers) are \\"always and every where\\" in a sort of tacit, but constant and uniform combination, not to raise the wages of labour above their actual rate. \\"To violate this combination is every where a most unpopular action, and a sort of reproach to a master among his neighbors and equals.\\" (Pg. 66-67) Yet he also notes that the inhabitants of a town \\"can easily combine together,\\" so that by voluntary associations and agreements they prevent that free competition \\"which they cannot prohibit by bye-laws.\\" (Pg. 126) He observes that \\"People of the same trade seldom meet together, even for merriment and diversion, but the conversation ends in a conspiracy against the public, or in some contrivance to raise prices.\\" (Pg. 128)Of course, the most lastingly influential idea in the book is his concept of the \\"invisible hand,\\" by which an individual who \\"intends only his own gain... (is) led by an invisible hand to promote an end which was no part of his intention... By pursuing his own interest he frequently promotes that of the society more effectually than when he really intends to promote it.\\" He adds ironically, \\"I have never known much good done by those who affected to trade for the public good.\\" (Pg. 423)Ultimately, the private interests and passions of individuals naturally dispose them toward tasks which are most advantageous to society. \\"Without any intervention of law, therefore, the private interests and passions of men naturally lead them to divide and distribute the stock of every society ... as nearly as possible in the proportion which is most agreeable to the interest of the whole society.\\" (Pg. 594-595)One cannot adequately summarize a masterwork such as Smith's within the confines of an Amazon review, of course. But anyone even remotely interested in economics and politics should seriously study this compelling and influential work."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations","review":"Adam Smith provides his thoughts and observations on the economic and social effects of government and culture in 1776.

It is not from benevolence of the butcher, the brewer or the baker that we expect our dinner, but from their regard to their own interest. We address ourselves not to their humanity but to their self-love and never talk to them of our own necessities, but to their advantages. The real price of everything, what everything really costs to the man who wants to acquire it, is the trouble and toil of acquiring it. Smith contends that there are only 2 ways countries can become wealthy: (1). Their citizens being good savers and then invest these savings toward productive ends; and (2). By way of trade. National wealth grows when things and money are circulated and exchanged to the most remote corners of the globe. Finally, Adam Smith believes that nations will become rich only if natural liberty is promulgated for, society has a natural tendency to allocate resources in the best way.

In a nutshell, it details the mechanisms by which personal liberty -- accompanied by personal responsibility and a just system of government -- make nations, and the individuals who live in them, wealthy. I had a Marxist professor who did not like Adam Smith because Marxist theory prefers to emphasize class warfare, while Smith is saying that everyone is capable of providing for themselves and the less the government interferes, the better off we all are. Many conservatives, meanwhile, like Adam Smith because they seem to perceive a \\"survival of the fittest\\" philosophy in his works.

This is List's core argument and not to be confused with the &quot;infant industry&quot; characterization. Smith's work is of course a classic.

Please get the complete audio, and that's why.This book is so widely cited and interpreted contrary to the author's original thought, that every economist should read it completely to avoid being misled by such incorrect interpretations.First, let us take the \\"invisible hand\\" metaphor. When I have studied economy in the University, I was taught that almost the entire book is devoted to the \\"invisible hand\\" which means \\"self-corrective markets\\", \\"liberalism\\", \\"Laissez-faire\\" and \\"state non-intervention\\". After reading this book, I have found out that Adam Smith did use the term \\"invisible hand\\" only once in the entire book, in the discussion of domestic versus foreign trade.To illustrate the point, let me quote the text where term \\"invisible hand\\" is used: \\"First, every individual endeavours to employ his capital as near home as he can, and consequently as much as he can in the support of domestic industry, provided always that he can thereby obtain the ordinary, or not a great deal less than the ordinary profits of stock. Thus, upon equal, or nearly equal profits, every wholesale merchant naturally prefers the home trade to the foreign trade of consumption, and the foreign trade of consumption to the carrying trade. In the home trade, his capital is never so long out of his sight as it frequently is in the foreign trade of consumption. [...]Secondly, every individual who employs his capital in the support of domestic industry, necessarily endeavours so to direct that industry, that its produce may be of the greatest possible value. [...]As every individual, therefore, endeavours as much as he can, both to employ his capital in the support of domestic industry, and so to direct that industry that its produce maybe of the greatest value; every individual necessarily labours to render the annual revenue of the society as great as he can. He generally, indeed, neither intends to promote the public interest, nor knows how much he is promoting it. By preferring the support of domestic to that of foreign industry, he intends only his own security; and by directing that industry in such a manner as its produce may be of the greatest value, he intends only his own gain; and he is in this, as in many other cases, led by an invisible hand to promote an end which was no part of his intention. Nor is it always the worse for the society that it was no part of it.\\"After reading this book, I have found out that Adam Smith was influenced by French Physiocrats. The Physiocrats saw the true wealth of a nation as determined by the surplus of agricultural production over and above that needed to support agriculture (by feeding farm labourers and so forth). Other forms of economic activity, such as manufacturing, were viewed as taking this surplus agricultural production and transforming it into new products, by using the surplus agricultural production to feed the workers who produced the extra goods. While these manufacturers and other non agricultural workers may be useful, they were seen as 'sterile' in that their income derives ultimately not from their own work, but from the surplus production of the agricultural sector.I have found out that this book is not about \\"invisible hand\\" or \\"Laissez-faire\\". It is quite a complete study that covers almost every basic aspect of the economy, and remains an effective introduction to economics to this day.This book is so often mischaracterized and politicized that I suggest you to listen it completely by yourself. This is a must read for every economist.

Voter thinking 11/03/09 focused on jobs and the economy, and sent a clear message of dissatisfaction with economic progress to-date. Smith's recommendations have had a large role in creating that dissatisfaction. Private sector employment has dropped since 2000, home ownership and median family income are down since 1998 and the proportion living in poverty has risen. The topic's importance was re-emphasized 11/06/2009 with the release of data showing the unemployment rate continuing to climb - now 10.2% (not counting those who have given up looking, or are working only part-time). Adam Smith and Free Enterprise are not working; meanwhile, China's GDP is growing 8.5%.Reinvigorating Main Street America's employment picture, however, will not be easy. Problems have been building for years, long before the sub-prime crisis. Some believe automation is the major source of recent job losses. However, it is difficult to look at the constant parade of long trains carrying shipping containers inland, or the millions of illegals turning up all across America, and conclude that this is the case. Substantial improvement on Main Street will primarily require drastically limiting Smith's 'Free Trade.' Free Trade supporters repeatedly cite the imposition of Smoot-Hawley tariffs as substantially deepening and prolonging the Great Depression, and conclude that we must not turn protectionist. Reality, however, is that prior to Smoot-Hawley, the 1929 Trade Surplus was an insignificant 0.38% of our GDP, and could not possibly have had significant impact even if lost entirely. True, international trade plays a much bigger role than in 1930 - however, the fact that we've run large and increasing trade deficits for decades is prima-facie evidence that eg. no trade whatsoever would at least stop the bleeding.As for Adam Smith's famous Free Trade support, that occurred 200+ years ago - before across-the-board very large and low-cost competitors like China, India, Japan, Korea, Taiwan, and Vietnam, the Internet, jet planes, and massive cargo ships made a much large proportion of economies vulnerable to offshoring than ever before. We need to also remember that protectionism is what allowed the U.S. and its new Asian competitors to achieve their original economic strength. (Smith himself warned against taking Free Trade too far - such that a nation's security was endangered.)Free Trade defenders might assert that manufacturing and IT have borne the brunt of offshoring to date, and their future offshoring is not likely to increase. Recent trends and data, however, suggest service jobs will increasingly also become affected. American firms are already establishing R&D; facilities in China; Asian competitors not only have a cost advantage competing for engineering work, they also have the advantage of greater experience in production gained through producing our manufactures. Unfortunately, this also provides them with a natural lead-in to new areas - eg. offshored CRT-tube manufacturing experience helped Asians in new areas of plasma, LCD, photovoltaic, solar, and LED screen development and manufacturing, and this trend probably will extend into nanotubes as well. Data reported in Business Week's 11/09/2009 issue confirms the shift - over the past year, U.S. employment of scientists and engineers has fallen by 6.3%, while overall employment has fallen only 4.1%.Proposed U.S. economic remedies frequently suggest increasing the proportion of Americans receiving college degrees as a defense against offshoring. Alan Blinder, former Federal Reserve Vice-Chairman and current economics professor at Princeton, warns that the key distinction in whether a job is likely to be offshored or not will be in whether a particular service is delivered in person (haircuts, brain surgery) or not (computer programing) - not whether it is education intensive. (Elective brain surgery can also be offshored.) Thus, a college degree may no longer be a panacea. Blinder also believes it is quite likely that offshoring (unless changed) will depress the real wages of many U.S. workers who do not lose their jobs, the offshoring transition will continue for 2 - 3 decades and bring gross potential job losses in the range of 30- 40 million, and that American standards of living will decline. Proposals by still others to deal with offshoring job losses via more jobs in high-tech areas (eg. biotechnology) become ludicrous when viewed in the light of these numbers. Professor Blinder's suggestion makes much more sense - increased vocational education.Additionally, some Free Trade defenders contend that Chinese labor costs will soon become non-competitive. There are two problems with relying on this 'defense:' 1)Chinese productivity has also increased considerably. Economist Steven Roach (author of \\"The Next Asia\\") lives and works in China and reports that productivity in China's industrial sector surged nearly 20%/year from 2000-2004. Further, even after six years of double-digit increases, average hourly compensation for Chinese manufacturing workers was only 3% that of the U.S. average in 2004. (It's difficult to get reliable up-to-date information on China.) 2)By 2020 it is estimated that there will be 553 million non-agricultural workers in China - 100 million more than in all the developed world, according to Martin Jacques in \\"When China Rules the World.\\"Others contend that China cannot continue its rapid economic growth without Democracy, something it shows few signs of doing. Jacques, on the other hand, provides data showing that most Chinese believe the political climate has improved since 1989 (Tienanmen Square), and 72% of its population are satisfied with the condition of the country vs. only 39% in the U.S. (As for the widely reported large number of civil disturbances within China reported each year, Jacques contends most have nothing to do with the central government - eg. local land issues.)Finally, there is the large and growing problem of illegal immigrants taking jobs from American citizens. The U.S. already has enough problems finding work for its own citizens, and the problems are going to become much more severe via currently unfettered offshoring. It is numerically impossible for the U.S. to also provide jobs for the current number of illegal immigrants from Mexico, Central, and South America - we must sharply reduce the estimated 12 million illegal immigrants in the U.S.Bottom Line: Main Street America cannot withstand continually losing jobs to Free Trade, illegal workers, and automation. Wall Street, on the other hand, has benefited immensely from these job losses and shows no signs of changing direction. The recent financial crisis clearly demonstrated that financial markets are not self-correcting, and that Adam Smith's 'invisible hand' is not infallible. Immediate government redirection is required."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations","review":"I bought this book because it seems like a must read for anyone interested in business and economics.

As a result each individual is incapable of sustaining his basic needs and thus must purchase these using his labour which Smith views as the source of all value. As a result demand and supply is created for such labour.He makes the natural assumption that each individual pursues their best interests.He foreshadows the concepts of marginal utility and scarcity in determining the shapes of demand curves for commodities. ( He never actually mentions curves ).Similarly, he describes the three factors determining supply prices for commodities ( rent of land, wages and capital costs ) and the various factors which influence them ( the equivalent of modern supply/demand curves for each factor ).He puts these together under ideal circumstances to show how supply and demand meet to clear markets ( equilibrium in modern language ).He then turns to macroeconomics laying the foundations for GDP and shows how capital can be distributed to \\"unproductive labour\\" ( that labour used to maintain productive labour ) such as doctors lawyer entertainers etc and \\"productive labour\\" ( that labour used in the manufacture and distribution of raw and finished products ). He explores the consequences of various distribution of each from both the micro and macroeconomic perspective.He concludes by emphasizing the importance of government in providing international and domestic security as well as providing public works and institutions especially education.Naturally this requires state revenue and he devotes almost one entire \\"book\\" to taxes.He delves briefly into political economy especially merchantilism and it's detrimental effects to society at large.A great introduction to modern economics that is often missed in didactic lectures. This book gives the motivation for many modern economic concepts that is often lost in mathematical formalism."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations","review":"Adam Smith's Wealth of Nations brilliantly analyzes how a nation's living standards can be raised. In large part his wisdom still applies today. To briefly summarize Smith's thinking:1. Standards of living are determined by the productivity of workers.2. Productivity of workers is greatly enhanced by specialization (see the famous example of the pin factory in the first chapter!).3. Greater specialization is possible only if the market size grows. Thus, government laws that prohibit growth of the market hurt specialization, and thereby keep living standards from rising. This is why Smith opposed laws that restricted trade or created monopolies. Smith actively worked to keep Britain from going to war against its American colonies over trade issues. The Wealth of Nations is a political tract designed to sway the British parliament (obviously it failed in that regard).4. Productivity of workers is enhanced by raising their wages.5. Productivity of workers is enhanced by publicly funded education.6. The role of markets is exquisitely analyzed by Smith. Self-interest leads people to carry out private activities that lead to social betterment, as if by an &quot;invisible hand.&quot;7. It is a serious misinterpretation of Smith to assert that greed or selfishness is the same as self-interest. Smith labored hard to avoid any such confusion. Please see his other book which addresses this specific issue: The Theory of Moral Sentiments.8. Clearly Smith favored limited government. But Smith was NOT a strict advocate of laissez-faire. He ended his illustrious career as commissioner of customs, a job he took seriously, and which he would not have taken had he not thought this level of intervention in the economy warranted.Read the first three chapters of WN: they contain the essence of the arguments above.

(To my knowledge, neither of these editionsis abridged.) In 1904, Cannan, a professor at theLondon School of Economics, did two things that greatlyadd to the value of Smith's book.First, Cannan prepared a detailed index. For example,\\"invisible hand\\" appears in it. Just try to find theone (and only one) appearance of that phrase withoutan index. Most of the non-Cannan editions I've lookedat lack an index.Second, Cannan wrote and added brief marginalia.

Anyone who has been to college willrecognize much that is familiar in his thoughts (inBook V) on \\"Education of Youth\\". And he also franklyaddresses the downsides of capitalism. The book beginswith the division of labor as a powerful means ofadding productivity. But later (pp. 839-41 in my ModernLibrary edition), he recognizes the destructive effectsof division of labor and, in response, recommendsgovernment investment in public education.

This model serves as the foundation of the arguments in the entire book; and an excellent guide to analyze our modern market economies. Smith touches on various topics, ranging from market economics, history of colony establishments, state of opulence (briefly describing China in the 18th century), and of human nature and behavior in general.Much of Adam Smith's ideas have been distorted by subsequent scholars, some of whom contorted his ideas to suit their own purposes, while others might have simply misunderstood. For example, in coining the word 'the Invisible Hand', Smith recommended free market competition as the foundation for progressive opulance. However, his implicit assumption was that people seeking their own benefits also embraced compassion and sympathy in their moral values. This 'moral value' part is often missing in contemporary economic analysis. As such, to gain an understanding of his complete doctrine, you should read this economics book together with his other book \\"The Theory of Moral Sentiments\\", which explores definitions of moral values and virtues.Another issue worth mentioning is that lots of people thought that Capitalism was derived from Adam Smith's doctrine, and the current market economies in the USA is a descendent of this ideology. However, if we used his definitions and analysis to compare the current USA market system, you will find that parts of the US system seemed to match closer to the Merchantile System that Smith lambasted as inefficient and short-sighted.A lot has been said about Smith's keen observations and eloquent quotes, however, most failed to mention his uncanny sense of humor. For example, in discussing about labor compensation, Smith remarked that \\"The public admiration which attends upon such distinguished abilities, makes always a part of their rewards; a greater or smaller in proportion as it is higher or lower in degree. It makes a considerable part of that reward in the profession of physics; a still greater perhaps in that of law; in poetry and philosophy it makes almost the whole.\\"; when taken into contexts that Smith is a Scholar in Philosophy, and hence should expect \`public admiration' as his total compensation package, this sentence is almost hilarious.This book is an insightful read, albeit one that requires much pondering. It took Adam Smith ten years to complete the first edition of Wealth of Nations, hence I would strongly recommend taking a slow pace in this exploration of his wisdom.You might ask whether there is an easier way to read this book, perhaps through some summary others wrote.My opinion is really not to do that, because the gist of this book is on the thinking process and good learning does not come easy. Spend the time to reflect on his reasonings and you will gain significantly from his wisdom. Not to forget that you should get a copy of his other book \\"The Theory of Moral Sentiments\\" to fully appreciate the Wealth of Nations."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations","review":"I didn't read this exact edition, and I did read an abridged version.

I thought going back two hundred years might be a dicey move, but Mr. Smith's voice remains perfectly lucid, compelling, and marvelously informative. I cannot praise this book highly enough."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations","review":"The Wealth of Nations is an overview of economics by the Scottish philosopher Adam Smith around the time of the American Revolution. At the time of the writing, the popular ideology of economics was mercantilism - that is, countries should export as much products and import as much gold as possible. Hence, the somewhat strange title of the book. (The fact that \\"capitalism\\" and \\"economics\\" were not common phrases at the times doesn't help either)Much of what the book says confirms what any Economics 101 course would tell you - when you try to modify a free market, there are ripple effects. Take mercantilism again, as an example. Countries at the time tried to have \\"positive balances of trade\\", through methods such as prohibiting the exportation of gold, and encouraging exportation of everything else. This supposedly makes a country richer. In reality, all it does is make gold worth *less* in that country, because there are less products to buy per unit of gold available. This also leads to smuggling, where gold is sold to other countries where it is worth more.Smith understands that some government and taxation is necessary - there are some services that the free market cannot effectively provide. Conservatives seem to over-emphasize the famous \\"invisible hand of the free market\\" endorsed by Smith, while ignoring the fact that he endorses the idea of taxing the rich at a higher rate than the poor. (Source: page 1065 of the Bantam paperback edition)What would Smith think about the 21st century? I think he would be disappointed in our politics, both Democrat and Republican. Both Bush and Obama have overseen increases in the size of the federal government. Smith would likely be a conservative, but not a Republican or a \\"Tea Party\\" protester. He probably would've voted for Ron Paul in the 2008 primaries and Bob Barr in the general elections, despite flaws in both candidates. He would be against the War on Drugs, the bailouts, and probably the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. He would be just as worried about corporate monopolies as he would government monopolies. I'm not so sure what he would think about healthcare - there are definitely problems with American healthcare, but don't think he'd want a public option or insurance mandate as a reform.Adam Smith is a very clear writer. Despite the book's length, it's not a boring read. I only skipped about 100 pages, mostly numerical data and obsolete information. Definitely worth a read."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations","review":"The Wealth of Nations handles a lot of economical phenomena in a concrete but sometimes complex way. On one hand the book is filled with ideas, some convincing, some out-dated, some fundamental to the current believe in free-markets. These ideas are combined with appealing (or appalling) examples of the injustice done to people by disturbing the free-market. On the other hand however, I find that certain sections of the book require a lot of concentration. The book is an interesting, but slow and at times difficult, read.Essentially, it is a treatise on the power of individuals to maximise their own wealth and therefor a support for the natural liberty of men and an argument for free-markets. Not as a perfect system in which there will be no misery, but as a system that gives individuals the greatest (and most just) opportunity to gain happiness and which will be the quickest to respond to changes in supply and demand (and therefor decrease the misery which is created when governments ignore gaps between supply and demand).It is not a book that believes in the pure goodness of companies (but explicitly states that companies have a interest which is directly opposite to that of society as a whole. I.e. the interest of companies is to create a supply shortage so they can ask prices above costprice), but says that the best way to break the power of these companies is the allow free competition. It also reveals that political decisions that at fist glance seems compassionate, might in fact be inhumane, cruel and the cause of much suffering (because on the long run they lead to a supply shortage). The examples given here, are still relevant to view the decisions made by politicians in today's so-called free market countries.Comment on review of Micheal Brady, june 13 2005:Brady remarks that Smith was the first opponent of globalization. The (strange) evidence he gives to support this statement is that Smith supports the use of counter tariffs, if (and only if) this might lead to the removal of the initial tariff. This statement clearly shows that Smith was against protectionist measures like tariffs and only condoned them if in the short run they would lead to less protectionism and therefor more globalization! Brady also supports his statement by mentioning that Smith opposed any offshoring if the purpose of such offshoring was to supply the home market. The keyword here again being \\"if\\". Smith was against a nation stimulating offshoring because he saw no national gain.

Their topics are present in the political agenda of our governments right today, and after all other reviewers have written, better than I would do so, i should add four key points:- With no proper political institutions there is no possibility of creating wealth (it reminds me sad examples from today...Argentina?). Smith thinks it is very important having economic liberties, besides independent magistrates, and a national state committed to enforce the contracts privates sign up to make transactions when some party doesn't want to comply them.- Under the right framework of political institutions is posible to have private interests and public interest converging on the same \\"bargain zone\\". Under Smith's point of view is the mercantilism, as a policy of state, policy that picks up the winners since the desk of politicians instead of from the shops of every-day industry and parsimony of workers and entrepreuners what creates the conflict (even though he makes some exceptions, like the Navigation Act, but he regards the need of this monopoly of english navy by national security reasons only).- After the short-run adjustments, the income distribution matters, that are so important for politicians, should be resolved by the market and the entrepreuners whom, by searching opportunities to make more profits, will make converging the prices of land, labour and goods.- The accumulation of capital is the process that lowers interest rates, expands the supply of loans and suports higher degrees of division of labour in the economy. This process should let people have cheaper goods along the time and improve the wages of workers. The tax system should not stop this process, by \\"punishing\\" profits and the letting the remaining sources of rent free (wages, and rent of land).Under Smith's point of view scarcity and poverty are historical and social problems, and their solutions are in history and in social interaction too.There are not worlds beyond every-day reality, as socialists made us to believe some time ago...just trade and division of labour and accumulation of capital, and so on. Let history and people surprise us. They will make the wealth, not the governments. The Smith system is open to history and change, and learnship, and only requires good foundations to secure an historical outcome of wealth.The world of today has institutions that were not in XVIIIth century: global financial institutions and spread trade agreements, that create barriers at some places and open gates at anothers. And now we have new constraints (the environment,..) and new key players (global corporations, ..). But this new scene only makes smaller the room of economic policy choices for latin american governments.

As pointed out by Ronald Coase,we don't see any further insight on the understanding of economic system over these 200 years. We could only see every newspaper and magazines are talking on how to stimulate the consumption to boost the GDP; or government officials announce to increase government expenditure to stimulate the economy. It seems that the only question to economic growth depends on how much we spend. But if it is true, do it imply that we could be wealthy by just spend and spend and without further work?It is only after reading the first sentence of the book I remember the only truth that seems also to be forgotten by many people: it is only our labour that determine the wealth of nations, and also yourself. The book use a lot of illustrations to show how the division of labour could increase the production and it is on our self-interest to make exchange that give rise to division of labour, the theme that has mentioned by other reviewers and books.You should have read a lot of quotations from the book but you could not understand fully the central theme of the book by just few sentences.

From the very first chapter, Smith makes clear the genius of markets, the benefits of the division of labor, and how government intrusion upon &quot;perfect liberty&quot; creates economic inefficiencies. As the Industrial Revolution was in its infancy, Smith keenly perceived the theoretical framework for its future development: property rights, markets, free trade, and government non-intervention. These institutions allowed for unprecedented economic growth (there was more economic growth in the 19th century than in the preceeding 4000 years) and thus the sustainability of modern life.

When I have studied economy in the University, I was taught that almost the entire book is devoted to the \\"invisible hand\\" which means \\"self-corrective markets\\", \\"liberalism\\", \\"Laissez-faire\\" and \\"state non-intervention\\". After reading this book, I have found out that Adam Smith did use the term \\"invisible hand\\" only once in the entire book, in the discussion of domestic versus foreign trade.To illustrate the point, let me quote the text where term \\"invisible hand\\" is used: \\"First, every individual endeavours to employ his capital as near home as he can, and consequently as much as he can in the support of domestic industry, provided always that he can thereby obtain the ordinary, or not a great deal less than the ordinary profits of stock. Thus, upon equal, or nearly equal profits, every wholesale merchant naturally prefers the home trade to the foreign trade of consumption, and the foreign trade of consumption to the carrying trade. In the home trade, his capital is never so long out of his sight as it frequently is in the foreign trade of consumption. [...]Secondly, every individual who employs his capital in the support of domestic industry, necessarily endeavours so to direct that industry, that its produce may be of the greatest possible value. [...]As every individual, therefore, endeavours as much as he can, both to employ his capital in the support of domestic industry, and so to direct that industry that its produce maybe of the greatest value; every individual necessarily labours to render the annual revenue of the society as great as he can. He generally, indeed, neither intends to promote the public interest, nor knows how much he is promoting it. By preferring the support of domestic to that of foreign industry, he intends only his own security; and by directing that industry in such a manner as its produce may be of the greatest value, he intends only his own gain; and he is in this, as in many other cases, led by an invisible hand to promote an end which was no part of his intention. Nor is it always the worse for the society that it was no part of it.\\"After reading this book, I have found out that Adam Smith was influenced by French Physiocrats. The Physiocrats saw the true wealth of a nation as determined by the surplus of agricultural production over and above that needed to support agriculture (by feeding farm labourers and so forth). Other forms of economic activity, such as manufacturing, were viewed as taking this surplus agricultural production and transforming it into new products, by using the surplus agricultural production to feed the workers who produced the extra goods. While these manufacturers and other non agricultural workers may be useful, they were seen as 'sterile' in that their income derives ultimately not from their own work, but from the surplus production of the agricultural sector.I have found out that this book is not about \\"invisible hand\\" or \\"Laissez-faire\\". It is quite a complete study that covers almost every basic aspect of the economy, and remains an effective introduction to economics to this day. Just don't start reading economic books from this book. It would be hard to understand. It assumes that you already have economics background, i.e. have studied economics for a few years.This book is so often mischaracterized and politicized that I suggest you to read it completely by yourself. This is a must read for every economist. You can get an audio version of this book to avoid lengthy read."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations","review":"Wealth of Nations by Adam Smith is a great read for anyone wanting to know the foundations of economics and how money works in our world.

It is a fairly aggressive book based on its size with almost 1,000 pages of fairly fine print of which half of it is dedicated to the supply and demand of corn. But it is surprisingly readable and even interesting. And it is the basic textbook of all economics.Wealth is defined as production capability or what we might call GDP.I figure with a changing economy, it never hurts to brush up on the basics. We are in a period of sharp changes in supply and demand. It is important for business leaders to try to understand what impact this will have on them and their companies.One principle that Adam espouses is the division of labour.He also talks about principals, those are the people that supply the capital that is put to use by the agents (people who apply the capital). His view is that people should not do both, they should do one or the other. It is an interesting thought.He is very harsh on protectionism (as am I).I am not going to recommend reading it because the size is too daunting for many people.

It gives a clear, proper - though sometimes a bit long - explanation of the laws of the market and exposes the logical workings of the &quot;invisible hand&quot;. However, as it was written for its own time, it refers tocontemporary events, people and nation-states, and that makes it hard for anyone but a history buff to understand many of Smith's points. Outdated and mutated words appear on almost every page and adds to this complicating It seems as if Smith's text was left completely intact. The book is also very long - almost 600 pages - and at times it relatively dull. For these flaws I felt it necessary to remove one star. However, the book deserves the other four stars for its remarkable clarity in destroying socialist arguments for the conscious ability of humanity to put the interest of the group ahead of their own."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations","review":"The simple points upon which this book is based might be much easier to understand today than when it was written, because a large part of the growth of the world economy has been based on the ideas about the growth of capital which this book assumed as the fundamental surplus value of economic activity. Less than a century later, Karl Marx was able to demonstrate, in his book, THE POVERTY OF PHILOSOPHY, how vacuous the ideas of good and bad, as they are usually applied in political economy, turn out to be in practice. Americans have largely accepted the notion of a consumer society totally dependent on copyright and trade laws to protect the value of the entertainment and related therapeutic products which it produces. What might be most upsetting to readers of this book, that someone like myself could use it to reflect on the events of 9/11/2001 as a challenge to such modern assumptions, as if the policing powers which maintain the world financial situation of today have more to fear from an examination of how this book treats consumption than from the usual lessons based on the growth of wealth, might make this an unacceptable view of what this book actually says.When this book was written, Adam Smith was able to combine economic ideas about the distribution and production (which he considered the highest good) of articles of commerce, in contrast to \\"the bad effects of the monopoly,\\" in a way that caused thinking people in Britain to believe that the world would be materially better off if the American colonies were free of rules which required those who produced all the tobacco from Maryland and Virginia to sell it in or through Great Britain. Adam Smith was worried that capital maintained to store this product in London was depriving England of the opportunity to produce goods that would generate more wealth. \\"At the port of London, indeed, it is commonly sold for ready money. The rule is, Weigh and pay. At the port of London, therefore, the final returns of the whole round-about trade are more distant than the returns from America by the time only that goods may lie unsold in the warehouse; where, however, they may sometimes lie long enough.\\" The American revolution was greeted by economic free traders as an event likely to cause a great increase in the wealth of nations, and the normally victorious political element maintains a strong belief in this fiscal ideology.The current situation might be closer to \\"the time only which the goods may lie unsold in the warehouse.\\" Near the end of Book IV, \\"Of Systems of Political Economy,\\" Chapter VII, \\"Of Colonies,\\" there was a frightening example of how bad things might get to be. \\"In Spain and Portugal the bad effects of the monopoly, aggravated by other causes, have perhaps nearly overbalanced the natural good effects of the colony trade.\\" Plenty of things went wrong, causing a large portion of the population to feel that they were victims of circumstances, \\" . . . but above all, that irregular and partial administration of justice, which often protects the rich and powerful debtor from the pursuit of his injured creditor, and which makes the industrious part of the nation afraid to prepare goods for consumption of those haughty and great men to whom they dare not refuse to sell upon credit, and from whom they are altogether uncertain of repayment.\\" Certainly, a great deal of money is in circulation today, and a tremendous amount is considered working capital, capable of producing many things that people might want, but the routine search for contraband includes cash in an amount exceeding $10,000, the amount which might be capable of buying a large amount of illegal substances. Police are actually so unfamiliar with cash transactions that large amounts might be held as evidence, until the police have been convinced that they have no reason to suspect the person who had the money of being involved in any sort of laundering activity. When Adam Smith was writing, his work was as shocking to those controlling the monopolies of his day as radical protests of today rile the police on the beat today, whose confiscation of vehicles, which are sometimes temporary, to see if they were used to transport illegal substances, is not considered in any way similar to hijacking airplanes in order to crash them into buildings which symbolize a violation of the right of the people to personal pleasure in a manner which averts the collapse of society as we know it.

Similar to Clauswitz's \\"On War\\" for the military strategist, or Plato's \\"Republic\\" for the political philosopher, this is a must read for anyone who lives in a free-market economy.Adam Smith goes through a completely exhausting and methodical explanation about the nature of money. The multitude of examples and depth of discussion could stop a Mack truck, but the lessons are critical. It teaches you about the true nature of money; where it comes from, what it means. That, in turn, as you reflect on your own life, will illustrate much about how you prioritize your own life.Along with Ayn Rand's \\"Atlas Shrugged,\\" this book will indisputably change your perception of the nature of money and a how person chooses to earn their living.The only drawback to the book is that it is brutally boring--but get a large cup of Java, sit back, and dig in.

And slavery like it or not is a part of economics. It's a way to get labor for very cheap (like food, water and shelter only). On page 744 he does however call it the unfortunate law of slavery. Slavery is abhorrent and prevents the whole from reaching their great potential for the benefit of a few (the wealthy who have slaves and the consumers who get products much cheaper because of it).On page 110-111 This really stands out \\"No Society can surely be flourishing and happy of which the far greater part of the members are poor and miserable\\"Adam Smith does however place too much emphasis on Corn being the commodity that everything is measured against. It's just as easy to switch to a different food source like Rice for instance. That if enough people switched to would cause the price of corn to drop or stop being planted.On page 986 He says there is no public institution for the education of women and he talks about not educating the women like the men. He says they are taught only what their parents or guardian judge it necessary or useful for them to learn and nothing else. This clealy isn't good either but I know he was just stating a fact of life at the time.I cry BRAVO!!! for Adam Smith's take on Religion. He got the true religion right! On page 998 it says \\"because in every religion except the true it is highly pernicious and it has a natural tendency to pervert the true, by infusing into it a strong mixture of superstition, folly and delusion. Each ghostly practitioner in order to render himself more precious and sacred in the eyes of his retainers will inspire them with the most violent abhorrences of all other sects. No regard will be paid to Truth, Morals or Decency.\\" The true religion extols Truth, Morals and Decency as Jesus taught us to keep the commandments. This is the whole duty of man. To speak the truth and walk uprightly. To not steal, Not Lie, Not commit adultery, etc. But today's organized religions are more interested in building bigger buildings to get more money collected for the most part than to do good works.On page 1067 Adam Smith says \\"the ground rents of uninhabited houses ought to pay no tax\\". I wholeheartedly disagree with thisstatement. This would allow the very wealthy to own so much land that the poorer people could never own their own piece of property. That's what property taxes are for to prevent this from happening. If the poor abandon all these houses that the very wealthy own then eventually the very wealthy will be unable to pay property tax and the government will take control of their property and put it back into circulation providing their workers places to live. That's why the proper way is the way the government of the the U.S. (or maybe Idaho) has implemented it. You get a tax break for your primary residence for your place to live but none from additional properties. Not to mention another country with a lot of cash could buy up all the property in your country and control too much without doing the labor needed to keep a country functioning properly.But overall it's a very good book.Sincerely,Jon Beckmon"},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations","review":"Adam Smith's \\"The Wealth of Nations\\" is truly one of the most influential books in world history. Published in 1776, it discussed many of the economic ideas of the thought system we refer to today as classical or nineteenth-century liberalism.First and foremost, it enumerated the capitalist doctrines that led to the awesome increase in living standards over the past two centuries--doctrines such as free trade, the importance of economic growth for a society, and the idea that the entire society benefits when the individual is encouraged to pursue his economic self-interest.Smith also examined the topics of paper money and commodity standards and provided examples from the past of when currencies were debased during hard times. Perhaps the most sobering part of the book from the point of view of today is the section that discussed how governments, when they have spent far too much and can no longer service their debt, must either repudiate the debt or incinerate it via severe inflation--we can only hope that the gross overspending in recent years on the part of both parties in Washington will not bring us to that point in the coming years.Some of the other topics on which Smith held forth include apprenticeships, colonies, agriculture, defense, taxes, the differences between public and private sector employment, and fascinating comparisons of wage rates between England and the then-colonies and between parts of Britain.The book is very readable despite the fact it was written in eighteenth-century English, and is definitely worth tackling if you have a serious interest in economics."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations","review":"Though Smith's &quot;Wealth of Nations&quot; is a true classic written in lucid English, and the foundation of our modern economy, I cannot say that it is all-too-important for most people to read this book. Weighing in 700+ pages for a typical printing, this work is not a quick and easy read by any stretch of the imagination. Many of Smith's great metaphors are found in the first quarter of the book, and I felt bored reading the latter parts. It is not that Smith was wrong, by any means, but rather that many of his arguments are now well-accepted and can be demonstrated in much more succinct manners. I feel that Smith's multitudes of examples are not particularly important to the average man.With that said, I reiterate that this is an important work that should be understood by everyone - but this does not necessarily mean reading all of it.

The vocabulary is be a little challenging, but that's why your Kindle has a dictionary built in - and you may also need Google, as I did, for some of the more obscure usages. A little background in 17th-18th century British history also helps. I recommend making plenty of notes in your Kindle as you go.Smith compares/contrasts the economies of hunter-gatherer, nomadic and warrior civilizations, as well as feudal and mercantilist economies, and outlines a free-trade system which he would like to see, which we call \\"capitalism\\". Unfortunately, it seems to me that the mercantile system has prevailed in the long run, at least as far as international trade is concerned. He makes considerable use of historical examples as well as contemporary (to him) events, and he seems ambivalent about the prospects for the American colonies which were then in revolt.Wordy?

It's a little tough to follow at first, but you get used to it. If you've read America's founding fathers it really constitutes NO difficulty2) Despite the language, this book is VERY readable.

This version (Bantam Classics) has 1208 pages.4) I wish Bantam would have given more room for notes in the margin.A few other observations about this book-* I was AMAZED by how different banking and financing were in the 1770s.* This book illustrates in SO many ways that people haven't changed AT ALL-very interesting - and amusing to see that illustrated over and over again.* Be prepared for an unrelating (and very convincing) argument for completely free trade.* Some of his digressions (especially the one on corn) were a little tough to get through.* He is SO honest in this book. In a day when pro-business talking heads will excuse any excess-Adam Smith has NO problem taking certain business practices to task. This book taught me, an Unrepentant Capitalist Pig that it is not only OK, but desirable to denounce bad business practices.* I feel a lot of the material in this book shows that a \\"gold standard\\" currency is not the magic bullet that many people today pretend it to be. (not that it's bad-but gold standard has it's own problems)* I feel the material in this book (specifically book 5) could be used to make a strong argument FOR the Fair tax (National Sales Tax)* The arguments he makes about the colonies in North America (us) are VERY surprising. I don't want to spoil it-but I had to re-read it a few times to make sure I understood what he said. - His argument makes sense, but I didn't see it coming.* Being a proud Pennsylvania resident, I was excited to see all the Pennsylvania references.* This book should be REQUIRED reading for any politician who will be assuming elected office.

A lesser problem is that the paragraphs in the text do not begin with indents; thus, the only way to tell when a new paragraph starts is if you come to a line that extends only halfway across the screen.On the plus side, this edition does include the explanatory call-outs of the original (in italics at the end of each section they pertain to) and the lengthy 1906 explanatory introduction by Edwin Cannan (though for some reason not the introduction by Robert Rubin to the recent Modern Library paperback).But it's a shame that Modern Library didn't do a better job with the formatting, especially since other Kindle publishers have made TWON available at a fraction of what Modern Library charges."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations","review":"This book is so widely cited and interpreted contrary to the author's original thought, that every economist should read it completely to avoid being misled by such incorrect interpretations.First, let us take the \\"invisible hand\\" metaphor.

With a little discipline, I think that the erudite reader will take away many enriching (yes, pun intended) lessons from Smith's ground breaking treatise. For me, as a business professional and business student (I have an MBA), the Wealth of Nations was a Damascus Road experience.I think there are several myths about economics that are exploded by a first hand reading of Wealth of Nations. Many supply side economists eagerly tout Smith's \\"invisible hand\\" metaphor in advocating deregulated markets, but in my view, Smith took a balanced and integrated approach in analyzing the supply and demand sides of national economy. In the first chapter Smith notes that national wealth is the production of labor. This has dual implications in that production is the creation of supply, but the labor force consumes that supply by trading the resulting wealth. These are two sides to the same coin, &amp; therefore indivisible. Also in the first chapter, Smith notes that increasingly sophisticated economies will employ a division of labor to increase production efficiency, which is another concept that necessarily integrates supply and demand, production and consumption.Smith devotes quite a bit of time lamenting governmental intrusion into economics by way of regulation. However, he does not condemn government regulation per se, but make very specific criticisms against those state regulatory polices that tend to create monopolies. None of his comments are strictly political in nature. Smith's analysis is purely based on economics &amp; the efficient allocation of capital. He views the enemy not as the King's ministers, but rather the monopolies that were so prevalent during the 18th century mercantile system.On a related note, I think it is clear that Smith would be horrified by the military centric nature of many post-industrial economies today. He notes that a standing army is a drain on national wealth. Essentially the state is paying workers not to work, but rather to stand ready to fight. I suspect that Smith would view large state defense budgets as being most closely akin to a transfer payment made by a welfare state. For those who will scream invective at me for saying this, please remember that the largest item on any defense budget by far, is payroll.Finally, as an amateur historian, I enjoyed the brief glimpse into what life was like in the 18th century Empire from an economist's perspective. Various parts of his book review social welfare systems of his day, as well as international banking, political economy, agrarian systems, and life in general."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations","review":"Its a bit difficult to make a comment on the writtings for validity of Adam Smith.

This is a review of the Modern Library hardcover edition, which I ordered here at Amazon.com.Let it be said right off the bat that the big thing Marx gets trashed for has roots right here in the 'W of N:' namely, the Labor Theory of Value. Both Volume One of 'Capital' and 'W of N' spend the first 100 pages or so going over it. Both refer back to it constantly in later pasages. And both must be taken off the table without it. The LTV boils down to this: all value is created by people working and producing goods and services that other people need and/or want. Furthermore, they must produce these goods and services at at least the average level of productivity and at the appropriate level of demand. Otherwise you're working either harder or more easily for your cut of the national pie than you otherwise would. The LTV is so straightforward and intuitive you'd think there wouldn't be much of an argument.The one thing Smith stresses throughout the book is the need for what he calls 'perfect liberty,' where everyone is allowed to buy and sell what they want from where ever they'd like. With this, resources would be diverted to where they needed to be as quickly as possible so people would stop wasting their time WORKING (see how the LTV operates here?) on things that should be made elsewhere.It's important to understand that neither the words 'capital' nor 'capitalist' ever occur in this work. This is very important because both words carry baggage Smith would break no bread with. In fact, the main bad guys in this work are the very people we would call 'capitalist' today. They subvert Parliament through bribery and intimidation, protect their own interests at the expense of everybody else in society, and raise unholy hell when workers try to form unions. All the while, of course, they form unions amongst themselves with the express purpose of stabbing the rest of us in the back.Sound familiar?Let me give you a modern example of how desperately we need American economists to actually pick up and read this book, as opposed to just talking about what a good boy Adam Smith was. Contrary to the propaganda we're getting out of our media, alternative sources of energy are now ready for prime time. There's nothing the internal combustion engine can do that hydrogen fuel cells can't do better. The price of solar cells has been dropping like a rock for years. And wind power is now the second cheapest source of energy after dirty coal. All we need to do is divert all that money we use to protect our oil resources into building up the economy of scale for these products (i.e. reducing the amount of WORK necessary to build each unit; this is the LTV lurking around again), and turn all these into cheap bulk commodities. We'll also need to use this money to build up the infrastructure necessary to safely deliver and store hydrogen. Then, after these (admittedly) high entry costs (i.e. expenditures of LABOR), we'll have access to unlimited, clean, and cheap sources of energy. The nonsense we have instead, which came to serious crises in 2001 in California with the impeachable collusion of the Bush administration, has nothing to do with Adam Smith's great work. I don't know about you, but I'm pretty tired of socializing the risk while privatizing the profits for this industry. Our current urge to go to war with Iraq precisely reflects the urge of 18th century statesmen to protect the interest of the mercantilist (capitalist!!) masters. This was a tragedy Smith covers quite extensively.As an added bonus he's a great read. After working so hard on Marx I was very happily surprised.Karl Marx brought the LTV to a fine polish, going beyond Adam Smith and showing how it translates into the average rate of profit, interest rates, standard of living, etc. He picked up where Smith left off. Also, using the weapon of dialectical materialism (i.e. the logic of motion and change -- the true heart of Marxism), Marx was able to show how capitalism, in fact, negates private property.

Adam Smith's \\"The Wealth of Nation\\" establishes the theoretical framework for Capitalism covering every aspect of an economic system that has created the highest standard of living known to man. Adam Smith shows how the interplay between labor, stock and land serve to generate the wealth of a nation. The keys to wealth are freedom, productive men, productive stock, and productive land. Smith says that the role of government is threefold - to protect the land from foreign invasion, enforce contracts and maintain a physical and legal infrastructure that promotes commerce and investment. Government produces nothing and therefore the expense of government reduces the wealth of a nation. Taxes are akin to a proportional reduction in the productivity of labor, stock and land and so should be kept at a minimum in order to increase the wealth of a nation. Any government role beyond the promotion and protection of investment reduces the wealth of a nation and of its people Adam Smith would oppose the many government programs that litter the landscape of the Federal Government today. Welfare, Social Security, education spending by the government, and other non-defense or infrastructure related expenditures diminish the productivity of the people and consequently their wealth. The majority of the people in the United States would have been much wealthier had it not been for these programs.Adam Smith was also a proponent of free trade. He understood that countries varied in the productivity of the land and the people and that only through free trade could the advantages inherent in different lands and peoples be harnessed to increase the wealth of nations. He opposed guilds and unions which only protected the few at the expense of the many and consequently reduced the wealth of a nation by reducing the productivity of its people.Adam Smith was truly a man for all season and for all time. It's unfortunate that our politicians and educators are more familiar and enamored by the idiot Karl Marx than they are with Adam Smith.

So let me boil it down for you:Adam Smith considered Free Enterprise to be by far the best method of economic interaction possible. HOWEVER, the book is almost completely about collusions or what he often calls monopolies where two or more people get together to avoid competition. He goes on in depth about the sickness that corporations, governments, and even religious institutions can inflict upon free enterprise. See why I say he was so smart?

It is for people who have an interest in classical political economy and its relation to the marginalist tradition. What I have attempted to do is take a critical approach toward contemporary mainstream economics based on what is written in the Wealth of Nations. I hope you enjoy it, and I look forward to constructive criticism and debate.Adam Smith has had by far the greatest general impact on the formation of economic theory of all economic thinkers since - it was he who cast the mold within which the future of economic thought would take place. What I believe has been neglected in most accounts of Smith's contributions to economic theory, however, is that in his attempt at establishing a unified theory of political economy he was instead responsible for developing the framework from which two conflicting theoretical approaches towards economic analysis would later be derived - one with focus on market relations and the other with focus on the relations of production. This marks the beginnings of what has been, in my opinion, a major inconsistency in the development of economic thought - the incompatibility of the former tradition of economic analysis, when taken in isolation from the latter, with the main pivot of Smith's theoretical justification for capitalist development in the \`Wealth of Nations'. The separation of these two areas, it will be argued, has been the result of the further development of certain aspects of Smiths core theoretical insights to the exclusion of deeper inquiry into an understanding of his attempted explanation of their origin and nature. Its product has been a superficial understanding of economic phenomena under capitalist relations responsible for the endless stream of conclusions that manage to both be incompatible with one another and claim immutability. Its practical impact has been to legitimize a system of ideas, culminating in the \`discovery' of universal economic laws detached from and functioning independent of social relations, that has fettered the further cultural and political progression of humanity through the intellectual impoverishment of human life.----------The \`Wealth of Nations', though it was overwhelmingly concerned with practical application and the specific policies of its time, has not cast such a long shadow on the progression of economic thought simply by merit of its attacks on the effects of Mercantilist economic policy. There were political economists before and after Smith who had carried out similar attacks, as is shown by the fact that Smith derived his argument against Mercantilist protectionist policy from Hume. Instead, the major impact of the \`Wealth of Nations' on economic thought has been its attempted establishment of a theoretical framework in which individual self interest was the driving force of an economic system that was propelled by its own momentum and functioned according to its own laws. In Schumpeter's words, it put forth the major assertion that \\"the free interaction of individuals produces not chaos but an orderly pattern that is logically determined\\". This orderly pattern was, for Smith, the tendential movement of the market prices of commodities toward their natural values. The major theoretical task of the \`Wealth of Nations' was an unveiling of the mechanisms that function to ensure this continuous movement of all nominal values toward their natural values within the framework of the free interaction of individuals. In this sense, Smith's argument against the Mercantilist system of political economy was, for all intensive purposes, an application ofhis general theory of natural value; there existed a \`natural' level to which any artificial adjustment in the quantity of money would adjust. The thrust of Smith's critiques on the effects of the Mercantilist doctrine are to be interpreted in the context of this distinction between natural and artificial value, within which its effects are extended beyond simple redundancy.Smith began his theory of value and price determination with a distinction between what he called the natural value of commodities and their market price, or their nominal and real price. The market price of a commodity is the price at any given moment of time in which commodities are exchanging for one another. Market prices fluctuate as a reaction to myriad natural and manmade phenomena and are in turn regulated by the interplay of supply and demand. If a drought adversely affects the yield of corn for a given period it would be the cause of a reduction in the supply of corn in relation to the level of effectual demand and a subsequent increase in market price; if it for some reason becomes fashionable to wear pink overcoats, assuming of course that individuals in a given society desire to be fashionable, then the effectual demand for pink overcoats will increase in relation to available supply and consequently so will the market price of pink overcoats. Value, on the other hand, is the point around which these movements, or vibrations, of price gravitate. Smith believed that individual commodities will rarely, if ever, exchange at their value due to constant changes and/or disruptions in the conditions of any given market. The hypothetical; point at which value and price meet may be understood as the more familiar concept of equilibrium; the point that competition would yield in the long run through the interplay of supply and demand on the market.The importance of these two concepts for Smith's theoretical framework was the effect that competition had on individual producers to cause the prices of commodities to always be in tendential movement toward their value. Essentially competition, which was restricted under the auspices of the \`Commercial System', was the force acting on individual producers which would ensure, in the long run, that commodities would be bought and sold at precisely the amount required to produce them - their value. There are two main justifications for the desirable nature of this process. On the one hand Smith believed that when prices were at their value the entire economic system was in turn at the highest point of efficiency and equality it could possibly be. On the other hand, Smith believed that this movement would ultimately benefit the mass of people with lower prices, which would continue to decrease in proportion to the advances in the conditions of production of commodities. Competition would in turn pressure individual producers to apply these cost lowering technical advances to the production process because of the need to reduce the value of their commodities in order to command a larger share of their respective markets, hence allowing for a higher rate of profit and the ability to continually reinvest their capital to repeat the same process indefinitely. Thus, it was on this tendency of competition to move the prices of commodities toward their values, and in time to reduce their values, that Smith's entire justification for the elimination of Mercantilist protection and privilege in favor of a system based on the free interaction of individuals ultimately rested. Not only was the Mercantilist doctrine of money manipulation redundant, but the means by which it attempted to achieve this ultimate redundancy prevented the functioning of extremely powerful mechanisms that Smith believed ensured the long run reduction in values of commodities - the betterment of the masses of people through the further development of the productive forces of society. As Schumpeter described: \\"It is the cheap cloth, the cheap cotton and rayon fabric, boots, motorcars and so on that are the typical achievements of capitalist production, and not as a rule improvements that would mean much to the rich man. Queen Elizabeth owned silk stockings. The capitalist achievement does not typically consist in providing more silk stockings for queens but in bringing them within the reach of the factory girls in return for steadily decreasing amounts of effort\\"Contemporary mainstream economics, a position held by the neoclassical tradition, though seemingly rejecting value as an \`economic' concept, has in fact incorporated selective parts of what has been its derivative into their theory of prices in market economies. This has been accomplished by simply supplanting the tension between value and price with what is their emergent concept of equilibrium, within which the whole of their analysis of price formation takes place. Within their framework, though for all intense and purposes similar, the nature of equilibrium, being for Smith a hypothetical position of the meeting of value and price, thus takes on an entirely different meaning. They essentially adopted a view of equilibrium as being determined by the equalization of the supply of commodities with their respective demand, the signals to which occur in exchange relations on the market. There is no contrast on which Smith placed prime importance between the 'natural' value determined in production to which all \`artificial' prices determined in exchange are constantly tending, but simply \`equilibrium' prices as given by the aggregation of subjective judgments of individuals - thus making the interaction of market mechanisms with man, which Smith attributed solely to the measuring rod of \`market' price, the explanation of value a. In this regard, 'value' is transformed into a function of the influence of demand upon costs of s well production - more specifically on the last fragment of want not satisfied - and ultimately purported to be a subjective calculation of individuals. Prices are now the reflection of the interaction between these marginal rates of substitution of individual consumers and marginal costs of production of producers - Marginal substitution as the demand schedule of individuals which, operating under the \`law' of diminishing marginal utility, decreases for every increase in the price of a commodity and increases for every decrease in the price of a commodity; Marginal cost as the supply schedule of producers which, under conditions of diminishing returns, decreases as more units are produced.The effect of this change, curiously enough, was largely on the classical theories of distribution. By shifting the focus of an inquiry into the forces acting on price away from the realm of production to the realm of exchange, essentially making the regulating force of price the subjective valuations of commodities and their impact on the costs of producing those commodities, it rendered meaningless what was of prime importance for Ricardo, and Marx thereafter - distribution between economic classes and its deterministic effects on the outcome of exchange. Theories of distribution had formerly attempted to explain the division of value between different social classes in a given society. Smith himself identified the \`three great classes' of society to \\"which the price of every commodity ultimately resolved\\" as being landowners, laborers, and manufactures - it was Ricardo, and more extensively Marx afterward, that showed the conditions in which this division of value between them took place was located in the realm of production before exchange took place. Gracious as they were in escaping them, these questions of class and the division of value between them became for economists not so much irrelevant in a greater sense, but \`outside' of what economic analysis set out to answer as they were now \`outside' of the theoretical determination of price. There was no longer a separation between exchange value and use value, but the derivation of exchange value from use value (utility). Distribution therefore became determined not from conditions of production but from exchange relations.This subtle maneuver of redefining equilibrium, or we should say using it for different purposes, served to retain positive aspects of Smith's analysis to the exclusion of what the logical extension of his system by further inquiry unveiled: It ultimately served the exact same purpose of having competition operate to tend prices to a point of efficiency and equality, where things are sold at precisely what they are worth (now subjectively determined by some feat of aggregating what occurs on the individual level of optimizing preferences), thus allowing for the maintenance of the virtuous development that Smith associated with the free interaction of individuals and the discarding of the negative features that became associated with Marx's later \`socially necessary labor time'. Not only were the later logical extensions of Ricardo and Marx that spoiled the virtuous cycle done away with in a single stroke, but extremely important aspects of Smith - from the identification and examination of the interaction between social classes to the objective nature of value existing in production - were all safely brushed aside.The vicious circle, however, eventually caught up with utopia: the attempted formalization of this interplay between market mechanisms and man as both the measuring rod of and the explanation for value brought an inconsistency: initial distribution continued to claim overarching priority in the formation of price. The expression of utility that was the interaction of man with the market could not possibly be based on subjective measurements of value, but on the actual purchasing power which translated into market pull. Thus, the independent postulation of some pre-existing income level or distribution was necessary for the internal consistency of any formal demonstration of price determination based on marginal utility. Essentially, This is the root of what will later be shown to be the major contradiction in the superficial extension of Adam Smith; it essentially revolves around the assumption most fundamental to all conceptual frameworks, that question supposedly \`outside' of the economists' domain - value.--------As Smith believes that the market price of commodities, regulated by their value, is established by the forces of supply and demand, he in turn identifies the natural price of commodities, the actual substance of value, as being equal to the labor necessary to produce them. He holds the latter to be the case because he believes that a commodity is essentially worth the amount of labor it is able to command on the market - if the producer of X enters into exchange relations with the producer of Y, and the production of X requires 10 hours or labor whereas the production of Y requires 5 hours of labor, then, in the hypothetical instance of commodities exchanging at their value, the producer of X will exchange one unit of X for two units of Y. Already within the beginning of his inquiry is the major problem, and what in the end removes all unity from his whole conceptual framework, to be found. It arises from the fact that Smith ultimately merges his explanation of the substance of value into what he before held as distinct, market relations - for what Smith is now basing his explanation of value upon is here the extent to which labor can be commanded in exchange, and not the \\"so much less labour than before\\" that makes up the substance of exchange value, or the labor embodied within commodities in the process of production.Let us examine this issue further. Smith, in holding the labor commanded by commodities as the explanation of their value, is essentially making what amounts to the same claim that it is the labor necessary to produce commodities that is the determinant of their value ONLY under conditions in which the whole produce of labor belongs to the laborer. Under these conditions Smith sees no contradiction because there is none; it is only after the fact that this separation comes to play a destructive role. We can easily see why Smith thought this to be the case - when a producer of a product exchanges this product, in which only his labor was used to produce, with an individual who has done the same, the labor which each of these commodities command on the market is equivalent to the labor embodied within them. There is X amount of labor embodied in the commodity, and the laborer, appropriating the whole product, thus exchanges it and receives X amount of materialized labor in return for it. Confusion sets in on Smith when he attempts to extend the labor commanded theory of value to instances in which labor is not the sole 'factor' ofproduction, but land and capital as well. He runs head on into what is seemingly a major problem - if labor does not appropriate the whole of its produce, but a portion is divided between either rent to a landlord or profit to a capitalist (manufacturer, in his words), then labor commanded is no longer equal to the price of the commodity it produces. The price of commodities on the market will in general be higher than the exchange value of labor. As Smith is well aware that he must have an explanation of value consistent with \\"the three great classes of society\\" for the functionality of his entire schemata, if only because the appropriation of the full product of labor by the laborer was \\"at end...long before the most considerable improvements were made in the productive powers of labour\\", he is now seemingly forced to discard the applicability of the labor necessary to produce commodities as an explanation of value to a society in which labor is not the sole \`factor of production' of commodities.Instead of further unraveling this contradiction, the task of which was left to Ricardo, and, more extensively Marx, Smith adopts what is now called a \`cost of production' theory of value - essentially, as Smith sees the necessity of the incorporation of \\"the accumulation of stock and the appropriation of land\\" into his conceptual apparatus, he simply makes the \\"natural value\\" to which all \\"market prices are constantly gravitating\\" equivalent to the \`returns' to land, labor, and capital based on the observation that it is into these \\"three parts\\" which \\"the price of every commodity finally resolves itself\\". Of course, \`value' is in this sense superfluous - simply identifying that rentiers, capitalists, and laborers all receive a portion of the value of commodities does not serve as an explanation of where the value of these commodities derives; but, then again, this is our problem, is it not? We can now see the starting point of superficial extensions - of profit simply being another form of wages for inspection and direction, risk or abstinence, which becomes plucked out of its proper context as being linked to the value of the stock employed. From whence does this value come - the sky? Thus, we are yet again gifted with another gem in the \`production possibility frontier' of neoclassical economics - in which there can be no mistaking the superficiality of \`switching between capital and labor'. Neither can the perspective required for the exposition of such insight be mistaken.It is in the evasion of one contradiction which Smith naturally becomes entangled in another, his recognition of this being doubtful. The contradiction materializes when Smith moves on to his analysis of the \`Wages of Labour', where he correctly maintains that returns to land and capital are derivative from labor and labor alone. Smith thus becomes his own greatest enemy, for he has now, quite explicitly, singlehandedly refuted both his own labor commanded theory of value and his cost of production theory of value. The only unifying force, and luckily for Smith what remains implicit throughout his whole analysis of the division of labor, is a labor embodied theory of value - that \`returns' to land and capital are not returns at all, but appropriation from the labor which they employ. Thus we have come to one major critique levied against Smith by Ricardo - the division of value between classes in no way refutes the principle that value is derived from labor.There are two rreasons why I believe that Smith did not realize his self contradictions: first, this contradiction was spelled out quite plainly, whereas the former was not. It thus makes little sense for Smith to have not made any attempt to remedy it as he did the former from which it came; second, and more importantly, the so called cost of production theory of value was, for all intents and purposes, consistent with his notion of tendential movements of price toward \`value', much in the same way as neoclassical equilibrium theory is functional solely by merit of the identification of a given supply. What it was not consistent with, which will be shown later, was his theory of the division of labor and the increases in productivity that it allowed as a function of decreasing value. It is from the combination of what Smith, in arguing with himself, found to be dead ends with his concept of the division of labor, on which the development of the former aspect of his inquiry relied, that is at the core my claims.---The Division of Labor---In sweeping away the Mercantilist doctrine, Smith put forth a new answer to the question of how to increase the wealth of nations; that it was be found in the realm of production, more specifically in finding a mechanism the influence of which caused improvements in the conditions of production. These improvements were the development of the productive forces which, by reducing the amount of labor required to produce them, caused a reduction in the value of commodities. Smith identified this mechanism as the division of labor.The division of labor, however, did not serve only to reduce the value of material output - it both fostered the growth and application of specialized knowledge to further innovate the production process. Innovations which were responsible for the introduction of new products and the increased efficiency of the production of existing products were the result of the division of labor. This is because a specialized producer would be more far more likely to posses, or have a much greater possibility of obtaining, the requisite knowledge to improve a product and themethod by which that product was produced than a person who was forced to spread his or her time across the production of many different products. The mechanism of the division of labor, in turn, was identified by Smith as being a function of the volume of exchange between individuals. He believed that when people regularly engaged in exchange relations they would become inclined to specialize in production - i.e. spontaneously form a division of labor. This is because with every increase in specialization there is in turn an increase in the volume of exchange due to a subsequent decrease in the self sufficiency of individuals. If an individual who formerly produced the whole of his or her necessary product specializes in the production of one of these products, he or she must then engage in exchange relations to obtain the rest. The growth in the volume of exchange then served to expand the division of labor, which itself served to expand the volume of exchange as it allowed for the individual the ability \\"to exchange all that surplus part of the produce of his own labor\\" and therefore \\"encourages every man to apply himself to a particular occupation\\".Thus, as exchange gave rise to the division of labor, and the volume of exchange was in turn directly influenced through the division of labor, the result was an increasing hold of the division of labor on society. The division of labor, then, functioned as a positive feedback mechanism. There was, however, a natural limit to the internal expansion of the division of labor. Smith identified this limit as the extent of the market, or the area in which exchange relations were able to occur. The essential notion behind this concept was that the extent of specialization between producers depended on the mass of producers available to specialize. Smith describes this phenomena with an identification of the further integration of the division of labor in areas that contain a large mass of people, such as \` great towns', as opposed to a small population, such as the countryside.IIAs Smith held that exchange was the driving force behind the expanse of the division of labor, and that this exchange was limited only by the extent of the market, he identified the elimination of spatial and temporal barriers - modern day \`transaction costs' - as the means by which exchange was able to be carried out in a widened area, and hence the means throughwhich the division of labor was able to more deeply integrate itself. This is because these eliminations served to open up further avenues of exchange between individuals and, flirting with their propensities to \\"truck, barter, and exchange\\", led to further expanse of the division of labor. Thus, Smith identified the emergence of commercial civilizations, or, as he says, the first \\"civilized\\" nations, in regions that had fewer barriers to exchange than others. As far as how this reduction of temporal and spatial barriers was accomplished, Smith was rather ambiguous. However, it seems fairly evident that he viewed the division of labor itself as the force that would accomplish this task in the long run. This is because Smith identified the division of labor as not only the instigator of increased material productivity but as the force through which innovation was fostered.But had a division of labor not already existed? And if so, why did the division of labor neither perpetuate itself as Smith had envisioned nor serve to harness the application of the creative potential of individuals to widen the market? Smith's answer to this was that the division of labor that existed, because it was not a system of free enterprise but a manifestation of Mercantilist doctrine, created an atmosphere of monopoly and special privilege that restricted or distorted the forces that signaled the spontaneous ordering of production. In a system of free enterprise, competition between individual producers would both incentivize the actual applications of innovations that the granting of special privileges and subsidies deinsentivized and would eliminate monopoly control because any sector with an above average profit rate would attract production that was formerly involved in a sector with a lower rate of profit, and therefore also ensuring the important movement of price toward value. The regulating force of competition was the main ingredient necessary to bring to life the positive feedback mechanism of the division of labor. Protection was preventing the functioning of the division of labor which, per contra to the conscience construction of Mercantilist policy, functioned by merit of a mechanism which was independent of the conscience design of man.It is in this context of Mercantilist protection policies that Smith's remarks on the interests of manufactures being at odds with that of society as a whole should be interpreted 12. For Smith, the secret of the wealth of nations was to be found in the positive feedback mechanism embedded in the link between the division of labor and the extent of the market: an increase in the division of labor lowers costs, raises real income, and extends the market, thus leading back to an increase in the division of labor and an increase in the extent of the market. Smith held that exchange between individual producers regulated by competition would cause the materialization and expansion of this virtuous cycle. It is in this sense that exchange is considered the driver of growth: it enlarges the pool in which the division of labor exists. The entirety of modern exchange based growth theory is thus derived from Adam Smith. Any argument put forth that identifies \`barriers' or \`limitations' on the ability to exchange being the immediate cause of poverty is thus derived from Adam Smith. Not only that, but Smith also implies that technological innovation is a factor endogenous to production based on a spontaneous division of labor. As technological progress is the long run mechanism through which temporal and spatial barriers are eliminated, not only does short run poverty due to the inability to exchange in this way derive from Smith, but the long run increase in the standard of living of the masses as well. The whole of contemporary mainstream economics has been an attempted formalization of the requirements needed for Smith's division of labor to function. This is the power that lies within the first twenty pages of the \`Wealth of Nations'.IIIBut it is precisely in this moment of glory where the disconnect occurs. For the role attributed to the division of labor is inexorably tied to the notion that labor is the \\"real measure of exchangeable value of all commodities\\". Redefining value as being determined in exchange contradicts the whole foundation of the Smith's division of labor: if the functioning of the division of labor is to reduce the value of commodities through paradigm shifts in how they are produced in the long run, in their conditions of production, then it is within the production process alone that an explanation of value must rest. Smith himself, in putting forth the labor commanded theory of value, maintained consistency with his theory of the division of labor to the extent that individual producers appropriated their own product. As this was incapable of being extended to capitalist production, Smith then switched to a cost of production theory of value in order to escape the trap he had laid for himself. However, as we have shown, this theory of value was not a theory of value at all and thus was incapable of explaining anything other than showing a hypothetical point at which value and price would be equal - it was therefore incompatible with the dynamic nature of the division of labor. It is from the latter which contemporary equilibrium analysis has its origins, and, quite naturally, why equilibrium analysis in neoclassical economics had also been doomed to a static existence: dynamics could only be incorporated as an element disturbing equilibrium, whereas within the whole of the operation of the division of labor equilibrium is only a fleeting moment of a vibration which is in ceaseless fluctuation. Smith, despite his fumbling, maintained conceptual unity because the whole of his division of labor was based around an environment wherein labor commanded was for all intents and purposes equivalent to labor embodied - or a world where the laborer appropriated the whole of his or her produce. His inclusion of the pin factory example, while highlighting the increase of productivity it allowed, served to hide the fact that this productivity was a function of a specific explanation of value. This dualistic nature, or perhaps the high degree of ambiguity, in which Smith conducted his analysis of the division of labor therefore turned out to be both his weakest and strongest point.This dualism carried on to his heirs, however it now took different form. In adopting the marginalist approach to value, it manifested itself in an attempt to explain the functioning of an economic system according to individual self interest as a function of profit on the basis, or perspective, of individuals who have left the production process, or left the process in which material objects are produced as a prerequisite for profit. Exchange, without production, yields no profit; no growth. I may trade you nine apples for one of your apples, a deal in which you have convinced me beyond doubt is best for both of us, and in the end we still have between us ten apples. This attempted escape, however, was not an escape at all but instead served to shift the search of error and inconsistency to the confines of marginalism, and, as we have shown that it was a purely exchange driven explanation of value, financial speculative excess naturally became the issue. For where there is no production process, or when value is explained in the ct the value of which is rooted in exchange becomes more a function of the degree to which people are holding it - hoarding it - as concerns scarcity than the aggregation of marginal propensities. The recent popularity of 'behavioral' economics corresponds to this identification."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations","review":"ALWAYS GO TO THE SOURCE!!!

It is very clear from the context in both books that Smith is referring to the enlightened self interest of moral decision makers who have had specific religious instruction,as well as a general education.Smith spends nearly 50 pages(Smith,pp.716-766) advocating the necessity of such instruction,if necessary funded by the public .Both of Smith's books must be read together in order to understand his overall philosophy.The Libertarian approach,which considers only a small portion of Smith's second book, is a caricature of Smith .Smith advocated a progressive system of taxation.Smith advocated usury laws(interest rate controls).The First Bank of the United States,set up by Alexander Hamilton,was modeled after the central bank control concepts of Adam Smith,as opposed to the free banking advocated by libertarians.Most importantly,Smith's theory of comparative advantage opposed any offshoring of either employment and/or industrial/financial capital if the purpose of such offshoring was to supply the home market.Such foreign investment can only be made to supply the foreign market.Smith was one of the first opponents of globalization,since globalization directly conflicted with the theory of comparative advantage.Globalization advocates base their arguments on absolute advantage.Finally,Smith fully supported the use of counter tariffs if there was any probability that such a counter tariff would succeed in getting the offending nation to remove its initial tariff.Only if there was no probability of success would Smith forgo retaliation.A reader of both of Smith's books will discover quickly that he would have no sympathy for the atheistic materialism of any variety of anarchistic libertarianism.

Selective reasoning or not, Reich does offer a nice summary line: \\"In these times, as when Adam Smith wrote, it is important to remind ourselves of the revolutionary notion at the heart of Smith's opus-that the wealth of a nation is measured not by its accumulated riches, but by the productivity and living standards of all its people.\\" Nicely said and I agree.

That's why I'm giving this book 1 star: not for the text itself, but rather for the paucity of well-done printings out there.Anyhow. I have three before me:1. The \\"Modern Library Classics\\" edition, the one you see on this page. This is complete and unabridged in a single volume, and has a handsome, sturdy feel to it. There is a 4-page introduction and a well-done index, but what irks about this edition is that while it has a plethora of footnotes, all the footnotes are of the \\"textual comparison\\" variety (e.g., \\"12 Car.

As is often the case with second hand accounts, textbooks have distorted and watered down Adam Smith. Going back to the original text is both refreshing and enlightening.The \\"Wealth of Nations\\" remains the most truthful defense of the economic science. But remember that Adam Smith also wrote \\"The Theory of Moral Sentiments\\"; for Smith, economics was a search to better people's life rather than simply a quest to optimize mathematical functions or estimate variables using econometric models.To simply associate Smith with expressions such as the \\"invisible hand,\\" does not do him justice. Take, for example, the opening chapter on the division of labor: first, Smith defends the division of labor as being efficient; then, he defends it as an essential component of the freedom to allocate one's labor to one's talents; finally, he links the division of labor to trade: without the freedom to exchange the fruits of one's labor, the division of labor is meaningless. The point is that Adam Smith defends the rationale for the market, rather than just explain its mechanics.Anyone studying economics in school would think that economics is all about efficiency; this preoccupation, inevitably, breeds economists who support the market simply because it works. But to read Adam Smith is to enter the realm of an economic science where the ultimate benchmark is not efficiency but human freedom and welfare. That is, probably, what Smith would remark if he were to sit in an economics class today, and why the \\"Wealth of Nations\\" is as revolutionary today as it was two centuries ago."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations","review":"Another reviewer is correct in that there are SIGNIFICANT PORTIONS of the book missing in the Great Minds Series (green and black cover). In one instance, I noted that 150 pages were converted into 14! Also, Book IV Chapter VII is missing parts 2 and 3 (also quite lengthy portions of the piece). Go with a complete version if you're going to bother to tackle this book, or especially if you are focussing on one particular idea (since that may be one that they cut out!)...Smith may be wordy, but to cut out such an enormous amount degrades the integrity of the work. Shameful to nowhere state that LARGE chunks of this classic are absent...at least be forthcoming!If you choose a more complete version you'll get to read a classic from a better economist than a writer, but still a fantastic piece of work. Smith does tend to try to overexplain things, but you get use to his style and can appreciate that he just wants to make sure that you get his point.AMMENDMENT:Upon discussion with my Economics professor, it is possible that this green book was one of the author's first versions (which he apparently edited and added to more than once). I still say that the publisher should be more clear about the version, and that if you want his most recent updates and complete work, to look elsewhere."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations","review":"The Wealth of Nations handles a lot of economical phenomena in a concrete but sometimes complex way. On one hand the book is filled with ideas, some convincing, some out-dated, some fundamental to the current believe in free-markets. These ideas are combined with appealing (or appalling) examples of the injustice done to people by disturbing the free-market. On the other hand however, I find that certain sections of the book require a lot of concentration. The book is an interesting, but slow and at times difficult, read.Essentially, it is a treatise on the power of individuals to maximise their own wealth and therefor a support for the natural liberty of men and an argument for free-markets. Not as a perfect system in which there will be no misery, but as a system that gives individuals the greatest (and most just) opportunity to gain happiness and which will be the quickest to respond to changes in supply and demand (and therefor decrease the misery which is created when governments ignore gaps between supply and demand).It is not a book that believes in the pure goodness of companies (but explicitly states that companies have a interest which is directly opposite to that of society as a whole. I.e. the interest of companies is to create a supply shortage so they can ask prices above costprice), but says that the best way to break the power of these companies is the allow free competition. It also reveals that political decisions that at fist glance seems compassionate, might in fact be inhumane, cruel and the cause of much suffering (because on the long run they lead to a supply shortage). The examples given here, are still relevant to view the decisions made by politicians in today's so-called free market countries.Comment on review of Micheal Brady, june 13 2005:Brady remarks that Smith was the first opponent of globalization. The (strange) evidence he gives to support this statement is that Smith supports the use of counter tariffs, if (and only if) this might lead to the removal of the initial tariff. This statement clearly shows that Smith was against protectionist measures like tariffs and only condoned them if in the short run they would lead to less protectionism and therefor more globalization! Brady also supports his statement by mentioning that Smith opposed any offshoring if the purpose of such offshoring was to supply the home market. The keyword here again being \\"if\\". Smith was against a nation stimulating offshoring because he saw no national gain. This however doesn't mean that governments should restrict labor/capital mobility, because this would go against the natural liberty of men."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations","review":"Adam Smith's \\"The Wealth of Nations\\" is one those great Classics that almost everyone should read. But if you intend buying a copy, be very careful which version you buy. Why, you ask?It's out in the public domain and a plethora of reprints are available, a great many from Print on Demand Publishers and there are some truely awful reprints available. Amazon associates reviews of a book with many different versions of the same book from different publishers. Unfortunately for us customers, Amazon is seeing a growing plague of low-quality Print-On-Demand Publishers who are specialise in reprinting copyright-expired books. Such as \\"The Wealth of Nations.\\" Some of these publishers produce quite good quality books, some do not. What you do need to do is check the publisher carefully for all these older \\"copyright expired\\" books.An outstanding example of \\"not good quality\\" is the version of \\"The Wealth of Nations\\" published by General Books LLC. This version is scanned in using OCR technology (and using pretty poor quality OCR scanning equipment and software from the look of their books), is overall of very poor print quality, uses automated reproduction with no index, no illustrations and an excessive number of typos.Lest you doubt, here's some word for word quotes from the publisher's own web site:\\"We created your book using OCR software that includes an automated spell check. Our OCR software is 99 percent accurate if the book is in good condition. However, with up to 3,500 characters per page, even one percent can be an annoying number of typos....\\"\\"After we re-typeset and designed your book, the page numbers change so the old index and table of contents no longer work. Therefore, we usually remove them. Since many of our books only sell a couple of copies, manually creating a new index and table of contents could add more than a hundred dollars to the cover price....\\"\\"Our OCR software can't distinguish between an illustration and a smudge or library stamp so it ignores everything except type. We would really like to manually scan and add the illustrations. But many of our books only sell a couple of copies....\\"\\"We created your book using a robot who turned and photographed each page. Our robot is 99 percent accurate. But sometimes two pages stick together. And sometimes a page may even be missing from our copy of the book. We would really like to manually scan each page and buy multiple copies of each original. But many of our books only sell a couple of copies.....\\"For the buyer that's not aware of this publisher this can result in a rather unfortunate purchasing decision as General Books LLC are all poor quality, tiny (almost unreadable) fonts and they don't bother to reproduce little things like Table of Contents or Indexes.A good rule of thumb for these Print on Demand publishers is to take a look at the cover - if it's a good quality illustration that reflects the content, there's a table of contents, and when you do the Look Inside thing there's no disclaimer saying you're looking at another version of the book, and they've stated that they used facsimile reproduction technology (rather than OCR), it's usually a pretty safe bet. Conversely, if any of these are missing, you're taking a chance on the quality. I've bought a few based on my selection criteria above and they've been good quality. General Books LLC however, is a publisher to steer clear of at all costs.If you have been unfortunate enough to buy the General Books LLC version by mistake, you can return to Amazon for a full refund (but check Amazon's return policy and process first)."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations","review":"Indeed this is true, [200 year old economics books are still relevant], but we miss half the value of the Wealth of Nations, if we do not also struggle through the turgid prose of the book he wrote 10 years before, The Theory of Moral Sentiments -- both of which of course are available for the Kindle for $.89 each.

Cannan treats us to a lengthy (63 page) introduction which includes a feisty justification of why this edition is put together precisely the way it is, including an authoritative history of those first five editions, with comparisons and contrasts. Once the book itself starts, Canaan's input is non-invasive; I felt that he was sitting silently and attentively in the wings, like a stage director overseeing a play.* The original wording is preserved, augmented by explanatory conventional bottom-of-the-page footnotes. Cannan's edits (mostly to correct typos and make clarifications) are most welcome, and even the typographical errors are preserved verbatim in footnotes. An example of a clarification: the author's mention of a \\"fire-engine\\" had me thinking of a horse-drawn vehicle for putting out fires. Cannan's footnote: \\"I.e., steam engine.\\"* The English usage of two centuries ago is a novelty, and much easier to follow than I had expected.* The author's original footnotes are exactly where he placed them: in little insets around the page.As for the content itself, the prevalence of Smith's ideas in modern treatises such asBasic Economicsis startling! (I recommendBasic Economicsas a first book on Economics, by the way.) I got MANY insights into the beginnings of America and what was going on in the world at the time this was published. I now understand why towns formed along sea coasts and waterways: it was much more efficient to transport goods via water than by land. Forget Economics for a second: any general historian would be remiss without reading this."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations","review":"Alfred North Whitehead famously stated that all of Western philosophy was merely a footnote to Plato. It seems to me one could say the same thing about economics in regard to Adam Smith. There were certainly economists before Adam Smith (just as there were philosophers before Plato); and there are some, I am sure, who will claim that some of the economists writing before Adam Smith were actually superior to Adam Smith in some ways (just as there are philosophers who prefer the pre-Socratics to Plato).But Adam Smith, like Plato, was able in his work to define a relevant set of problems which to a large degree are the same problems that are still being dealt with, and debated, within economics today; and, like Plato, the work of Adam Smith has been the source for various strands, or schools of economic thought, each of which finds its ground in a different aspect of Adam Smith's work. Adam Smith's analysis of the division of labor (the productive forces of society), his adherence to a labor theory of value (at least in part) and his distinction between productive and unproductive labor have been sources for the tradition of economic thought following Ricardo and Marx; while Adam Smith's analysis of the benefits of laissez-faire economic policies, his analysis of exchange, and determination of price through supply and demand, have been sources for the Neo-classical, marginalist, and free-market strands of economic thought.Adam Smith sees the wealth of a nation as consisting in its annual produce (what we today would call GDP). This is the central idea behind the whole book and is Adam Smith's major innovation in regard to previous economic thought (as I understand it). Adam Smith will evaluate the harm or the benefit of various economic policies by attempting to determine the over-all effect each policy will have on the annual produce of society as a whole. If a policy increases this annual produce then it is beneficial to society as a whole. If a policy decreases this annual produce then it is harmful to society as a whole. This is still, to a large degree, the measure we use when evaluating the effects of a given economic policy, though we are perhaps beginning to see that the benefit or harm of a given policy cannot be reduced to its effect on annual produce or GDP (environmental effects, for instance, effect society as a whole and have to be measured against effects on GDP in determining the costs and benefits of any economic policy).With few exceptions Adam Smith believes that laissez-faire policies are the best policies for increasing the over-all wealth of a nation and he bases his argument on his notion of the \`invisible hand'. This is another one of Smith's important theoretical innovations; the notion that each individual, by pursuing their own interest, without any thought or conscious plan for society as a whole, does not lead to chaos but tends, as if guided by an invisible hand, towards a maximization of the yearly annual produce of a nation. It is not necessary for society to \`plan' for this outcome in a conscious way; in fact, no amount of conscious planning could improve on the outcome produced by simply allowing individuals to pursue their own interests unfettered by government. This has been one of the most influential ideas ever put forward by anyone since the beginning of human history, whether for good or ill.So there are a number of reasons why anyone who is interested in economics should study The Wealth of Nations. First, Adam Smith defines a common set of problems which to a large degree are problems that economists are still trying to solve to this day (in the same way that Plato determined a common set of problems that still occupy philosophers to this day). Second, some of Adam Smith's ideas have been extremely influential on all subsequent debate and are still used in policy debates to this day. People still use the notion of the invisible hand to argue for the benefits of free-trade for instance. It is important, therefore, to understand how the invisible hand is supposed to work and what the benefits of allowing it to work are supposed to be. And third, Adam Smith is one of the most accessible and readable economists who ever wrote. You do not have to be a trained economist (I am not) to benefit from reading this work.So I fully recommend this work to anyone interested in economics or social and political philosophy."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations","review":"\\"The Wealth of Nations\\" is a big book of economics, history, philosophy, and social criticism. It is much more than Adam Smith neckties at GOP conventions. It is much more than a reverential nod or two in modern econ textbooks. Econ students need to read it to see where their discipline came from and what it could be again.Dickey's abridgment reproduces enough of the text (about 25 percent) to convey the depth of Smith's erudition and the diversity of his interests. Unfortunately, the editorial apparatus is weak. The Comments are few in number and incredibly brief, and the short Preface fails to put the book into historical and intellectual context. Dickey does offer four appendices but these deal with specialized topics rather than the big picture.Bottom line: this edition is inexpensive but is probably not the best one for students."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations","review":"The Scottish Adam Smith is certainly the most important economists of all times and is the founder of modern economic thought, being &quot;The Wealth of the Nations&quot; his major work, where he introduces to the general public of his time - the book was first published in 1776 - new concepts and ideas as &quot;competitive advantage&quot;, &quot;divison of labour&quot;, &quot;the power of the invisible hand&quot;, and many others still powerfull today, even accounting for the changes happened in the world economy and politics. From this starting point, a crucial juncture in the world economy, that is, the beginning of the industrialisation in England, many renowed economists and social scientists construed their theories. To name a few? Karl Marx, David Ricardo, John Stuart Mill and many others acknowledge the importance of Adam Smith's work to their theories.

Enjoy it."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations","review":"This book is so widely cited and interpreted contrary to the author's original thought, that every economist should read it completely to avoid being misled by such incorrect interpretations.First, let us take the \\"invisible hand\\" metaphor. When I have studied economy in the University, I was taught that almost the entire book is devoted to the \\"invisible hand\\" which means \\"self-corrective markets\\", \\"liberalism\\", \\"Laissez-faire\\" and \\"state non-intervention\\". After reading this book, I have found out that Adam Smith did use the term \\"invisible hand\\" only once in the entire book, in the discussion of domestic versus foreign trade.To illustrate the point, let me quote the text where term \\"invisible hand\\" is used: \\"First, every individual endeavours to employ his capital as near home as he can, and consequently as much as he can in the support of domestic industry, provided always that he can thereby obtain the ordinary, or not a great deal less than the ordinary profits of stock. Thus, upon equal, or nearly equal profits, every wholesale merchant naturally prefers the home trade to the foreign trade of consumption, and the foreign trade of consumption to the carrying trade. In the home trade, his capital is never so long out of his sight as it frequently is in the foreign trade of consumption. [...]Secondly, every individual who employs his capital in the support of domestic industry, necessarily endeavours so to direct that industry, that its produce may be of the greatest possible value. [...]As every individual, therefore, endeavours as much as he can, both to employ his capital in the support of domestic industry, and so to direct that industry that its produce maybe of the greatest value; every individual necessarily labours to render the annual revenue of the society as great as he can. He generally, indeed, neither intends to promote the public interest, nor knows how much he is promoting it. By preferring the support of domestic to that of foreign industry, he intends only his own security; and by directing that industry in such a manner as its produce may be of the greatest value, he intends only his own gain; and he is in this, as in many other cases, led by an invisible hand to promote an end which was no part of his intention. Nor is it always the worse for the society that it was no part of it.\\"After reading this book, I have found out that Adam Smith was influenced by French Physiocrats. The Physiocrats saw the true wealth of a nation as determined by the surplus of agricultural production over and above that needed to support agriculture (by feeding farm labourers and so forth). Other forms of economic activity, such as manufacturing, were viewed as taking this surplus agricultural production and transforming it into new products, by using the surplus agricultural production to feed the workers who produced the extra goods. While these manufacturers and other non agricultural workers may be useful, they were seen as 'sterile' in that their income derives ultimately not from their own work, but from the surplus production of the agricultural sector.I have found out that this book is not about \\"invisible hand\\" or \\"Laissez-faire\\". It is quite a complete study that covers almost every basic aspect of the economy, and remains an effective introduction to economics to this day.This book is so often mischaracterized and politicized that I suggest you to read it completely by yourself. This is a must read for every economist. You can get an audio version of this book to avoid lengthy read."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations","review":"Hello,I made the mistake of buying a differnt kindle version of this book.

Thank You.Joe"},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations","review":"The Wealth of Nations is one of the most important books ever written. In some respects the Wealth of Nations was a tract for the times. Smith penned a crippling critique of the mercantilist \`Policy of Europe'. Smith, along with David Hume and David Ricardo, refuted the mercantilist case for protectionism. Much of what we read in this book is still taught in modern economics classes. Modern day protectionists still have no answer to the principles of absolute and comparative advantage, and for the basic logic of Hume's specie flow mechanism.Smith was more than an ordinary economist. He was a visionary who saw some of the potential for progress through Globalization. Perhaps the most important concept of this book is the dynamics between division of labor, labor productivity, and the extent of markets. Smith conceived of Globalization as a process that would raise productivity as local markets expanded to national and then international scope. His example of division of labor in a pin factory is simple, but illustrative.The most widely known part of this book is that part of the \`invisible hand of markets'. Invisible hand reasoning still pervades modern economic theory, though there are some variations in how economists interpret this concept. Smith does differ from Modern economists on certain issues. Smith thought of competition as a process and of monopoly as a government grant of privilege. In these areas Smith was ahead of many modern economists. Smith also explained market prices in terms of labor content. Here is Smith's great error. Labor value theory set economics on the wrong course. Labor value theory served as the basis for Marxism. This, of course, indicates the great influence of The Wealth of Nations on world history. Without labor value theory the Marxist idea of exploitation falls apart. Smith therefore played a posthumous role in twentieth century history, especially from 1918 to 1991. Of course, we cannot blame Smith for the misuse of his ideas. Smith would have surely opposed Marxism, had he been alive to do so.What we have in this book is a tremendous effort at discovering the proper limits between private and public institutions. Better still, Smith thought about society and institutions in evolutionary terms. This is another reason why the Wealth of Nations is preferable to modern economics texts. Smith understood the dynamics of capitalism better than many modern economists- who focus on static math models. Smith also influenced Charles Darwin with his ideas of social evolution. There is much evidence indicating that Darwin got the idea for the evolution of species by reading The Wealth of Nations. Smith therefore had great influence on the biological sciences.Modern economists reject Smith labor value theory (ever since Menger refuted it in 1870). However, there is no denying the influence of The Wealth of Nations. All members of the educated public should read at least part of this book. The question then in which edition should you buy? The Liberty Classics edition is unabridged. The Modern Library Classics edition has margin notes that could be helpful. Given the affordability of these editions, you might consider have both on your bookshelf (I do). I would avoid the Great Mind Series altogether. The Wealth of Nations should be read because it is both a book of great historical importance and a good source for understanding modern Globalization. The labor value theory part precludes a five star rating, but anything less than four stars would be absurd."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations","review":"I have read WoN in three different editions and undoubtedly the best was the definitive version in the Glasgow edition of his Collected Works.

I read the free Kindle version of \\"The Wealth Of Nations\\", and while I do not recommend that version I do recommend the overall work.The issues with the Kindle version are that it is poorly formatted, and it is painful to attempt to read the numbers in the tables at the of Book I. You are much better off getting a hard copy so that you can more easily flip to the section of interest, and to read the information in a better format. As for the rest, the content is all there, once you get past the poor formatting.The work contains five books within. The first is \\"Of the Causes of Improvement in the productive Powers of Labour\\". In this book he discusses the benefits of the division of labor, the origin and benefits of using money, a section on the \\"real\\" price of commodities (i.e. how much toil it takes to produce them), a discussion of the natural and market prices of commodities (the forces of supply and demand), the effect of controlling a commodity can have on the price, the wages of labor (again a case of supply and demand with the commodity of labor), the profits of stock, a discussion of the ill effects of groups who use their influence to manipulate the government (this would include banking conglomerations, trade unions, etc.), and closes with a section on rent.The second book is \\"Of the Nature, Accumulation, and Employment of Stock\\" which deals with accumulating wealth which lasts a longer period of time. This book starts with how one divides their stock into what they need for personal use, and what they can dispose of in exchange for others available stock. He then moves into a discussion of money as a type of stock, and then how to use their excess money/stock to gain interest.The third book is \\"Of the different Progress of Opulence in different Nations\\", where he talks about the balance between the inhabitants of towns and those of the country areas and goes into how agriculture is discouraged over time, while cities and towns prosper.The fourth book is \\"Of Systems of political Economy\\" in which Smith discusses the commercial system, along with importation which contains a detailed look at the effects of restraints on importation/exportation. Smith also discusses commerce treaties, and the role of colonies. This book also has a brief section on the agricultural system, but here he is referring to a specific system where the produce of land is the sole source of the revenue of a nationThe fifth book is \\"Of the Revenue of the Sovereign or Commonwealth\\" in which Smith deals with taxation. This is an important area to read and understand, as it is the one which many ignore when using Smith to try to support other areas. There are hints here of the progressive tax, as well as a discussion of the expenses of the nation, an important acknowledgement that the poor spend the greater part of their income on the fundamentals, such as food, and so he suggests luxury taxes as not unreasonable. Smith then closes the final book with a discussion of the costs of war, both for the actual fighting, and in terms of the loss of trade."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations","review":"This version is just too small for such a great book.

That tradition later found expression in Adam Smith's \\"Wealth of Nations\\" in which is posited a \\"rational self-interest\\" operating as an \\"invisible hand\\" upon \\"free markets\\". Recent accounting crimes and corporate scandals, however, amount to enormous empirical evidence that \\"laissez faire\\" capitalism is a myth and the \\"invisible hand\\" is mere \\"wishful thinking\\".It is obvious that there is no \\"invisible hand\\" which militates against crooks, charlatans, and fast buck artists now seen to have firmly ensconced themselves as much in the board rooms as among sleazy fly-by-nighters.Markets left to their own devices trend toward oligopoly in which oligarchs effect political plutocracy through the exercise of sheer political muscle, intimidation, fraud, and outright bribery.If there is an \\"invisible hand\\", it has never moderated the rich and powerful. If a ruling cabal is to be moderated it must be done by political action.This is less a criticism of Smith himself than of modern economic conservatives and/or 'supply-siders' who find in Smith --ex post facto --a rationalization for rapacious and monopolistic behavior. Smith is no more to be faulted for this than Darwin should be faulted for the excesses of \\"Social Darwinism\\" --neither Social nor Darwin. \\"Social Darwinists\\" are most often associated with the age of the Robber Barons, providing them an ideological bias that justifies all manner of corporate crookedness and sleazy practices.To his credit, Smith himself feared the rise of monopoly power --a fear which modern conservative commentary either does not understand or omits entirely.The picture is complicated, however by Immanuel Kant who assailed the pursuit of self interest in favor of \\"good in and of itself\\" --a \\"categorical imperative\\". It is a moral standard that no one, of course, can live up to. Nevertheless, Kant became the other great influence upon American conservative thought --though I cannot give most contemporary conservatives credit for having actually read Kant or, for that matter, understanding him.Yet --Kant may be found lurking beneath the ideological surface of the extreme right-wing and the religious right which seeks to impose upon us a \\"transcendental\\" reality and morality whether we like it or not.It is unfortunate that Kant himself defined this \\"transcendent reality\\" --which he calls the noumena --as being unknowable. If follows, by definition, that one cannot make meaningful statements about it, but that has not kept righteous ideologues from deducing from this \\"unknowable\\" value judgments and imposing those values judgments on others. By definition, nothing meaningful can be said about whatever is \\"unknowable\\"!We are given a choice of two mutually exclusive alternatives: \\"selfishness\\" or \\"selfless transcendentalism\\". Neither position, however, is entirely true and neither is completely understood even by the conservative mentality that espouses them. Adam Smith's \\"invisible hand\\" is no more valid than Laffer's \\"trickle down\\" theory and it is highly doubtful that even Kant lived up to his own moral dictum --though I credit Kant with sincerity but doubt it among his followers. I rather think that \\"mankind\\" is neither entirely selfish or entirely selfless.The truth is most likely found in the middle. The work of mathematician John Nash, celebrated of late in the motion picture \\"A Beautiful Mind\\", wrote a brilliant paper on \\"binding agreements\\" that casts grave doubts upon many \\"conservative\\" fables, shibboleths, and fairy tales --including those whose origins lie in \\"mutually exclusive\\" intellectual traditions.

This is highly contrary to how this book is interpreted, yet, if understood, explains many of Wealth of Nation's failings.The second major failing of this book is that through its clever wording and euphemisms it completely changed the language of economics. No longer would the British come out in direct language of their intentions in the House of Lords of the hostility and economic warfare that they were perpetually waging (and continue to wage to this day, albeit in a much different form) in open, brutal and naked language; they would do it through euphemistic and sophistical language. When we observe other methods of modern economic imperialism, the IMF for example, we see that the tools of the language that Smith pioneered have been perfected to a science - just Google the latest IMF policy papers or interviews to see what I'm talking about.To illustrate this fact in summation, rather than in a case-by-case, chapter-by-chapter disassembly that nobody would read nor would fit in this format, I'll turn to Friedrich List who illustrated these problems of Smith's \\"Wealth of Nations\\" brilliantly in his 1841 book \\"The National System of Political Economy\\". For the sake of brevity, I'll only include List shining a light to the later of these two problems, that is, the total obfuscation of the language of economics post-Wealth of Nations.\\"...The ministers of George I in 1721 openly declared, on the occasion of the prohibition of the importation of the manufactures of India, that it was clear that a nation could only become wealthy and powerful if she imported raw materials and exported manufactured goods. Even in the times of Lords Chatham and North, they did not hesitate to declare in open Parliament that it ought not to be permitted that even a single horse-shoe nail should be manufactured in North America. In Adam's Smith's time, a new maxim was for the first time added to those which we have above stated, namely, to conceal the true policy of England under the cosmopolitical expressions and arguments which Adam Smith had discovered, in order to induce foreign nations to imitate that policy.It is very common clever device that when anyone has attained the summit of greatness, he kicks away the ladder by which he has climbed up, in order to deprive others of the means of climbing up after him. In this lies the secret of the cosmopolitical doctrine of Adam Smith, and of the cosmopolitical doctrine of Adam Smith, and of the cosmopolitical tendencies of his great contemporary William Pitt, and of all his successors in the British Government administrations.Any nation which by means of protective duties and restrictions on navigation has raised her manufacturing power and her navigation to such a degree of development that no other nation can sustain free competition with her, can do nothing wiser that throw away these ladders of her greatness, to preach to other nations the benefits of free trade, and to declare in penitent tones that she has hitherto wandered in the paths of error, and has now for the first time succeeded in discovering the truth.William Pitt was the first English statesmen who clearly perceived in what way the cosmopolitcal theory of Adam Smith could be properly made use of, and not in vain did he himself carry about a copy of the work on the Wealth of Nations. His speech in 1786, which was addressed neither to Parliament nor to the nation, but clearly to the ears of the statesmen of France, who were destitute of all experience and favour of the Eden Treaty, is an excellent specimen of Smith's style of reasoning. By nature he said France was adapted for agriculture and the production of wine, as England was thus adapted to manufacturing production. These nations ought to act towards one another just as two great merchants would do who carry on different branches of trade and who reciprocally enrich one another by the exchange of goods. Not a word here of the old maxim of England, that a nation can only attain to the highest degree of wealth and power in her foreign trade by the exchange of manufactured products against agricultural products and raw materials. This maxim was then, and has remained since, and English State secret; it was never again openly professed, but was all the more persistently followed.\\"-Friedrich List, 1841 Political EconomyWe can all agree that certain areas are more suitable to certain types of farming, but what does it mean that \\"England was thus adapted to manufacturing production\\"? As if, while grapes to make wine sprung from the earth in France, fully formed factories were springing from the earth in England and that each nation should therefore simply take what was provided to them. This sheer nonsense was later refined and perfected by such degenerates as J.B. Say and, of course, David Ricardo.As a book that professes to explain macro-economics \\"Wealth of Nations\\" is a catastrophic failure. And this explains a lot of why the modern schools of economics that build their edifice upon this \\"foundation\\" are so worthless at creating prosperity, progress, predicting anything of any merit, etc. This book originated, insofar as I am aware, the idea of looking at The Market and The State as a dichotomy rather than as using an observational and scientific approach, which concludes that looking at Macro-economics with anything other than the role of modern Nation-State at its primary focus is pure folly. Friedrich List defines Smith's work brilliantly when identifies \\"Wealth of Nations\\" as the \\"economics of a shop-keeper\\" - that is, a focus on the exchange of value rather than the creation of value. What a different world we would live in if List was widely read and understood; for List's work is infinitely more adept at explaining how productive forces come into being and how macro-economies function than Smith. Adam Smith's work, the State is giving the far back-seat in favor of The Market that Smith mythologized and the legendary Individual (Man, as such) that Smith makes so popular. There are many books that dispel this nonsensical view from simply observing the historical record, read \\"Debt\\" by David Graeber or Friedrich List's \\"Political Economy\\" (I recommend both, but the latter book much more so). If you accept the major tenants of this book as they have been popularized then you will be yet another anti-historical fool, but don't worry, you'll have plenty of company.However, for many things, Smith's micro-approach is very good and yields usable information and therefore shouldn't be completely disregarded. But drawing the line of what is useful and what is fantasy in this book is no easy task for those that don't read an incredible amount of economics books or who's minds haven't already been turned to mush from an \\"education\\" (indoctrination) in modern economics. It is this very reason that I, reluctantly in spite of this books merits, give it 1 star.If you are going to read this book then you should read the other side of the argument and give it fair consideration. The \\"other side\\" (that is, the objective, factually based one that is derived from historical observation) from what Smith professes can be found with the following authors: Daniel Raymond, John Barnard Byle, Willard Phillips, Friedrich List, Webster G. Tarpley, Ha-Joon Chang, Steve Keen, Michael Hudson, Herman Finer, Heikki Patomaki, John Quiggin, Les Leopold, and of course Alexander Hamilton."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations","review":"I ordered this book for my son.

Adam Smith did not found economics, and The Wealth of Nations is not a must-read. It is not the first or best case for economic liberalism, or even the best case of its time.While Adam Smith's work was a much-needed rebuke to mercantilism, it was in many ways a step back from what had already been written on economics by the School of Salamanca in the 16th Century,Richard Cantillonin 1730, andAnne Robert Jacques Turgotin 1766. It was even a step back from his own previous work, including theLectures on JurisprudenceandThe Theory of Moral Sentiments. Smith's analysis contains many serious errors that would lay the foundation for Marxism, notably his crude labour theory of value (as opposed to marginal utility), his exaggeration of the importance of the division of labour (putting in the shade such critical factors as capital accumulation and the growth of technological knowledge), his identification of some innate \\"propensity to truck, barter and exchange\\" as the cause of the division of labour (rather than differences in ability), and his adoption of the dubious Physiocratic concept of \\"unproductive labour.\\"An economist won't benefit from reading Adam Smith any more than a physicist would benefit from reading Aristotle.

Although the announcements as to the current book, volume, and section on LibriVox are tiresome, you know where you are. Tantor's edition contains absolutely no index or printed table of contents for a 29 CD set. The current location is neither announced at the beginning of each CD, nor printed anywhere on the CD. So if you were reading the book and want to listen to the rest on audiobook, you have to listen to the whole thing from the beginning. :(The reader has a nice accent though. He delivers Smith's sarcasm and indignation very well. Contrary to popular belief, Adam Smith was a bit of a radical. He adamantly reiterates that of the workers, the landowners, and the merchants (read business people), the latter are the only group who should not lead a nation because their priorites will always lead it into ruin. Based upon his theory, which is still valid, the only reason the United States' economic system has not tanked is the petrodollar.As the book progresses his radicalism becomes increasingly apparent as he expresses his low opinion of the efforts to block free trade and posh schools like Oxford University, as well as his list of alternatives of what should be done with the new American colonies. He even declares that the missionary campaigns by the Catholic church during colonialism were only a pretense to get more gold--and this was in 1776!There are also miscellaneous digressions on the history of liberal education, banking, currencies, and organized western religion.

Reading the observations of someone who was a contemporary of America's founding fathers, but not one of them, gave me a new perspective on the 1700s. Passing references to the vast, but stagnant wealth of China, as well as to colonial enterprises from South America to Asia, add historical flavor to what could have been a dry summary of economic theory, but is instead a rich and colorful exposition of the world as it was.Having just spent some time in Manila earlier this year visiting historical sites and museums, I was intrigued to read about Spain's \\"Acapulco ships\\" that carried silver and other commodities from Mexico across the vast Pacific to the Philippines. Indeed, over and over I found myself putting my finger between the pages so I could daydream for a few minutes, imagining Spanish galleons loaded with treasure, or European merchants bartering and haggling. I suppose a vivid imagination helps to make any book more interesting, but this book in particular lends itself to such flights of fancy.The English of the mid- to late 1700s is not exactly the same as ours today, but it's close enough that few people will have any difficulty with the book. There are a lot of references to weights and measures of gold, silver, corn and other commodities, and their relative value to one another. Frankly, after the first few such references, I simply began skipping over them. Readers who enjoy playing with numbers in their heads may prefer to read those items carefully and playfully -- but I suspect most folks will skip across them as quickly as possible just as I did. It's not the specific values and figures that make this book so important (or enjoyable), but it's ideas about how capital flows, accumulates, is put to productive use and so on.Read this book and gain a new appreciation for the wisdom of the past, and you may also find yourself noting how ideas apply so directly to issues in today's headlines.

He viewed inflation as \\"extremely pernicious\\". The book contains ideas that Americans should possibly revisit in the near future."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations","review":"This book is so widely cited and interpreted contrary to the author's original thought, that every economist should read it completely to avoid being misled by such incorrect interpretations.First, let us take the \\"invisible hand\\" metaphor. When I have studied economy in the University, I was taught that almost the entire book is devoted to the \\"invisible hand\\" which means \\"self-corrective markets\\", \\"liberalism\\", \\"Laissez-faire\\" and \\"state non-intervention\\". After reading this book, I have found out that Adam Smith did use the term \\"invisible hand\\" only once in the entire book, in the discussion of domestic versus foreign trade.To illustrate the point, let me quote the text where term \\"invisible hand\\" is used: \\"First, every individual endeavours to employ his capital as near home as he can, and consequently as much as he can in the support of domestic industry, provided always that he can thereby obtain the ordinary, or not a great deal less than the ordinary profits of stock. Thus, upon equal, or nearly equal profits, every wholesale merchant naturally prefers the home trade to the foreign trade of consumption, and the foreign trade of consumption to the carrying trade. In the home trade, his capital is never so long out of his sight as it frequently is in the foreign trade of consumption. [...]Secondly, every individual who employs his capital in the support of domestic industry, necessarily endeavours so to direct that industry, that its produce may be of the greatest possible value. [...]As every individual, therefore, endeavours as much as he can, both to employ his capital in the support of domestic industry, and so to direct that industry that its produce maybe of the greatest value; every individual necessarily labours to render the annual revenue of the society as great as he can. He generally, indeed, neither intends to promote the public interest, nor knows how much he is promoting it. By preferring the support of domestic to that of foreign industry, he intends only his own security; and by directing that industry in such a manner as its produce may be of the greatest value, he intends only his own gain; and he is in this, as in many other cases, led by an invisible hand to promote an end which was no part of his intention. Nor is it always the worse for the society that it was no part of it.\\"After reading this book, I have found out that Adam Smith was influenced by French Physiocrats. The Physiocrats saw the true wealth of a nation as determined by the surplus of agricultural production over and above that needed to support agriculture (by feeding farm labourers and so forth). Other forms of economic activity, such as manufacturing, were viewed as taking this surplus agricultural production and transforming it into new products, by using the surplus agricultural production to feed the workers who produced the extra goods. While these manufacturers and other non agricultural workers may be useful, they were seen as 'sterile' in that their income derives ultimately not from their own work, but from the surplus production of the agricultural sector.I have found out that this book is not about \\"invisible hand\\" or \\"Laissez-faire\\". It is quite a complete study that covers almost every basic aspect of the economy, and remains an effective introduction to economics to this day.This book is so often mischaracterized and politicized that I suggest you to read it completely by yourself. This is a must read for every economist. You can get an audio version of this book to avoid lengthy read."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations","review":"This book is filled with great information you will find useful as well as having to find new things you never knew about.

For this reason I have marked it down to three stars. Smith is necessary reading for anyone interested in the history of Western thought, the Enlightenment or economics, but it must be said that it is dry, if admirably clear, reading and difficult to chew and swallow. For that reason, it is disappointing to get so far in and then find that one is not getting the complete work.There can be few books that have had such lasting influence on the cultural milieu. Unlike Marx, Smith's ideas seem to have stood up to the tide of history without being washed away, although I write at a time when the finance system appears to have just collapsed, so who knows how a little more history will judge it. At any rate, the correctness of Smith's ideas is perhaps of less import for the student of Western thought than its place in the emergence of a rationalist, secular culture. For Smith was part of the conscious project of the Enlightenment to introduce naturalistic models of our world in place of the magical thinking, in the form of divine providence, which preceded it. Smith was building a model of economy which did not rely on an external, disembodied agency but which emerged deterministically and reached equilibrium through the rule-based interactions of its component parts. His \\"invisible hand\\" replaced another.At the same time, he was making a case for personal autonomy and the right of economic self-determination. As such, Smith combines the two most salient threads of the Enlightenment project - liberation from authority and liberation from magic. More than perhaps any other Enlightenment figure, Smith has shaped the way we think as a political culture today. As such, one must read this book to understand the legacy of the Enlightenment. It is hard going, as he was a very thorough worker and this is economics, the most dismal of sciences, but indispensable.There is one misconception that this reading corrected for me which I ought to share, and that concerns Smith's alleged scepticism about \\"corporations\\". For Smith, and presumably for his contemporaries, this did not, as I thought, indicate opposition to public companies and multinationals in the way we would currently understand it. Rather, he referred to, and condemned, the system of closed trades and apprenticeships by which the market for certain trades was until recently widely protected from competition. I demur from taking sides in this, but it is important to mention the misunderstanding which arises out of the word \\"corporation\\", incautiously read."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations","review":"The book came in a timely fashion and was in great condition.

Smith has written much better in 1776 than nearly all economists do today.The marginal notes are good too. This book is a great book because it argues for some iron-hard economic rules in a way that Centre-left people, such as myself, will listen seriously to. Smith is not a neo-con by any stretch of the imagination. He speaks of employer combinations openly, whereas most economist writers won't talk about them, and he notes that combinations of employees (unions) are, in 1776, banned by the entire world. He also approves of regulations when they improve the safety of working people, something management still has a problem with.So Smith is more even handed than the right wing voices who cite his economic principles constantly, and deserves reading and citing by Centre-Left people."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations","review":"Reading this reminded me of my Latin classes many years ago, trying to decipher the likes of Cicero.

Thus, upon equal, or nearly equal profits, every wholesale merchant naturally prefers the home trade to the foreign trade of consumption, and the foreign trade of consumption to the carrying trade. In the home trade, his capital is never so long out of his sight as it frequently is in the foreign trade of consumption. [...]Secondly, every individual who employs his capital in the support of domestic industry, necessarily endeavours so to direct that industry, that its produce may be of the greatest possible value. [...]As every individual, therefore, endeavours as much as he can, both to employ his capital in the support of domestic industry, and so to direct that industry that its produce maybe of the greatest value; every individual necessarily labours to render the annual revenue of the society as great as he can. He generally, indeed, neither intends to promote the public interest, nor knows how much he is promoting it. By preferring the support of domestic to that of foreign industry, he intends only his own security; and by directing that industry in such a manner as its produce may be of the greatest value, he intends only his own gain; and he is in this, as in many other cases, led by an invisible hand to promote an end which was no part of his intention. Nor is it always the worse for the society that it was no part of it.\\"After reading this book, I have found out that Adam Smith was influenced by French Physiocrats. The Physiocrats saw the true wealth of a nation as determined by the surplus of agricultural production over and above that needed to support agriculture (by feeding farm labourers and so forth). Other forms of economic activity, such as manufacturing, were viewed as taking this surplus agricultural production and transforming it into new products, by using the surplus agricultural production to feed the workers who produced the extra goods. While these manufacturers and other non agricultural workers may be useful, they were seen as 'sterile' in that their income derives ultimately not from their own work, but from the surplus production of the agricultural sector.I have found out that this book is not about \\"invisible hand\\" or \\"Laissez-faire\\". It is quite a complete study that covers almost every basic aspect of the economy, and remains an effective introduction to economics to this day.This book is so often mischaracterized and politicized that I suggest you to read it completely by yourself. This is a must read for every economist. You can get an audio version of this book to avoid lengthy read."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations","review":"Adam Smith, a professor of moral philosophy in 18th century Scotland, was, perhaps, the World's first &quot;economist.&quot; One must remember that during Smith's era, there simply was no such thing as the formal study of economics, and it is this fact that makes &quot;Wealth of Nations&quot; so interesting as it represents the first attempt, as far as I know, by an individual to explain the intricacies of money, capitalism, profit, etc., in a scientific manner. Truly, &quot;Wealth of Nations&quot; is to economics what Newton's Principia is to physics. It is not perfect, but considering the time in which it was written it was an amazing accomplishment.The reader will find discussions on a great many topics, but what is especially fascinating is the insight into 1700's Britain that is provided. Remember, this book was published in 1776. Smith even discusses the &quot;recent troubles with the colonies&quot;--America.It is emminently readable, though it becomes less so in certain sections--the digression on silver, for example. However, if one takes it slowly, then one can easily digest this feast of intellectual achievement in a relatively short time. Afterwards, the works of Ricardo, Marx, Keynes--to name a few--should be tackled.Again, highly recommended."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations","review":"If you have any interest at all in Economics, you'll want to go to the source. This is the source. Adam Smith lays the groundwork for the study of Economics in this very readable treatise.Though he is discussing 18th century Britain, the topics he discusses have direct analogs in the modern American economy. Taxes, trade, money, monopoly, tarrifs, and international trade balance are all tackled with aplomb.He really lays into Mercantilism and blasts the protectionism it engenders. Never anything less than a champion of the common man, Smith decrys monopolies and other taxes on those most unable to afford them. Though he seems to be a total free marketeer, he takes great pains to examine the types of taxes which would be useful and prudent for a government to levy.Once or twice may be fine, but Smith uses this construction for almost every sentence in the book. It is just a stylistic gripe, but the length and complexity of each sentence make digesting the information quite a bit more difficult than it otherwise could have been. I would not be at all disappointed to see this book translated to a more modern style.Again, if you're interested in Economics at all, this book is the place to start. There is so much good information here to be absorbed and pondered. I recommend it highly."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations","review":"Nobody seriously involved in economics can do without this exhaustive work, originally published in five volumes as An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations. This classic is a pragmatic and accessible milestone in the history of economics. Its author, Adam Smith, is woven into every economics textbook. However, Smith's theories, which today often are recounted mostly in fragments, frequently incorrectly, reveal their entire social and economic innovative power only in context. Smith burst onto the scene at a time when absolutist national states monopolized the world's precious metal reserves and tried to increase their own wealth through stringent export policies. These states were motivated by an entirely new concept about national wealth: that it stemmed from the work of the country's people, not from gold. Based on that idea, economic markets should balance themselves as if guided by an \\"invisible hand,\\" impelled by each individual's self-interest. The state has to provide only an orderly framework and specific public goods and services. Even though Smith's image of idealized economic and social harmony may have developed a few cracks over the course of time, his ideas have inspired many well-known economists during the past 250 years, including David Ricardo, Vilfredo Pareto, Friedrich August von Hayek and Milton Friedman. We highly recommend this seminal work."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations","review":"Note that the complete edition of Adam Smith's Wealth of Nations is usually published in two volumes. The only exception I'm aware of is the University of Chicago Press' edition, which specifically states that it is \\"two volumes in one;\\" note that this means double-numbering, as the page numbers restart for the second \\"volume\\". The reason that it usually comes in two volumes is that it is a very, very long work, totaling over 1000 pages, and abridgement is apparently so common that it isn't stated directly by publishers. So, if the edition you're considering buying has less than 1000 pages, it is either only one of the two volumes, or it is abridged. It doesn't help that Amazon often provides the \\"inside pages\\" of a different edition from the one you're viewing, so if you want to check the table of contents to see just what's in a particular edition, you may be misled. If what you want is the complete work look for something that indicates that it is \\"unabridged\\"."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations","review":"After hearing about socialism from too many people who do not know and admit to not knowing what the word means, it makes sense to return to the sources and read. Start with Adam Smith. To be clear, Adam Smith is writing about capitalism, but how many of us know what that word means? Adam Smith is a good place to start learning before you start opining.This is not a simple read. The style is not as dense as was typical in 1776 but it can be just as elliptical.Interesting, although tangential is that the book mentions the American Revolution but only as an incidental backdrop to the more import issue of how and why money is created and moves. How well Mr Smith understood the then nascent industrial revolution is a hypotheses for a more learned reviewer than myself.Over all there is a great deal of repetition, and repetition with slight variation , punctuated by a scattering of tables, none of which printed as readable in my e version. This being said, Mr. Smith writes with a power granted to those who first encode a new world view. His is the more powerful because most of this work consists of a logical argument laid out in simple words.While many of us were exposed to the basics, capital, land labor, lowest cost, investment seeking the highest return, taxes bad (although not always) and so forth, I was struck by some of the lessor taught observations.Written in a time when there was no functioning concept of labor union, Mr. Smith warns that labor will loose against owners. The law (then) tended prevent labor from organizing and owners frequently socialized together, had common interests and therefor could be expected to overpower the labor virtually at will.Perhaps the single most telling comment, and the one most significant to today is his comment that when business interests attempt to make or influence public policy it is best to assume that they are lying or seeking action at the expense of public interest. Mr. Smith gives no third possibility.This is a great classic in western thought. I am tempted to say it should be mandatory. E editions certainly make it affordable. But For all you Wall Street occupiers and big wigs, Greek protesters, and Tea Party literalists, Obama haters, and anyone with a loud opinion on economics, this is a good place to start educating yourself. It might be nice to hear the shouting from some one who has done some homework."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations","review":"For anyone coming to Adam Smith's Wealth of Nations the first surprise is how readable it is. Famous classic of economic theory though it may be, this is no dry academic tome to be read only by people with a scholarly interest in economic history. There are no detailed tables of statistics of the sort one might expect to find in a modern book on the subject, and no mathematical analysis, indeed not very much quantitative information at all. Instead there is a long series of examples to explain such ideas as why it is more efficient to divide work among several specialists rather than have a complete task fulfilled by one person, or why slave labour is ultimately more expensive than paying free workers, even workers in cities like Boston or New York, where wages were far higher in Smith's time than those in his native Scotland.To illustrate the principle of the division of labour Smith discusses the manufacture of nails. Even a blacksmith -- skilled in working with a hammer but with no special training in nail making -- could not make more than a few hundred nails in a day, and those of poor quality. A specialist nail maker could make more than two thousand, but much greater improvements, both in quality and quantity, come from recognizing that even a task as apparently simple as manufacturing a nail can be broken up into smaller tasks: maintaining the fire at the right temperature, hammering the nail into the right shape, using a different tool to form the head, and so on.A popular edition of Wealth of Nations is inevitably abridged, as one can hardly expect to buy a complete scholarly edition for a price not much more than that of a novel. Complete editions are available as well, but they are much more expensive. With sensible editing, however, an abridged version can include as much of Smith's writing as the ordinary reader is likely to want, together with notes to explain points that will be obscure to the modern reader. In the Oxford World's Classics edition Kathryn Sutherland has made an excellent job of this, with notes that fill around a fifth of the length of the book."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations","review":"This is one of the truly great books produced by the Western world. Although much has been written on economics since, it considerably broadened my perspective to read it in the original.I can't help feeling that those who pan Wealth of Nations as an apology for exploitation simply haven't read it. That&#65533;s simply not what the book is about. For if you really do care about the underpriveleged masses -- and it's imminently clear that he really does -- then you better consciously organize your state in such a manner that money will flow naturally where it's most needed.I'd been told before I read it by several people that AS was, for example, apologizing for the East India Trading Company? Does his apology for EIT include the lengthy chapter which discuss in full detail how and why the East India Trading Company was responsible for an wide array of abuses in the Far East, and why no similar company would be legal if a society were fully moral and knew its own best interest?Nor is it a blind apology for laissez faire economics, though it does recommend non-intervention by the government insofar as that is possible. Still he fully recognizes the need for social services, rightly understood and rightly executed.In fact, I can't see how anyone who reads it could view it as an apology at all -- it's simply a statement of fact. Adam Smith is not the one carrying an ideology around on his shoulder. You may not like it that the world works this way -- that's another matter. But that IS the way it works... you are made to see that for yourself. It is not imposed on you as dogma.And after reading AS, I'm left feeling very happy that that's the way the world works.I think the most fundamental idea I am left with after reading all those pages, is that wealth is a verb, not a noun. Land and labor (i.e. food and farming) are the bottom line of economics. Treat your farmers well. Unjust practices in trading will ultimately backfire.The dynamo which runs the machine that creates wealth lies within each individual - it is the individual&#65533;s will to better his or her condition.

It is worth reading, but for those with less time, I recommend \\"The Essential Adam Smith\\"The Essential Adam SmithContent Summary: The \\"Wealth of Nations\\" contains Adam Smith's classic defense of free trade, and his simultaneous attack on the mercantilist system of his day. Mercantilism was a policy favoring exports and discouraging imports, while trying to maximize the silver and gold coins brought into the nation. Smith points out that this policy was self-defeating, that trade barriers invite retaliatory trade barriers. Mercantilism actually discouraged greater economic growth. Smith further argues that free trade, with a focus upon producing commodities and commanding more productive labor, is actually the more prosperous alternative. Besides many other things he says, he was in favor of an inheritance tax for the wealthy, opposed to taxes on wages, for generally minimizing all taxes as much as feasible, and repeats the idea that the wealthy have some greater responsibility to give back to their country in proportion to their wealth. In fact, it is in their self-interest to do so, to assure a prosperous and secure nation that protects their own wealth. The \\"invisible hand\\", which people are so fond of quoting - appears only once in this book (and thrice in all Smith's writings). It does suggest that it is through pursuing their own free, self-interest, that men render a greater prosperity to society.Analytical Review: Smith's argument, that free trade renders a more prosperous economy, is probably a good one. Capitalism has been a vehicle for generating greater wealth, but not always generating greater equality. It must be pointed out of course, that there rarely if ever has been a completely free market. I believe Marx's Communist radical alternative has not and will not supplant capitalism. What Marx understood, however, was a greater sense of social justice. Marx's writing is loaded with justified sentiment for the oppression of the working poor, and his labor theory of value in \\"Capital\\" goes a long way to augment and correct (but not entirely substitute) Smith's omissions. Smith had absorbed the very hierarchical, class-based values of his time. In several passages on slavery, for example, Smith's strongest condemnation is to call it an \\"unfortunate\\" institution. What Smith understood better was that humans are self-interested and will prosper more generally through a free market. But Smith also opposed the power of monopolies, and believed some provision should be made for the poor, and that plays into Marx's thought. Marx had greater insight into the abusive dominance of monopoly capitalism, and its often cold-shouldered indifference to the inequities it produced. In a nutshell, Smith gave us the wisdom that the free market is better, but Marx has given us the corrective that a fair and just use of capital is a better (and yes - you might add even democratic of Christian) ideal. A free-market economy, with some corrective for social justice and common welfare, is my view of a compromise between them. My advice - we have much to learn from both Smith and Marx, if only critics would often read them before speaking too brashly."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations","review":"Out of necessity, whenever an original work is \\"abridged,\\" the abridger must make a value judgment regarding what in the original work is worthwhile (and will be preserved), and what is not of relevance, and will thus be discarded and placed beyond your view.

First, it is truly \\"complete and unabridged.\\" So, you get the real deal, all thousand pages of it. Second, it includes Edwin Cannan's summaries in the margin that assist in reading this thick tome. Cannan also provides an enlarged index that serves as a quick reference. And third, the Introduction by Robert Reich and the Commentary at the end by R.H. Campbell and A.S. Skinner are very helpful in better understanding this work. You may get more out of those two sections than Smith's thousand pages of writing.This book was written before the field of economics theory existed. As a result, Smith's writings do not include such common words as: economics, recession, expansion, contraction, inflation, GDP, common stocks, and securities. Thus, his writings has no resemblance to modern economics commentary. Given that, it is challenging interpreting what he is saying in modern context.Smith could not be an economist since the latter profession did not exist he had to be something else: a moral philosopher. In the 18th century if you studied hard sciences you were a natural philosopher. And, if you studied anything else you were a moral philosopher. Such a broad base binomial taxonomy of all intellectual scientific fields had great advantages. This is because moral philosophy included all the fields that today are pretty separate such as: logic, rhetoric, psychology, sociology. On a more granular level moral philosophy as advanced by Smith included microeconomics, macroeconomics, international economics, behavioral finance, international economics, etc... Nowadays, all those fields are fairly demarcated.In view of the above, Smith's intellectual legacy is in part timeless. This is because he was concerned about the speculations that went inside individuals' minds just as he was concerned about the productivity of labor, small businesses, and the economy at large. His cogitations covered the entire fields of behavioral finance, macro and macroeconomics.Smith's thinking was far more complex and nuanced than the ones of his libertarian followers such as Friedrich Hayek, Milton Friedman, and Alan Greenspan. They all missed more than half of Smith's message. That included Smith support for labor unions (at a time when labor abuse was rampant), government regulations including very tight regulation of banking. Smith also was opposed to the might of large corporation as he was suspicious of their collaborating to depress wages and their colluding on prices before laws banned such practices. Thus, Smith was far more the precursor of Keynes than Milton Friedman. Yet, this is not what the economic profession conveys to the outside world.Smith's posterity and prescience are second to none. Unfortunately, his writing in a contemporary setting is unreadable. For my part, I got a lot more about Smith's thoughts from reading digested modern interpretations from others than from reading Smith's own writing. In this regard, I recommend three books. James BuchanThe Authentic Adam Smith: His Life and Ideas (Enterprise)is excellent and solely focused on Adam Smith and his writings. Arthur HermanHow the Scots Invented the Modern World: The True Story of How Western Europe's Poorest Nation Created Our World & Everything in Itcovers the entire Scottish Enlightenment. And, John CassidyHow Markets Fail: The Logic of Economic Calamitiescriticizes the entire field of economics. Yet, he describes Adam Smith as a far more balanced and complex thinker than his modern followers."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations","review":"In his day monarchies, emerging democracies, business people and government employees were profoundly inept in the affairs of economics, trade and taxation. We have come a long way. Now governments are simply inept including the USA government. When you compare the errors in governmental affairs that he reviewed more than two hundred years ago to the mistakes and wrong governmental policies of today there is considerable reason for optimism.What a damning review of governmental affairs he wrote. This is the predominant reason for reading this book. Secondarily, to trace the development of economic thought. Adam Smith was one of the greatest pioneers in the science of economics. There are areas where we now know he was in error. Science content of modern economics is more profound than most observers are willing to admit. If you just want to learn about economics you would be well served to first read more current economists. In modern times, Milton Friedman has played a similar role. Again there is that radical urgency to place Friedman in the conservative pile before they decide the correctness of his thought. The legacy of critically reviewing the errors of democratic governments as well as repressive governments will hopefully be kept alive and well. Much is left to be done-- even in the USA. A very exciting question remains what happens when the repressive leaders of China realize that good economic policy and political freedom are so deeply intertwined that there repression is truly doomed. Will the end be destructive or positive. It is surely coming.Similarly in the USA and other developed nations, as more people learn economics on the path to greater involvement in business, investing and entrepreneurship one would expect increasing rebellion against the reckless of policies by politicians and the uninformed contentions of the media. There are many helpful books some I have recently reviewed that can broaden ones understanding of governmental failings in economic policy.While everybody would benefit from more knowledge about economics, the basic shortcomings of the media and politicians is of critical concern. It is no surprise that reviewers of economics related books have to rush to place any book either in the conservative pile or the liberal pile. Why or how one decides to place Adam Smith in the conservative pile, is surely the sickness of political views over logic.

Smith would thus have been an ardent advocate of the conservative Federalist position of Washington,Hamilton,Madison,Franklin,Jay,etc.,while opposing the libertarian views of Paine,Mason,and Henry."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations","review":"Where is this guy buried so I can dig him up and slap him?

He explained that all work had to behighly organized in order to be productive. In addition, herecognized that machinery facilitated work. This notion servesas an important foundation for more modern patent practice.He praised the ingenuity of inventors and makers of newmachinery. The author spoke of increased production as acondition precedent to enhancing the power of labor. From thisprecept, he explained that the size of a market would dictatethe division of its constituent labor. For instance, a smallcommunity in the suburbs might be serviced by a local&quot;General Store&quot;; whereas, a county in a large city would beserviced by a retail chain store with hundreds of employeesand a highly sophisticated management structure.In Adam Smith'stime, metals were popular in the manufacture of commodities.Problems were encountered in weighing the metals and arrivingat a uniform system of metrics. The theory of pricing wasa function of the toil needed to purchase a good. For instance,the price of an auto was a function of the many hours of labornecessary to earn the money to buy the car. In addition, the price of an item was related to its constituent parts.For instance, the price of linen was a function of the laborof the flaxdresser, spinner, weaver, bleacher and overallemployer. The natural price varied with the price of componentparts. For instance, if the semiconductor was reduced significantly in price- then the overall price of an electronicappliance would go down. Adam Smith saw labour as a functionof national wealth. He recognized that laborers had to earnmore than a mere subsistence in order to live dignified lives.He told a story of a mother in the Highlands of Scotland whohad to raise 20 children so that 2 would survive. Presumably,18 children would die from various diseases and poverty.The interest rates at the time were low. In England, rateshovered at 5%. In France, the rates were 3-5% . The governmentcould borrow at 2% in Holland.Adam Smith defined a wage as a function of the following:o the ease or hardship to do workConsider the case of a diamond cutter. The art of cutting adiamond is a precise process which requires extensive trainingand expert worksmanship. The demand for precious stones was afunction of their inherent beauty, scarcity and workmanshipinvolved in polishing them and preparing them for commercial use.o the difficulty and expense of learning a tradeA skilled surgeon required years of medical training and along apprenticeship in anatomy and surgery.o the constancy of employmento the trust reposed in the workpeopleConsider the case of a landowner who took a year-long vacationto the Orient. He/she would leave behind a manager to run theentire business on a 24/7 basis. This high degree of trustreposed in the workperson required a commensurate compensation.o probability of success or failure of the ventureConsider the effort required to cross the Atlantic. The tripwas lengthy, dangerous and prone to failure due to the vagariesof nature, pirating on the high seas and disease. Naturally,a worker had to receive a greater compensation to take thesefactors into consideration.o the danger inherent in doing the workConsider the danger inherent in entering a diamond mine.The possibility of collapse was a constant threat. Accordingly,workers were compensated commensurate with the threat level.Adam Smith explained that fear of misfortune dampened the takingof risks. He knew (intuitively) that investors were risk averse.In addition, there was a restriction on training new labor.In Sheffield, no master cutter could train more than a singlecutter . Apprenticeships were lengthy. i.e. 7 years in lengthAdam Smith explained that food was a source of rent to thelandowners. The pricing of metals was a function of the pricein the most fertile mine in the world. Whatever increased thefertility of the land increased its value by implication.Markets in foodstuffs were restricted because refrigerationdid not exist until motors and condensers were perfected.Essentially, there were no operable refrigerators until thefamous Clausius statement was perfected in the engineeringsciences.Accordingly, the market for butcher's meat was confined to thecountry of origin. Wool and raw hide could be transported;however, meat was consumed locally as its shelf-life was limited.The value of money was a function of the value of annual produce.Accordingly, increased quantities of commodities raised thevalue of money. Low fixed rates of interest promoted businessand discouraged usury. Riches were a function of the annualproduce which created the wealth and supported the tax base.High duties were enforced to protect the local markets. Treatiesbetween countries helped local merchants to craft meaningfultrade sequences. Exports were encouraged . The expense oferecting public works was a function of the taxes raised on theland and the proportion of yield from the crops.Governments granted bounties to merchants who wanted to selloverseas in order to assist them in making a profit anddefraying costs/risks. This work is a classic in theoreticaland practical economics. It is a &quot;must read&quot; for economists,historians, majors in government, financiers, investors,literary buffs and a large constituency of academicians."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations","review":"Fundamental economic principals do not change, what worked (or did not work) in Babylon works in the United States(or does not work)or perhaps more accurately as being practiced in Communist China, works now.

Amy Thomas is shocked twice in one day when her child's secret father appears and a dead body is unearthed at a construction site. One threatens her heart. The secret of the other threatens her life. Can Jake save Amy, win her heart and create a family with her?&quot;Best-Kept Secrets&quot; is really two books: a fairly good mystery plot and a boring secret child story that uses every clich&eacute; in the book. If you can find anything in the circumstances of Amy and Jake's separation that you haven't read in dozens of other books, you haven't read enough of these books (Lucky You!). I spent much of &quot;Best-Kept Secrets&quot; counting all the many cliches. The mystery element is far stronger. There are some juicy secrets to be uncovered and plenty of danger. Late in the book, the story picks up some steam with good action and some twists. Unfortunately, there's more of the secret child nonsense than the mystery. After being pulled away from the mystery too many times, I started to lose interest in it too. The suspects aren't developed enough for us to guess who it could be or why. By the end I was having a hard time understanding why I should care who did it.I don't think you can dismiss secret child books simply because they involve a secret baby. Recent titles like &quot;The Bodyguard's Baby&quot; and &quot;The Agent's Secret Child&quot; have used this hook effectively to create compelling stories. Unfortunately books like &quot;Best-Kept Secrets&quot; are why many readers are growing unhappy with its overuse. Secret babies by themselves aren't interesting; it's what the author does with it, the emotions she has her characters go through. There is nothing interesting about what Sinclair does with it here. The characters repeat the same arguments we've read a million times before. Frankly I didn't care about them because I've read about these characters before. There was nothing special about Amy or Jake. Without a strong plot, strong characters are critical. This book didn't have them. There is only one interesting character in this book: a teenage boy. I kept thinking about Rafe and Kendra from Sinclair's last book, &quot;The Specialist.&quot; They had complicated pasts and much depth. Amy and Jake do not.Well-written but uninspired, the book is as unremarkable as its title. Two years after the Intrigue editors renamed Adrianne Lee's &quot;The Real Mac Coy&quot; &quot;The Best-Kept Secret,&quot; we get &quot;Best-Kept Secrets.&quot; They make it sound like a rehash, and in many ways it is. That isn't to say it's awful. Out of the four books in this series, &quot;Best-Kept Secrets&quot; is probably tied with &quot;My Baby My Love&quot; in terms of quality. It's better than &quot;The Silent Witness,&quot; not as good as &quot;For His Daughter.&quot; It's not as confusing or muddled as TSW but it's also not as exciting or emotional as FHD. It's boring. More of the mystery, none of the secret child muddle would have improved it. Overall, I would recommend &quot;For His Daughter&quot; or Sinclair's recent Texas Confidential book over this one."},{"Title":"Best - Kept Secrets (Fools Point) (Intrigue, 602)","review":"FINALLY the story behind the mysterious Jake Collins.

A focus of this activity is our main character's atelier (studio). He's a sculptor and what better occupation to attract the chicks? He tells us that the perfect affair is when both partners are married and the woman is 20 years younger than the man. And he should know! He spends very little time banging on marble and a lot of time...well, let's not go there. He reminisces, compares, contrasts and rates his lovers. His latest is a pediatrician's wife. The sculptor's wife is also a pediatrician and the lovers first began meeting at pediatric conferences. She's 30-ish and he's 50-ish so this should be perfect. But unlike the others, she's a bit hard to get and he becomes somewhat obsessed, spending an entire week trying to track her down when she goes on a family vacation. Lucky in Love is translated from the Portuguese and it features a lot of local color of Lisbon street life.

Impressed with the author's storytelling ability, I felt as though I was beside this humble federal agent in each of his undercover experiences. An incredible description of the evil drug underworld, this book opened my eyes to the real dangers of drugs, unlike any other book, article or presentation.

Didn't want to stop reading until I was finished the book."},{"Title":"Hot Shots and Heavy Hits: Tales of an Undercover Drug Agent","review":"I once read a marvelous quote by Anthony Boucher, the late great New York Times Book Review critic in which he described the sheer joy he felt when he discovered a new talented mystery writer. He said nothing gave him greater pleasure than finding that year's best debut. Among many other jobs and talents, Boucher also edited the True Crime Detective magazine, so perhaps it's befitting that it's Boucher who springs to mind when assessing Boston native Paul E.Doyle's true crime/memoir -- the sensational debut Hot Shots and Heavy Hits.In Hot Shots and Heavy Hits, Paul Doyle (or his street pseudonym \\"Paulie Sullivan\\" or the pseudonymous moniker \\"Sully\\"), a retired DEA agent, chronicles his undercover narcotics agent experience in mostly Boston and New York City during the 1970's. Believe the passage from the introduction when Doyle prepares readers, \\"My purpose is to share the work of an undercover agent with you so that you may understand the heart and soul of what we do.\\" Newcomer Doyle succeeds - actually, exceeds - his stated purpose in Hot Shots and Heavy Hits by writing a memoir that is deft and neat-handed and told with a prose that is absolutely stunning. Doyle's writing reads like a novel - dialogue is superb, action scenes are palpable, and the suspense is page-turning. Perhaps that what contributes most to the exceptionality of this book that I found so unputdownable - this ain't fiction, people! This is the brutally honest memoir of one man's - one special agent's -- undercover work in his fight against the problem of drugs during the 1970's.Each chapter is a visceral account of Doyle's experiences; each cinematically episodic. Readers should prepare for a roller coaster of vignettes that are hilarious, frustrating, terrifying, gut-wrenchingly brutal, and at times so poignant, that Doyle had me in tears. Academics may pay particular attention to the professorial foreword, though I thought it was unnecessary and clumsy juxtaposed against Doyle's consummate narrative.Hot Shots and Heavy Hits - true crime that reads like a novel (money says this writer has a fiction book or two in him!).

In reading this book I found that other than the bell bottom pants and silk shirts, the happenings of the underground drug world are in so many ways similar today. The difference being the technology used and the way the intelligence is gained. I bought this book at a fair where the author was present and signed my copy. I spoke to him for a few moments and told him that I worked for a police department in a neighboring town and that my husband was also a police officer. He suggested that I read it and have my husband do the same. This book was a real page turner and I wasn't able to put it down until I was finished. I was truly impressed with his compassion for people which can easily be lost in the investigative and enforcement field.

I read this book pretty much straight through and totally enjoyed it. The experiences that Doyle had as an undercover agent are told in exciting and passionate fashion. The book is filled with great incite and depth into the life of an undercover agent in the 70's. I think what is important to remember here is that the book is about experiences of an undercover agent in the 70's. While reading I couldn't help but feel that Paul and company were doing their jobs the only way they knew how. The reader has to be cognizant that the DEA was in its infancy and they were makingthe rules as they went. We often look at our servicemen and women as hero's, as we should, but remember people like Paul are just as important fighting a war here at home. The only thing the books fails to really delve into is how Paul continued to deal with his fatal encounter and how it effected his family and fellow agents.Dolye does speak a considerable amout about the where his mind was at immediatly after the shooting but the reader never really finds out how it effected his marriage or his wife's feeling about his job. As far as the other stories in the book and what Paul leadthe reader to believe he was becoming, it's par for the course. There is so much evil in the world and only a few brave men and women that choose to combat it. Paul Doyle is just a man...but a man others that choose his path that will sacrifice personal relationships, their health, and their mortality for the benifitof the greater good."},{"Title":"From the Promised Land to Home: Trajectories of Selfhood in Asian-American Women's Autobiography (Woman in History, 83)","review":"This in-depth discussion of Asian women's autobiographies fills a huge void in our understanding of this neglected subject.

This is a worthy investment for a Who Fan with a long drive or with children s/he wants to help introduce to reading since a child can follow along with the text in the (not included) book version."},{"Title":"Twelve Cities","review":"The author was an American press and TV journalist, born at the turn of the last century and most known for a series of travel narratives based on the \\"inside\\" look. He authored over 40 books and died in 1970.This work was written over several trips in 1967 and is therefore, of course, somewhat dated as to the cities descriptions, politics and populations. Partly this is because of his choice of cities - Moscow, Warsaw, Jerusalem, Beirut and Tokyo - form a sort of epicenter of dynamics and change. His narrative is written in a fairly conventional and conversational prose, no sparkling interplay like Jan Morris, or Paul Theroux would offer the reader, and one repeated \\"twitch\\" he allows himself all too often, infuriated this reader. On several instances in the midst of descriptions of history or culture he deploys that rather strange excuse \\"... but space forbids further explanations here... in this work\\". I actually margin-scribbled about the third of fourth time - \\"Take the ploody space man - tell us!\\"He is heart-wrenching in Warsaw and the figures and descriptions of two million Jewish slaughtered there in the uprising against the Nazis still disturb - no matter how often we may have read of then before, and he is lyrical of Beirut, as it was in the still French-influenced time before the period of the \\"Six Day War\\" in the region. Of the current squalor, trash, and corruption he writes...\\" Beirut commits treason against itself.\\"A turn of phrase that none of us who remember her in earlier years would dispute. An interesting book for any arm-chair traveller, but not recommended or offered as a guide for any current trips."},{"Title":"Space-Time Structure","review":"I've turned to this thin book far too many times to count. It was also a life-saver when I was learning General Relativity because of its clear and careful exposition. Schrodinger was doing this back when nobody was quite sure what the deal was with, e.g., index notation, and he took pains to lay out the benefits -- but also the limits -- of that system. See, for example, his discussion of the derivative operator, something that is almost always glossed over.I'm in the middle of my dissertation now, and every now and then I hit on a subtlety in GR that my advisor has missed but I caught from reading this book.Don't get thinking that this is Schrodinger's book on the unified field. It is more like the lecture notes of a very intelligent man figuring out what on Earth this truly new version of gravity is all about.In the end of course this book is too slim to live on its own as a GR text. You will need to carry around a bigger, more comprehensive tome to get through your studies. As a handguide and emergency sense-maker, however, it has few equals."},{"Title":"Space-Time Structure","review":"I am an advanced undergraduate physics student who has started to go through Space-Time Structure. It seems to be a very good book, but the section introducing tensors was not as lucid as it could be. If you already know tensors or have a good book like Shaum's Outline of Tensor Calculus, then it can be a very useful introduction to the affine viewpoint of relativity that Schrodinger promotes. The discussion of nonsymmetric unified field theories is introductory and it would be necessary to look up the references it cites to get a more in depth understanding of them."},{"Title":"Space-Time Structure","review":"This book presents the results of Schroedinger's work in Ireland in which he explored the manifold of possibilities for unified field theories along the general lines pursued by Einstein. The main accomplishment was in constructing such a theory from just the connection, with metric derived as a consequence, using no ad hoc assumptions. I extended this work in my 1977 Master's thesis. While this kind of theory has gone out of style, it is still an exciting pursuit and Schroedinger's writing is clear and compelling."},{"Title":"Space-Time Structure","review":"I'm twelve right about now, and I have my own theory of time.Time (the fourth dimension) is arranged on separate lines, like thefirst dimension. The fifth dimension is arranged in time planes and the sixth in time cubes. The fourth dimension, however, is simpler than those. Imagine infinite lines in space, each stacked one on another. These we will call \\"time lines\\". From these infinite lines spread more infinite lines. We'll call these \\"destiny lines\\". Then there are more and more destiny lines branching from those destiny lines, and so on and so forth. They get very complicated. Time lines are the original paths of time. Destiny lines are the lines of time determined by what happens along the time lines. Sounds confusing? Well, anything you do creates a new destiny line. As I write this, I am creating a new destiny line. The future may be different if I didn't write this at all. Time planes are the collection of one timeline and all destiny lines spreading from it. Time cubes are the colletion of all time planes. It's kinda weird ;)"},{"Title":"Vineyard: A Year In The Life of California's Wine Country","review":"I admit at the outset that I am not a wine-lover. I drink a glass of wine every evening because it is said to be healthful, and I don't sip wine while chewing gum, but, okay, usually I cannot distinguish one wine from another without reading the label. So I could probably write a more informed review of a book about toilet tissue. Still, I don't believe this book is altogether wasted on ignorant readers like me. Ms. Sterling's prose opens an appealing and beautiful window into the California Wine Country, as seen by someone who lives and works on a vineyard there. The reader comes to appreciate, and sympathize with, the labor-intensive nature of wine-making, and the countless and challenging factors of climate, weather, soil, parasites, barrels, farming decisions, and nearly endless intangibles that determine the volume and the quality of the yearly vintage. Even more important and more visible in this book is the love that accompanies the labor: love of the land and its seasons, love of the process, and especially love of the final product, with all its subtleties and nuances.The text does provide information, but this is by no means a text in oenology. Instead it is a rhapsody on making of fine wines in the singular and fortunate environment of California. The accompanying photographs, which constitute more than half of the book, not only harmonize with the prose but also stand alone as superb examples of photographic art. The photographer (and co-author) is a master of light, skilled at achieving dramatic, evocative, and downright beautiful results even in conditions that are photographically marginal.Quibbles: there were a few terms that my dictionary did not define; perhaps a short glossary would have been useful. And I wish the figure captions had been placed adjacent to the individual photographs rather than on a list at the back of the book.In summary, this is essentially an art book, a coffee-table book, that can be enjoyed and savored like the wines it describes. It has certainly made me rethink, if not yet revise, my habit of wine-as-medicine."},{"Title":"Vineyard: A Year In The Life of California's Wine Country","review":"I admit at the outset that I am not a wine-lover.

How Would Jesus Raise a Child? written by Teresa Whitehurst Ph. D., might be just what you are looking for to read. It raises the bar for Christian parenting books. Dr. Whitehurst captures the essence of the character and teachings of Jesus and skillfully applies them to parenting.Dr. Whitehurst is a clinical psychologist currently working in research on leadership at Harvard University. She has a background as a therapist who has worked extensively with families. She is also a mother of two daughters and has balanced parenting, work and pursuing her education.The value of the book comes from her applying the lessons from Jesus' life to the issues parents and children face. She draws from her clinical and parenting experience, education and research to identify the challenges that parents must overcome.A reader might infer from the title of this book that the author is attempting to take advantage of the \\"What Would Jesus Do?\\" trend in the Christian culture. This is not the case however. Dr. Whitehurst has written a book that truly answers the question of how Jesus would raise children if he were a parent today.She examines his way of life, his relations with his family, disciples, strangers and children. She looks well beyond the scriptures that speak directly of parenting and looks to the heart and soul of Jesus.How Would Jesus Raise a Child? consists of two parts: \\"Our Inner Growth Comes First\\" and \\"A New Paradigm of Guiding Your Child;\\" each consists of five chapters. Dr. Whitehurst focuses equally on the parent's care for self and on parenting strategies.This is not another parenting book that offers a list of expert opinions and rules to follow that may or may not be the best thing for a child. Dr. Whitehurst bases her instructions on the need for parents to express the same love, compassion, gentleness and teaching style that Jesus embodied during his three years of ministry. As Jesus emphasizes the importance of service to his followers, Dr. Whitehurst writes, \\"Service is at the heart of parenthood.\\"Each chapter in the book presents a balance of insights and lessons from Jesus' life, Dr. Whitehurst's clinical expertise, and other writers and teachers. Throughout the book, Dr. Whitehurst also offers comparisons between parenting and living like Jesus and parenting and living like the world. She illustrates quite a contrast.Perhaps my favorite chapter is \\"Encouraging Your Child's Potential.\\" In this chapter, Dr. Whitehurst shows how to teach, inspire and discipline children while also giving them the freedom to find their own identity and passions. She sums up the importance of providing positive support to children, \\"Since children tend to view God much as they do their parents, showing an interest in them boosts their confidence that God too is on their side and wants them to fully develop their unique gifts. And this may be the most important lesson of all.\\"I appreciated the several times when Dr. Whitehurst shared successes and failings from her role as a parent. Her honesty contributes to the overall empathetic and consultative tone of the book.I don't think you will find a guide to Christian parenting as significant as How Would Jesus Raise a Child? So, if you are interested in raising your children as Jesus would, then definitely read and reflect on this book.Craig Stephans, author of Shakespeare On Spirituality: Life-Changing Wisdom from Shakespeare's Plays"},{"Title":"How Would Jesus Raise a Child?","review":"Dr Whitehurst is to be commended for this excellent book, which offers a fresh perspective on living the Gospel, applicable not only to child-raising but to all human relations. The chapter on the Golden Rule is the best treatment of this subject I have seen. While the book comes from an evangelical publishing house, Christians of all traditions, and anyone who looks for guidance to the teachings of Jesus, will find much of value here."},{"Title":"How Would Jesus Raise a Child?","review":"I highly recommend this book to anyone searching for a non-punitive method of discipline. This book isn't a step-by-step guide with explicit guidlines for disciplining children (it is most definitely not a child training manual). It is thought-provoking and if you really internalize the information, it will affect not only how you deal with your child(ren), it will change how you approach and deal with every person you encounter in life."},{"Title":"How Would Jesus Raise a Child?","review":"I found this book very encouraging. Every Seminary and church should have this on their must read list. The insite and tender leading is such a refreshing change from so many of the people who teaching break the child. I found this books sound theology valuable not only in the areas of raising a child but in the everyday process of life."},{"Title":"How Would Jesus Raise a Child?","review":"Highly recommended. Not only is Jesus our Lord and Savior, He is also a parenting partner who will help and guide us every step of the way. Whitehurst helps us attain a working understanding of this partnership to revolutionize our parenting. Wonderful book which totally changed my outlook on parenting."},{"Title":"How Would Jesus Raise a Child?","review":"The positives of the book include the fresh and purposeful insistence on Jesus as a role model in parenting, as well as the positive emphasis on prioritizing, listening to, and carefull knowing your child. As a corrective effort aimed at authoritarian, negative parenting, which has been all too common in many Bible oriented families, the book is helpful. It also contains positive principles applicable to all parents. On the negative side, the total absence of scientific data, the \\"driveby\\" psychology flavor of most of the examples in the book (usually anecdotes based on observing a very brief parent-child interaction in a public setting), and the generally negative slant toward behavioral approaches to child rearing is disappointing coming from a professional psychologist. While reinforcement and punishment are not the only essential aspects of parenting, they are an integral part of it and are inevitably used by parents on a daily basis. It would seem that guidance on using such principles well would be valuable to readers."},{"Title":"How Would Jesus Raise a Child?","review":"How about \\"How would MARY raise a child\\"?It strikes me as very belittling of women and the importance of mothers in general."},{"Title":"Country Friends Good Times: Come Along for a Joyride...Good Times, Good Eats, Good Friends!","review":"I recently ordered this book, and what can I say?

This book does an excellent job of forcing you to not only solve rather difficult puzzles, but also to understand how to solve them (for some types I found myself getting them right without actually knowing what I was doing) and why you find them difficult. Markus, et al. explain the applications of the thought processes required for the puzzles to business and the symptoms of not doing so correctly. I would highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Retrain Your Business Brain: Outsmart the Corporate Competition","review":"Want to feel dumb? Then just take a look at Retrain Your Business Brain, and try one of the 101 problems inside. Donalee Markus, Lindsey Paige Markus and Pat Taylor designed these visual and verbal puzzles to force open new mental pathways. If pain leads to gain, they've done it, because you'll feel as if your mind is being stretched, bent and twisted. It's like yoga for your brain.The authors claim that leaders and employees who work their way through the book become better at solving business problems and spotting opportunities; they even promise to turn detail-oriented people into big-picture thinkers. They walk you through solutions, coaching you to color-code and label problem elements, create categories and apply other problem-solving tools. By the final chapter--in which you decipher an ancient Babylonian numbering system without the use of a decoder ring--you'll never approach a problem the same way again, whether it's unraveling a market trend or trying to develop a new product."},{"Title":"Retrain Your Business Brain: Outsmart the Corporate Competition","review":"In this book you will have to deal with tons of puzzles, primarily of the visual, complete the progression type you find in GMAT (the GMAT puzzles are of the kindergarten level compared to those here). If you enjoy solving puzzles and believe that it can help to improve your IQ (that the authors do diagnose detailedly about your problem solving process which is definitely a plus), you will be highly satisfied. In case you simply get dizzy by looking at them like what my wife does, please give it a pass.p.s. The five star rating is given to appreciate the effort of the authors for putting the large amount of extremely difficult and diverse puzzles in a 260 page book."},{"Title":"Spirit of Homeopathic Medicines: Essential Insights to 300 Remedies","review":"As a licensed naturopathic doctor in New York I know a fair bit about homoepathy. It has been my main method of treatment for at least five years. When I read this book by Dr. Grandgeorge I was awestruck. Here is a doctor that has already been where I am in my understanding of the remedies. Not only has he been where I am, but his experience, compassion and intellligence have obviously taken him far beyond. His insights to the remedies have the clarity that can only be attained by being a master in the field. I have not often been impressed by the skill level of various doctors (natural &amp; conventional) that I have met. I was extreemely impressed by this book. Experienced homeopaths or those new to homeopathy would do well to make this a part of their library.

I am a student of homeopathic medicine and I think, by reading this book, you get an actual sense of exactly how a homeopathic practices works. You can read it like a short esseys. He gives a 'name' to each remedy. This famed French Dr. works with mainly low potencies and works miracles. I think the main thrill of this book for me is absorbing his capacity for 'listening' to his patiences and 'hearing' what they are saying, in order to use homeopathics with the utmost success. His intuition is what homeopathics are all about. A treasured, oft-refered to book."},{"Title":"Spirit of Homeopathic Medicines: Essential Insights to 300 Remedies","review":"I am greatly disappointed by the way the writer of this book grossly oversimplifies homeopathy, and specifically, the quick, magic-like cures he reports in his \\"observations.\\" He continuously gives examples of cases where symptoms \\"disappeared completely\\" after one dose of this or one dose of that.The truth is, I am certainly one of the biggest proponents of homeopathy one could ever meet. I know how truly powerful and capable homeopathy is at treating and healing people (especially when using LM potencies). But this author, Didier Grandgeorge, is very irresponsible and misleading to write about homeopathic remedies the way he does.Homeopathic cures are a bit of a process. The remedies are not magic potions that make one's symptoms just \\"disappear.\\" They work on an energetic level to restore balance, hence, undesirable symptoms get changed, transformed, and also eliminated in the process, but this rarely happens (for non acute cases) via one dose. The author also fails to mention any of the beautiful psychological changes or occurrences of personal growth and expanded awareness that are not only a result of a cure, but ARE ESSENTIAL to a real and lasting cure.On a more positive note, his oversimplified, quick \\"takes\\" on the remedies themselves (verses his paragraphs of case \\"observations\\") can be somewhat useful IF combined with the remedy pictures of other writers (lots of other writers!)."},{"Title":"Spirit of Homeopathic Medicines: Essential Insights to 300 Remedies","review":"there are so many excellent homeopathic books [frans vermeulen,morrison etc etc]grandgeorge stresses some issues [i would call them jewels]in this book,which can be life-saving.i would recommend for example-any doctor [urologist] to tryasa foetida for mild to even severe ureter-reflux.i have seen asa foetida being able to prevent intra-uterine operations,just after using a few doses.quite a few children benefitted from it who would have by now been operated.a uncredible useful clinical book [even if it is called the spirit oh homeopathic medicines]was it only for this tip,then the book is worth buying."},{"Title":"Spirit of Homeopathic Medicines: Essential Insights to 300 Remedies","review":"I expected a different sort of book than this one turned out to be.

Once you've been using homeopathics for a while, and begin to work on a deeper level with them, you'll wonder which (for instance) liver remedy is really the one you need, when there are several which might be right. This book is the book that gives the particular spiritual/psychological picture of the remedies that will let you decide. for instance: &quot;Chelidonium refuses to see clearly, refuses to see the truth ... Chelidonium individuals are energetic realists, practical and anti-intellectual...&quot; &quot;Lycopodium individuals want to recover the power, strength and dignity that have been lost...&quot; &quot;Lilium Tigrinum ... they escape their basic metaphysical anxiety by working to the point of exhaustion...&quot; &quot;Magnesia carbonica .. for children who are abandoned by their parents.&quot; The actual remedy pictures are presented in more detail, including physical indicators.

I highly recommend this novel, and I intend to read his others in the near future."},{"Title":"Senor Vivo & the Coca Lord","review":"I was really captivated by the beginning of this book but as it progressed it all seemed a bit forced. There was too much focus on subplots and not enough on the truly interesting central story. And the &quot;magical realism&quot; seemed to lose steam as well.

This book, compared to the World of Random Novels At Large is great, challenging, fun equally tragic. Compared to other books by this author, it's the runt of a very impressive liter.I think the reason stems for the fact that it is a sequel - the stage is pre-set, the characters already onstage. And the plot, though winding and with sprinkled with capricious elements, boils down to man versus man, a very clear cut analogy for men who strive to do good things, and men who strive to bad. There are some gruesome scenes in here; and if you're read The War of Don Emmanuel's Nether Parts, you know DeB can be horrific at times, but in this book, there is no reason for some of the most grusome parts of the book. The Tragi-comedy aspect is still there - but much less on the comedy. The magical realism is also a key fixture, but it's more like a gimmic in this work than the finely wielded tool in his other books.In short, if youre looking at picking up a DeBerieres book, don't start here. I recommend Birds Without Wings or the War of Don Emmanuel's Nether Parts."},{"Title":"Senor Vivo & the Coca Lord","review":"The first sentence of this book wrongly led me to believe that this De Bernieres' book would be radically different from his masterpieces: \\"Corelli's Mandolin\\" or \\"Birds Without Wings.\\" Those two novels are serious pieces of literature blending the language of the region with the historical events of same around the love story which emerges from an otherwise strained period of that region's history.Who would expect a book that starts with, \\"Ever since his young wife had given birth to a cat as an unexpected consequence of his experiments in sexual alchemy. . .\\" would dovetail with another love story amid another foreign country's torrid historical period? But it does.In fact, that sentence greatly misleads the reader. This book is about the 1980's misfortune of Columbia during its control beneath a drug lord - whose name resembles the real Pablo Escobar: Pablo Ecobandodo. The rest is not so much a parody, but rather an unfortunate truth as De Bernieres' years of Columbian residence too well informed him about the atrocities often committed by the Escobar-influenced henchmen. And, too often the acts were more than merely without mercy, but without purpose - as so recited in this fictional account.Ultimately, the mysterious character of protagonist Dionisio Vivo becomes ensconced with some bizarre events which are as wildly occult as the book's first sentence. But, they appeal to the reader in a fabulist manner akin to Paul Coelho's \\"The Alchemist\\" or Yann Martel's \\"Life of Pi.\\" All books are fun, but De Bernieres' writing style is more sophisticated and better aimed toward a more mature reading market.Like all good fables, good things happen to the good and bad things happen . . . But, how they happen and to whom they happen are always a mystery. But, before the good happens to the good, this book has a lot of bad happen to the good - much like the gory-detailed account of after war atrocities in the way-beyond-the-worst-horrors-of-the-Brothers-Grimm delivered by Jerzy Kosinski in the \\"The Painted Bird (Kosinski, Jerzy).\\"De Bernieres may have been younger and less skilled when writing this book than when writing \\"Birds Without Wings\\" or \\"Corelli's Mandolin: A Novel\\", but this novel is still strong and fun. This is a first class writer whose prodigious fictional writings could well deliver a worthy invitation to great award ceremonies - including an all expense paid trip to Oslo. He is that good."},{"Title":"Senor Vivo & the Coca Lord","review":"I purchased The Troublesome Offspring of Cardenal Guzm&aacute;n several years ago, not realizing it was part of a trilogy. I had just finished Captain Corelli's Mandolin and liked the author. Last year I found the first two, The War of Don Emmanuel's Nether Parts and Se&ntilde;or Vivo and the Coca Lords. I went through the three without stopping to take a breath and enjoyed Cardenal Guzman even more the second time!The author has a perfect pitch ear for Spanish rendered into perfect English. I could translate back into Spanish without missing a beat. His characters are all of Latin America and his mythical country extends from Mexico to Patagonia. His \\"magical realism\\" makes each of the stories more real and the characters deeper and more alive.I particularly like the way he takes on each of the components to the problem we live with: government corruption in Don Emmanuel, drug traficing in Se&ntilde;or Vivo and the heritage left us by the right wing Catholic Church. i only wonder why he calogs all Panamanians as prostitues. Each of the books stands on its own but together they are a masterpiece of writing.By the way BIRDS WITHOUT WINGS fell into my hands a few years ago and I could not put it down. I lost weight reading it because I didn't want to take time to eat."},{"Title":"Senor Vivo & the Coca Lord","review":"Having now read all three novels in the South American trilogy, I think Don Vivo is the best. It continues to flesh out the characters so beautifully crafted in the first book while containing more of the romance and heartbreak with a bit less of the magical realism of Don Emanuel. De Bernieres doesnt lose a step in terms of plot, characterization, tone, etc. He is, at this point, probably my favorite contemporary English writer. I haven't read anything of his more recent than Birds Without Wings, so he may have fallen off. However, all four novels of his that I have read have impressed me deeply, not only with his skills but with the consistency and strength of his voice. De Bernieres should be read by all, but in particular, by postadolescent young men."},{"Title":"Senor Vivo & the Coca Lord","review":"Very complex, creative and compelling. Gets you into the mindset of the time and place. Makes you want to say, &quot;why didn't I think of that&quot; when he brings it up a notch. De Bernieres understands what he is writing about. Love all his works."},{"Title":"Senor Vivo & the Coca Lord","review":"De Bernieres serves a lush yet chilling dish of quasi-myths and social tragedy. Beyond the chronicle of arduous love, through the wit and sadness of it all, you will see an outlandishly imaginative sketch of a triumphant human spirit. This story will entice you, intoxicate you, and then wake you like a razor-sharp blade."},{"Title":"Senor Vivo & the Coca Lord","review":"It is good, but I don't remember having to stop reading through horror before ( I'm not a horror reader). Starts charmingly and wittily in in a South American city dominated by a coca lord, opposed by a bumbling and innocent and very lucky reporter. The conflict continues to the end of the book. Other reviews say it builds to the climax of Snr Vivo (Vivo = alive!) and his confrontation with the Coca Lord. For me that was a damp squib compared to the brutal murder of a character which has been made real and attractive. After that point everything seems pretty flat - as I suppose it does for the main character. Captain Corelli's Mandolin has horrific moments, but it's pretty warm. Don't expect the same from this book. Sorry if I spoil it for anyone, but selling it under the same cover style gives no guide to the book."},{"Title":"Senor Vivo & the Coca Lord","review":"This book manages to make you laugh and cry, which can be pretty embarassing on the 4.20 from Waterloo. De Bernieres ability to create believable living characters in the space of a couple of pages and then to develop them logically into heinous villans or benign saints is remarkable."},{"Title":"Senor Vivo & the Coca Lord","review":"A novel that takes a familiar theme and turns it inside out, with the unique perspective of characters that defy usual clasification. It combines the empathy and identification of a thriller with the acute and painful observation of more thoughtful fiction. Alternately entertaining and shocking, it's a really gripping read"},{"Title":"Senor Vivo & the Coca Lord","review":"lived in our world...we could use a few like him.Dionisio Vivo (not his real name) is just a typical philosophy teacher in a typical high school in a small Andean town in a small Andean country. Then he writes a letter to the editor of the local newspaper, telling the local drug lord to put a stop to his dirty business....and life gets complicated for Dionisio.De Bernieres writes with great style, creates wonderful human characters who are just a touch over the top, and tells a tragic story with wit and humor."},{"Title":"Senor Vivo & the Coca Lord","review":"Another impressive book from De Bernieres, though I don't believe anything can match the magnificence of Captain Corelli's Mandolin. Scenes of tender devotion between Dio' and Anica jostle for space among farcial Presidential memos, the letters forming the coca crusade and, finally; descriptions of truly stomach-churning torture, in a narrative that hares off in a bewildering number of sub-plots. Initially rather bewildering, all threads are satisfactorily woven together and in the process, De Bernieres creates a host of engaging, if somewhat surreal, characters. Episodes of grisly violence alternate with teasing and banter and the novel succeeds as escapist entertainment as all works of fiction should. However, in the matter of fact accounts of Lazaro's death by fire and Anica's rape and mutiliation, De Bernieres reminds us that Latin America's drug wars are alive and well and exist outside of the pages of this first-rate novel."},{"Title":"Senor Vivo & the Coca Lord","review":"Writing in the mystical style of South American novelists, Louis de Bernieres creates a story that is hilarious and horrific, sadistic and sad, colorful, fantastic, illuminating, beautiful, mythical and brutal, tragi-comedy and allegorical love story of Columbia.Senor Vivo, professor of philosophy, unlikely adversary, and Everyman, finds himself the target of retaliation by the brutish drug lord, El Jerarca, who has moved into the area. Vivo's audacious acts of heroism, in the form of anonymous letters to the editor of the newspaper calling for the expulsion of the drug trade, have been exposed--by his own father. Such is life in this lawless South American country.His friend, policeman Ramon Dario, who invokes an ongoing series of philosophical commentaries on Dionisio's quest, urges him to save himself, but to no avail. Infused with myth and magic, the story of Lazaro moves in parallel toward each man's confrontation with El Jerarca.In this imaginary country, inept, corrupt government, debauched leaders, tangled bureaucracy, and ridiculous laws all fail the People. Women are routinely violated and gangsters lauded for their \\"good works.\\" Within the descriptive narration de Bernieres also comments on: the impact of American trash on ocean pollution, the vagaries of direct translation of slang, the corruption of Catholicism, patterns of promiscuity, and the impact of language on the social history of a country.Can this nation be saved? Dionisio and his female followers believe it can. If, as a reporter quotes at the end of the book, \\"Journalism is to a large extent responsible for the formation of our National Being,\\" then de Bernieres' is writing to us all."},{"Title":"Senor Vivo & the Coca Lord","review":"The hilarity continues. This trilogy starts with \\"The War of don Emmanuel's Nether Parts\\" and after Senor Vivo continues with \\"The Troublesome Offspring of Cardinal Guzman\\". Be sure to read them in order! Oh how I love the cats, and I'm NOT a cat person! This blend of fact, fiction, magical realism and social commentary is marvelously mixed with larger than life characters.The book's description above does a good job of introducing the book. This was extremely fun to read."},{"Title":"Senor Vivo & the Coca Lord","review":"Latin America has spent decades struggling to break the chains of residual colonialism. While North Americans can rejoice in casting off hereditary monarchy, Latin America has been gripped by a far stronger and enduring set of bonds - culture and tradition. When Spain ruled these lands, great haciendas, usually built on royal land grants, were ruled by titled aristocrats using armed vaqueros and the Church to maintain social quiet. Today, it's drug lords and paramilitary squads but the structure has changed little. While an established anti-establishment stable of writers in Latin America have mildly flourished [those that have survived], de Bernieres intrudes as an outsider to bring a fresh, vivid and disturbing view of this society. His imagination is boundless and his capacity to impart his visions is peerless.Vivo Dionisio is a philosophy teacher - young, vibrant and, of course, idealistic. He's also articulate, which leads him to pepper the great newspaper, La Prensa, with complaints about the drug lords. In particular, the local padrino, El Jerarca. An obtuse, obese, and overbearing man, he views Senor Vivo as a threat to his hegemony. Most powerful men in such societies can dominate the local police. Here, however El Jerarca must contend with a philosopher police chief, Ramon. While Ramon is powerless to deal with the drug czar, he is anything but submissive. He cheerfully retrieves the corpses El Jerarca's men leave in Dionisio's front yard, hoping to find a niche in the drug lord's armour. Dionisio may provide the key - if he survives.Dionisio, however, has many interests. Among the most demanding is his new-found love, Anica. Anica is the epitome of the spirited Latin lover - intense in all her interests, devoted to the man she loves, tragic in her desire to preserve and protect Dionisio. His response to her is almost a cliche of Latin American writing, but with a humanity rarely seen in such literature.De Bernieres portrayal of people and events is matchless. His novel approach, categorised by some as \\"magical realism\\", keeps this book lively, entertaining, but fraught with a need to expose injustice. His knowledge of Columbian society, with its many disparate elements, is vast. He weaves these many threads together in building a seamless tapestry of politics, magic, tradition and affection. Violence is a fundamental element, with all forced to contend with its pervasive role. Happiness is balanced by tragedy and grief in ways that leave the reader breathless. This is an admirable work, with black humour and deep ironies. Read it and enjoy the work of a writer of peerless prowess. [stephen a. haines - Ottawa, Canada]"},{"Title":"Senor Vivo & the Coca Lord","review":"Witty, sardonic, sarcastic and yet romantic: Louis de Bernieres parodies the magical realism of the Latin American greats, transforming what Nick Joaquin, Filipino counterpart of Gabriel Garcia Marquez, has baptized &quot;Tropical Gothic&quot; into a P.G. Wodehousesianesque barrel of laughs; and yet Bernieres can horrify and move you to tears -all in the same novel. His books go from strength to strength; a master storyteller by any set of criteria."},{"Title":"Senor Vivo & the Coca Lord","review":"Since first reviewing \\"Senor Vivo and the Coca Lord\\" for Amazon my opinion has changed substantially, and it is only fair to pass this on.I stand by my original thought that this book suffers from the post-modernity malaise: The author has brought together almost too many ideas, styles and techniques in the service of his agenda - at certain points these tend to obscure rather than clarify things. However, the depth of the message and the beauty of its expression have become clearer over time.The message is simultaneously uplifting and painful: There is a grim symbiosis that unites corrupt and stupid governments with drugs and arms dealers in a feeding frenzy that destroys not just people but civilisation itself. Love and justice can be victorious, but only the kind of love that has more to do with self-sacrifice than romance, and only the kind of justice that is prepared to confront evil regardless of the cost. It's a profound but painful truth that only that strange hybrid of Marxism and Christianity called \\"Liberation Theology\\" has succeeded in developing systematically.The book's principal stylistic flourish is \\"magical realism\\", a formula familiar to readers of Garcia Marquez and others. This piece of lit. crit. jargon means simply that magical events are an integral part of the plot, but, this being the world of po-mo, it only happens to make a point. In other words, the author does not require you to suspend disbelief as would be the case in a conventional magic story. This technique provides the opportunity for some of the book's most delicate and beautiful images, but on the downside it imposes a clumsy constraint on the author: He cannot narrate supernatural events directly and objectively - he has to do so in a subjective way from inside the head of one of his characters. This is not a criticism of the author - he executes this perceptual juggling with flawless technique. Rather, it is an indictment of the literary fashion that makes this sort of mannerism necessary. The self-distancing of the author from the world in which his characters live and move is unavoidably communicated to the reader, making it harder to engage with the characters or feel for them the way we would under the spell of a conventional narrative.In this literary framework, only appalling suffering can draw us into the intensity of feeling for the characters that is necessary for the device to work. The story starts off in a light, satirical vain that will raise genuine rueful smiles and in its erotic moments even perhaps mildly titillate. The only searching question is whether he can reign the po-mo mannerisms in for long enough at a time to keep the story flowing, but Louis writes such beautiful prose that it is a pleasure to read. Nevertheless, the feelgood factor of the earlier chapters cannot last, and quite quickly the book descends into a nightmare of depraved violence. Louis narrates rape, torture, mutilation and so on with exactly the kind of elegant simplicity you would expect, and after the good humour of the early chapters the result is almost unbearably shocking.I have some reservations as to whether even great literature should incorporate such graphic descriptions of sexual violence. I would certainly not wish to leave this book lying around the house where a young or impressionable person could be exposed to it. And in places Louis' literary technique almost gets the better of his artistic sensibility. Nevertheless, it stands as a remarkable achievement by a novelist of extraordinary gifts. If you are not afraid to laugh, cry and be sickened in one sitting, it is strongly recommended."},{"Title":"Senor Vivo & the Coca Lord","review":"I greatly admire this author and his work, but this is not a very good novel. It draws its stylistic inspiration from Latin American writers, most importantly Gabriel Garcia Marques, but is not as successful. It relies too much on an alien imagination, and too little on the true culture, history and mythology of Latin America. The result, especially with its graphically violent portrayal of the sufferings of the Coca lords' victims, is almost voyeuristic. It's certainly gratuitous in places. I also think that the blend of 'magic' realism with a conventional contemporary story does not work here."},{"Title":"Senor Vivo & the Coca Lord","review":"Magical Realism. Our book club was introduced to this new (for us) peculiarly Latin American literary form when we read Gabriel Garcia Marques's One Hundred Years of Solitude and later Saramago's The Cave. In the De Bernieres rendition, we get Magical Realism on steroids. The Result: Mixed Reviews. Love it or hate it, all of our readers agreed that the author rivals Rushdie in the use of \\"I'm smarter than you are\\" references. (I challenge anyone to understand half the references in this book without easy access to English and Spanish dictionaries, Wikepedia, and an eighty-year old shaman). Sure, when you get the inside joke, it can be really funny (I loved his calling the john an excusado), until you start thinking about all the stuff you are missing ( Do you know why he changes the character's name to Parmendies) . I'm sorry, but when I'm sitting on the beach with a paperback, I don't want to have stop at every other sentence to do Where's Waldo exercises on my laptop. After doing that more than a few times, the Reality for me was that the book lost much of its Magic."},{"Title":"Senor Vivo & the Coca Lord","review":"This series is not about Captain Corelli - but it is about hope, love, and destiny.

When Franklin Roosevelt was elected President, his confinement to a wheelchair prevented him from touring the country. It then became the job of his wife Eleanor to go out and do the visitations that the country expects the President to do.In many ways, Franklin and Eleanor were the perfect political couple. Both were children of privilege and yet each somehow managed to develop a strong sense of social justice. Because she was such a trailblazer and a role model for women in the world, Eleanor Roosevelt was most likely the most powerful American woman of the twentieth century. Her willingness to literally get her hands dirty won her admiration from working people all over the country. I still remember the political cartoon I read in a collection many years ago. Two black-faced men are deep in a coal mine and one of them turns his head and says, \\"My God! It's Eleanor Roosevelt!\\" The fact that the cartoon represented actual events is a tribute to her willingness to do what was necessary to succeed.Donnelly captures the determination, grace and intellect of Eleanor Roosevelt and puts her life and achievements in the proper perspective. Although not a great deal of time is spent on the sad events in her life, it is enough to demonstrate how Eleanor had to overcome a great deal of personal tragedy in order to succeed. The book is well written at the level of the middle school child, and is an inspiration to all girls who aspire to greatness. While it is easier for them to do it in modern times, role models are still needed and there are none better for young woman than Eleanor Roosevelt."},{"Title":"Eleanor Roosevelt (Heroes of America)","review":"I was so excited to get this book for my elementary students!

His later short stories tend to be about \\"manly men\\" who speak in a telscoped professional short hand about \\"manly things.\\" So, if you don't know much about firearms, ships, trains or cars circa 1900, some of the dialogue will seem a bit abstruse such as this bit from, \\"The Captive,\\" the lead story in this collection: \\"I presume you never heard tell of the Laughton-Zigler automatic two-inch field-gun, with self-feeding hopper, single oil-cylinder recoil, and ball-bearing gear throughout? Or Laughtite, the new explosive? Absolutely uniform in effect, and one-ninth the bulk of any present effete charge--flake, cannonite, cordite, troisdorf, cellulose, cocoa, cord, or prism--I don't care what it is. Laughtite's immense, so's the Zigler automatic.\\" Hmmm, maybe they are \\"immense,\\" but Kipling is right to presume. Anyway, \\"The Captive\\" is yet another, in an unlimited series, of Kipling's jingoistic puff-pieces defending the British Empire and allaying anyone's concern that the British aren't just the nicest, most understanding, understated and smartest chaps about, but also the most able too--even in the face of Laughtite and Zigler. This story is of some interest in that it is defending Britain's aggression in South Africa at the turn of the twentieth century, otherwise known as the Boer War, which bequeathed to the world one of the most emblematic of twentieth-century inventions: the concentration camp (or at least the label).The rest of the stories are a mixed lot of various cats and dogs. There's \\"The Bonds of Discipline,\\" featuring one of Kipling's recurring characters, the irascible seaman, Emanuel Pyecroft. In a very different vein from \\"The Captive,\\" this story demonstrates how the British are the nicest, most understanding, understated, smartest--oh, and ablest--chaps about in matching wits with the \\"Portugee,\\" as opposed to the Dutch Boer. Then there's \\"A Sahib's War,\\" also a very different story which concerns an Indian who travels with his British master to South Africa and there discovers that even Indians realize that the British are the nicest, most understanding, understated, smartest and ablest chaps about in matching wits with the Dutch Boer. Then, as a twist, there's another Pyecroft story, \\"Their Lawful Occasions,\\" concerning how some British may not be the nicest, most understanding, understated, smartest and ablest chaps when they try to match wits with other British--namely one Pyecroft and companions--who, in turn, really are the nicest, most understanding, understated, smartest and ablest chaps. The rest of the short stories are even more divergent than these.So, how does Kipling get three stars? Well, it's sort of like the question once posed to Andre Gide about who the greatest French poet was--the answer: \\"Victor Hugo, alas!\\" And who do you think is the greatest English short story writer? Sigh."},{"Title":"Wake up stupid","review":"Groucho Marx once invited the author, the San Francisco State college English professor Mark Harris, onto his late 1950's / early '60s TV quiz show \\"You Bet Your Life\\".

If you like Calvino you'll love &quot;Pascal&quot;. It's a very funny depiction of what happens when one (here, Pascal) tries to reinvent oneself and become something else. Like Calvino, it incorporates irreverent humour, mystery and wonderful descriptions. But Pirandello is more traditional in his prose than Calvino--so if your offset by Calvino's randomness, don't worry, Pirandello is more focused."},{"Title":"The late Mattia Pascal","review":"Italian author, winner of the Novel Prize in 1934, Luigi Pirandello is better known for his plays, forerunners of the theatre of the absurd. In this novel, the main character Mattia Pascal faces an economic downfall and a marriage without love. He decides to escape from this situation and in a stroke of luck wins a fortune in Monte Carlo. He takes a new identity, gains total freedom, shams death but the ghosts of his past existence, and the discovery of true love will spoil his new life.The plot is neatly constructed and the dialogues between Mattia Pascal and some of the characters are enlightening, expressing Pirandello's philosophical outlook on life as well as reflecting biographical elements. The author is concerned with the ambiguity of truth and reality, the problem of identity and illusion. For him self-identity only exists in relation to others, as much as man is a social creature, unfortunately bound to social conventions. Man creates his own reality and lives in a world of illusions, always bound one way or the other to the past. The resulting paradox is that illusion may often become more real than reality!Mattia Pascal is unable to cope with his total freedom which strucks him as being shapeless and aimless. Only the love he feels for Adriana will help him brake away from his suffocating mask. Upon returning to his former town he finds his wife has remarried and he is destined to become the shadow of a dead man.Pirandello held a pessimistic outlook on life, believeing that his time was one of distress and darkeness (early 20th century), democracy was nothing more than tyranny disguised as freedom, and philosophical speculations nothing more than a product of our imagination.\\"When death comes perpetual night will great us after the misty daylight of our illusion, or rather, we will be left to the mercy of Being, which will only have shattered the vain forms of our reasoning.\\""},{"Title":"The late Mattia Pascal","review":"This novel is about the identity of the individual, and the possibilities and limits of self-reinvention. By failing to transform himself into someone else, Mattia Pascal remains the same person, but radically changed from his experience. Oh, but it's not so complicated. Mattia Pascal is a good-for nothing- junior who, along with his also-spoiled brother, lose the fortune inherited from their father. Besides losing his fortune, Mattia is forced to make a disastrous marriage. And then, along comes a big and most unexpected chance to run away and become someone else. I won't spoil anything. Just read it and you will find an amazing story. Pirandello's writing is easy. The introduction to the real knot of the story is a little long, but it is absolutely necessary to situate the plot, and moreover, it is very funny. Pirandello's style fluctuates between irreverent and outrageous irony, and melancholic reflections on fate, identity and man's place in the world. Far from being boring, it has extremely funny moments of dark humor (check his confrontations with his mother-in-law). So, it is an extremely recommendable book, because it is intelligent humor with a reflection on life. If you really get to love the story, as I did, you'll end up asking to yourself: &quot;Who the hell am I?&quot;."},{"Title":"The late Mattia Pascal","review":"Okay, so that may sound awfully obvious, but my goodness! Of course it's not funny! It's not supposed to be funny! When is Pirandello ever funny? If anything, he may be ironic, but he is never slapstick and certainly wrote nothing to be considered \\"a lark.\\" The author of the article in Publisher's Weekly ought to be taken out and shot in the most General Dreedle sense of the term. Il Fu Mattia Pascal is anything but a beach read and if you were disappointed in it because it was not cheap entertainment, your disappointment is probably due to the misinformation you received from a review as miscomprehending as that of Publisher's Weekly. Il Fu is an examination of the modern treatment of identity. It is an existential examination of society's abandonment of those who seek to live an \\"authentic\\" life. It is a piece of LITERATURE, not a DaVinci Code or a Mary Higgins Clark mystery. These may be enjoyable books, but for a different reason.

We must have read two different books. I read Pscal at fourteen and I found nothing funny in it. All I found was a hardly decent, terribly slow story, told in the usual boring language so dear to Italian novelists (I read it in Italian, by the way... Maybe the translator did Pirandello a great service, who knows?). It is a book that lacks life entirely. Although the story is plausible, there is no oxigen in it. Besides, it repeats pirandello's themes over and over again. OK, we know, according to him it is impossible for a man to know himself and not to have less than ten personalities at a time. We have heard this song over and over again! I mean, Pirandello dissected the same bloody theme for at least a thousands times. Why the hell couldn't he explore other themes and dilemmas as well?

Barrie's \\"A Kiss for Cinderella\\" opened on Broadway in December 1916 and ran for 152 performances through May 1917. Maude Adams (clearly different from Maud Adams from the James Bond film \\"Octopussy\\") played the lead as Miss Thing. The play was revived in March 1942 at the Music Box Theatre with Luise Rainer who had won Best Actress Oscars for \\"The Great Ziegfeld\\" in 1936 and \\"The Good Earth\\" in 1937 as Miss Thing.The first of three acts follows Miss Thing or Cinderella, who is a domestic that works for Mr. Bodie. The play is set during wartime with Germany. Cinderella lacks education, but is immensely practical and efficient with household tasks. We discover that she has a mysterious penchant for lifting boards and taking them away for her own usage, which brings an inquiry from the police.The second act takes us to Cinderella's flat. She has many ideas about herself that parallel the story of Cinderella, such as a special pair of glass slippers and an unusual amount of attention paid to her feet. The boxes use becomes apparent as we learn that Cinderella has fondness for wartime orphans who need care. The policeman follows her to her flat and becomes invited for tea and a celebration. In Cinderella's mind as she sits outside her flat in the cold, her fairy godmother appears. We are treated to the lavish spectacle of a ball complete with a prince who looks a lot like the policeman.The third act opens at the country practice of Dr. Bodie, Mr. Bodie's sister. After almost freezing, Cinderella is taken there for recuperation. Cinderella has a special rapport with all the recuperating soldiers and the nursing staff. The story ends with her real-life Prince Charming, aka the policeman, proposing to the frail Cinderella.Barrie's play is an interesting script that uses the fairy tale as a starting point. It's light romantic fantasy. Staging would be fairly complex with four different sets and a large cast. I enjoyed reading the play; although it would be difficult to produce, perhaps not worth the bang for the buck. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"A Kiss for Cinderella","review":"\\"The Plays of J.M. Barrie\\" is a wonderful volume, my copy dated 1928. It contains 20 plays from 1901 on, including the first act of his unfinished play \\"Shall We Join the Ladies?\\" Barrie's stage directions are so replete, injecting mood and character insights, that they make the play from the page seem more than just a theatrical recipe for performance. Of course, \\"Peter Pan\\" is his most well-known work, a classic with fantasy and fancy. I had read that Barrie was only 5'3\\" tall. Whether that shaped his sense of observation on the world, he certainly sees things in a unique manner. His classic ghost play \\"Mary Rose\\" is performed less than Pan, but is also haunting in the story's setup and the way it unfolds in a paranormal way. I confess it took me quite a while to get through the 871 pages, but I did love the short play \\"The Lady Shows Her Medals\\" which relates the tale of Mrs. Dowey who so wants to have something to talk proudly about to the other charwomen (maids) that she \\"adopts\\" a soldier with the same last name and brags about him as her son. This of course gets complicated when he shows up in London on leave from the war and is directed to the residence of his \\"mother\\" he did not know he had. \\"Quality Street\\" is also an excellent romantic play. \\"The Admirable Chrichton\\" from 1903 is sometimes still performed about a group of British people stranded on a tropical island and the comic rules of society they set up. Barrie is a master playwright, one whose entire catalog still needs to be seen. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Low man on a totem pole","review":"Low Man On A Totem Pole, H.

Maybe today isn't really different from all the other days in all the other years. As I read this book today, though, it speaks directly to today's triumphs of self-serving word-play over honesty and sanity.Lessing's point is scarcely exaggeration: the intangible faculty of reason is subject to contagious disease, just as the physical body is. The first part of this book is a case study of a particularly acute and severe attack of rhetoric. Though not scientific, it gives enough detail for you to recognize the ailment when you see it yourself (and you will). Except for the details of topic, that poor sufferer's rantings could have come from yesterday's TV news.Although I found the first half of this book very strong and clear, I felt that it weakened towards the end. The trial, prosecution of a culture instead of a person, barely sustained the thesis. I found the final passages of the book frankly disappointing, given its promising start.In spite of the book's weaknesses, I find it very worthwhile. I will probably find it worthwhile and up to date when I read it again, years from now - although timely, this topic is timeless. Even more, it makes a satisfying companion to Lessing's other 'Canopus' books. I recommend it.//wiredweird"},{"Title":"The Grizzly Book","review":"\\"A Gallery Of Outlaw Grizzlies\\" by W.P. Hubbard (pages 160-208) is the most interesting chapter in this book that highlights historical grizzly bears of the late 1800s to the early 1900s killing large numbers of cattle and sheep of pioneer ranchers for spans of years; these bears showed surprising intelligence in observing, evading, and attacking pursuing human hunters; the bears were killed in tremendously violent and dramatic encounters sometimes by people who were actually not actively hunting the bears and were doing other activities. The various chapters describe early historical experiences with grizzly bears, bear attacks on people throughout history, hunters' views-experiences, the bears' surprising activity at night, and the view that the plains grizzly bear of the distant past was larger from the abundance of buffalo meat and shorter hibernation periods than the modern grizzly bear."},{"Title":"Aircraft Performance & Design","review":"Any student who has read through this textbook and tried to understand the derivations and derive the equations presented will realize that Anderson's forte is history more than engineering. The text is well written and interesting to read since Anderson gives a good historical background to each concept but Anderson's explanations are sometimes questionable and there are many conceptual and formula errors. The book does have good figures and presents a lot of good data but for students trying to learn aircraft performance for the first time, there are better textbooks out there. I am currently a PhD student in Aerospace Engineering at Georgia Tech studying for the qualifying exam. I was studying from this textbook but found that it was difficult to master the concepts to my professor's expectations based on what Anderson has presented. I recently aquired &quot;Mechanics of Flight&quot; by Warren Phillips which is much better at presenting the same material and is much more exhaustively researched from an analytical point of view. It is also much cheaper with twice the content so I would recommend it over Anderson's &quot;Aircraft Performance and Design.&quot;"},{"Title":"Aircraft Performance & Design","review":"This is an excellent book and can be used as a continuation of Introduction to Flight by the same author. This book focuses on airplane design and performance, but also gives a very clear introduction to propulsion and aerodynamics of airplanes. I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in airplane design, as well as Daniel Raymer's book Aircraft Design: A Conceptual Approach. Both books I found to be extremely interesting and written in clear, easy to understand language.This book was used in an upper level Aircraft Performance and Dynamics class that I recently took. I also found this book very helpful in my Aircraft Design class and my Aircraft Propulsion class. In short, a student of aeronautical engineering couldn't ask for a more well rounded book on aircraft design--covering all the aforementioned topics.If only all engineering textbooks were so well written!"},{"Title":"Aircraft Performance & Design","review":"This was the first book dedicated to aircraft performance that I bought, back in 2001, and I think it presented the topics in a clear fashion.

Not the kind of winner who twists off a bottle cap to discover they just won a free iTunes download, but the kind of person whose life demonstrates a remarkable sense of spiritual victory.In LOSERS AND WINNERS, SAINTS AND SINNERS, pastor Greg Laurie asks some rather deep questions about what it means to live a truly successful life.What are the secrets to spiritual longevity?How can you ensure you will cross the finish line?How can you know if you will hear the Lord say, \\"Well done, good and faithful servant\\"?Laurie writes, \\"We should all be asking these questions because one day every one of us will complete this race we are running. And each of us will be either a winner or a loser. One day, we all are going to die.\\"To answer such deep, life-reflective questions, Laurie examines the lives of key figures from the Bible. In many ways, this book reads more like a series of sermons --- often complete with two, three, and four point messages --- than a typical nonfiction book, but the project is organized well enough to pull off the sometimes bumpy transitions between chapters.One of the title's greatest strengths is its focus on Biblical characters. Laurie takes a look at the life of King Saul and Samson, people who started well in their spiritual race only to stumble and never fully recover. It follows the lives of such men as David, Elijah and Elisha to demonstrate that just because you fall doesn't mean you have to stay down. And it takes a look at Joseph as one who stayed strong throughout his life journeyThe story of Paul demonstrates that even the most unlikely of candidates can make a significant change in their spiritual life, while the life of Peter teaches us that even our blunders are not above redemption. Meanwhile, Moses teaches us that it's never too late for God to do something miraculous. Stories of Caleb, Enoch and Ananias also fill the text.As Laurie follows each character's journey, he adds in anecdotes, stories and quotes from a variety of modern day and historical believers to tie the text together. The result is an enjoyable read. One of the strengths of highlighting the lives of so many Biblical people is that the book at times works as a kind of overview of the Bible --- making scriptural principles accessible through memorable stories.If the title of the book seems familiar, it's because it's taken from the popular worship song, \\"And We All Bow Down\\" by Lenny LeBlanc and recorded by Integrity's Hosanna! Music. It's a nice tie-in and reminder of the worship tune, even if you don't \\"win\\" a free download the next time you buy a soda that's having a sweepstakes.Whether you're starting out in life or looking to finish strong, LOSERS AND WINNERS, SAINTS AND SINNERS is a helpful, biblically-based book worth reading.

I can't say I don't have any pain anymore, but I can say it has greatly reduced, and improving.There is little text in this book, dealing mostly with how you should do the repetitions and how to avoid further injury, then it is right ot the action with the diagrams and instructions for every exercise.If you have an RSI try this book, and also check for your posture while working, seating, and standing.

(Also, I just found out that Sharon Butler has a web site: http://www.selfcare4rsi.com. I'm definitely going to check it out.)This book presents information on RSIs not found elsewhere. It begins with a concise but thorough discussion of the role of fascia in the development of RSIs. From my personal experience with over a dozen MDs, many doctors, even hand specialists, don't understand the role of fascia in these injuries. As a result, despite their good intentions, they can't effectively help many RSI sufferers. Neither can many well-intentioned physical therapists.Also, never before had I heard of the concept of the &quot;stretch point,&quot; which is the secret of success for this program. I suspect that people who don't get results with this program have not applied this concept but are stretching too hard and fast, only worsening their symptoms.Besides helping you figure out which stretches to do for your symptoms, there's a &quot;Prevention by Profession&quot; section that lists various professions and the suggested stretches to do for them.

My doctors turned out to be fear mongers, so I declined their invasive tests and surgeries and have focused my efforts on supporting my body's natural healing process. Although the healing rate seems to be less than 1% improvement per day on average, I would encourage anyone with similar symptoms to treat this problem conservatively.This book has an interesting high-level discussion of fascia. It is primarily a book of drawings which depict various stretches, and an organization which allows you to choose the stretches most appropriate to your injury. I found a couple of the stretches useful, but have found plenty of other useful stretches on the Internet and in other books which are not covered here. It also has a discussion of ergonomics which is fairly typical of other texts.I am convinced that my injury is primarily acute tendinitis followed by chronic tendinosis. I have spent a tremendous amount of time studying tendon injuries partly by reading medical textbooks. One of the primary reasons for stretching tendons is that it stimulates proper healing and strengthening for a variety of reasons, not just to free up fascia. It would be nice if this book contained more background information about tendons in addition to the discussion of fascia.Another interesting aspect of my condition is the fact that I have had cramping and inflammation which lead to poor circulation and healing. I have found that both hot and cold therapy as well as massage are instrumental in the healing process. I perform all of these things by myself most of the time, with a little help from friends occasionally. This book really doesn't address these issues, so I'd also recommend exploring some books on massage and trigger point therapy."},{"Title":"Conquering Carpal Tunnel Syndrome and Other Repetitive Strain Injuries: A Self-Care Program","review":"I am a technical writer and have been working at a computer daily for almost twenty years.

I couldn't open a door, fasten a button, hold a pen, hold playing cards or even hold my toddler when she asked for me to pick her up. I had been on the point of launching a business as a textile artist, focusing on medieval style embroidery, yet could no longer hold a needle. I was devastated.I searched on Amazon for anything and everything that might ease carpal tunnel syndrome and found this book. At the time I was skeptical about the potential for mere stretching to fix my problem, but I was so desperate that I tried it. After one session - just one - in which I only did roughly 50% of the stretches, concentrating on the upper body for my first try - I noticed that for the first time in months I did not wake from sleep multiple times in the night due to numbness and/or pins and needles in either or both hands. I also found on the following day that the symptoms were now no longer constant, but merely reactive to activity and stress. This was incredible for only one session.I carried on stretching daily, now incorporating into my routine all of the stretches listed for upper body, forearms, wrists, fingers and thumbs. It was time consuming but _totally_ worth it.Yesterday I had an appointment for nerve conduction study, which was booked before I started stretching. I had now been stretching for two weeks. The doctor found no evidence of damage or even irritation to any of the nerves in my hands and wrist, especially the median nerve. I told him about the stretches I'd been doing and about the dramatic - almost unnervingly so, no pun intended - improvements and he told me that it is undoubtedly this stretching that has turned my condition around. He told me to keep doing it, because it will keep me away from surgery and preserve my ability to engage in the creative pursuits that I love.I'm elated and will keep stretching from now on, treating any hobby or work task that requires intensive hand use as I would treat a marathon, carefully stretching before and after. I will still wear night splints, but that's a small thing compared to the loss of all my hobbies and my fledgling business!I just wish I could give the author a hug. A really big hug.

I began using splints at night early on (my suggestion is don't make them too tight). Then a couple months ago I began decreasing the use of my wrists (staying off the computer as much as possible except for work) and icing (after computer use and exercise). My symptoms continued to increase. A few weeks ago I became desperate (but not enough to see a physician). The pain and numbness was getting worse and would flare up with any activity. I didn't like where this was headed. A couple weeks ago I began taking B6, Advil (sporadically), using Arnica topical (1-3 times a day)and doing the exercises (throughout the day)found in this book. I can't say for sure what worked. Splints? Delayed effect from rest and ice? B6? Advil? Arnica? the exercises? or a combination of all of the above? For the last week my symptoms have decreased. I plan to keep up this regimen and hope to have decreasing symptoms. This book is simple but don't knock it until you try it. I would give the book 5 stars if I was sure the exercises where a major cause of my decreased symptoms."},{"Title":"Conquering Carpal Tunnel Syndrome and Other Repetitive Strain Injuries: A Self-Care Program","review":"As a massage therapist for the last 16 years I have used this book almost continuously in my practice. I often recommend that clients purchase their own copy. The explanations and exercises in this book are easy to understand even for a lay person. Any one who suffers from RSI will benefit from the stretches. I use them myself throughout the day in between my clients. They are easy to preform and can be done almost anywhere. I suggest that clients do them at their desks during the day to relieve symptoms. GREAT book, still applicable after all these years!"},{"Title":"Conquering Carpal Tunnel Syndrome and Other Repetitive Strain Injuries: A Self-Care Program","review":"The stretches in this book take a while to take effect, but I have finally found some relief.

It is nicely written, has good illustrations, and if it works, it will be fantastic! I recommend trying it."},{"Title":"Conquering Carpal Tunnel Syndrome and Other Repetitive Strain Injuries: A Self-Care Program","review":"I'm a computer geek, having been typing for over 20 years, and also a drummer, so I have been prone to carpal tunnel symptoms for a very long time. Suddenly I went through a terrible ordeal with bilateral carpal tunnel symptoms; terrible pain around the clock in both arms (from the shoulders to finger tips). I was beside myself in pain and was really panicking since I could barely function in the office or at home. Pain killers did not work so it was very frightening and starting to cause depression.I was forced to get very educated on the subject quickly and found the majority of information on the Internet on how to combat this problem is absolutely FALSE, including vitamins, massages, chiropractors, wrist braces, wrist wrests, and even surgery in many cases. I tried all of these (aside from the surgery) and actually got worse. All it took was finding this ONE book on proper stretching exercises, and I went from 0% to 95% improvement in just 10 days. If you have carpal tunnel symptoms, drop everything and get this book!No wonder doctors don't mention this solution; it would put them out of business! The Internet seems filled with websites saying to take B-vitamins etc, but most claim you won't see results for up to 3 MONTHS? Yet vitamin testimonials are difficult to find on the Internet at the same time which is odd. Complete nonsense if you ask me; I took B-vitamins faithfully for a month, at the correct dosages and you'd think I'd see SOME improvement, but I only got worse. Wrist braces may help prevent further aggravation while sleeping, but they do not fix the underlying problem! I tried the chiropractor which did nothing, and massages of the forearms absolutely KILLED me the following day.With this book, simply just follow the exercises VERY gently and slowly. If any pain is felt, don't do that particular exercise and move on to others. There is no set schedule on how often to do the exercises, so I chose to do them morning and evening (took me about an hour each time). At first you may feel like you don't want to do them, like they may do you more harm. For example, doing exercises to bend your wrist backward when you have painful carpal tunnel symptoms, just seems like a bad idea and is uncomfortable to do and your initial gut feeling may be to stop. Again, if you do them VERY gently and softly and stop the exercises just before the pain threshold hits, THIS is what cures the problem. Every day you will go farther and farther this way.I am shocked out how much misinformation there is on the Internet on this topic. This book was all I needed. However I did also use the product called the \\"Carpal Solution\\" at mycarpaltunnel.com while I slept. I am convinced this helped as well. It basically pulls the lower, fatty parts of the palm apart slightly while you sleep, allowing the median nerve to breath a bit, and heal faster. Great concept and I recommend it, but it is this book I am writing a review on that is most essential.Note the book \\"It's not Carpal Tunnel Syndrome\\" also found on Amazon also had some really good info on things to do. I think the ergonomic info was most helpful. After getting so educated on carpal tunnel syndrome, I am convinced poor ergonomics while sitting at my computer (and on my drums) was the source of the problem. You MUST sit up straight at the computer, use a keyboard tray, and do NOT use arm wrests on your chair, and do NOT use a keyboard cushion, and do NOT lean your body forward and wrest your arms on a table as you type, or against the tables edge while typing. That was my whole problem. Elbows MUST be at your sides as you type, and NOT leaning on anything. Follow these guidelines and also using the exercises in this book, you will be set. I will continue to do these exercises for the rest of my life - they feel good and are the right thing to do as you get older. You have to offset all hand/finger/wrist activity on a daily basis with stretches, period. Hope this helps!P.S. I did seriously consider carpal tunnel surgery as a last resort, as a few people I know had success with it. However, come to find out, carpal tunnel surgery does not have a big success rate overall, or it may only help temporarily. This is because carpal tunnel syndrome in most cases originates in the neck, shoulders and chest (pinched nerves), where pain then travels to the hands. In this case the surgery often doesn't work or only provides temporary relief because the source of the problem is actually elsewhere in the body. Once I found this book on proper stretching and saw the results, I realized surgery is not needed.UPDATE: Now 3 months later, my carpal tunnel symptoms are still gone and I can do everyday tasks normally. Though if I type for a long time, my hands do get a bit achy. In that case, I pull out the exercises from this book and do them and I always feel much better. One solution I found in the meantime to lessen my typing is software called \\"Dragon Dictate\\" which allows me to dictate everything and the computer writes for me. Worth every penny and saves SO much stress on my hands so that I don't have to do the exercises as much."},{"Title":"Conquering Carpal Tunnel Syndrome and Other Repetitive Strain Injuries: A Self-Care Program","review":"First I would like to say that Sharon Butler's description of how to stretch gently and effectively is fabulous - her book is probably the best resource for stretching available and I actually think everyone who uses a computer should have this book. It is incredible for prevention I think, healing up to a point, and for body awareness in general.However...I want to warn that if you are injured so severely to where you actually can't function (like I was) these stretches are probably not going to be what you need at first & you might be misled into thinking they will cure you. I think that to truly heal yourself from this kind of malady there are two other books that I would say are REQUIRED reading along with this one (ideally, I would recommend reading all 3 at the same time):IT'S NOT CARPAL TUNNEL SYNDROME! by Suparna Damany and Jack Bellis - to understand the problem from many different angles andTHE TRIGGER POINT THERAPY WORKBOOK by Clair Davies. This book is amazing! Absolutely amazing because it shows you exactly how to get rid of these things called trigger points (yourself) which are usually at the root of MUCH of the pain and dysfunction of RSI's and Carpal Tunnel. He even says that if you have active trigger points, stretching of any kind can actually do more harm than good. I found this to be true, and it looks like some other readers have as well.Once you have those other two books, Sharon Butler's would be the 3rd I'd recommend (and I think it is essential). I also at a certain point got her online book for healing the thumb injury called DeQuervain's (she has a 6-week stretching program aimed at different injuries) and I thought it was even better for me than CCTS because it was geared towards my particular unremitting problem.Oh, be warned that if you do get one of her online book one of your first assignments in the program is to order a particular CD. Some might find this irksome, having just purchased a book - but mostly I was just glad to be given such a good program for stretching. I do recommend both this book as well as her online programs.Well, good luck. Take this SERIOUSLY and save your hands. Go to Barnes and Noble and look through these books there if you're not ready to buy them - but INFORM yourself from all angles because otherwise this can become an incredibly serious problem."},{"Title":"Conquering Carpal Tunnel Syndrome and Other Repetitive Strain Injuries: A Self-Care Program","review":"Carpal Tunnel and related stress injuries struck me in mid-August and left me practically helpless for nearly 3 months. After 3 days of doing the stretching exercises in Butler's book, I was back to doing simple activities and completely off the high dosages of anti-inflammatories recommended by my doctor. I cannot recommend this book too highly. The exercises are super simple and can be done throughout the day whenever you have a moment - in front of the TV, while laying in bed, in the car at a stoplight. The exercises deal with the entire upper body, including arms and wrists. You can choose those appropriate to you and your activities. If you are not sure, Butler has a list of which exercises apply to certain lines of work. An excellent - and inexpensive - book."},{"Title":"Conquering Carpal Tunnel Syndrome and Other Repetitive Strain Injuries: A Self-Care Program","review":"Sharon Butler's book is a vital resource in a sea of misinformation about RSIs. (My personal experience at the end.)She clearly explains causes and effects of syndromes like Carpal Tunnel, and how to move and hold your body to prevent injury and reduce symptoms. The book begins with an excellent description of fascia (connective tissue), how it gets stuck, how it contributes to pain and numbness and how to stretch and 'release' it, to free you from pain. Then, there are exercises: how when, how often to do them and who needs them, depending on where you are 'stuck.' Rather than just doing all of the exercises in the book, you are encouraged to pick ones that correspond to your injury, your profession, or the places you feel pain.I don't believe in the 'quick fix.' It takes time to re-train your body, but it can be done and Sharon has the key. If you don't follow her advice, you overdo an exercise, you could delay relief.My experience sounds like many others, but longer-term. I first had symptoms of CTS in 1992. I was given matching wrist support braces by my then Dr. I was in my early 20s, and told to expect to be on disability (SSI) for the rest of my life. I found Sharon Butler, who taught me how to care for my own injury. Now, I'm 42, symptom-free, because I do her exercises every day."},{"Title":"Conquering Carpal Tunnel Syndrome and Other Repetitive Strain Injuries: A Self-Care Program","review":"I wouldn't have bought this book if I had had a chance to look at it, since it uses words like &quot;bodywork&quot;, which turn my stomach, and has a somewhat new-age-y tone which repels my mind. But as it turns out, I bought it sight unseen from Amazon, and thought I'd try it out. I had started experiencing RSI symptoms about a month earlier. One evening I picked up the Butler book and did a few of the exercises. The next morning I woke up without pain in my forearms for the first time in several weeks. I still have some symptoms which these exercsises have not (yet?) alleviated, but it's definitely alleviated some, and perhaps prevented others from getting worse. The exercises are easy and non-stressful (physically or mentally). Even I -- who ordinarily hate physical exercise of any kind -- enjoy them.END"},{"Title":"Conquering Carpal Tunnel Syndrome and Other Repetitive Strain Injuries: A Self-Care Program","review":"The good: The exercises are categorized and easy to understand.

It recently got worse after she fell off her bike and broke a couple of bones in the same wrist. The bones have healed, but the accident somehow increased the CTS symptoms: tingling sensations, numbness and a general increase in CTS aggravation. She has found this book, Conquering CTS, informative and helpful. After reading it and doing the excercises, for about a month now, she has found that not all the exercises suit her particular condition. So, she has, through trial and error, found which excercises in the book are helpful. They work, and help relieve the sypmtoms. So, I would recommend this book to anyone who has CTS. It is not a cure-all, in my wife's case, but it has made a difference.

The relief was dramatic. Most of my pain was gone after I did the exercises, and only partially returned the following day.

You don't have to do all of the exercises in the book; I do 10 of them, and those ten take up 7 minutes daily. Not a big price to pay for avoiding carpal tunnel syndrome! There are other things you can do to prevent or reduce CTS, like taking a B-complex vitamin supplement daily. I take 25 mg a day; 50 mg is also fine. Don't buy the extended-release forms---they can cause liver damage. Taking vitamin B6 alone may also help, but don't take more than 100 mg/day for extended periods, because you could wind up with even more nerve damage than before.

With these exercises and a hand brace when sleeping, pain at night went away. But if I forget to do the exercises on one day, I paid for it the next day through pain and decreased range of motion; therefore I know they were helpful. The carpal tunnel and subsequent inability to write or draw with my right hand did not all go away after several months of doing the exercises, however, just improved. Perhaps I should have done them more often. Be careful when you do them - she is not kidding when she says go GENTLY. More force is worse.) The truth is I only fleetingly do them now, though, since I have found more complete help elsewhere.One might need to consider some underlying health issues which no amount of exercise will cure. Could you be hypothyroid? The blood tests are -as I personally found out - not always accurate. Synthetic thyroid - as I also found out - may not help nearly as much as natural thyroid. If you have a thyroid problem, quite likely your adrenals are weak and the blood tests for them are also not yet perfected. You may find it helpful to get a doctor who will let you do urine testing. You may need more estrogen and/or progesterone if you are a gal. Etc. Etc. I found the Stop The Thyroid Madness website to be a huuuuge help. With that info, ergonomics and massage - especially for trigger points - and medical and supplement changes (just because supplements are in a health food store that doesn't mean they are necessarily working as vitamin and mineral blood testing may reveal) I am now starting to draw and write again so far without that \\"tingly\\" feeling at night and without medication or surgery. Prayer was the biggest help of all, though. So much info out there...but how is one to know which of it is right...?9/28/11 Edit. And my prayers were answered! I found out about a machine called a Sota Magnetic Pulser. It is used to do things like help with muscle pain and cleanse out the lymphatic glands. It occured to me to try it on my wrist. I placed my wrist down on it, rather than vice versa because it is a bit heavy and those bones are small there, and I pulsed every night for 5 - 10 minutes. (It feels like virtually nothing is happening. In a couple of days I could draw for an hour w/o that tingly feeling. In a couple of weeks I could, and do, draw for hours (though I do take stretch breaks every hour or so) with no CTS at all!I also used to have CTS problems with much use of the computer keyboard but not any more.Now I also lie flat on my back when sleeping, what is called the corpse position in Yoga, which I don't like at all but I've gotten used to it. When I draw I use a little mini easel to keep my hand in a position pointed pretty much toward the cieling. No matter what else I do though, aspirin, ergonomics, whatever - if I stop using the Pulser the pain comes back. I have no financial connection to that company btw.

I bought the spiral-bound volume, which comes to 350 pages of Houston's built environment.Now, I will have to admit that Houston is not the most beautiful city, and its reputation for architectural preservation is abysmal, but for those of you adventuresome enough to look at what a modern-day boom town looks like, this is the best possible book. It is very, very good.First of all, the catalog is about as comprehensive as one can possibly expect in 350 pages: There are 1,000 entries in this book. The coverage is limited to the VAST city limits of Houston, the contained Villages, and a few very short excursions into the suburbs. Sugar Land, Katy, Woodlands... you'll have to wait for the next edition!Houston is a huge city with many beautiful buildings, but they're so spread out, and there's so much transient schlock in between that it's easy to miss them entirely. Downtown, Midtown and the Museum District are packed with architectural treasures, and this book will guide you right to them. If you're looking for residential excellence, it's in River Oaks, The Heights, Mid-Westheimer, Hedwig, Hunters Creek and West University Place but, once again, you'll need a car with lots of gas to get to these places. Also, some of those places are thinly covered. In this land of BIG, we want more! More modern skyscrapers, more historic sites, more residential coverage in West U, Bellaire and the Mid-Westheimer Villages!Houston is not unique in its relative disregard for historic structures, but attitudes toward preservation are beginning to change. That makes this guide all the more important and useful. No, Cram, Watkins, Finn, Staub, Lemmon and SOM do NOT get their due in this book, and a new edition should expand on the sites. In my opinion, the survey of Staub show be absolutely exhaustive. Every Staub structure should be included in a book like this. Houston is his city. We should capture every one of his existing buildings.This is the best architecture guide you're going to find for Houston, but we're all hoping for a THIRD edition! So much has changed since 1999."},{"Title":"HOUSTON ARCHITECTURAL GUIDE SECOND EDITION","review":"Most people, even Houstonians, are not aware that Houston has some of the most interesting urban architecture in the country. Unfortunately while individual buildings are interesting, even exciting, it is mostly a case of the total picture being less than the sum of the parts. This is by far the best book on individual buildings. Fox takes the reader on a tour area by area. Houston is a huge city geographically, and the book is correspondingly large, while being small enough to tote on a walking tour. He examines not only the prize winning commercial buildings (e.g., Johnson's Penzoil building -- a modernist icon), but various public and university buildings as well as individual homes. . Fox writes well (he is the best writer-expert on Houston architecture) and the pictures, while small, are well done. Three negatives: the book is old enough so that some recent buildings are not included, it is out of print (although readily available from used vendors), and descriptions of individual buildings are sometimes frustratingly short.

Such a nonsense! The idea that the universe was created by a random explosion tells us more about the kind of society we live in, than about the Universe itself. Explosions create chaos and noise, not order and information.This interesting book comes to show that far from having the qualities and characteristics that one would obviously expect from a casual, accidental and random process, the universe seems to have been fine-tuned for life, and not only for life but also for intelligent and inquiring life.Although the holes in the Big Bang theory have been increasing in the recent decades, undermining its status as a ruling paradigm, it is interesting to see that the results we get from macro-observations mimics the results we get from micro-observations. Also life has the highly specified complexity we normally and instinctively associate with information and intelligence.That's why many astrophysicists and biologists, even atheists, speak of the \\"antropic principle\\", of \\"antropic coincidences\\", \\"designoids\\" \\"appearance of design\\", etc. They use words like \\"code\\", \\"words\\", \\"translation\\", \\"transcription\\", etc., because the vocabulary of randomness and accident is manifestly insufficient to describe what they see in nature.In spite of all this, many try hard to show that that although appearance of design and fine-tuning is overwhelming, it is all the result of a big explosion of primordial nothingness. The problem with this understanding, is that it simply doesn't fit the observable evidence. Empirical data doesn't speak about randomness. Pretending it does is like running against the wind.If science is about what can be observed, than it is about information and design, because both can be empirically detected and measured. That's why creationism (in its various shapes and sizes) is here to stay. It simply is more scientific than a pure naturalistic and materialistic definition of \\"science\\".Of course all this has religious and philosophical implications, but so does any approach to science. All science necessarily relies on assumptions about the totality of what is. There are many conceptions of science, all with their own overt or covert assumptions.The authors try to find a third way between naturalism and biblical creationism, although I think that we have no choice but to embrace biblical creationism if we can get a consistent interpretation of all empirical, theological, moral and social data available.Naturalism and biblical creationism, both very different from the position adopted by the authors of this book, rely on different conceptions of science.Naturalism will never have absolute certainty of the truth, in spite of all the accumulated data, because data never ceases to accumulate. Naturalism is based on human observation and extrapolation, but observations are limited and many different models can be built on the same observations. We will never be able to know for sure that we have embraced the true model. Besides, naturalism will always have problems with evidence of design in nature and lack of transitional evidence of evolution.Biblical creationism, on the other hand, will always have confidence in absolute Truth, in spite of occasional difficulties with data. It is ultimately based in Revelation given by the One who IS and observes all there is to observe. Biblical Creationism is based on the Words of the One who is the Alpha and Omega. It confidently asserts and predicts that all empirical evidence will ultimately fit the pre-given account of reality, given in the Bible, like the pieces of a big puzzle that will fit to a pre-given picture. This will ultimately be testable. Biblical creationism will be perfectly comfortable with evidence of design and with lack of transitional evidence of evolution.Naturalism and creationism rely on different assumptions and epistemologies, but their accuracy can be measured against the real world. One thing we can say for sure: as far as we know, there is no such thing as a religiously neutral concept of science."},{"Title":"The Privileged Planet: How Our Place in the Cosmos is Designed for Discovery","review":"This books works on the eternal question: Are we alone in the Universe.It's clear that a tremendous number of things had to happen just exactly right for life to develop as it has. Just the right temperature, the amazing characteristics of water at this temperature range, exactly the correct amount of oxygen, carbon dioxide, and other elements and compounds necessary for life.There was a school of thought centered around the late Carl Sagen that there must be a lot of life in the Universe. He estimated that there were as many as a million civilizations in the Milky Way alone. Since then a revisionist school has come about. The authors of this book have collected a massive amount of knowledge about the nature of life on our planet, much of it just developed in recent years. Their conclusion is that the circumstances surrounding life on earth make it more rare than previous studies might have believed.Does it prove that we are alone in the universe, absolutely not, it is theoretically impossible to prove a negative. You can only prove a positive, and this question will remain until we receive a signal from outer space or perhaps when a UFO joins the flight pattern at the airport in Washington, London or where ever."},{"Title":"The Privileged Planet: How Our Place in the Cosmos is Designed for Discovery","review":"Like any books about &quot;evolution&quot; and &quot;creation&quot;, including those on intelligent design, this book will not change the mind set of those who do not believe in God, at all. Those scientists or science-minded people who do not believe in God will keep believing in their 'evolutionism' which is, in fact, their religion. They are even passionate. (We read a word 'racist' in this book review.)However, for those who believe in God and its wonderous creation and those who love reading, this book can be a gem to be added on their reading list.One more comment for those who want to know how to deal with this problem of creation vs. evolution, I urge to read a small extraordinary book by Gitt (a German information scientist) titled &quot;In the Beginning was Information&quot; (English translation). We have to know first 'how to talk' before we take up a position for either 'evolution' or 'creation'. Unless we know why they talk the way they do (presenting their non-sense of dogmatic 'scientism' as if it is erudite scientific endeavor), no argument would be helpful.&quot;Darwinism&quot; is long ago dead (well, he just happened to be in the age where scientific knowledge was limited); already proven wrong and replaced by 'neo-Darwinism' (they claimed that it has 'superceded' and itself is still undergoing to cover up their deficiencies). No amount of 'information' has been generated by itself, no matter how long period time is given. As for me, information is at the core of all the existence and the order; the universe, the life, the matter, and by extension, the spirit.P.S.Science itself is evolving! How I love the word 'evolve'. I myself am evolving till I die. Long ago some Greeks had helicentric cosmology. The geocentric cosmology of the pre-modern gave a way to the heliocentic one. As we now well know, thanks to science itself (relativity theory, etc.), that both are right and both may be wrong, depending on perspective and derivatives. In the vast universe where you cannot put a finger as its center, why cannot be the planet earth taken as its center?"},{"Title":"The Privileged Planet: How Our Place in the Cosmos is Designed for Discovery","review":"Gonzalez' book doesn't compare to books by Brownlee or Ward about the place of Earth in the Cosmos. Rare Earth (Ward)--ALL science and nothing but-- is a fascinating look at the history of our planet and the remarkable number of variables that led to complex life. Rare Earth suggests that microbial life may be fairly common in the universe, but that complex life/animals are probably rare (and why: radioactive elements from the core create constant mountain building--and circulation of nutrients, moon creates stability, Jupiter gathered asteroids to itself and away from Earth, Earth has just the right amount of oxygen and liquid water, just the right distance from the sun, metals very important to life, a stable star that is 30% brighter than at the beginning, the right kind of galaxy, the right place in the galaxy, etc, but Ward never makes any value/religious judgments; he does mention that we have come full circle from a theory of earth-centered to earth- \\"mediocrity\\" -- Carl Sagan thought there might be millions of planets like Earth -- to again, a theory of \\"Rare Earth.\\" Let's skip trying to draw conclusions about why and just marvel that we are here at all."},{"Title":"The Privileged Planet: How Our Place in the Cosmos is Designed for Discovery","review":"When I first met Dr. Gonzales he was doing a talk at my university...or more likely a book tour. He sold this book before the talk and naively I thought he being a scientist that this would be an interesting new idea in astronomy. However as I started reading this I knew there was something wrong here. The first 2/3 of the book was extremely intelligent and covers alot of astronomical history. However near the end I see the theme. The authors are trying to \\"create\\" \\"science\\" to give credit to intelligent design. For those of you who do not know what ID is it's and idea (NOT a theory for I will explain shortly). The idea states that this world was not created as a condensing ball of gas which eventually created life in the oceans but rather God or some being (but lets face it: God) created everything.Now the problem with this is that is not a theory. That is an idea or hypothesis. Theories have to have data to support their idea. This book is trying to show some data for support, but the incredible jump in conclusions is ludicrous. A theory must also support all the previous discoveries. How does intelligent design support the fact that the Gallapagos Island has a completely separate ecosystem and animals that are somewhat similar to animals in other lands. Or how about the fact that bacteria adapt and change to resist the medication we throw at it.Evolution is a theory, that is true but you must understand the word theory first. A theory is an idea that supports the data we see. Evolution has survived since the mid 19th century because we have data to support it. We do not have many \\"laws\\" in science because we see things change. Theory of Relativaty is almost 100 years old now and its still a theory. Yet with those laws we are able to predict all the eclipses, transits, and occultations of astronomical objects. We have also land a man on the moon with these and passed by Jupiter onto Saturn onto Uranus and onto Neptune.Because Dr. Gonzales has chosen to close his mind to ideas I am ashamed that he is a fellow physicist. It was his job to keep an open mind to all ideas. He instead chose to close it and deny all the past 80 years of astronomical and biological research to say that the Earth is the perfect place and God created it.Shame on you mister Gonzales."},{"Title":"The Privileged Planet: How Our Place in the Cosmos is Designed for Discovery","review":"The book is a unique American product where scientists and theologists work together to write extensive techinical material to confuse and impress people misdirecting them in science. One author is a scientist and the other is a theologist. It is a bizarre output that is, in literary terms, may be described as a very well-written book. But as far as the content goes it is a shame that somebody would be expected to spend so much time reading this heavy book to be convinced about a place for intelligent design in science."},{"Title":"The Privileged Planet: How Our Place in the Cosmos is Designed for Discovery","review":"To any who are fed up with the violent blasts of ignorance spewing forth from the negative reviewers, understand where they are coming from. There is no evidence for macro-evolution. All avenues of scientific inquiry more than disprove it! These Darwinist proselytizers who remain in the \\"dark ages\\" of science...faithfully believing theories that date back 150 years ago...are no threat to any who are truly interested in reading the arguments, data, and proof in this book. My prediction is that, in about 10 years, people in this Evolution cult and its deeply embedded blind faith, will be sitting in dark corners with primordial egg on their faces."},{"Title":"The Privileged Planet: How Our Place in the Cosmos is Designed for Discovery","review":"After reading the book and viewing the DVD, all I can add to the perpetual I.D. debate is to recommend further study on why theological propositions are a bad mix with scientific research. A good place to start would be for readers to scrutinize the entire transcript of Kitzmiller v. Dover case. Judge Jones (a conservative, Bush appointee and Christian) was able to separate the theological, hence untestable, logic of I.D. from evolutionary theory, which is supported by facts. The clarity of his legal opinion, is a breath of fresh air in an atomosphere of rancor and hostility. Like biological complexity, the cosmos can be interpreted according to ones spiritual longings - or materialistic leanings, but actual scienctific achievement must be based only on supportable facts. The Privileged Planet is a reasonably well written arguement in favor of Intelligent Design and, as such, will be championed by those who desire quasi-empirical validation of their spiritual beliefs. Nonetheless, by confusing scientific methodology with philosophical mussings, I cannot recommend this work."},{"Title":"The Privileged Planet: How Our Place in the Cosmos is Designed for Discovery","review":"I've read this book and have heard Jay Richards speak. My analysis is that the authors are putting a new spin on an old argument. It is worth the read if you're interested in keeping up with the ID movement. Otherwise, don't bother. The 'new science' presented is interesting and there certainly are reasons to believe that earth is a special place. Whether this means that we are the only special place is not 'proved' in anyway by this book. Also, whether or not we really are privileged seems to me to be theologically irrelevant."},{"Title":"The Privileged Planet: How Our Place in the Cosmos is Designed for Discovery","review":"At first this book appeared to be a follow up on the &quot;Rare Earth&quot; hypothesis and had a lot to offer until the third section in which it turns away from science and presents an idea that has no justification. The book then becomes a rambling mess inspired by religion more than science and fails to convince the reader of the idea that habitability and measurability are related in the universe.Unfortunately the Notes are nearly as long as the book. Rather than just contain references they contain a substantial portion of the material forcing the reader to flip back and forth several times per page.There are more than the usual number of errors in the writing as well as the material. I cannot recommend this book to anyone with a scientific or historical interest in the universe."},{"Title":"The Privileged Planet: How Our Place in the Cosmos is Designed for Discovery","review":"\\"The earth is the Lord's, and all its fullness,The world and those who dwell therein.\\" -- Psalm 24:1 (NKJV)I enjoy reading books that explore the intersection between science and faith. While many people feel that the two never intersect, scientists who are believers often point out overlays that are unknown to non-scientist believers. If you don't believe that the two perspectives can overlap, you probably won't change your mind after reading this book. If you are open minded about the point, your mind will probably be filled with many new reasons to appreciate Creation.Before reading this book, I was familiar with some arguments about the special nature of life on Earth and how conditional it is on certain factors being just what they are now. The Privileged Planet added to my list of reasons to be grateful for what we have.The major new information for me was in The Privileged Planet was how many ways that what makes life possible on Earth is also essential to being able to observe the rest of Creation outside of our own world. Now, that's pretty special, I'm sure you'll agree.Now, the book has some flaws. First, if you don't know anything about science I suspect you'll get lost from time to time. Second, if you know a lot about science, this book will seem too elementary. So the book's writing style won't be exactly right for too many people. Third, there's a lot of extra detail and repetition that make the \\"aha\\" moments further apart than would ideally be desirable for the casual reader.I do praise the use of figures and plates. Those images added a lot to the story for me.Pastors who feel stuck for a new sermon topic while teaching Genesis would do well to take a close look at this book. That's how I learned about the book, and I feel blessed that I had an opportunity to read it."},{"Title":"The Privileged Planet: How Our Place in the Cosmos is Designed for Discovery","review":"This book makes the same arguments for Earth as a rare/unique planet in the galaxy as do Ward and Brownlee in their book, \\"Rare Earth.\\" In addition to astronomic and terrestrial factors, towards the end of the book, Gonzalez and Richards go further to bring in intelligent design as the explanation. As factors they cite: a planet of the right mass at the right distance from the right star of suitable composition in the right orbit at the right time. Terrestrial factors include: plate tectonics, free oxygen, low impact, right amount of liquid water. Moreover, as with Ward and Brownlee, they emphasize the effect of a large moon in stabilizing the Earth's obliquity thus maintaining the seasons.Their argument for intelligent design is persuasive but not as clearly stated as in Behe's book, \\"The Edge of Evolution.\\" This book along with \\"Rare Earth\\" present an alternative hypothesis to the mediocrity principle.

It is fairly easy to read for anyone with only a basic understanding of physics (I would recommend brushing up on general theory of relativity to make some points easier to follow). There are a lot of fascinating facts about geology and astronomy that alone make this work a pleasure to read.As with any scientific book, I always check the credentials of the author(s)before I bother reading it. You will notice that neither the incredibly biased and ill-informed Publishers Weekly 'review' or the 1,2 and 3 star reader reviews offer any issues with the scientific data presented or the credibility of the authors. Guillermo Gonzalez is a professor of physics and astronomy and has many other qualifications in this field.

Things we take for granted all point to the Privileged Planet. For example, if the axis of the earth were not tilted to a 23.5 degree angle, Seattle would have weather like Siberia. The awesome nature of so many facts and how beyond comprehension it all is even though the fact can be so simply stated. We can know without understanding or comprehending. What a perspective!

Whatever your stand regarding a Creator, this book is a great read. If you are an atheist, read it so you can understand your adversary's point of view and you can hold up your end of the argument. If you are one of faith in a Creator, the book helps validate your stance; it just helps things make sense.I think a good way to describe the book is to use the same analogy the authors used on page 267. The following passage was used to explain the Weak Anthropic Principle: \\"Another analogy is the popular story of the firing squad. Imagine an American intelligence officer, captured by the Nazi SS during World War II, who is sentenced to death by a firing squad. Because of this officer's importance, the SS assign fifty of Germany's finest sharpshooters to his execution. After lining him up against a wall, the sharpshooters take their position three meters away. Upon firing, however, the officer discovers that every sharpshooter has missed, and that instead, their fifty bullets have made a perfect outline of his body on the wall behind him.\\"What would we think if the officer reflected upon this situation, and then responded, \\"I suppose I shouldn't be surprised to see this. If the sharpshooters hadn't missed, I wouldn't be here to observe it\\"? We would rightly wonder what he is doing in intelligence, since the more sensible explanation would be that, for some reason, the execution had been rigged. Perhaps the sharpshooters had been ordered to miss, or they had colluded with one another for some unknown reason. In short, the best explanation would be that the event was the product of intelligent design. Shrugging one's shoulders and concluding that it's a chance occurrence is just dense.\\"And so be it with the universe as well."},{"Title":"The Privileged Planet: How Our Place in the Cosmos is Designed for Discovery","review":"A very well-documented and reliable information source regarding the development of crucial aspects of our planet.

Surprisingly, it reads like a mystery novel. You keep running into evidence for design in unexpected places. The average educated reader will find this book very accessible. It's hard to put the book down for two reasons: 1. It captivates interest by calling attention to how our place and time in the cosmos sets us up for the thrills of life and productive scientific inquiry. 2.

Seems like this book, and others, strikes a nerve that the secular humanist has a hard time dealing with?Overall, this is a fabulous book. Written at an appropriate level of technical detail for general readers but chock full of the references to the hard science underlying the ideas. Like the distance from the earth to the moon, the diameter of the earth and the diameter of the moon. This interesting \\"coincidence\\" that these few facts present allow us to enjoy a total solar eclipse. The eclipse, in large part, allows us to understand what the sun is all about.

What is especially engaging about both the book and the DVD, is the \\"non-preaching\\" format: the research is purely scientific and presented in a manner that a wide range of readership should both understand and appreciate. My only \\"critical\\" comment would be this: the authors systematically build a scientific foundation of contingency. Since Jay Richards has a strong background in philosophy, I would have enjoyed an approach to the subject based upon Aristotle and his development of the argument of contingency. But this is a moot point. If you have high school students, read the book together with them and discuss."},{"Title":"The Privileged Planet: How Our Place in the Cosmos is Designed for Discovery","review":"The book's chief argument is that we are not living on an ordinary world circling around an ordinary star in an out-of-the way part of an unremarkable galaxy. The authors provide convincing evidence against this so-called \\"Copernican Principle\\" (which Copernicus would be horrified to learn was named for him), beginning with the perfection of the solar eclipse. The authors discuss why a world much warmer or much colder, with just a little less or a little more gravity, would not be the spectacular \\"data-recording device\\" it in fact is, allowing us to discover the earth's past in exquisite detail. They show why our world had to be as far as it, and no further than it is, from the sun; why a Jupiter-size planet further from the sun protects us from frequent cometary and asteroidal impacts; and why a large, single moon is important to the earth's stability. They present reasons why the earth, in its position in our solar system and in our galaxy, is a \\"practically perfect\\" platform for scientific discovery, and why other earths are likely to be rare, and perhaps nonexistent, in the universe. An excellent chapter toward the end of the book rebuts the claims of those who espouse the \\"Copernican Principle.\\" For those who are tired of being told that humanity is an unimportant species on an meaningless speck in the vast universe, this is the book for you!"},{"Title":"The Privileged Planet: How Our Place in the Cosmos is Designed for Discovery","review":"This book is a very thick read but well worth the effort (At least it required a lot from me). One thing I enjoy about this book, and the many others offered in the same attitude, is that it says to Darwinists, \\"The argument is not over. Not by a long shot.\\" I think evolutionary theory has played an important role since it's inception. Like Luther shattering the concept of absolute Roman authority Darwin and the like opened up new scientific possibilities, an end to the idea that truth must come from just the priesthood. Most Christians today don't want to monopolize the discussion. We just want a seat at the table. Books like this strengthen our case immensely.The unique idea this book adds to the implicit conclusion of a designer is the desire of said designer for us to discover, to discover Him, to discover His handiwork. Not only is this earth a rare and precious oasis of habitability in the cosmos, it was created in such a way and placed in such a position as to allow us to look back into time, to look deep into the elements, and forward into space so that we can come to a greater understanding of it all. If the glory of God is intelligence it seems that he in our creation and in the circumstance of our existence wants to share with us at least some of His glory. Some of us look at the stars and see stars. Others are touched by the order in the design and yearn like Abraham to possess greater knowledge. It seems the creator is accomodating to those who want to know more.This book is profound and touching and answers the great question of what God thinks of the internal combustion engine and nuclear power. I was fascinated by the discussion on fire and fuel. This is a great book. There is a DVD by the same name in which the thesis is more simply explained.

It does away with a lot of myths, ranging from \\"bigger is better (when the authors talk about our sun, as well as our planet), all the way to the silly belief that the universe is full of life. It also attacks many myths that are used against Christianity. The authors also talk about all the (known) requirements for life, which, amazingly enough, are numerous, including such things as the shape of our galaxy, our location in our galaxy, our location in the solar system, and the several planets which keep earth safe."},{"Title":"The Privileged Planet: How Our Place in the Cosmos is Designed for Discovery","review":"The book is a logical and quantitatively supported advancement of the implications of the so-called anthropic cosmological principle. Not only must a precise array of specific values be implemented if a universe that is stable on a large scale and materially complex is to exist, these same &quot;fine tuned&quot; values are necessary for life, for technological (intelligent) life, and for a viable &quot;platform&quot; for scientific discovery. Such a platform is our home, the planet Earth and its calculably favored location in space-time. &quot;Our argument is subtle,&quot; say Gonzales and Richards, &quot;Earth's conditions allow for a stunning diversity of measurements, from cosmology and galactic astronomy to stellar astrophysics and geophysics; they allow for this rich diversity of measurement much more so than if Earth were ideally suited for, say, just one of these sorts of measurement.&quot; If, as Fred Hoyle famously said, a super-intellect has &quot;monkeyed&quot; with the physics (and chemistry and biology) of our material world, then it likewise appears that this super-intellect has also presented us with unique opportunities for discovering this same precise array of specific values. The particular values that support intelligent life also provide the opportunity for knowledge of these particular values. Thus another in the growing number of &quot;cosmic coincidences&quot;. The theological implications are, in a general sense, obvious to anyone who isn't pre-committed to excluding them. (Gonzalez is an astrophysicist, Richards a theologian and philosopher).The first section broadly quantifies the remarkable &quot;habitability&quot; of our host planet, treating such issues as the role of Earth's plate tectonics in maintaining the carbon cycle; the highly specific advantages of a rotating iron core (meteorological, magnetic, etc); the type and age of our star, the unique advantages of having a &quot;twin&quot; body with the parameters of Earth's moon; the protective function of the neighboring gas giants like Jupiter, and so forth. Also treated are Earth's surprising array of &quot;data recorders&quot; and their importance to scientific discovery. If intelligent beings are to ask questions about the nature of nature, Earth is a strangely ideal place for these questions to be asked.The second section considers the larger cosmos, quantifying the privileges of being between the spiral arms of a large (Andromeda and ours are the largest of the Local Group) and old galaxy, and well removed from the perils of a galactic center. Here also we consider the stunningly precise values required for stellar nucleosynthesis, the necessary advantages afforded to our location in time, the necessity of the fundamental force values being very narrowly &quot;tuned&quot;, and so forth.Building on the quantification considered to this point, the third section examines &quot;anthropic&quot; and design implications, thoroughly debunks the Mediocrity Principle popularized by Drake and Sagan, and presents some general and specific predictions arising from a 'design' interpretation of the measurements and discoveries of the past century (and especially of the past three decades). The authors go on to anticipate and answer contradicting arguments, and in making their predictions they clearly challenge those who won't like their hypothesis. To be sure, some won't like it (the 'purposelessness' and 'mediocrity' faithful). But the inevitable detraction (and outright whining) will arise from personal psychological commitments and not from science.A fascinating book, highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Privileged Planet: How Our Place in the Cosmos is Designed for Discovery","review":"In their conclusion, the authors write:&quot;The reasonable skeptic - as opposed to the hardened skeptic for whom no evidence is sufficient - should at least consider the possibility that nature exists for a purpose. For those open to such a possibility, the correlation between habitability and measurability should be a compelling discovery.&quot;Indeed. The evidence and observations in this book clearly complement the recent resuscitation of the argument of Intelligent Design, but their specific argument certainly stands on its own merits. The book is both easy to comprehend and filled with very detailed information, some of which personally astonished me. The authors eloquently reveal the paradox of the Copernican Principle as well as the mistakes and misguidings of SETI.Furthermore, the authors make a number of prediction risks to enable the book to be evaluated as more evidence is discovered. Either evidence will mount that continues to support their argument (which has been the recent trend), or the argument will wither on the vine as future evidence invalidates it. The authors clearly believe the former is inevitable, and so do I.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Privileged Planet: How Our Place in the Cosmos is Designed for Discovery","review":"The Privileged Planet is a wonderful book. Relating the conditions which make our planet oasis habitable as well as best positioned for scientific discovery is as novel of an idea as it is thought provoking.

I imagine that conversation would be as equally enlightening.As a second note, many of us grew up watching shows such as Star Trek. It's refreshing to see ideas based upon scientific evidence instead of childhood hopes of finding a universe teeming with life."},{"Title":"The Privileged Planet: How Our Place in the Cosmos is Designed for Discovery","review":"Please click on \\"see all my reviews\\" to see the full text of my commentsNow that the DVD for \`Privileged Planet' has been announced, it is time to remind the readers of why I believe that the Privileged Planet makes for a very poor scientific argument. Although I do believe that the argument serves well as an apologetic and rhetorical tool, which may help explain why it is given such a \`privileged' position at the DDD-V conference or creationist websites.So why do I believe that the Privileged Planet approach is wrong? To quote Xia-Li Meng at the 2004 ENAR Spring Meeting in Pittsburgh PA on statistics:\\"If you have not seen all the data, how can you estimate how much you haven't seen? But, as statisticians, we can do anything!\\"As statisticians we can do anything. Especially when the argument is based on a correlation. Mark Twain had this to say about \\"lies, damn lies, and statistics\\"? It's not that statistical arguments are necessarily lies but it's a warning that good statistics requires a careful approach to avoid obvious and less obvious pitfalls. I argue that in Privileged Planet the authors have failed to do so.We can show for instance that ice cream sales cause summer drownings, we can show that wet pavement causes rain or even that the Dow Jones causes changes in the skirt length. In other words, correlation can be used and abused and it requires a careful analysis before one can jump from correlation to causation.Arguments based on correlation need to carefully quantify the terms of interest. How else can one determine if there exists a statistically significant correlation? The authors of Privileged Planet fail to define quantifiable measures of either habitability nor measurability.Arguments based on correlation need to deal with causal direction. Does rain cause the pavement to get wet or does wet pavement cause rain? The authors of Privileged Planet fail to explain why correlation should be interpreted as causation.Arguments based on correlation need to deal with additional correlating variables. A good example is the correlation between ice-cream sales and summer drownings. A careless person may argue that this is evidence of a causal relationship between ice cream sales and drownings. Of course the real \`cause' was found in the realization that both factors also correlate with a third factor namely \`summer'. Summer and ice cream sales correlate, summer and summer drownings correlate.And finally a correlation requires a sample of more than one. The authors of Privilged Planet however base their argument on a sample of one. More on that later.What is the Privileged Planet aboutThe Privileged Planet basically argues that there is a correlation between habitability (is it hospitable to life) and measurability (can one learn about the world around it). Based on this poorly defined concept, the authors are trying to argue that life on earth involves purpose, or Purpose.Not only do the authors fail to present quantifiable measures for habitability and measurability (making any claim of correlation suspicious) but they are also relying on a single data point (earth) to make their claims. But a single datapoint cannot be used to make any reliable statistical inferences.Mark Isaak notices that Voltaire in \\"Candide\\" observed that:\\"It is demonstrable,\\" said he, \\"that things cannot be otherwise than as they are; for as all things have been created for some end, they must necessarily be created for the best end. Observe, for instance, the nose is formed for spectacles, therefore we wear spectacles. The legs are visibly designed for stockings, accordingly we wear stockings. Stones were made to be hewn and to construct castles, therefore My Lord has a magnificent castle; for the greatest baron in the province ought to be the best lodged. Swine were intended to be eaten, therefore we eat pork all the year round: and they, who assert that everything is right, do not express themselves correctly; they should say that everything is best.\\" [Voltaire 1759)Single datapoint? Tell me it isn't soDavid Grinspoon: \\"It is always shaky when we generalize from experiments with a sample size of one. So we have to be a bit cautious when we fill the cosmos with creatures based on the time scales of Earth history (it happened so fast here, therefore it must be easy) and the resourcefulness of Earth life (they are everywhere where there is water).\\"This is one history, and one example of life. When our arguments rest on such shaky grounds, balancing a house of cards on a one-card foundation, we are in danger of erecting structures formed more by our desires than the \\"evidence.\\"The authors have argued that they are NOT relying on a single data point since they show various examples of what they claim to be a correlation. But when I pointed out that there are also examples of poor correlation, they responded by stating that:\\"Of course, as we say several times in the book, we don't argue that the Earth is optimal for observing every particular type of phenomenon we cite. Rather, it's optimal in the constrained sense of providing the best overall place for discovery.\\"so before the authors object by saying that they show several such examples, let it be clear that the authors themselves are arguing for a \`constrained optimization' which means that a single observation cannot be independent of another observation but rather that when taking into consideration all aspects of habitability and measurability for lets say the planet earth one has one example of a constrained optimization (in a statistical sense). Otherwise any observation which contradicts the authors' viewpoint would count as an example against their thesis. But they insist that such observations do not affect their arguments.Hence the conclusion is simple, earth can be at most a single datapoint of an \`constrained optimization'.But things get worse. Think about it, how would we know if a particular aspect of earth makes it a poor platform for scientific discovery? Since we would remain ignorant of our ignorance, we cannot even determine if earth were optimal in some constrained sense. And just when you thought, thing could not get any worse, we now realize that any planet where intelligent life were to develop, the inhabitants would argue that their world is ideally positioned for inquiry.Maybe a quick thought experiment may clarify this. Let's assume that intelligent life on Planet X has developed a scientific knowledge similar to our with one major difference, their planet is in the worst position to allow them to detect that Newtonian physics is merely an approximation. Ignorant of this fact, they marvel how their planet is in an optimal position to allow them to measure the world and universe around them. Unaware of the fact that a theory of Relativity exists. I argue that this problem is endemic to the whole approach namely that any intelligence would consider its position in the universe to be optimal for scientific inquiry since science has been able to use whatever is available and remains unaware of that which it is missing.Naive Falsification?The following statement by the authors\\"Finally, we don't argue that Earth is unique. Discovering another planet around another star in the Galaxy would be quite compatible with our hypothesis, so long as that planet is genuinely Earth-like. Finding a fundamentally different planet with (native) complex life on it, in contrast, would contradict our argument that the conditions for life and scientific discovery correlate in the universe.\\"makes even less sense. Why would finding a \`non earth like planet' with complex life contradict their claim of correlation. Since such a planet would show another datapoint in favor of a correlation between life and scientific discovery.Unless of course the real argument is to show that the Earth has a privileged position but such an argument cannot be used a premise unless the authors want to claim a tautology. On the other hand, from a theological perspective it is much easier to understand why one may consider the earth to be privileged. But what we wish or what we believe by virtue of faith may have little relevance to the scientific accuracy of such a belief.And that's where my strongest theological objection to the Privileged Planet can be found. By insisting that the earth is privileged based on some mathematical arguments, the authors miss the obvious, the earth is privileged because that's where we are living. To suggest that a Creator would create a universe with countless planets and consider only one to be privileged requires a knowledge and understanding of said Creator, beyond our realm of knowledge. In fact, it shows a certain level of hubris.In other words, the design inference is based on a flawed foundation (single sample) , poor mathematics, failure to control for confounding factors, failure to address the causal directions.And of course lets not forget that the Privileged Planet does not present any testable hypothesis of Intelligent Design.One may wonder why the ID movement gives the Privileged Planet such visibility. The real question is, will ID do better in the (near) future? Can we expect a positive ID hypothesis?Why the Privileged Planet is not a positive hypothesisWithout any understanding of motive, means or opportunity, we cannot really constrain a hypothesis. The hidden assumption of the Privileged Planet seems to be that a \`Designer' would \`create' an environment not just suitable for life but also for scientific inquiry. But that presumes a lot about a \`designer' of whom we have little data allowing us to determine if such an assumption is warranted or just ad hoc.An intelligent design hypothesis without constraints fails to be relevant scientifically. In fact, since ID hypotheses are based on elimination rather than on positive evidence, they are not just irrelevant scientifically but unreliable as well.Gonzalez is well aware of the \`weak anthropic principle' (observer bias). In Home Alone in the Universe (From: First Things 103, May 1, 2000 ) with Ross, Gonzalez makes the following assertion:\\"It is difficult to quarrel with the simple physical interpretation of the WAP (Ed: Weak Anthropic Principle): it is just a type of observer selection bias. We should not be surprised to observe, for example, that we are living on a planet with an oxygen-rich atmosphere, for the simple reason that we require oxygen to live. The WAP \\"explains\\" why we should not observe ourselves to be living on, say, Titan, but it fails to account for the origin of the oxygen in our atmosphere and hence for the rarity of planets with oxygen-rich atmospheres. However, Barrow and Tipler, no doubt motivated by the philosophical CP, have burdened the basic physical interpretation of the WAP with unwarranted philosophical extrapolations. In considering the WAP with regard to the observable universe, they claim that we ought not be surprised at measuring a universe so finely tuned for life, for if it were different, we would not observe it.\\"In other words, Gonzalez does recognize the risk of philosophical motivations leading to unwarranted extrapolations. And that's exactly what I argue, Gonzalez and Richards have done in \\"Privilged Planet\\".Gonzalez et al appeal to Dembski's _Design Inference_ to show how the correlation of habitability and measurability shows evidence of \`purpose' in the universe. Various people such as Wein, or various authors on Talkreasons.org, have already shown what is wrong with the _Design Inference_ argument. I will limit my comments to the claims by Gonzalez et al to show that their appeal to the _Design Inference_ is inappropriate. In addition I will show that their use of correlation to support 'purpoe' suffers from poorly defined and thus poorly quantifiable terms, that it is based on a single observation of what they call a 'constrained optimum' (the earth), that it is biased towards earth-like planets, and that it is based on cherry picking of examples that support the thesis. In other words, from a scientific perspective their claims are meaningless.Which of course does not mean that their book does not make for a useful apologetic tool (hence my two stars). For people who need their faith to be supported by some impressive sounding but scientifically poorly supported claims, this book serves its purpose. If one is hoping that this book will present a scientific argument for _Intelligent Design_ then one will be quite disappointed.In simple terms, which would not do full justice to their arguments (hence the length of my review), the main problem of their claims is that on any planet on which life were to develop, complex life would develop some form of 'science' and they would believe that their planet is best suited for their science to have developed, ignorant of what they don't know. For all we know, our science may be light-years behind what science would be elsewhere but how would we know? The authors present no evidence that the expected correlation between our level of science (measurability) and habitability is anything beyond what is to be expected. In other words, we only know scientifically that which we can measure and have no way to know how 'optimal' our knowledge is since we have no comparissons.A quick overview of the _Design Inference_ is in order to understand the shortcomings in the arguments by Gonzalez and Richards.Basically, the \`Design Inference' attempts to identify events with low probability (or in the somewhat confusing language of Dembski, high complexity) and a specification (an independently given pattern). Such events are claimed to be \`designed'. Low probability is determined through elimination of regularity and chance processes, specification is provided through an independent description of the event. It is important to realize that the _Design Inference_ is a purely eliminative argument with all the problems of such an approach such as _gap arguments_ and _argument from ignorance_.In addition to others such as Ratzsch and Wimsatt's critical remarks about the \`Design Inference', Richards himself seems to consider the \`Design Inference' of limited usability:\\"We think there are lots of events and structures for which we are rational in concluding \\"intelligent design,\\" but for which it is impossible (or really hard) to run a probability on them. If we had to do so to infer design, we would almost always be unjustified in inferring design. For instance, I still don't know how to run a probability on Stonehenge or the black monolith in 2001: A Space Odyssey. Still, I think both are designed, and I think we're rational in so concluding.\\"So in order to be able to be able to appeal to the \\"Design Inference\\", Gonzalez et al have to show that the events are of low probability and that there is an independent specification. My claim is that they have failed in all aspects to make a convincing case. In fact, I intend to show that the authors are aware of the limitations of their use of Dembski's \`Design Inference' yet are still appealing to it to draw their conclusions of \`purpose'.WELL POSITIONED EARTH\\"Mankind is unusually well positioned to decipher the cosmos.\\" From: Gonzalez and Richards, The Privileged Planet: How our place in the cosmos is designed for discover.But Gonzalez et al provide no quantifiable measures that help us determine if their claim is correct. What they do argue, again without much supporting evidence, is that habitability and measurability correlate in zones that are called galactic \`habitable zones\\". They argue that these zones are \`rare' but present no quantifiable information as to how many stars would be involved. The statement that habitability and measurability correlate in (significantly sized) zones in the universe undermines the argument that habitability and measurability are improbable and even seems to argue that measurability and habitability naturally correlate.Even more mysterious than the fact that our location is so congenial to diverse measurement (what is so mysterious about this? Other than that the authors have failed to make their case that the earth is uniquely congenial to diverse measurements) and discovery is that these same conditions appear to correlate with habitability (appear to correlate. That's the risk of not really providing for hard estimates). This is strange because there is no obvious (to the authors at least) reason to assume that the very rare (unsupported) properties that allow for our existence (anthropocentric) would also provide the best overall (and yet the authors provide NO evidence for this optimality) setting to make discoveries about the world around us.So lets look at some of the examples of measurability they quote from a variety of disciplines. Their article include perfect solar eclipses (astronomy), ice cores in Greenland and Antarctica (geology), deep sea cores (geology), tree rings (biology), stellar trigonometric parallax (astronomy). Stars as isotropic emitters of highly specific information (any ID paper seems to have as a requirement a reference to information and specificity J), supernovae and Cepheids (astronomy), our place in the Milky way and dust extinction (astronomy), the capacity to observe the maximum diversity of star types and the distant universe (astronomy) background radiation (astronomy) and the particle and event horizons of the universe (astronomy). Not as diverse as one may have hoped for and in fact the authors fail to show that the earth is somehow unique in these aspectsSo is the earth \`the best overall bench in the lab'? The authors do little to support this conclusion other than by pointing out that the earth has certain characteristics but are they optimal? Are they the best bench in the universe? How will we know? Little guidance is provided here.BIG MOONS AND SOLAR ECLIPESESGonzalez suggests that there is a link between life (on earth) and perfect solar eclipses. The moon and sun appear to be of similar size in the sky allowing \`perfect' solar eclipses to occur. Not only is a big moon essential for stabilizing the planet (helpful perhaps but not necessarily essential)but it also was essential for the validation of Einstein's theory of relativity and the study of the solar corona. Thus linking habitability with measurability.But was the solar eclipse of 1919 required for the scientific discover of Einstein? It's hard to argue that this confirmation hurt Einstein's case but lest point out that first of all, Einstein did not base his theory on the solar eclipse so the origins of the theory are not dependent on the solar eclipse but what about its verification?To understand the relevance of the 1919 solar eclipse we need to remember that Einstein provided in his 1915 paper three experimental tests.Would the precession of the perihelion of Mercury not have been sufficient? Would the solar eclipse data have been sufficient without the Mercury prediction? In fact to Einstein \\"This discovery was, I believe, by far the strongest emotional experience in Einstein's scientific life, perhaps in all his life. Nature had spoken to him.\\" Abraham Pais (EM, p. 202)\\" \\".Einstein commented: \\"These equations, which proceed, by the method of pure mathematics, from the requirement of the general theory of relativity, give us, in combination with the [geodesic] equations of motion, to a first approximation Newton's law of attraction, and to a second approximation the explanation of the motion of the perihelion of the planet Mercury discovered by Leverrier. These facts must, in my opinion, be taken as a convincing proof of the correctness of the theory.\\"The same source reports that: To his friend Paul Ehrenfest in January 1916 he wrote that \\"for a few days I was beside myself with joyous excitement\\", and to Fokker he said that seeing the anomaly in Mercury's orbit emerge naturally from his purely geometrical field equations \\"had given him palpitations of the heart\\".But of course Mercury and habitability arguments just do not seem to be as impressive as trying to present a case that the moon provides for stability of the earth axis (habitability) and allows for discovery (measurability). Certainly the perihelion of Mercury was an earlier event than the 1919 solar eclipse. We may never know to what extent the solar eclipse data sealed the case for Einstein's theory but it does show how the data appear to be carefully selected to support the thesis.Here we also encounter another peculiarity of Earth namely that the requirement for habitability (nearly circular orbit) made the earth orbit unreliable for perihelion precession measurements.THE IMPROBABILITY FALLACYGonzalez et al attempt to make their case for the design inference by first pointing out that: \\" Complexity is improbability\\" (finally a clear definition of Dembski's version of complexity) and argue that:1. Conditions that allow for habitability are improbable2. The conditions that allow for measurability are improbable.Let's look at there terms in more detail:HABITABILITY AND PROBABILITYBut is this correct? Are conditions that allow for habitability improbable? Dembski requires a probability of 10^-150 before a design inference can be triggered. In addition Dembski requires the elimination of chance and regularity pathways while Gonzalez et al only consider chance pathways. Richards argues that \\"But what if you want to know if, say, the structure of the natural laws themselves, or the cosmos as a whole, is the result of purpose or design? Well, you'll at least need to modify Dembski's approach.\\" In other words, when Gonzalez et al infer \`purpose' they include natural law as the \`designer'.Richards seems to recognize the challenges and limitations of the \`Design Inference' approach when stating on ISCID that: \\"We view Dembski's arguments as a valuable rational reconstruction for capturing an important subset of designed structures. We also think he makes a critical insight that design detection has as much to do with pattern recognition as with probabilities. However, Dembski's reconstruction is optimized to avoid false positives, not to allow a design inference for all discernibly designed structures. So it shouldn't be treated as a Procrustean Bed into which we have to fit everything that's discernibly designed.\\"In that light Richards states that \\"Also, while we use Dembski's criteria for detecting design, we don't depend on them exclusively. We also draw on the work of John Leslie, Del Ratzsch and others.\\". My biggest gripe with this is that despite this, Dembski's \`Design Inference' is given a central position in arguing for \`purpose' in public presentations and even in the book itself.Do we know enough about the parameters for habitability to be able to state that conditions for habitability are improbable? I claim that at most one can argue that with our present knowledge we simply do not know. Certainly it is far too early to argue that habitability is improbable.In addition, habitability is defined in terms that treat our own situation preferentially. In other words habitability describes a \`terrestrial' planet not too warm, not too cold with water and oxygen. Add some ad hoc requirements, like those used by Gonzalez et al, such as for example a large moon, plate tectonics, a large planet to deflect some of the incoming threats etc and one can make a case for the uniqueness of earth. But a similar argument could be made for almost anything. By tightening the requirements for habitability to describe the present situation for our earth one can indeed reach a small probability but then the question becomes one of prediction. Is the earth unique or have we forced upon it enough criteria that make it appear to be unique? Has habitability become a description rather than a prediction? Or in other words are the requirements set for habitability that lead to a low probability actual requirements or \`ad hoc' descriptors of our own situation. In other words are we making our own earth \`privileged'? If that is the case the outcome is not surprising. However any claim of \`purpose' seems to be leaping to conclusions.While one can certainly attempt to tighten the probabilities, one should not ignore those circumstance which would loosen the probabilities such as the fact that we can only observe a fraction of the total Universe or that habitability requirements need to be loosened to take into consideration other forms of life.And finally, habitability is not a concept easily quantified. Arguments of improbability thus become subjective claims.MEASURABILITY AND PROBABILITYDefinition: Measurability refers to those features of the universe as a whole, and especially to our particular position in it - both in space and time - which allow us to detect, observe, discover and determine such features as the size, age, history, laws and other properties of the physical universe.Gonzalez et al claim that they do not argue is that every single condition for measurability is optimized on the Earth's surface or that it is easy to make measurements and scientific discoveries on Earth. The argument is that the Earth allows for a \\"stunning diversity of measurements, from cosmology and galactic astronomy to stellar astrophysics and geophysics; and it allows for this rich diversity of measurement much more so than if Earth were ideally suited for, say, just one of these sort of measurements.\\" So in other words, the earth is \`optimal' in a weighted, statistical sense. But is that really supportable with quantifiable evidence? I argue that the authors have failed to show that this is the case. Largely because the concepts of habitability and measurability have not been given quantifiable values.The authors argue that they have avoided \`cherry picking' by taking examples from every important discipline. As I will argue, they have done so at the cost of ignoring examples that show poor measurability and thus have failed to show that the earth is somehow unique in this aspect.So what about measurability? As with habitability, measurability lacks a workable definition, but it also suffers from a selection bias. In case of habitability we may make the mistake of using factors typical for our earth as relevant to habitability in general. With measurability, the same problem arises in that what we cannot measure will remain unknown. So what is the full space of measurability versus what we can actually measure on earth? How do we know if we are optimal if we cannot define measurability due to our ignorance?In other words, either measurability is trivially true (we measure what we can measure) or it is fraught with an appeal to ignorance since we fail to consider that which we do not know.Gonzalez et al argue that the moon is an important factor for measurability since \`perfect solar eclipses' allowed verification of Einstein's theory of relativity and the study of the corona. As Gonzalez et al point out, these eclipses are not really perfect due to the eccentricity of the Earth and Moon's orbits.How do we know that Einstein's theory would have fared worse or better if the earth had not had perfect eclipses? If the earth is such a special place how come that astronomy had to wait for space based platforms before it really took off? I will look in more detail into some of the examples used by Gonzalez and show that they do not support their claims.In summary I argue that the authors have failed to show that measurability and/or habitability are improbable. In fact I argue that given the present status of our scientific investigations and knowledge, any such claim of improbability runs the risk of \`appeal to ignorance'.THE SPECIFICATION FALLACYIn addition to improbability, the Design Inference also a requires a specification. Remember that one of the requirements for this specification is that it is independent of the event. According to Gonzalez \\"The correlation of habitability and measurability forms a meaningful pattern\\" or in other words, a specification. Are they correct? Once again I have to disagree with their claim for a variety of reasons. First of all they have not shown that the correlation between the two is independent. In fact the existence of a correlation suggests that these two events are NOT independent. What if measurability is strongly correlated with habitability through some form of necessity? In fact, Gonzalez argues that the correlation between the habitability and measurability effects of the Moon can be explained by natural law. Surely appealing to natural law as the designer of \`purpose' seems to weaken their argument.In addition the authors base their claims on a sample size of one. While the authors try to defuse this criticism by arguing that they have in fact many examples from a variety of disciplines their correlation argument is based on a single data point namely \`earth'. No other examples of \`habitable' environment are described. Under such circumstance, one should frown upon any claim of correlation. Especially when measurability and habitability are poorly defined, and unquantified.THE DESIGNER ICE CREAMLet me give you an interesting example that I hope will clarify some of my objections. When studying data on ice-cream sales and the number of drownings, it was found that there existed a strong correlation between the two. Using the same Design Inference approach chosen by Gonzalez et al, one may argue that drownings are improbable and in addition that the correlation between drownings and ice-cream sales shows evidence of a specification. In other words one should conclude, according to these authors, \\"design\\" or purpose. While I am not sure why one would expect design in something like drownings, this example shows the risks involved in using the approach chosen. And in this example ice-cream sales and drownings were actually quantifiable; not much ignorance on our part as to their exact numbers. So statistically the case is much stronger than the case made by Gonzalez et al.Of course we all \`know' that the correlation was not evidence of \`design' but caused by a third independent factor namely \`sun shine'. Since more people go out swimming during sunny days and since more people eat ice-cream during sunny days one quickly realizes that this correlation was due to a third factor. So what if measurability and habitability are intrinsically correlated or correlated through a third factor? I could think of various reasons why this may be the case.As an interesting side-note, in addition to drownings, correlations have been found between ice cream sales and murder, boating accidents, and shark attacks.CONFLATION OF DESIGN AND PURPOSEMy biggest gripe is with the authors' confusion of design and purpose. While science can show function, showing purpose requires a philosophical or theological assumption or direct or indirect knowledge of the motivations of the designer. While Dembski denies that motives, opportunity, means etc are indispensable for a reliable design inference, actual design inferences in archeology, criminology and SETI strongly depend on such assumptions. Would a designer be interested in correlating habitability and measurability and that uniquely to earth? Perhaps, but such an argument is easier made based on theological assumptions than based on unbiased assumptions. Without much knowledge about motives, stating that the correlation between the habitability and measurability is what we would from a designer seems somewhat circular.In other words. when purpose is inferred based on our ignorance then we enter a dangerous realm of \`gap arguments'. Gonzalez et al argue that a designer would be interested in having his creation learn about the world and universe they live in hence measurability and habitability would be expected to correlate. But then again, there may be regularity and chance processes that result in a similar correlation. Lacking a clear definition of both habitability and measurability and the inherent observer bias, it is hard to argue that we can reach a design and purpose inference. After all how can we eliminate regula"},{"Title":"The Privileged Planet: How Our Place in the Cosmos is Designed for Discovery","review":"After reading a number of writings by scientists who lean towards an intelligent designer and also a number by those who support blind chance as a maker, I find that there seems to be a certain ring of &quot;sincere honesty&quot; to be found among the former, whereas the sheer speculation and real lack of suporting evidence for evolution leaves the latter in a position that almost makes forces them to seem dishonest in there theories. The Privileged Planet reflects this honesty to which I refer.Some have dismissed the Anthropic principle, reversing the reasoning to support evolution, yet, if the chances are that because of the sheer number of possible planets in the universe, life had to arise on one of them that was perfect for life (Earth) in an unguided way, then would it not also be reasonable to think that in a biologists perfect laboratory (out of all the labs worldwide) that a living cell could be developed from scratch (even with a highly intelligent designer and his technology). This has not happened in recent decades and doesn't seem likely it will happen in the anywere near future.

The vast majority (more than half) rate the book at five stars. Does this prove that this is the greatest book ever written? Of course not. It is simply a result of the adage that &quot;you will like this book, if this is the kind of book that you like.&quot; The next largest category is a rating of one star. And what does that prove? It proves that &quot;you will not like this book, if this is the kind of book that you do not like.&quot; Apparently this book is not as simple, or as obvious as either group would tell you. In fact, I found this book to be quite complex, if one read it (or should one say, &quot;studied&quot;) the book carefully. I would say that one has here three, or possibly four or more, &quot;books&quot; combined in one.First we have a book of &quot;scientific information or facts.&quot; I found no criticism of these facts in the one star ratings. The facts are clear, complete, well reasearched and well referenced for those who wish to look further. Clearly this &quot;book&quot; deserves a five+ star rating.Another book is based on the &quot;choice of facts to present.&quot; Some people may be unhappy that facts they would include, are excluded. Is this a problem? Only if you disadgee with the clear intent/agenda of the authors. There is nothing hidden here. The authors make it clear where they stand respecting the origin, and purpose, of life. One can disagree that life has a creator or designer. But that is a different premise that the one chosen by the authors. Given their premise. I would argue that the authors chose just the right science to present and to exclude.A third book involves &quot;conclusions&quot; derived from the presented facts. The idea that our planet is privileged to both our kind of life and also to scientific discovery, and the corolary that the requirements for both are intertwined, is intriguing. Nevertheless, I must say that I am not completely convinced respecting privilege in scientific discovery but the supporting material is 100% convincing respecting our kind of life.A fourth book, if one will, involves various conclusions respecting what one might call orthodox intelligent design. Here is where prior biases and ideas will make a big difference, ranging from a perfect five to an insignificant one.

It is dense, but carefully worded AND readable.It contains over a dozen frontpieces and illustrations of books from Copernicus onward (including a page of Copernicus's Latin that was readable). The illustrations are so clear that one can do some primary research to evaluate the author's claims!Shortcomings??? The 68 pages of endnotes contains so much more than just references, that they should have been footnotes.Overall??? A Tour de Force.Remarkably the day I got the book, I found an article (dated 2/12/04) on the SETI subweb of space.com by Peter Backus where he states\\"Many believed the Earth was the center of the universe and that humans were in some way \`higher' than all other creatures. Then along came the Copernican revolution four centuries ago, and suddenly Earth shifted out of the center of the universe to take up its true position among the planets in our solar system.\\"Egads!!!, over three years after Dennis Danielson gave the plenary presentation too the AAS debunking the Copernicus myth, we have a SETI officer marching around on a myth.I joined the Racine Astronomical Society when I was thirteen (1973) and a few years later I went to a day long seminar on SETI. The optimistic picture of those days is quite different from the current state of research.I have often asked myself if I was duped back then and I feel that the answer is no. There was a lot of guessing, but it was good faith guessing. Looking at the SETI material today, my answer would be different.

Everything I heard souned fresh and was well-supported, and thus I have been eagerly awaiting its publication. Needless to say, this book has even exceeded my expectations!The Privileged Planet is a seminal contribution to the growing debate over purpose and intelligent design in the universe. Most of the action in the last few years has taken place in biology, with the inevitably rancorous debates over neo-Darwinian evolution. It's very refreshing to read a book on design that doesn't having anything to do with that debate.The list of endorsers for this book is truly impressive, so one need not take my word for it. The Privileged Planet will give many of our elite scientists a lot to discuss over the coming years.

It differs in some ways from the well known design arguments in biology, and also from the arguments for the fine-tuning of the laws of physics (although it has certain affinities with both of those arguments). The conclusion of the argument is that the universe seems designed for discovery.Unfortunately, any argument that talks about design and purpose seems to attract critics who think they can evaluate the argument simply by concocting it in their heads and citing clich&eacute;s, rather than finding out what the actual argument is. This is defensive avoidance, not intellectual engagement.I suspect the most popular avoidance strategy for dealing with Gonzalez and Richards' actual argument (and the wide ranging evidence on which it is based) will be the one-size-fits-all \\"selection effect\\" argument. But anyone who has even perused The Privileged Planet will know that the authors' fully accept the validity of this objection, and formulate their argument so it doesn't commit the fallacy described. In fact, they return to the point several times, and take account of the most recent technical descriptions of the problem. They even have an entire chapter on potential objections, and formulate the selection-effect argument in very strong terms (so as not to make it easy for themselves).One example they use is of a dandelion growing in a narrow crack in a parking lot. If it doesn't know that dandelions cast lots of seeds to the wind, so that some are bound to land in cracks in parking lots, the dandelion might mistakenly conclude that it has been intentionally planted there. In short, it would be under the illusion of a selection-effect, and should not have \\"inferred design.\\" Gonzalez and Richards understand fully that if their argument were like that, it wouldn't go anywhere. So they carefully and convincingly deal with this objection, both as it applies to local conditions that produce a habitable planet, and as it applies to the fine-tuning of the universal laws of physics. In fact, they integrate the recent insights about selection-effects into their own argument. It is the most satisfying treatment of this issue that I have seen.It causes me to cringe when I see supposed \\"critics\\" repackage an objection with no awareness that the book not only describes the objection more strongly than the \\"critic,\\" but also answers it decisively. Their argument builds on a wide range of generally accepted evidence that complex life, not merely life on Earth, must have certain characteristics within our universe. The universality of chemistry allows them to make an argument with appropriate generality. No objection that avoids this key part of their case has any relevance.And most importantly, the requirements for habitability are only one part of their argument. It's on the basis of a correlation between habitability and scientific discovery, which can also be generalized beyond our own setting, that allows them to argue for purpose.The argument in The Privileged Planet has another virtue: It's falsifiable. Find biochemically different complex, intelligent organisms thriving in a fundamentally different environment, without carbon or water, in a location that is hostile to scientific discovery, and the argument collapses. In fact, they actually offer a number of other ways to contradict or falsify their argument. If you're wondering what they are, read the book. But here's a hint: A panicky, a priori objection that doesn't engage their argument is not how you do it."},{"Title":"The Privileged Planet: How Our Place in the Cosmos is Designed for Discovery","review":"This is one of the simplest and most informative pieces of information I've come across.

Specifically, the authors argue that the conditions that make a planet conducive to producing technologically advanced life forms such as ourselves are essentially identical to the conditions needed to explore the world and the space around it. These conditions include the type and age of star, the number, type and orbits of the other planets, the presence of a satellite (our Moon) of a specific size, composition, and orbit, a location within a specific area of the Milky Way Galaxy, being located within a galaxy of a specific type, age, and location in the universe, and being in a universe where the various physical constants (gravity, electron mass, electron charge, etc...) have just the right values. The book also examines the validity of various philosophies relating to man's and Earth's place in the heavens. This book is not a direct argument for the existence of God, or some grand creator. It is an argument for order, in that it shows that the geological and cosmological factors needed for technologically advanced life such as ourselves are not that common in our galaxy, and hence advanced life itself might not be that common.

There is a spectrum of thought from the creationist through the ID theist to the evolutionary atheist.Why do the members of the same intelligent human race differ so much, both intellectually and emotionally, when presented with the same astronomical facts, including the enormous probabilities?John Price of Lutz, Florida, USA was most helpful in his review of the Privileged Planet, when he quoted Dr George Wald, Nobel Prize Winner of Harvard University.Dr Wald, who says that spontaneous generation is impossible, goes on to state, \\"I do not want to believe in God! Therefore, I choose to believe in that which I know is scientifically impossible - spontaneous generation arising to evolution\\".Human beings differ from each other at a genetic level according to the information encoded on the DNA molecules. There is encoded on to some of the DNA molecules, a set of information which causes human beings to be unbelievers in the God and Father of Jesus Christ.For this reason, a person can be convinced that the facts in the Privileged Planet do not add up to a Designer because there is a section of DNA making it impossible for that person to believe this theistic and potentially Christ revealing understanding, regardless of the power of the argument presented to them.Another person remains an evolutionist and an atheist in spite of the scientifically impossible nature of spontaneous generation, because the \\"unbelieving\\" segment of the DNA causes him or her to want to not believe in God.I think that this was the situation for the late and highly intelligent Dr George Wald.This \\"unbelieving\\" segment of DNA can be called \\"sin\\". So, sin is a piece of DNA, or many pieces of DNA, which is constantly active within the genome.The product or products of the sin DNA may or may not include protein, but the consequence of the activity of the sin genes is to force the human being to unbelief or to some form of disbelief in the risen and ascended Son of God.If \\"Life\\" is defined, for the purposes of this discussion, as being the lively & personal relationship of a human being with the God and Father of Jesus Christ, then \\"Death\\" can be considered, not only as the absence of such a relationship, but also \\"Death\\" can be found within the nucleus and the genome in the form of sin genes.To put one's faith in Jesus Christ as Lord and Saviour requires that the sin genes are somehow over-ruled within the being of the person, who did not have such faith previously.The phenomenon of re-creation or re-generation discussed in the New Testament deals with this problem.The person, who is re-created, is no longer dominated by their sin genes, such that they do not have to go on and on believing, for example, in spontaneous generation when they know that it is scientifically impossible.The counterpart to the DNA is the divine nature, otherwise known as \\"spirit\\". This spirit or \\"spermatozoon\\" from the divine nature, when deposited by the Designer into a human being, results in the hitherto total domination by the sin genes being overcome and nullified.The result is that the person, for example, who did not want to believe in God and was consequently forced to go on and on believing in the scientifically impossible, is now able to believe in the Designer of the universe and in the Creator of bio-nature, and is able to put their faith in him as their Lord and Saviour, Jesus Christ.This line of thinking helps me to understand a persisting phenomenon: How it is that human beings are never convinced by enormous probabilities that the Universe was designed and not chanced into existence."},{"Title":"The Privileged Planet: How Our Place in the Cosmos is Designed for Discovery","review":"The arguments in this book were covered with more humor and in less space by Voltaire:&quot;Master Pangloss taught the metaphysico-theologo cosmolonigology. He could prove to admiration that there is no effect without a cause; and, that in this best of all possible worlds, the Baron's castle was the most magnificent of all castles, and My Lady the best of all possible baronesses.&quot;'It is demonstrable,' said he, 'that things cannot be otherwise than as they are; for as all things have been created for some end, they must necessarily be created for the best end. Observe, for instance, the nose is formed for spectacles, therefore we wear spectacles. The legs are visibly designed for stockings, accordingly we wear stockings. Stones were made to be hewn and to construct castles, therefore My Lord has a magnificent castle; for the greatest baron in the province ought to be the best lodged. Swine were intended to be eaten, therefore we eat pork all the year round: and they, who assert that everything is right, do not express themselves correctly; they should say that everything is best.'&quot; -- Candide, ch. 1Even my ten-year-old can see through such stuff. Once when we were talking about vegetarians I asked her why animals are made out of meat if we aren't supposed to eat them? I guess you need a Ph.D. to take that question seriously.Our planet hosts all kinds of life -- including organisms that live in environments we could not survive in -- and as far as we know none of those species contemplates the meaning of their existence or their place in the universe. What do we have in common with them? Were they put here for us to eat? Or perhaps are we just one example, out of millions, of an organism that has gradually EVOLVED and ADAPTED TO our environment? When the environment was less compatible with our species other organisms adapted and thrived.Right now we have exactly ONE data point for life of any kind in the universe: our own planet. That one point supports the hypothesis that our planet is somehow uniquely blessed with the ability to support life. It also supports the hypothesis that we just haven't discovered any other planets supporting life because they are all too far away for us to observe. Drawing conclusions from a single data point is not science."},{"Title":"The Privileged Planet: How Our Place in the Cosmos is Designed for Discovery","review":"The proponents of this Intelligent Design worldview based book and some reviewers here see this book as a breath of fresh air to put purpose back into a directionless, material based culture. The first premise that evolution,Copernicus and science has taken away our purpose in life is not valid to me.Science has only enhanced our understanding of life and it's task is not to provide a purpose in our lives because like religion that is a subjective experience. Science explains how things work and does not presume to answer why we are here.I think that the philosophy of this book and other ID dogma does the opposite of restoring a purposeful based view of life. It only prolongs our self-absorbed human culture...the sense of being divinely ordained to be the center of the world...it keeps us in a immature state of infantile narcissism.Everything then was created just for us. Believers are superior to athesists and agnostics,Christians are superior to non-Christians, Americans are superior to other cultures and now the ego even goes out further... the earth was designed and placed so humans(specifically Judeo-Christians) could appear,evolve and be the priviledged observers of the cosmos and discover the creator.That is absurd and ludicrous to propose such a thing in a universe with literally billions of galaxies and nearly 15 billion years old. In the midst of all that space, how likely is it that the lifeforms on one tiny orbital body would have the \\"truth\\" nailed down in their corner. Why do we arrogantly presume to know \\"absolute\\" truth when we do not have access to all information in a universe that is larger than our human minds can hardly grasp.This inflated hubris of elevating ourselves...the EGO,over everything is one of the reasons we have so many problems in this world.We are here now, we are alive and cognizant. Our atoms and molecules will one day make up something or someone else in the universe. It is an endless continum. What we need is a more humble,inclusive and awe inspiring perspective on our part in the universe and how we and all life are interconnected through the distant and immense evolultionary journey of time and biology. Maybe if we had a more realistic respect for all of life then would do a better job of preserving it.If there is a life force and \\"purpose\\" that is behind it all, I believe it would have to be grandly more sophisticated and breathtaking than the ludicrous cartoon characters in most religious texts and the hypothosis of this book."},{"Title":"The Privileged Planet: How Our Place in the Cosmos is Designed for Discovery","review":"This work is a good overview of the science of astrobiology but not as good as Rare Earth.

The vast majority of scientists, especially those in biology related fields, do not believe that I.D. is a scientific hypothesis.This is because I.D., which is essentially just a renamed version of Creationism designed so that it could be snuck into public schools. The federal court decision in \\"Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District\\" ruled that I.D. was religious and just a poorly disguised form of Creationism.

This is dishonest and unscientific."},{"Title":"The Privileged Planet: How Our Place in the Cosmos is Designed for Discovery","review":"Guillermo Gonzalez (an astronomer) and Jay W. Richards (a theologian), in their book The Privileged Planet, attempt to convince us that the planet Earth is in a privileged position in the Universe-and that it is so because it is \\"intelligently designed.\\" Without getting into the poverty of the whole ID reaction to enlightened science, we can judge this book on its own. Except for a few trivial \\"in passing\\" notes on \\"biodiversity,\\" the astronomer and theologian never mention biology. Instead remaining fixated on Earth's location in the galaxy, like a couple of real estate agents chanting, Location, location, location.The authors reject the notion of panspermia (343-345). Panspermia is the idea that life came to this planet from somewhere else in space, either in chunks of rock (meteorites) or in specks of dust (comet tails). They argue that the odds of organic material A) surviving the expulsion from a planetary body into space; and B) the survival of same in space, are vanishingly small. Between the heat and shock of ejection and the radiation of space, nothing, they argue, could survive. They're probably correct.But The Privileged Planet is marked by deep flaws, namely an ingrained anthropocentrism and a lack of imagination. Because of Earth's position in space, they say, \\"Mankind is unusually well positioned to decipher the cosmos\\" and that \\"the conditions allowing for intelligent life on Earth also make our planet strangely well suited for viewing and analyzing the universe\\" (x). In other words, our place on Earth gives us the ability to judge the rest of the Universe, and Gonzales and Richards find it lacking in the conditions they deem necessary for intelligent life. If there is intelligent out there, they argue, it'll be just like us: it will... enjoy a clear vantage point for searching the cosmos, and maybe even for finding us\\" (xi). Why this assumption that intelligent life will necessarily be looking outwards? Is human intelligence really the only possible measure of intelligence in the Universe? Isn't it possible that other forms of intelligence-and I'm thinking of something specifically introverted or inwards-looking-could exist out there?This lack of imagination, and its correlative anthropocentrism, is similar to the idea that pervades histories of science and philosophy in general: forget the ancient Chinese, the ancient Indian, the ancient cultures of the Pacific and the Americas: science and philosophy started with the Greeks. Why? Because their science and philosophy are like \\"ours\\". Gonzalez and Richards betray this bias when they write that \\"a planet in a giant molecular cloud in a spiral arm might be a good place to learn about star formation and interstellar chemistry, but observers there would find the distant universe to be hidden from view. In contrast, Earth offers surprisingly good views of the distant and nearby universe while providing an effective platform for discovering the laws of physics\\" (xii-xiv). No doubt \\"the laws of physics\\" are important, but is discovering such laws the only criteria for intelligence? A race of beings in a spiral arm as Gonzalez and Richards describe might not be scientists at all: they might be poets, endlessly inspired by the spiraling clouds of gas that lit their skies.This isn't just a lack of imagination, though: it's also racism. For if the criteria of \\"intelligent life\\" is, as they claim, knowing the laws of physics and being able to make scientific discoveries, then what of many cultures here on Earth? Consider the few remaining speakers of Mura, a language family of the rainforest peoples of Amazonia. Consisting of only a few phonemes, a handful of consonants and only three vowels, these indigenes know nothing of our physics. Are they not, then, intelligent life? By the criteria set for in The Privileged Planet, the answer has to be no. Yet the indigenes of Amazonia know more about rainforest botany than anyone on Earth.Most of the stars astronomers have observed, they correctly point out, are red dwarfs, cold and inhospitable to life, while the Sun, with its relatively stable light output, is in fact rare, not, as commonly believed, small and average. True enough, but this neglects the fact that most red dwarfs passed through the Main Sequence on their way to their present condition; in other words, at some point in the past, such stars would have been, for a period of billions of years, similar to our Sun. Their argument seems to hinge on the idea that life in the Universe must all be co-temporal; if it doesn't exist in the conditions present in the Universe now, then it doesn't exist.Their anthropocentrism centers on the conditions for life, using Earth, and Earth's position in the Solar System, as a normative model. Perhaps for carbon-based life forms this is so, but it is possible that truly alien forms of life exist. The value of science fiction is in expanding the mind. We need only recall the episode of Star Trek: The Next Generation, in which a silicon-based life form on an arid planet toxic to human life, and which described humans, once the crew of the Enterprise, brilliant exo-linguists that they are, figured out what the creatures were saying, called humans \\"Ugly bags of mostly water,\\" to realize that the Universe is stranger than we can possibly imagine. The hubris of Gonzalez and Richards is in assuming that their minds can indeed wrap around all that is possible. But their minds can't even wrap around the possibility of the different kinds of intelligence right here on Earth-and they don't even mention biology. So how can they be trusted to inform us of \\"intelligent design\\" in the Universe?They can't. The Privileged Planet is a thinly disguised racist tract.

I'm not a scientist by any stretch, but I did pass some serious pre-med science classes, and I found some of the book deep enough that I could only really cover a few pages in a half hour. Other sections went by more quickly.The authors cover two tracks. The first is that the conditions that are necessary to support intelligent life are much more complex and much rarer than previously believed. The second is that creation is simultaneously designed to give us an opportunity to explore nature and learn more. As a small example, many planets' atmospheres do not have the chemical composition to support intelligent life, but ours does. And, many planets' atmospheres are opaque, eliminating the possiblility of astronomical exploration, but ours isn't.For the atheist or agnostic, I would imagine this book would give one a great deal to think about. For a person of faith, such as myself, I found that it took my relationship with God to a higher level. My praise is no longer mindless: it is a mindful wonder at the power, intelligence, and grace of the creator as reflected in the creation.This is one the very few books of which I own two copies: one to lend to friends, and another which never leaves my possession.I recommend it highly, but it's not a quick, casual read."},{"Title":"The Privileged Planet: How Our Place in the Cosmos is Designed for Discovery","review":"The book came in exceptional condition, on time, and was exactly what I had ordered."},{"Title":"The Privileged Planet: How Our Place in the Cosmos is Designed for Discovery","review":"This book should be a must read for all science students.

Their analysis of the fine-tuning of physics and the universe is thorough and provocative. They examine the makeup of the earth, it's atmosphere, it's place in our solar system, that system's place in the galaxy, and our galaxy's relation to the rest of the cosmos and build a strong case for a purposely designed universe.Yet, rather than engage the authors in thoughtful dialogue about their unique and interesting ideas, critics are attacking them for all manner of unrelated issues. Not only that, critics are levelling unfounded, serious personal attacks on them.The Spanish Inquisition has nothing on the modern day Darwinian Inquisitors. Don't dare to challenge the scientific status quo or you will find yourself the victim of an internet smear campaign to ruin your reputation and destroy your credibility.Just read the radical reviews on this page that call the authors of The Privileged Planet racist because they are challenging modern scientific dogma and you can see that their proposition has obviously undermined the materialist underpinnings of modern day science."},{"Title":"The Privileged Planet: How Our Place in the Cosmos is Designed for Discovery","review":"An awe inspiring product bearing witness to the uniqueness of planet earth in our large universe.

Well, once in a while a book is published that does just that. The Privileged Planet by Guillermo Gonzalez and Jay Richards is such a book!It has long been the contention of this reviewer that the \\"official\\" version of the Copernican Principle (CP) is in serious trouble, but that it has become so \\"dogmatised\\" that most scientists are blinded to its failures. I have written on this myself, and so was greatly encouraged to hear someone with a louder voice than mine shouting that the emperor has no clothes!Over the years, as the authors point out, CP - based predictions at one time or another have included the more or less earth-like nature of the other Solar System planets, intelligent inhabitants on these planets, (then, when the latter became untenable) abundant non-intelligent life on Mars, planetary systems closely resembling our own around most stars and an infinite, eternal, steady state universe. Not one of these predictions has survived the advance of knowledge. Yet, so entrenched has the CP dogma become that this failure is seldom even noticed. One is reminded of the story about Galileo's critics' refusal to look through his telescope at the moons of Jupiter, preferring instead to believe that the instrument was bewitched.Contrary to the popular and dogmatic interpretation of the CP, the authors convincingly argue that the earth, sun, solar system and galaxy are all anomalous in a number of ways. In one sense, this statement is trivial. Every individual will be \\"anomalous\\" in some sense, just because it IS an individual. There will be no two absolutely identical peas in the same pod. The authors readily admit this, but the real force of their argument is the growing realisation that the anomalies to which they refer all conspire (though sometimes in subtle ways) to render our position in the universe unusually - and possibly uniquely - suitable for the habitation of complex forms of life. This is becoming a growing conviction amongst many who look dispassionately at the evidence, but here the authors take a further step and demonstrate that the same factors which ensure this anomalous property of habitability, also ensure the equally anomalous property of providing a planetary platform from where the nature of the universe can be discerned by creatures with the intelligence to do so and with the curiosity to so desire. There is no logical or physical necessity why these two properties should occur together. But if they did not, our intellectual life would be much poorer and our curiosity would never find adequate fulfilment.I believe that the authors' argument could also be extended to include aesthetics and (in a broad sense) spirituality. It seems to me that many of the most awe-inspiring phenomena either are, or are consequences of, the very factors which rendered our planet habitable. Great mountain ranges, for example, inspire feelings of awe in just about everybody. They awaken within us appreciation of the beautiful and the sublime. Yet ours is the only known planet which has true mountain ranges; the consequence of continuing plate tectonics - a process which is also vital in maintaining earth's habitability.Some other examples are volcanoes, the large moon, perfect solar eclipses, meteors, comets, meteor storms, earthquakes, storms and lighting. The march of discovery has shown that a world without any of these would be a world without life, yet the connection with habitability is often subtle and is in no way associated with the awe that these events have aroused throughout history. We may also point out that this awe has often been sublimated into the sphere of the religious, as these events have often been seen as (or as intimately associated with) supernatural beings. Ultimately, some of these phenomena have even played a role in arousing a sense of divine transcendence.Other phenomena which arouse similar (though perhaps not so extreme) sensations seem to be associated more specifically with the property of our world as a platform of discovery. Two good examples are rainbows and the Milky Way band, as readers of the book will be quick to see.Perhaps a future monograph by the authors will develop this line of thought further.The authors conclude that the convergence of features which enable both terrestrial habitability and scientific discovery are too improbable to be merely results of random accidents. We are here, in short, because some greater Intelligence planned it. Not only that, but this Intelligence has also placed us where we can gain the greatest knowledge of the universe. Perhaps this is why we are willing to expend so much time, effort and finance on scientific endeavour, much of which has no obvious survival value for the species. This makes sense though, if we have been \\"made\\" for it - if we have been specially endowed with the emotion of curiosity and placed in a region of the universe where this can best be sated.But may this appearance of design be only illusory?The authors conclude against this alternative, arguing their case largely through the use of William Demski's concept of \\"specified complexity\\" and the intuitively apparent but difficult-to-define concept of \\"value\\".This could, I think, have been beneficially expanded by incorporating the design argument of philosopher, the late Richard Taylor. Very briefly, Taylor argued that if something appears to be purposeful and does actually fulfil that purpose, it is irrational to deny the presence of design in that object.This proves fatal to the popular argument by Richard Dawkins and others that, given sufficient time, an appearance indistinguishable from design will inevitably emerge. For example, he argues that a sufficiently large number of apes playing with computer keyboards will eventually come up with an encyclopaedia. Dawkins' argument fails however, to appreciate that an encyclopaedia is more than a complicated ensemble of words. Its real significance lies not in its complexity, but in its role as a store and transmitter of specific information in an intelligible manner. Thus, if I wished to learn about Charles Darwin, for example, I can open the encyclopaedia at the \\"Ds\\", go down to \\"Darwin, Charles\\" and read the article, confident that what I read is at least tolerably valid.But I can only have this faith in the encyclopaedia article if I know that it was written by someone who had adequately researched the life of the naturalist. I could have no such confidence if there was any possibility that the article was the random product of apes playing with keyboards! Indeed, it would then be irrational to suppose that the article contained any truth whatsoever.If I harboured any such suspicions, I could go to other (and trusted!) authorities on Darwin or even undertake my own research and if the information I gleaned through these methods corresponded to a reasonable degree with that in the encyclopaedia article, then I could conclude (indeed, I would be logically forced to conclude) that the encyclopaedia article was indeed the product of a designing intelligence and not the work of blind chance!There is no direct causal link between Darwin's life and an article on the same. The only link possible is through the operation of an intelligent mind - the mind of the encyclopaedia article's author.Similarly, if we and our position in the universe are simply the product of chance, there seems to be no reason why the supposed facts that we read from the study of science should be any more accurate than the printout from an ape's game with the keyboard. In other words, there would seem to be no reason why the universe should be intelligible to the human mind. Still less, would we expect that our (or any) position in the universe should be conducive to scientific discovery. But, just as we could prove that the encyclopaedia article was the product of intelligent design by \\"checking\\" its content against other research, so we can confirm the emerging understanding of the universe by comparing the findings of one line of scientific research with that of another. Significantly, we do really find that the various lines converge. Our understanding of the sub-atomic level and of cosmology (the two extreme ends of the scale) both tell the same story as to the nature of physical reality, and the \\"in-between\\" realms such as chemistry and biology all yield results that fit together like a grand jigsaw puzzle of knowledge.Scientific curiosity seems to be a human drive almost as basic as hunger and sex, but unlike these, it is largely devoid of survival value. Certainly, knowing what plants are edible and which are poisonous has survival value, but knowing the composition of a red dwarf star has not. Curiosity at this level is (to borrow Aldous Huxley\\"s phrase) \\"a biological luxury\\", yet, we seem to have been set up in just the region of space where we can enjoy this \\"luxury\\" to the maximum.I should mention that Huxley actually used this phrase to refer to our heightened sense of colour. That too is not necessary for survival, but it is beneficial to our sense of beauty and to the consequent development of art. As mentioned earlier, our place in the scheme of things also appears to have been designed for the exercise of this \\"luxury\\" as well. (Of course, both are \\"luxuries\\" only for purely biological entities. From a strictly Darwinian viewpoint they are hard to explain, but they make perfect sense if we are also \\"spiritual\\" beings in the sense of possessing intellectual, aesthetic and religious faculties, whose existence depends upon the will of an intelligent Designer).I hope that this book will help trigger the paradigm shift that is so long overdue. If I must be critical of anything, it is merely that the copious notes were given as endnotes and not as footnotes. This made it too easy to lose the place!But that is hardly a serious criticism. In short, I do more than recommend this book. I appeal for it to be required reading for anyone with even the slightest interest in science or philosophy."},{"Title":"The Privileged Planet: How Our Place in the Cosmos is Designed for Discovery","review":"One of the most extraordinary things about The Privileged Planet is the maturity of the argument. This is evident not only in the deep and broad array of empirical evidence its authors marshall as evidence of a correlation between life and discovery, but also in the many objections the authors anticipate and soundly refute. It reads as if the authors were writing a second edition after spending years on the lecture circuit in the refining fire of repeated question-and-answer sessions. One instance will serve to suggest the strength of the many objections Gonzalez and Richards thoughtfully consider: &quot;How can you have a correlation with a sample size of one?&quot; A good question. The only inhabited planet we have to go on is the earth. But, as the two authors note, their case isn't based strictly on the particulars of earth and its inhabitants. For instance, they make a detailed case that any organic life elsewhere in the universe will take a form roughly similar to earth's (at least at the biochemical level), life based on water and carbon. (Incidentally, that's conventional wisdom in astrobiology, not the puddleglummish opinion of an anomolous few.) They also make a thorough case that technological life will need a planet similar to earth. They don't assume this point: the provide abundant evidence for it. One can disregard their evidence or dismiss it out of hand, but for all that, it remains in the book waiting for objective, thoughtful scientists to consider and even extend.From these twin conclusions the authors go on to scrutinize a range of environments beyond earth, availing themselves of the wealth of information pouring into astrobiology during the last several decades, particularly the last few years. They conclude their response to this objection with examples like the following: thanks to insights provided by stellar astrophysics and climatology, we can ask whether an earth-like planet around an M dwarf star is more or less habitable and more or less conducive to making discoveries than here on Earth.The various chapters of the book offer countless such examples of close, empirical treatment of the hypothesis of a correlation between life and discovery. And yet one could also object that whatever environment we found ourselves in, we would find examples conducive to its measurability. A good point, but guess what? They deal with it.Certainly, there are numerous questions raised by the book's thesis; these questions and the authors' trenchant, scientifically and philosophically rigorous answers make up the contents of this groundbreaking work."},{"Title":"The Privileged Planet: How Our Place in the Cosmos is Designed for Discovery","review":"Almost two years ago now, my ex-father-in-law (who is a fundamentalist Christian) gave me a copy of this renowned book on Intelligent Design theory, The Privileged Planet. My father-in-law was no doubt hoping it would \\"shed some light\\" to help me with my \\"atheistic troubles,\\" but I am sorry to disappoint him, it hasn't. The work was composed by one scientist and a theologian, Guillermo Gonzales Ph.D and Jay Richards Ph.D. I read the book cover to cover and I must say, for a book by theists, I was pleasantly surprised. It was an easy, non-boring, and even compelling read. I found myself picking up bits of scientific data that really complimented my own knowledge of our planet and solar system. While the book has a mild progressive creationist overtone, it does not come off as most creationist books do, with the stench of intolerance towards reason, nor with the usual conspiracy theorizing about atheist scientists covering up evidences for design in nature. The work is very scientifically charged, and not counting the occasional logically strained point and religiously influenced wishful thinking, the book keeps itself as a good presentation of the facts of the natural world, particularly astronomy.As far as its arguments for a supernatural creator are concerned, I have no compliments to give. When all the hoopla is pulled back, the book is simply another squint at trying to strengthen the old creationist argument of statistical improbability, suggesting that the odds are too great against the possibility of a universe like ours forming by naturalistic processes without a guiding intelligence. In the book's introduction, the authors utilized what I felt was a good illustration in a clever, but futile attempt to support their creationism; in order for a laptop computer to be the best on the market, it must demonstrate the best compromise between features: the proportionally best price, ideal screen size, proper key size, processor speed and memory, peripherals, the right weight, and ergonomic user-friendliness in general. The best laptop is the one with the best compromise. Likewise, the earth's position in the cosmos is the best compromise for life, stellar observation, and the acquiring of scientific knowledge. Said the authors, \\"earth's conditions allow for a stunning diversity of measurements, from cosmology and galactic astronomy, to stellar physics and geophysics\\" (xiii). The world was supposed to be discovered and investigated, say they. God put us here to do scientific research and flush out the details of his creation. How unoriginal!I will keep this review short for a woeful lack of space, and because creationist claims like this have been refuted by good minds long ago...First, this book does what all books of the genre do--they try to demonstrate why the earth must have been designed by a designer, but ignore altogether the fact that the complex mind who was responsible for it all must himself have been designed as well, given the premise of the teleological argument: \\"every design must have a designer.\\" The authors chalk this up to a mere \\"philosophical issue,\\" not realizing that consideration of it is pertinent to their argument, and therefore, should have been deemed relevant, even imperative to discuss!Second, the book suffers from what I refer to as the design theorist's ultimate intellectual fallacy: design theorists always follow the illusion of design. They awake each day to a world with one large moon, spinning around our middleweight sun on the outermost arms of the solar system. They look around to see a planet that is intricate and diverse, and they naturally find ways to understand how things work, all the while not seeing that if they were theists born on a distant, alien world with three smaller moons, deep within the solar system instead of on the fringes of it, circling a star not like our own, they would be finding a whole different set of \\"designs\\" which would tell them that their planet and solar system are also \\"privileged\\" with habitability. Theists should learn that we adapted to our environment first. Our environment did not adapt to us, and it is flatly naive and unwarranted to think that it was created for us. The natural world is responsible for our existence. We fit into it because we evolved from it. Saying that the universe was designed for man is like saying that river beds were designed just wide enough for the rivers! Just like this illustration, theists are royally confused when it comes to causality arrangements!The third and final criticism is that the book doesn't deal very well with another serious criticism: if intelligent, sentient life was intended for the universe, why is the universe so void of intelligent life? We only know of one small speck of a planet containing life capable of discovering anything. With great difficulty, I could possibly come around to understanding a universe filled with beings made to learn from a creator, but never could I come to grips with just one planet out of countless lifeless ones in a universe big enough to hold a googol such worlds. It is precisely because the universe is so barren and hostile to life that theistic design contentions appear as bankrupt as they do. This observation alone throws a huge monkey wrench into the machine of intelligent design theory.What tickles me more than anything else in analyzing creationist literature is that the creationists themselves are intelligent and well educated people (most of them anyway), yet they put this intelligence to work trying to get everyone to believe what any hillbilly will believe without any education whatsoever--that a ghost made the world!This reminds me of the old adage about the savage, the watch, and the theist...Show a savage a watch and ask him what makes it go, and he will say, \\"a spirit.\\" Show a theist the world and ask him what makes it go, and he will say, \\"a spirit.\\"Overall, the book is a good presentation and summation of a great many science facts, as well as the theistic and atheistic side of the notion of Intelligent Design.(JH)www.ministerturnsatheist.org"},{"Title":"The Privileged Planet: How Our Place in the Cosmos is Designed for Discovery","review":"I really appreciated the work & thought that went into this book.

This is a weak link for them, which has been pricked by authos such as Kenneth R. Miller in Finding Darwin's God."},{"Title":"The Privileged Planet: How Our Place in the Cosmos is Designed for Discovery","review":"I got this book as soon as it became available, so I thought I'd be the first one to write a review. I've followed the debates over design and fine tuning for a while, and had heard this book was in the pipeline. I am thoroughly impressed with the clarity of its argument, the elegance of its prose, and the staggering level of scholarship displayed in its pages. I have no doubt that it will raise the level of debate on the larger issues about the meaning of it all. The book is richly illustrated with both color and black and white pictures.Gonzalez and Richards' (G and R) argument is something that, so far as I know, has not really been discussed before, namely, that the universe is fine-tuned for scientific discovery itself. This is a completely new angle. But the book is more than an argument for purpose in the universe. In fact, in many ways, it's a sweeping overview of the history of scientific discovery itself.I would like to say something about the Publishers Weekly review that is posted on Amazon.com. It's baffling. I thought Publishers Weekly reviews were supposed to be more or less descriptive rather than editorial. But this review must have been written by someone who either didn't read The Privileged Planet carefully, or didn't understand the argument. First of all, the description of their treatment of habitability is inaccurate. G and R don't claim that Earth is the only habitable planet. They argue that, given what we already know about what it takes to make a habitable planet, such planets are probably rare. And they definitely don't argue that just because the Earth is well suited for life, therefore it was designed. In fact, they go to great lengths to show why that's not a very good argument.The reviewer also misunderstood the central point of the book, or what the authors call \\"the correlation between habitability and measurability.\\" In fact, the review turns the very thesis of the book into an afterthought: &quot;In addition, the authors contend, the universe itself is designed for discovery.&quot; Huh? That's the point of the book, and it is developed and reiterated many times, so I don't know how a reviewer could miss it. The argument is fairly straightforward: the (universal) requirements for complex observers like human beings also provide the best (overall) places for making scientific discoveries. In other words, observers (embodied observers, anyway) will find themselves in the best places for making various significant kinds of scientific discoveries. Some of their examples, like eclipses, are, frankly, a little eerie. The rarity of conditions for complex life is one of the premises of their argument for purpose, but it's not the only premise.Finally, the Publishers Weekly reviewer warns readers &quot;that the vast majority of scientists reject the intelligent design argument.&quot; Why would that be in a review? Did the reviewer poll all scientists? And which intelligent design argument is he referring to? There's more than one. In the ancient world there was Plato's, Cicero's and Thomas Aquinas'. In the 19th century, there was William Paley's. In recent years, there have been design arguments from Michael Denton, Michael Behe and William Dembski in biology, to John Barrow, Frank Tipler, John Leslie, and others in physics. The argument in The Privileged Planet is related to these arguments, but it is also different. Even those who are critical of design arguments in biology might like the argument in The Privileged Planet, since it has to do with the design of the universe as a whole, and not with individual items within the universe. It's most related to the fine-tuning arguments in physics, but it deals with a new class of evidence. I don't think their argument would differ if Darwin's theory of evolution were true in all its details. In any case, the book should be judged on its own merits, and not just lumped in with a generic and somewhat dismissive phrase like \\"the intelligent design argument.\\"Finally, how can a reviewer make bald assertions about the general reception of an argument which isn't even known yet? (The Publishers Weekly review came out before the book was even available at Amazon.com.) Is he clairvoyant?I do hope that readers will read the book for themselves. And I also hope that future reviews will be more careful in how they describe this important and inspiring book."},{"Title":"The Privileged Planet: How Our Place in the Cosmos is Designed for Discovery","review":"Co-authored by two Discovery Institute Fellows, astronomer Guillermo Gonzalez and philosopher Jay W. Richards, The Privileged Planet presents a new form of design argument which can be applied to the level of the cosmos. Design proponents have long held that the physical constants of nature and properties of our solar system appear finely tuned and specified to allow for advanced life. But Richards and Gonzalez take this argument to a new level by arguing that the same set of circumstances which permit advanced life are also optimized for a range of scientific discoveries.Chapter eight, for instance, centers on research by Gonzalez that was featured in a cover story of Scientific American in 2001. Like our solar system's habitable zone, our galaxy has a habitable zone as well. This broken ring roughly have way from the galaxy's center is far enough away from the radiation-filled center of the galaxy, between its radiation-filled spiral arms, but not so far out that it lacks the heavy elements needed for terrestrial planets like Earth. This location is also well situated for making a range of scientific discovery. While other locations might allow improved observation of this or that feature, the Galactic Habitable Zone offers an overall better location for a range of important scientific observations. This is but one of many instances of what seems to be a consistent correlation between the requirements for life and the requirements for scientific discovery.But any book coauthored by a philosopher must investigate the philosophical implications. Richards and Gonzalez recounts that a historical myth developed, according to which, when it was discovered that the Earth was neither the center of the Solar System nor the Universe, Earth became insignificant. This mythology was popularized by materialists like Carl Sagan who preferred to portray Earth to the public as just a lucky but insignificant pale blue dot floating through the uncaring depths of space.The Privileged Planet argues that there is a weak historical and theological basis for the claim that Christianity requires Earth to be at the center of the action. Moreover, there is a growing body of scientific evidence from a range of disciplines showing that great care and intelligent design was taken in our cosmic placement. According to the evidence cited in the book, both the design of cosmic laws and the specific architecture of our solar system, including the sizes and relationship of Earth and moon, permit the existence of advanced life with the opportunities to make profound scientific discoveries."},{"Title":"The Privileged Planet: How Our Place in the Cosmos is Designed for Discovery","review":"The two halves of this book are markedly different. In the first half, the authors recount many facts and figures from the sciences, mostly astronomy. This half is readable, but the details require close attention. Some reviewers have complained that the book contains factual errors but have not said what they are. Considering the huge amount of material covered, it would be surprising if there were not a few errors. Not being an expert, I can only assume that most of the facts are correctly stated.The second half is philosophical, treating things like the \\"Copernican principle\\" and the implications of the scientific findings. Naturally, this half is not restricted to hard data, but includes the authors' views of what the data imply. Many philosophically illiterate writers stumble on this ground, but G&R; show considerable savvy.Many outspoken scientists say that scientific findings imply that God does not exist, or that human beings are merely the last freakish product of the hurrying of matter; these authors disagree. If your mind is made up that only the former philosophy is legitimate, there is no use reading this book. If you would like to read a well-informed and reasonable defense of the latter position, this book is a good start."},{"Title":"The Privileged Planet: How Our Place in the Cosmos is Designed for Discovery","review":"I first heard Guillermo Gonzalez present his ideas about our place in the universe being designed to facilitate scientific discovery at a conference at Yale in the fall of 2000. For me this was the high point of the conference. Jay Richards and Guillermo have since developed this idea, providing numerous lines of evidence to show that without a host of contingent facts being just-so, our scientific understanding would be impossible or severely attenuated.The idea that the world and features of it are designed to help us understand the world and those features constitutes a remarkable insight. Gonzalez and Richards apply this insight mainly at the level of cosmology and astrophysics. But it promises to apply also in biology. Indeed, some preliminary work in the bioinformatics literature is suggesting that biological systems contain information of no functional use to the organism as such, but information that is useful to the investigator in examining the organism and trying to understand it.The Privileged Planet breaks new ground. Einstein found it incomprehensible why the world should be comprehensible. Gonzalez and Richards begin to provide an answer to Einstein's perplexity."},{"Title":"The Privileged Planet: How Our Place in the Cosmos is Designed for Discovery","review":"Science is not supposed to answer questions of \\"why?\\" Only the \\"what?\\" questions are considered acceptable grist for the scientific mill. Unfortunately for traditional science, the \\"why?\\" questions are some of the most important and intriguing. For example, Einstein was continually puzzled by the fact that humans can understand what are biologically irrelevant phenomena (e.g., black holes). Indeed, what survival value is linked to our ability to investigate and understand aspects of the universe beyond this earth? We can easily propagate this planet without knowing Earth is part of a solar system which in turn is part of a galaxy system. This ability has no evolutionary value, yet our ability to know persists and even grows. So, what's up?Richards and Gonzalez have an intriguing answer to a troubling question: Why is Earth so well-suited for complex life and observation of the universe by its inhabitants? More critically, is there evidence, scientific evidence, to suggest design-a purpose that explains more than the sheer permutations and probabilities which allow for complex life-form existence?Guillermo Gonzalez (Ph.D., Washington), Astrobiologist, and Jay W. Richards, Philosopher (Ph.D., Princeton), seem to be obsessed with finding some sort of reason behind irregular phenomena. They seems particularly obsessed with challenging some fundamental principles of scientific investigation. Not all obsessions are bad, and when coupled with premise challenges, they can be mind-boggling. Such is the case with The Privileged Planet.Copernicus discovered the Earth was not the center of the solar system, and certainly not the center of the universe. But the medicine we ingested intellectually to avoid the toxicity of anthrocentrism has had a negative side effect-we have assumed, unnecessarily according to Richards and Gonzalez, that the Earth is not special. Sagan called it a little blue dot in a vast cosmic arena. Sagan is clearly right quantitatively, but qualitatively? Perhaps there is more to the Earth than its size.Qualitatively, why is the Earth so well configured for life? Theists, of course, have a ready answer. But, science normally leans on the huge ledge of time which affords google-sized permutation possibilities. \\"Why?\\" is not a particularly popular nor socially-appropriate question to be asked by a scientist. Some fear losing their credibility by asking \\"Why?\\"Richards & Gonzalez are fearless. Challenging traditional premises, they re-examine the empirical record in biology, chemistry, astrobiology, and especially physics. A rather startling conclusion accumulatively emerges: rather than being a pale blue dot insignificantly placed in a galaxy, evidence supports a quite different conclusion-the Earth is uniquely positioned to support complex life, and-here's the real news-uniquely positioned to observe the universe. Einstein was puzzled that humans have such ability; it is a challenge for biologists as well. Just what is the survival value of being able to understand, for example, a black hole?Scientists who assumed a deity are not unusual; Newton, Pascal, Copernicus, and Einstein are just a few of the more famous. But, today is different. Deity is neither a premise nor a possibility in traditional science. And to be fair, Richards and Gonzalez are not arguing for deity, per se, but arguing that the empirical evidence of life, chemistry, astrobiology, and especially physics accumulatively suggest purpose, not random permutation.Amidst the evidence supporting a purposeful design is the rather startling precision of the relationship between the moon's mass/distance from the Earth and mass/distance from the sun. One scholar extols, \\"were it not for the moon, we would not be.\\" In fact, Gonzalez discovered that the size of the moon is precisely what allows solar eclipses to be scientifically rich experiments. If it were slightly smaller, or larger, we could not observe solar flares (and starlight bending from the sun's mass, a major confirmation of Einstein's theory of relativity). Furthermore, it is the moon's precise mass that stabilizes the Earth's axis to maintain a temperate climate whereby complex life forms can exist.Richards and Gonzalez continued to reveal a variety of accumulated evidence which supports two pillars of thought: (1) the Earth is particularly well-suited for complex life forms, and (2) the Earth is particularly well-suited for observation. Specifically, Gonzalez argues that both sides of the equation must be considered; i.e., not only the number of possibilities, but also the number of factors that must be precisely \\"in tune\\" to support complex life-forms and an observational platform. Small changes in just one factor (e.g., gravity) remove all possibilities of complex life. And there are more than a score of factors which must be precisely tuned not only to a given level, but also tuned systemically with all the other factors. It turns out the probability for a well-suited environment for observing complex life-forms trumps the \\"other side of the equation.\\"The debate will continue, and it should. After all, there are few questions more important than \\"purpose.\\" To be driven by purpose is one definition of obsession, and Richards and Gonzalez are obsessed. Perhaps we too need to be obsessed-as scholars we have some work to do. Surely, there is more to our purpose than mere propagation.D.

I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"The Privileged Planet: How Our Place in the Cosmos is Designed for Discovery","review":"_The Privileged Planet: How Our Place in the Cosmos is Designed for Discovery_ by astronomer and physicist Guillermo Gonzalez and Jay Richards of the Discovery Institute provides a fascinating account of how some of the more recent developments at the frontiers of science have made possible a revival of the \\"design argument\\". In viewing earth from space, two emotional reactions are found to occur in many sensitive people. The first may be called the \\"pale blue dot\\" reaction (described by Carl Sagan) that we occupy an extremely obscure and miniscule location of the universe and that \\"we are not special\\". This view became popular for a time because discoveries in science (in particular astronomy and cosmology) seemed to indicate that such a view was appropriate. The second type of reaction is the more religious reaction - a recognition of our importance in the cosmos. For a long time it was believed that this reaction was discredited and that we were ultimately a meaningless speck in the universe; however, recent discoveries have not only made such a reaction viable, but have also seemed to show that it is the appropriate one. It should be noted though that both such reactions are ultimately rooted in feelings (thus, the reply of \\"wishful thinking\\" applies to both and thus cannot be used as a criticism of one or the other). The central thesis of this book is that unlike the picture presented of earth as the \\"pale blue dot\\" (which still seems to hold sway among many scientists, materialists, and some sector of the educated population) that actually earth may better be understood as occupying a unique place in the cosmos that is in fact \\"designed for discovery\\". The authors divide this book into three basic sections: the first deals with our local environment (the earth itself and the solar system), the second deals with the broader universe (the Milky Way galaxy, our galactic cluster, and the universe itself), the third deals with some implications of this (such as implications for the search for intelligent life in the universe (SETI) as well as design and the anthropic principle). Indeed, it seems to be a central contention of this book that the design inference (often believed to be discredited) is making a comeback and may even play some role in the science (particularly cosmology) of the future (barring a materialist take-over of science, of course).The authors begin by considering our local environment (earth itself and the solar system) and how it supports the role of life and our ability to discover facts about the universe. For example, the fact that the earth has a moon and that together the sun and moon give rise to \\"eclipses\\" as seen from earth has allowed scientists to further our knowledge about the fundamental laws of physics. For one thing, this has enabled us to learn more about the sun itself. But, even more amazingly eclipses have allowed for an experimental test of Einstein's theory of relativity (thus furthering our understanding of physical law). The authors next consider life itself as a \\"data recorder\\", allowing one to understand the earth through the presence of life. The authors note the important role that carbon plays in life. They consider the possibility of other radically different forms of life (perhaps an extrapolation based on the \\"extremophiles\\" found on earth) such as silicon-based life, but they find the case for such life problematic. (It cannot be ruled out a priori of course but there are some good reasons to think it may not exist.) The authors also note the importance of water in the maintaining of life. To support their understanding of life they quote extensively from the important works of biochemist Michael Denton who has done important research in this area. Following this, the authors consider the case of the earth itself, noting how various aspects of the earth (such as its climate and geological structure) allow for the possibility of life (i.e. habitability). The authors quote from the work of James Lovelock and mention the \\"Gaia hypothesis\\" (which they appear to admire but find problematic in certain ways). The authors also have an interesting take on the subject of \\"global warming\\" and climate change. They regard much of the global warming hysteria to be overblown and believe that in fact carbon dioxide emissions may enable civilization rather than ultimately destroy it. The authors also make an important distinction between simple, complex, and technological life and note the apparent uniqueness of earth in this respect. Following this the authors finally turn their attention to the heavens. They note the importance of meteorites for studying the composition of the solar system. They mention the idea of the \\"panspermia hypothesis\\"; however, they find this to be somewhat problematic. They also note the importance of earth's place in the solar system, as well as the apparent fact that contrary to original expectations in early times it is now believed that earth is the sole planet in the solar system with life (barring the possibility of some very simple forms of life on other planets). The authors next turn their attention to the \\"pale blue dot\\" idea, noting the importance of the moon for earth, but also considering the widely regarded claim that moons may provide a source of life. They also consider some of the other planets in the solar system. The authors next consider the importance of our neighboring planets for enabling discovery on earth. Following this the authors turn their attention to the broader universe. The authors consider the role of other stars, how the sun has certain unique aspects, our place in the galaxy and the fact that such a location is important for life, the role of the Milky Way galaxy (and how the galaxy itself has certain characteristics which are unique for life), and the broader universe. The authors consider our place in cosmic time (the importance of such for life) as well as the idea that our universe itself is \\"fine-tuned\\" for discovery (certain cosmological constants are just right to enable life to exist). The authors also consider the possibility that our universe itself is not unique but note the problematic for such a possibility. Finally, the authors turn their attention to some of the implications of all this. First, they provide a revisionist history of the Copernican discovery that the earth was not the center of the cosmos. This revisionist history shows how much of the myth surrounding the Copernican discovery is unwarranted and ultimately based on a false understanding of history. The authors then consider the extended Copernican principle itself (the idea that we are not special). They show that such a principle is ultimately rooted in dogma or merely assumed a priori and fails the test of empirical investigation. The authors then consider a possible way around these difficulties (the anthropic principle); however, they show why this is problematic in many respects. Following this, the authors consider what this has to say for SETI, and the apparent failure of SETI. They consider Fermi's paradox as offering a significant challenge to much of SETI. They also present several seemingly obscure arguments (such as the so-called \\"Doomsday Argument\\") against ETI; however, ultimately it should be noted that while these arguments may weaken the case for ETI they cannot ultimately eliminate the possibility (as the authors duly note). The authors also note the religious overtones of SETI, noting the fiction of Carl Sagan in this respect. Following this, the authors turn to the issue of design. They regard design as having been unduly dismissed by science prematurely. Individuals such as William Dembski have made the design argument viable again and it may indeed have a role to play in the science of the future. Interestingly, the authors note that many scientists themselves are so prejudiced against the notion that they have gone out of their way to avoid it. For example, Hawking has resorted to certain highly questionable assumptions to avoid it. On the other hand, individuals such as William Lane Craig have attempted to make the point for it. Finally, the authors consider the skeptical rejoinder to their arguments. In two appendices, the authors explain the revised Drake equation and reconsider the panspermia idea.This book is an absolutely fascinating study of our place in the cosmos. Further, it shows how developments at the very forefront of science and cosmology have brought back the design argument and how such an argument may have a unique role to play in the science of the future (provided that it is not stifled by a dogmatic materialist opposition). For those grappling with the issues of man's role in the universe in light of modern science, this book is sure to be an important read."},{"Title":"The Privileged Planet: How Our Place in the Cosmos is Designed for Discovery","review":"I am a practicing physician.

Then imagine that there are three times as many that you haven't heard because they were too bizarre or off-color. Joan Rivers has put all these and more that you could never dream up in this short biographical sketch of her quintessential loose woman Heidi Abromowitz.Divided into twelve chapters with titles that range from Baby Bimbo to Hooker Housewife, Joan Rivers will introduce you to a wonderful collection of jokes about tramps, tarts, and teasers.Written at the height of the sexual revolution just before the recognition of the AIDS epidemic, some of the references to penicillin-treatable STDs may seem a bit insensitive by today's standards. While there is much in this book that will be humorous to the liberated reader, there is still plenty to upset the proper reader and the politically-correct."},{"Title":"The Life and Hard Times of Heidi Abromowitz","review":"\\"The Life and Hard Times of Heidi Abromowitz,\\" by Joan Rivers, is the alleged biography of the sexually adventurous woman of the title. The book features illustrations by James Sherman. As comedienne Rivers writes, Heidi was a tramp from day one: \\"She did things with her pacifier that most women still haven't done with their husbands.\\" The book has a copyright date of 1984, and the Dell paperback is dated 1985. It's good-natured, dirty fun.The book charts Heidi's sexually promiscuous life from babyhood through elementary school, high school, and adulthood. Rivers covers such milestones as a sex-filled trip to Europe. Interspersed throughout the book are supplements like a page from Heidi's fouth-grade diary, a list of her favorite films (including \\"Easy Rider\\" and \\"Anything Goes\\"), etc.Quite a bit of the humor stems from Heidi's tendence to spread sexually transmitted diseases. This is very much a pre-AIDS sex comedy, and the STD related humor may leave a bad taste in the mouth of some readers. Still, the book is entertaining, and Heidi comes off as a likeable free spirit who lives life on her own terms; she may have something in common with HBO's \\"Sex and the City\\" women.

Humans before Humanity is thoroughly engaging to both the general reader (myself included) and to the novice in the fields of anthropology, palaeontology, evolutionist, primatologist, geneticist and others. The book is entirely refreshing in its approach and in the discussion of theories relating to the origins, developments, morphology and extinction of the humans before humanity-the common ancestors of modern humans.The book is organised in a novel (at least to me) way of answering pertinent questions relating to humans. These are questions like, among others, What are human beings; Why Africa; Why are humans so rare in evolution. Each chapter is an intellectual journey with highly scientific approaches, with ample evidences and empirical basis. One such theoretical discussion was on the developments of the large human brains. He summoned theories relating to sociality of the apes (human ancestors) to explain why humans evolved large brains. He also gave a statistical discussion on co-relation of brain size (and all the other mathematical methods of measuring brain size) to sociality. What was most interesting and enlightening was a cost and benefit analysis of large brains, explaining why other apes do not have brains as large as humans, if such large brains were so beneficial.Throughout the book, especially the later part, Foley summons the cost and benefit approach to explain most characteristics of humans. This is a highly structured way of making sense of the most perplexing questions relating to human evolution. It was the economics of evolution. He also used this approach to explain why other animals did not evolve the way humans did. This approach was used in explaining bipedalism, hominid reproduction, hominid social complexes and others.The last chapter, I feel, is the chapter worth reading more than any other books in anthropology and evolution. The last chapter answers the question: Does evolution really matter? He sums up the book by exploring the origins of language, culture and cognition. The most annoying yet important debate of nature vs nurture (biology vs culture) is also treated albeit in a brief way and not revealing any bias to one side. His last discussion is a cogent intellectual call to separate consequences from causes. He argues that human evolution has been highly magnificent and even grand-like because of the benefit of hindsight. But it does not warrant grand causes like creationist theories, aquatic theories and other blinding-flash theories, which gave man what he has today. His coup de grace in this scientifically intellectual book, is by saying that during the course of human evolution, \\"nothing very much happened\\".In the plethora of books with the purpose of introducing the reader with the latest theories of human evolution, this book ranks as one of the best. Foley is careful to focus squarely on fossils and scientific theories and not on magnificently wonderful ideas, with hardly any scientific basis. I would recommend this book to all who wish to understand the origins of humans and our ape ancestors. It is a totally intellectual creation-the book that is."},{"Title":"Humans Before Humanity: An Evolutionary Perspective","review":"Foley manages to say quite a bit in this 200 page book about anthropology, evolution, and a little about sociology too. He addresses not only the mainstream but some peripheral issues as well. All in all he covers a wide range of issues intelligently and resourcefully. The text is harmoniously augmented and complimented by great graphics and charts as well, rendering what I thought was an informative, entertaining, and credible exposition of an often dry and soporific subject matter.The other reviewer who rates this book one star was obviously way over reacting to some comments by Foley in the opening pages of the book that address the scientifically outdated Boas/Mead SSSM (Standard Social Science Model). This book's strength should be measured by its anthropological relevancy, not the brief, although likely accurate assessment of a paradigm shift away from obsolete social theories toward the more current genetically based models, which is more of a fait accompli than a debate. Foley's pot shots at literary post modernist meddling in the hard sciences is certainly not unwarranted, nor is his de rigour lecture about the idiocy of the religious right verses biological evolution. These are two pretty common and valid criticisms.Foley does join the status quo and endorse the out of Africa theory, but does give some air time to the likes of Van Daniken and the more credible but still fringe Elaine Morgan. He does this I think to contrast how much has been learned and set into a defined scientific context about the still swampy opaqueness that temporal extension tends to create in anthropology, especially in light of the more anthropocentric critics and cranks that this particular science naturally attracts.In any event, he proceeds, workman like, to cover the known artifactual and statistical data regarding bipedalism, its concomitant anatomical morphology, classification schemas &amp; lineages, tool usage, radiations, African Eve, allometric neural evolution, etc. I particular enjoyed his discussion of allometric neural evolution and the encephalization quotient statistical model, and their correlation to intelligence relative to the putative survival characteristics of now extinct hominids.Foley sums up with the cultural considerations of art, langauge, and agriculture. He poses all of his survey in an evolutionary context and never wavers from a most scientific consideration of all the material he analyzes. This book is a thorough, fast paced perusal of anthropology as it stands today (or in 1995 as it were) and helped me to syncretize what can be a daunting ocean of a most dense and often impenetrable science."},{"Title":"The First Two Years (Living Books)","review":"My wife and I are getting ready for our first baby, so I am on the lookout for any and all books that can prepare us for all aspects of parenthood (i.e., medical, psychological, and logistical issues).

At the same time, Amelia's spouse John, who has been chronicling the Holmes cases, is heading to France to provide lectures on the great sleuth.

Yet, Colonel Jaime Wolf continued to hold some of the Clan standards including adding in bondsman from the Clans themselves. This led to the Civil War fought on the Wolf's Dragoons homeplanet of Outreach. The story is fascinating and fun! If you love mercenaries you will enjoy this book."},{"Title":"Wolf Pack (Battletech # 4) (Vol 4)","review":"WOW! This is a exellent book. Who knew that the Wolf's Dragoons were from the clans. Not me, until I read the book. This book takes over a little from the book Wolves on the Border, but just a little. The battle for control of the Dragoons is realistic and seams to based on some true life family."},{"Title":"Wolf Pack (Battletech # 4) (Vol 4)","review":"Yes! More of Wolf's Dragoons. This book details the civil war within the Dragoons during the Clan Truce of Tukayyid. New Dragoons are introduced who will play minor parts in later Battletech novels. Personally, I think Robert Charette ranks pretty high up on the list of good Battletech authors. Wolves on the Border and Heir to the Dragon are also good books of his that detail the history of the Dragoons and the Kuritas during earlier conflicts."},{"Title":"Wolf Pack (Battletech # 4) (Vol 4)","review":"This book is very well written, and very easy to follow. The only recommendation I have is read the &quot;Blood of Kerensky&quot; series by Michael Stackpole for clearification of the clan invasion."},{"Title":"Wolf Pack (Battletech # 4) (Vol 4)","review":"When the chips where down Wolf's Dragoons did the job and where the best .

I'm sure they will enjoy it eventually. I bought it instead of a FP book that was not available."},{"Title":"Big Book of Things That Go","review":"I bought this for my 6-yr-old son. He loves it.

Some of the vehicles seem a little dated to me (it was published in 1995), but my son thinks they're all great."},{"Title":"Big Book of Things That Go","review":"My 3 year-old is addicted to anything that has wheels and he loves to look at the vehicles in this book."},{"Title":"Big Book of Things That Go","review":"We have had this book for over three months and he still looks at it every day (which is hard to find!). A great purchase."},{"Title":"Big Book of Things That Go","review":"My nephew is two and loves this book! He can anme almost everything in the book as we point ot it and becuse the pictures are actual photos, he recognizes them when we are out.

So big and colorful. Love them."},{"Title":"Big Book of Things That Go","review":"Both of my 6 year old and my 2.5 year old sons love this book. They are lovers of anything that goes. They never get tired of looking at the brightly colored photographs and hearing the descriptions of the vehicles."},{"Title":"Big Book of Things That Go","review":"I saw these reviews when I logged on to purchase a new copy of this great book. This is certainly one of the best books in the toddler's picture-book genre. My 3 year old son has loved this book since he was 2. My experience is similar to other reviewers. My son has memorized every picture and word of text in the book, and recites the detailed text verbatim, and wants to review the book with me cover to cover almost every night. I now know more about road-building heavy equipment than I ever cared to know."},{"Title":"Big Book of Things That Go","review":"I am another parent who has to buy a second copy of this book because my young toddler has destroyed his first copy by looking at it and carrying it around day and night. One caveat for those with small children, and one for those with older ones: the names of many of the things that go are long and complicated for little ones to learn; and the book was written for a British market, so some of the names, items and vehicles are not equivalent to the American ones (many examples of this on the \\"Emergency Vehicles\\" pages), which I imagine older boys may find confusing or irritating. But overall, it's the pictures that they'll love and keep coming back to, not the words. I'm constantly amazed at how my son's interest in this book never flags. Myself, I am heartily sick of it. But here I am on Amazon buying another copy, and was amused to see that so many other parents had had to do the same -- and it's not a badly constructed book! It has a hard cover and good-quality pages. They've just had to take a lot of punishment, and our copy's now made more of tape than of paper..."},{"Title":"Big Book of Things That Go","review":"This is one of my girls' favorite books, beloved for years. Its been popular with any kid that visits as well, except for the pink-and-ruffles crowd."},{"Title":"Big Book of Things That Go","review":"I just wanted to give this book some credit for being my favorite book when I was a boy. At four years through 10 years I would read this book and look at the pictures almost every night. It's a great book and would recommend it to anyone. I am now 16 and can't give it enough credit."},{"Title":"Big Book of Things That Go","review":"This along with the train book were my son's two favorite gifts! He knows every bit of this book from cover to cover."},{"Title":"Big Book of Things That Go","review":"My now 2-year old son was 17 months when he first spotted this book at a garage sale. It turned out to be quite possibly the best $1.50 ever spent on him. Over the past six months he has memorized all of the vehicles as well as managed to rip out out 75% of the book. Not that he seems to care -- though the majority of pictures were ripped out, it remained his favorite book. I finally bought him another book, a new one, to start fresh. Worth every penny."},{"Title":"Big Book of Things That Go","review":"This book is great for any boy who loves trucks.

We have owned this book since he was 18 months when we found it in a consignment store. Every page is taped down the center to help it get through the excitement he feels when looking at the working trucks. It has a fantastic collection of working trucks, i.e. excavators, dump trucks, road equipment; as well as every other kind of vehicle. His friends are thrilled each time they look through it and I fear for the books pages and am beginning to think we may need a second copy. If you have a little one who likes trains, planes, boats, trucks or cars he will love this book."},{"Title":"Big Book of Things That Go","review":"This book was and continues to be a favorite of my two sons (ages 2 and 5). Each page includes several clear, colorful photographs of all types of vehicles on land, sea and air. Short descriptions of their use or how they move are included. Not recommended as a bedtime story though, since it can be quite stimulating."},{"Title":"Big Book of Things That Go","review":"In my preschool classroom of 4 year olds this book is the VERY favorite of all the boys. In fact, after about 6 months it is falling apart through considerable use and I need to order another. They huddle around it on the floor and pour over the pictures talking excitedly and naming all the cars, planes etc. A few children have shown it to their moms and asked to have one at home. You won't miss if you get this one!"},{"Title":"Big Book of Things That Go","review":"A nice book for younger children (maybee 2-5 years) with big bright pictures of common and &quot;extreme&quot; machines including boats, cars, construction, emergency, planes, trains and more.The text for each picture is concise and to the point - keeps things fast paced."},{"Title":"Big Book of Things That Go","review":"I have an almost 2 year old little boy who goes \\"gaga\\" for anything with wheels. We read it every day.It helps that each 2-page spread has a theme \\"Emergency Vehicles\\", \\"Construction\\", \\"Farming\\", etc. This encourages discussions of vehicles in context and helps little ones eek out what does what. I would wait to introduce to toddlers under 15 months b/c the pages are paper and easily torn by eager little readers.This book is one of his all-time favorite and we actually have banned it from being a bedtime book because it causes way too much excitement to be sleep inducing.You can't go wrong having this book in your toddler's library."},{"Title":"Big Book of Things That Go","review":"I bought this for my 3 year old nephew. My brother is a mechanic so he loves cars , tractors , buses ,anything in Daddy's shop. This has a brief paragraph about every automobile I can think of.

Close but not quite right. The introduction is the best part of the book. That and the picture on the book cover. This book is a collection of previously published essays and magazine stories. Two times too much for most of them. A mundane, wordy chronicle of action sports and poetry by a dilettante who is forever quoting his poet soul brother, rainer maria rilke, another dabbler who perfected the art of guesting and frivolous flitting about under the guise of meaningful experience. This book has nothing new to say. Second hand and second rate."},{"Title":"An Unexpected Joy: The Gift of Parenting a Challenging Child","review":"A friend from church gave this book to my wife to read. Roughly two weeks before that, my son was diagnosed with a mild form of autism. This struck a big blow to me as a father. After reading the book, my wife told me I needed to read it. While I read it, I was transported into Mary Sharp's world as she raised her son. It dealt with many of the issues and questions we had about ourselves and our future. Though not a \\"text book\\" like some other books that deal with Autism, \\"An Unexpected Joy\\" deals with the emotional struggles that they faced. I could definitely relate as we have been facing the some of the same issues. I would recommend this to any parent, especially those with \\"normal\\" kids, because it helps you understand those special ones."},{"Title":"An Unexpected Joy: The Gift of Parenting a Challenging Child","review":"The life and world Dr. Sharp writes of is incredibly isolating, but the moments of grace experienced give insight into all of us. Her experiences mirror my family's, but she found the words we have struggled to identify due to exhaustion. Sleep is not for the weak, it is for the survivors. Those with special needs children will, hopefully, see themselves and know they are not alone. Those with friends with children with special needs will see their friends, and know in some small way just what a blessing their relationships are to these families. Those who have limited interaction or understanding of special needs families may gain some understanding and compassion for those so challenged. And those who provide help, via therapists, babysitting, house cleaning, dog walking, anything, may finally know just what angels they are."},{"Title":"An Unexpected Joy: The Gift of Parenting a Challenging Child","review":"this book had just about everything in it that I am going threw love this book so much.

She is about to blow up ... move over Mayo Angelou - there is a new poet on the scene and her name is Stacey McAdoo!One of my favorite chapters was the mental illness, this was very heart touching and on the real. I felt that she really bared her soul and enlightened the Black community that no it's not limited to the white community...it's right in our family and all of us need to be aware of this illness and take a stand. And stop acting like it doesn't exist because it's real...Stacey is a very talented writer and this book had me in tears."},{"Title":"Baring My Soul","review":"The book definitely wears the title well.

Many of you who take this journey with her, may not be able to relate to her experiences, but you can learn from them. Mrs. McAdoo puts herself out there on the line in ways most people wouldn't dream about. It was refreshing to see someone who has nothing to hide and her words may well force you to deal with difficulties of your own. Wonderful job!"},{"Title":"Baring My Soul","review":"I really enjoyed the book. When I need a reality check or some uplifting, I pick up the book and re-read specific chapters. The book \\"Baring My Soul\\" is very inspirational. It made me laugh, cry and go hmmmmmmm! I am waiting on \\"Baring My Soul II\\" because I feel that there was so much yet to be told and now I would like to know about how Stacey & her family have dealt with the loss of her brother."},{"Title":"Baring My Soul","review":"In a crowded airport, as I sat impatiently awaiting my delayed flight, I began to read \\"Baring My Soul\\". I thought I was just going to skim through a couple of pages and just sorta waste time. I bought the book outta of support and because of a referral, without having a clue as to what it was going to be about. And boy, was I in for a shocker. The people at the airport probably thought I was CRAZY because I was literally talking outloud. I finished the entire book at the airport...and it is the best book I've ever read. I'm going to re-read it so that I can let certain parts soak in and make sure I didn't miss anything! Stacey is one extraordinary lady...and a BADDDDD [meaning good] writer! Good luck and I wish you much success."},{"Title":"Baring My Soul","review":"I loved this book. I initially sat down to read a couple of chapters, and before I knew it, I was through! I thought the book was intelligently written, yet at the same time, it was written in a &quot;down to earth&quot; understandable language where everyone could relate and comprehend. The whole time I was reading, I just kept shaking my head and thinking to myself, &quot;this sister is deep&quot;. At times I found myself talking outloud to the book...lots of the stuff I just couldn't believe! This book stirred up a lot of emotions...I often found myself getting angry, crying and even laughing. This is a heavy book and everyone should buy a copy. (I wish I could convey that my momma, my sister and my daddy - because right now it's rotating through my family!)"},{"Title":"Baring My Soul","review":"I could really relate to this book - especially the ongoing battles with mental illness. But what I especially loved about the book was Stacey's writing finesse. I liked the highs and the lows. Just when I'd complete one chapter, I'd sigh with relief and think &quot;alright - everything's gonna be okay&quot; and then before you know it, my adrenaline's pumping again. And somehow in between all these wrenched events, she still finds room for humor. This is a really powerful book... a definite must read!"},{"Title":"Baring My Soul","review":"I hate to admit this, especially since I am a writer, but I hardly ever read.

I read &quot;To my daughter with Love&quot;, &quot;Real men don't cry&quot; and &quot;Marriage isn't logical&quot;. ... She moves and the strength I sense through her words is so refreshing and energizing. And at the same time the humble way she admit that her thoughts today will, most likely, not be those of tomorrow... That (to me) puts into perspective the necessity of admitting that one can be gauging life in a way that makes total sense today and then understanding tomorrow, with a new &quot;lighting&quot;, that adjustment must be done. I see it everywhere... In my own vision and evolution and in the surroundings. I love her style."},{"Title":"Baring My Soul","review":"Stacey candidly brings to life her personal experiences in such a way that makes you feel as though your homegirl, best friend, big sister or even the girl next door, is giving you the unadulterated truth about life and its highs and lows.

Anyone who has ever been in love, pain, hurt, happiness, joy or anger can relate."},{"Title":"Baring My Soul","review":"Stacey McAdoo reminds me so much of Maya Angelou. Maya once said that she would tell the truth...even if it was painful to do so--that you can succeed inspite of and because of your past. And Stacey James McAdoo, as evident through her honestly written and truthly told memoir &quot;Baring My Soul&quot;, is living proof...and I hope she becomes as sucessful as Maya."},{"Title":"Baring My Soul","review":"A friend of my purchased a book and originally I read portions of her. And it was so good that I had to buy one myself. I really enjoyed reading this book. Mrs. McAdoo undertook a huge project to write about, with such honesty and bravery, subject matters that many of us only whisper about. And while I found the entire book interesting and a page turner, I especially liked the section on race relations or &quot;Black &amp; White&quot; and &quot;White Privilege&quot; as they were respectively entitled. I think it's sad that in this day and time, we still have a race problem. I also found myself saying &quot;Amen&quot; during the &quot;Real Men Don't Cry&quot; chapter and laughing during the &quot;Marriage Isn't Logical&quot; section. This was a great read. Stacey is an excellent writer and I can't wait to read more of her work."},{"Title":"Baring My Soul","review":"If the book &quot;Baring My Soul&quot; by Stacey James McAdoo was to be made into a television series, it would define the true meaning of &quot;reality&quot; television and open the door for more of the kind to follow! Stacey tears down walls and barriers to let nothing but the truth - plain and simple - come barreling through. I could definitely appreciate the raw and intense honesty delivered by Stacey when sharing of her brother's bout with manic depression and the effects this mental illness had on her and her family. The incidence of mental illness is more prevalent in our society than we may want to admit and we can not afford to turn a deaf ear to it. In her &quot;non-mincing of the truth&quot; style, Stacey brings the message home with a distinct IN YO FACE delivery.Thank you Stacey for exposing yourself and allowing me to get to know you on a more real and peronable level. Your memoir further drives the point home for me that we all have a story we MUST tell!"},{"Title":"Baring My Soul","review":"At times I felt like I was invading Stacey's privacy...&quot;Baring My Soul&quot; read like a journal, a dairy.

This book tells the story of Stan Dale and the Yali tribe as cultures clash and the Gospel wins over the hearts of fierce and cruel warriors, whose enjoyment is to shoot so many arrows into a victim to porcupine him or her, and then eat with relish the corpse of a victim. These people are so entralled to their spirits that any violation of taboo was punished by death. Women were also excluded from all rituals and religion and deemed unclean. Into this walks Stan Dale charging forward with fortitude determination and a total reliance on God. Winning a few young converts coupled with tortuous hard labor to construct a basic airstrip, Dale and a friend were martyred. Then through a total act of Providence, God intervened miraculously and revival swept the Yali people at the same spot where the two missionaries were killed and dismembered by the appearance of a little missionary boy and his protection by a wise old man. You must read this book to find out what happens. After all is revealed, you will see the Hand of God, protecting Stan Dale and his family in a very humourous manner based on mistaken identity.This book will give you a taste of the challenges in reaching a lost world. It is still going on today with organizations such as the New Tribes Mission whose missionaries were recently martyred in the Philippines. Truly amazing real-life stories."},{"Title":"Lords of the earth","review":"This was an exciting book to read, not just for the exotic setting in remote Irian Jaya, not just for the odd social Yali customs, not just for the bravery and determination of the missionaries who lived among these cannibalistic people, but because Richardson is a superb storyteller who knows how to blend fascinating tales with a good dash of suspense. It took very little effort to read this book as I was so caught up in the story that it was hard to put down. Recommended reading."},{"Title":"Lords of the earth","review":"\\"Lords of the Earth\\" is the term the Yali warriors use to describe themselves. They live in the Heluk valley in Irian Jaya, and the only knowledge of them to reach the outside world are the dark rumors of the cannibals beyond the mountains. The first section of the book is about them, their customs, and the awful fear and darkness they lived in. Don Richardson does a great job portraying a people bound by chains of sin, and longing for release. The horror of their pain is graphic, and not suitable to be read to younger children.The second part of the book describes the early life of Stan Dale, his conversion, and his burden for those in darkness. He is drawn as a determined man, physically strong and fit, with firm convictions.The book goes on to tell of Stan's coming to the Yali people. How a strange story begins over his identity, protecting his life. How the first few Yali Christians were killed, and later Stan and a fellow missionary were brutally murdered. How another missionary family died in a plane crash, except for the nine-year-old son, whose friendship with the Yali paves the way for them to turn to Christ.The book reminded me Christ's words in John 12:24, \\"Verily, verily, I say unto you, Except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die, it abideth alone: but if it die, it bringeth forth much fruit.\\" On earth, Stan Dale never saw the fruit his life and death brought forth, but he will rejoice in heaven with the Yali that are there through his witness."},{"Title":"Lords of the earth","review":"This book is probably the best I have read. It puts you in the picture with excelent detail yet easy to read. Not to mention the real life suspense of the Yali mountain tribe people and the sheer guts and determination of missonary Stan Dale. If Speilberg wants to make another great movie like Schindlers List, this would have to be it."},{"Title":"Lords of the earth","review":"My heart was torn apart as I read the story of the Yali people. This is one of those 'I can't put it down' books. I'm still somewhat smitten in my heart over the price these missionaries paid and the intense need for the gospel these people so desperately demonstrated. God help us to heed the call to go into all the world."},{"Title":"Lords of the earth","review":"lords of the earth is an excellent book! every time i read it i am amazed at God's grace and divine providence. don richardson is an excellent writer. his vivid description makes this amazing true story come to life. i've read it several times, and each time i just can't put it down."},{"Title":"Lords of the earth","review":"This is an incredible true story of a man passionate to reach for Christ those who have never heard. It also clearly illustrates the darkness, evil and despair that comes from idolatry. But it also shows the true liberation and freedom that can come only for Christ. This book will draw you in from the first page.The world needs more people like Stan. People who are willing to trust solely in God and how are willing to go to dangerous remote areas to share Christ. This book will shatter your complaceny and force you to think. I highly recommend this book. For all Christians, but especially those (like me) who have heart for missions. This book details the good, the bad, and the ugly of missions work."},{"Title":"Lords of the earth","review":"The surprising gift of this book is the introduction (for me, at least) to Stan Dale, a missionary of heroic proportions. In the flesh, Dale is portrayed as a resolute and courageous ironman; in the spiritual, he's portrayed as a giant. Inspiring, in that regard. I presume that Richardson's knowledge of some of the actions/thoughts etc. of the indigenous peoples are from hearsay and speculation (I don't know this to be true), and the writing style certainly seemed to be more sentimental in those portions of the book. Even so, this is worth the reading."},{"Title":"Lords of the earth","review":"This book is one of the best I've ever read. I rarely sit for an entire day to read a book but I just couldn't stop reading. Mr. Richardson starts by explaining the culture of the Yali tribe, then moves to the life and background of Stan Dale. Seeing the providence of God at work as the third part brings the Yali tribe and Stan Dale together is remarkable. Stan Dale's conviction, comittment, and compassion is something to inspire any believer concerned with spreading the Gospel of Jesus Christ."},{"Title":"Lords of the earth","review":"It is a very rare book that can move me to tears. This was so realistic, and so inspiring, I am recommending it to everybody I know"},{"Title":"Lords of the earth","review":"God indeed loves all people and in spite of our rejection of Him for aeons of time, He still provided a way for us to be reconciled to him. Even these remote people groups who lived in darkness for generations have within their own traditions a key to the redemption available through Jesus Christ. And Don Richardson is a powerful story teller. He draws the reader in and holds him spell-bound to the very end.Christians Awake! Read and weap over the lethargy of our generation in taking the Gospel message to the uttermost parts of the earth! Rise up and Go!"},{"Title":"Lords of the earth","review":"Lords of the Earth by Don Richardson, published in 1977, is a spellbinding account of missionary Stan Dale and Bruno deLeeuw (and others) who entered the remote world of the Yali cannibals of Irian Jaya Indonesia to share the gospel of Jesus Christ. The Yali called themselves \\"men of power....lords of the earth.\\" As the introduction states: \\"Yali males bowed to no one and needed nothing.\\"Stan, fearless in the face of incredible danger - boldly entered the remote Heluk Valley and lived among the Yali tribe with his gentle fellow missionary, Bruno. Later Stan's wife and four children join them. They had no idea how complex and hazardous their journey would be.This beautifully written book describes the Yali tribe and their beliefs in kembu spirits which required rituals to cleanse and initiate young boys into the fraternity of the male tribal leaders. Kembu also required the sacrifice/killing of any female straying on to sacred ground as well as sacrifice/killing for other offenses against kembu laws.Stan Dale's childhood abuse by his atheistic drunken father and bullying by his school mates fueled his determination to learn how to be strong.

Though the title and sub-title may sound a little over the top, the story itself is a well-written account of the strengths and weaknesses of Stan Dale as he ministered in an extremely difficult mission field. It was a great reminder of the tremendous work that the Lord is accomplishing in far off places. I enjoyed the book and would highly recommend it.I would caution that some of the details of the violent culture of the Yali are a bit more graphic than your typical missionary biography. However, I didn't feel that they were gratuitous details, but rather, the author used these incidents to show how depraved the Yali society was without God."},{"Title":"Lords of the earth","review":"I bought this book for my mom.

It was not an easy read as many of the things in it are difficult to hear. It is an incredible story though, and worth reading."},{"Title":"Lords of the earth","review":"The effect of Christian missionaries on indigenous cultures is a very controversial subject, and I'm not really sure where I stand. I was hoping this book would help me make a decision, but I think now I'm even more uncertain. Throughout the story I could not decide if what Stan and his team were doing was a good thing or a bad thing. Near the beginning I perceived him rather negatively, but as the story went along, I began to feel greater sympathy for him and his cause and near the end felt like, though they may have had some negative effects, the ultimate effect was good, especially the apparent liberation from an \\"oppressive, deadly religion\\".And then I read the epilogue. I really wonder why Richardson put this here in the manner presented. It pretty much tells just another tale of a way of life destroyed forever and forced into the modern world that it isn't made to be a part of, causing supreme detriment. This basically destroys every prior notion I held of Stan and his team having a positive effect despite the damage done in the story. However, Richardson does all this in two pages and doesn't make the connection to Stan, basically telling the reader that Stan's effect was good so that these people can face the modern world with the goodness of Christianity, etc. But I wonder, did Richardson neglect the details of someone else interfering, or is it Stan and his team who cause this destruction?If you believe the tribes have gained eternal life, then I suppose the issue is settled. But if you're not so sure and/or you think any damage done could be justified by the \\"hope of eternal life\\", then it's not so clear. And I know Richardson's position of: someone's going into these tribes, isn't it best that good people go in first? That's a respectable position, I suppose, but there is enough controversy that I can't decide where to stand on the issue.As a side note on the book, one thing I wonder is how exactly Richardson reads peoples minds like only God or a novel writer could do. This also really brings into question for me just how legitimate this account is, or whether he tried his best to convey what he thought they would be thinking, or if he was inspired by the holy spirit to write something otherwise unknowable to his mind, or if maybe some of this is \\"his interpretation\\" made to make the story read more like an interesting novel.Whatever the case, Lords of the Earth is an interesting story and a worth-while read, but is the effect of the missionaries detailed good or bad? Some of both for sure, but ultimately (and regardless of this accounts reliability), who knows?"},{"Title":"The Feldman method: The words and working philosophy of the world's greatest insurance salesman","review":"I bought this book 20 years ago & was just thumbing through my copy. Ben Feldman was a master salesman and proved it in this book. For his time, Feldman produced staggering sales figures. These were mostly sales of whole life policies packaged to presented to business owners. The sales techniques and Feldmanisms are easily transferable to today's selling and also transferable to the selling of any product. He took a boring product like whole life insurance and made it brain dead obvious that you should own it. Spend the money. Get the book.

At the core of Feldman's philosophy are the two key issues:1. identifying problems people face and creating packaged solutions to those problems, and2. articulating the problem in such a way that the prospect has to acknowledge the real consequences of the problem.This book is no silver bullet (although if you sell insurance its about as close as you're ever going to come).

However, they are iterated in such a way - coming from a reputable and successful source - that drives home the simplicity of what is needed to be wildly successful in sales (and not just insurance sales!).Because this book is out of print, it's hard to find, and an old copy might run upwards of $30-40 or more; however, please believe me when I state in no uncertain terms that it'll be money well-spent.This book cuts through a lot of the modern-day waste, drivel and filler that lines the pages of today's sales books (possibly because it was written in 1969) and cuts right to the core of what is needed to make it.If you are fortunate enough to uncover a copy of this volume, grab it, read it, learn it, and do not give it away."},{"Title":"The Feldman method: The words and working philosophy of the world's greatest insurance salesman","review":"Ben Feldman started work at 8 am and worked form 12-16 hours a day, 6 days per week.

The stories are enriched by line drawings of Navajo artist Andy Tsihnahjinnie and commentary by Dr. Joseph Henderson on Navajo myth and legend in relation to world mythology. Further embellishing this reissuing of the 1950 publication is the biographical material written by James Schevill. There is no doubt that Margaret Schevill Link led an unusual life. Her drive to seek out the authentic content of Navajo sacred tales has left us with a treasured legacy of recordings. In addition to the tales, there are many songs and chants in the appendix, plus multiple observations of the author from her many visits to the Southwest. She wrote: &quot;The pollen path is the way between gods and men, and it expresses the harmony that should exist between them.&quot; This sacred way fascinated her and seeking it shaped her life. A contemporary, Wright, Henderson, Woelff, and Lorenzo Hubbell, trader, nurse, and philanthropist to the Navajo and Hopi tribes, Margaret Schevill Link translates the great Navajo tales of the First Worlds, the Turquoise Goddess, Changing Coyote, Earth Man, the Dreamer, and many more. The Pollen Path is a fine and beautiful collection of myth, worthy of pleasure and learning on many levels.Nancy Lorraine, Reviewer"},{"Title":"Savannah","review":"Reviewed by Mario S.

Recommended. ****"},{"Title":"Heart of a Lion","review":"The first Hillary Fields book I read was &quot;Marrying Jezebel&quot; in which I didn't really like the main characters, but the exotic locale of Egypt and the fairly fast-paced storyline kept my interest. And I liked it enough to read &quot;The Maiden's Revenge&quot; which is by far Fields best novel to date. Her male character was somewhat typical of romance novels, but Lynette Blackthorne was strong and witty. The action was well-developed and so was the romance. After reading &quot;Heart of a Lion&quot;, however, I've come to realize that all of Hillary Fields main characters are attracted to each other for physical looks only. You can counter-act this and say that Jared and Isabeau had been in love since child-hood and blah de blah, but as soon as he saw her naked it was all &quot;his blonde goddess in the glorious buff&quot;. It seemed more like he was in love with her simply because of who she had been to him and because she was beautiful. Hint to Miss Fields : Not Everyone in the World is Beautiful. She has talent as a writer and her locales are interesting, but her character developement is severely lacking. Maybe have a plain Jane attract a handsome hero for something, ANYTHING else besides her looks. I don't think I'll be purchasing her next book, but I might check it out of the library to see how she manages with her next batch of characters. However, if the hero and heroine are both beautiful people and the initial attraction is all physical, that puppy is going back! The whole storyline of &quot;Heart of a Lion&quot; was really rather ridiculous, there was no way Isabeau would have been able to keep her virginity in a harem and that just made her a far less interesting character all together, and I saw absolutely no reason for Jared and Isabeau to have fallen in love. Two stars for the more interesting romance novel setting and because the writing style made it slightly superior to most Harlequin-esque novels."},{"Title":"Heart of a Lion","review":"Reviewed by: Romance Reviews TodayP>Eight-year-old Isabeau de Lyon simply had to go into town to see the boy who was allegedly a saint. Her betrothed, sixteen-year-old Jared de Navarre would not allow it, since he had been entrusted by Isabeau's parents to watch over her. No pouting, crying, tantrums or other childlike behavior from the coddled beauty would change his mind. Naturally, that left no option but to escape into town, and Isabeau managed that on her own, never fathoming, in her little girl's mind, that she would be assaulted, injured and abducted from her luxurious home and loving family, never to return.Jared vowed to find Isabeau or die trying, and years of following empty leads eventually deposits him in Persia, where he becomes a famous and ruthless mercenary dubbed the Black Lion. His adolescent dream of finding Isabeau and going back to the life he was supposed to lead died early on, although in the far corners of his mind he has never stopped searching for the Isabeau of the golden locks and bright blue eyes.Many years later, Jared is asked to meet with a dangerous adversary who has a mission for Jared and his renegade group. The adversary is a mysterious desert warrior, the only one with perhaps a more dangerous reputation than his own. Jared has no idea that Isabeau survived her abduction years earlier, so it never occurs to him that she and his new employer are one and the same. All he knows is that the \\"Assassin\\" has bright blue eyes and an almost paranoid penchant for privacy.Isabeau cannot believe her eyes when she realizes the Black Lion is her betrothed from another lifetime. Still, she needs his assistance to help her accomplish her goals, so she cloaks herself in even greater secrecy than normal in an attempt to hide her true identity from the man she has never forgotten, or forgiven, for not saving her those many years ago. Besides her anger, though, Isabeau feels vulnerable and exposed in front of Jared, believing that if she reveals herself to him he will never be able to move past what she has had to do in order to survive.HEART OF A LION is a powerfully written, intelligently crafted romance with high intrigue and riveting suspense. Isabeau is the perfect heroine; strong and intelligent. She is a woman way beyond her time, who not only has survived the atrocities committed against her, but risen above them and triumphed like a true heroine. I love strong and independent women in historical romances, and Isabeau ranks right up there with the best of them.This story is filled with all the elements of a good book, and then some. Interesting characters, beautifully depicted scenes of life in Persia in the 13th century, true blue romance in the face of what appears to be insurmountable odds -- this is just some of what you'll find in HEART OF A LION.

Besides my married son, I still had children at home to finish raising and I was going to have a grandchild!Fay A.

It is a source of ideas that would take many years and many grandchildren to exhaust.Ms. Klingler has compiled ideas from many sources and many people and come up with a \\"Grandparenting 101\\" manual. She uses graphics to illustrate many of the ideas that are so easy to copy or tailor and modify to individual needs.One of my favorites is on page 80, \\"the paper sandwich,\\" which illustrates and describes a charming, crafty, colored paper sandwich with Grandma and Grandpa as the bread and kisses, hugs, admiration, and smiles as the meat/cheese and fixin's. She suggests tucking a $5 bill inside, too.

Albom's attempt to make a conjecture regarding the aftermath of one's life leaves much to be desired. Albom's introduction of new characters is terse and poorly developed, and although the book is designed to be a quick read, it may sometimes feel like characters are simply thrown in to meet a clandestine quota. I believe that the flaw in \\"The Five People You Meet in Heaven,\\" is largely due to the fact that it is Albom's first attempt at writing a work of fiction whereas all his prior books center largely on retelling an existing story, something that parallels Albom's occupation as a sportscaster. His nonfiction writings, particularly \\"Tuesdays With Morrie,\\" required very little creative juice, for its main appeal was its simplicity; Albom makes the mistake of using the same approach in writing this book, neglecting the fact that the current book is a different genre of literature. The majority of the characters lack vivid descriptions and remain static throughout the book, whereas the imagery he tries to paint faisl to exist. Therefore, while the characters in \\"Tuesdays with Morrie\\" evolved on their own, the characters in this present book do not, and any curious reader will walk away with a medley of unanswered questions. Albom needs to take a creative writing class before attempting another work of fiction-in the meantime, he should stick to what he has done well with in the past, namely reporting nonfiction in a simplistic, heartwarming manner."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"A lot of people think dogs don't go to heaven which really worries me.

To suggest that when you go to Heaven you are forced to relive all the pain and anguish you went through on earth PLUS find out about the others you killed/hurt that were unknown to you is irresponsible and cruel.After meeting his first person, Eddie feels responsible for his death, then again for the second's, then, to top if off, to his horror, he finds out that he was directly responsible for the death of a child. And he finds that he is responsible for these deaths when death seems like nothing more to him than waiting interminable lengths of time in a limbo where you get a taste of the love you need and then it is yanked away, you must feel anew the rejection, emotional torment and physical pain experienced on earth and are required to forgive before you go on, and you are subjected to horrifying, gruesome experiences not possible on earth, without any additional emotional capacity to handle them than what was available to you on earth.If God is my Father, and his view of me is as his beloved daughter, I refuse to even consider that this could be my fate after death. If I must explain to my sons something of the harsh realities of this world, I do it in an environment of love and support, not uncertainty, anxiety and pain.

While both books essentially deal with the afterlife, they adopt different approaches in storytelling, compelling in their won ways no less.The Lovely Bones begin with a murder of a young girl but Five people focuses on the ending - the death of a 83-year old amusement park watcher, Eddie. Putting the end at the start was no doubt a gimmick but the story unfolds. Albom tells the story of this man by replaying scenes from his various birthdays from young to old. More importantly, these are interwoven with five people the old men meets while in heaven. On his arrival in heaven, he can't seem to remember how he died or whether he did rescue the girl he last held.So begins his journey on heaven, meeting the five most pivotal persons in his life, some close to his hear while others who were strangers. More importantly, the story tells us that the people who had crossed paths with us in our lives, close or strangers, could have played a part in changing our destinies. In understanding the things that have happened, we learn to understand ourselves and those around us better. All things happen for a reason. Heaven is made out to be the place where our past life on earth unravels.What the book tries to tell us, it does very well. Ultimately, it's about letting go of the anger (\\"no one is born with anger\\")and the judgement. It's about resolution and finding peace within oneself. Learn a few words of wisdom along the way!"},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I have just turned 14years old and was very impressed with the book Albom has wrote. i have read every book he has written and everytime i feel as if i have just learned a new lesson. Again from this book i have learned a big lesson. (although i would not tell you what it is because you should really read it) Well, this book can really touch your heart. Make you realize things that didn't matter to you. well anyways, i really recommend this book to people. :^)"},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"Other reviewers have derided this book for a few reasons. One that stands out is that they disagree with the notion of a Godless, joyless Heaven. However, regardless of your conception of Heaven, I think this book is well worth reading. In short, it was an emotional journey that allows for self-inspection. I highly recommend this book and admire the author's craft. I will be buying more copies to give as gifts."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"Wow, I LOVED this story. I recommend it because it is such a small book with such a huge message. Eddie, the main character, has grown old and, carnival ride repair man that he is, he feels as though his life has not been of much use to anyone. It takes a tragic accident, an arrival in heaven, and a painful journey once there to make him believe otherwise.Five people from Eddie's life have been sent to tell him about his life and what his actions on earth meant for them during their lives, and how Eddie fits into the big picture because we are all ultimately connected to eachother. The story is soooo good because the fact that Eddie didn't really know some his &quot;people&quot; personally during his lifetime makes for some awesome twists and just reiterates Albom's concept of how we are all, knowingly or not, connected.The ending was a good one, and Eddie's fifth person will surprise you!What Albom has to say in this book is somewhat original and definitely powerful and inspiring. But what makes this man a genius is that he does all of this in 200 pages. I mean, imagine that. If you have tried to get a start on a book, or collect your thoughts, or written an essay even, you know how hard it is. Albom's story is just wonderful."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I've always been one for controversy.Not the type that makes people mad and scream and cuss, but the type that makes people take a second look at something and consider it in a way it's never been considered before.This does not mean I believe in the Heaven (or heavens) in Mitch Albom's The Five People You Meet in Heaven, but I'm glad he has taken such a sacred concept of Heaven, questioned it, and made it an entirely enlightening experience, for both the religious and non-religious.Meet Eddie. He is your typical rough-exteriored, grouchy old guy. Eddie works at an amusement park called Ruby Pier and (despite his rough exterior) the children absolutely love him, asking him to make them pipe cleaner animals all the time.But as we know, all people have a story and... well, Eddie's life was rough, lacking real meaning. And this story is his life.Only not in the typical way. When the belt on a ride scrapes loose and the ride falls, almost on a young child, Eddie pushes the child away, feeling what he believes to be her tiny hands right as he dies. He awakens in the Ruby Pier of the past, the way he remembers it when he was a kid, with old wooden teacups and vintage signs advertising things like cigars. It is there he meets the Blue Man, a sideshow freak that Eddie ran into in childhood, but never particularly knew. The Blue Man explains the impact Eddie had on his life and teaches him the 'moral of his story'. He then tells Eddie he will meet four other people (five in total) who will share him stories and will teach him lessons from those stories. Some will be people he knew, some not. But each, in some way, has been impacted by or has impacted Eddie's life. In this book, the focus of Heaven is to show that each life has some meaning.I absolutely loved this book and read it in the period of one night. In many ways, I could feel the emotions Eddie was going through as he experienced the pains and joys of reliving these past moments of his life through his spiritual guides and found much of their advice thought-provoking and soul-sustaining. The story is truly an epic in its own right -- not epic in the sense of encountering monsters and demons, but an epic in the sense that it's a story about conquering the soul. It's a journey we must all take to find meaning in our lives.I also liked how the author showed how mundane mortal life can really seem when you consider the short snippets that recall Eddie's hard life and those that show Eddie's friends undergoing sorrow in preperation for his funeral. Such segments shows that they (and in many ways, we) just don't get it.I recommend this book. It is a book I feel people will pick up again and again when they undergo many hard times and many good times. It helps us realize how important God is in our life (although he's not mentioned much in this novel) and how books like this, almost holy in nature, can help us bring us closer to him."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"This is a lovely book if you take it in the spirit in which it was written--religion/philosophy/spirituality lite. What it lacks in literary depth it makes up for in simple, honest, emotional resonance. An easy book to make fun of, and the marketing and hype will turn off NY/LA/SF cognoscenti types, but for everyone without a PhD. a highly enjoyable read. My other pick for an uplifting book is &quot;I Sleep At Red Lights: A True Story of Life After Triplets,&quot; by Bruce Stockler, a wonderful, wise and witty book about the definition of manhood--juggling career, marriage &amp; kids--that deserves to be more widely recognized."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"This is a life changing experience.

In his previous books and columns he has shown great talent in connecting the reader with real people through reflection of simple, yet very powerful, emotion. Even the most cynical make that connection because we know that the conclusions about living, loving, and the lessons of life are based on a real person, not a creation of the author.Unfortunately, the realness of Morrie is missing in Eddie, the lead character of &quot;The Five People You Meet in Heaven&quot;, and the book suffers for it. The experiences of Eddie, especially his WWII service in the Pacific, seem a little far-fetched (I mean, really, how many POWs, after being brutalized, starved for months, and forced to dig coal, ended up overpowering their captors and then burned villages on the way to being rescued?). Without a strong link to reality, Eddie never becomes the star of the story -- the skeptical reader remains aware that he is a conduit for Albom's imagination. And that makes this an OK, but not great, book. Imagine reading &quot;All I Needed to Know I Learned in Kindergarten&quot; without having gone to Kindergarten -- and you'll get the idea."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I read this story in one afternoon!

I'm also a big fan of &quot;feel-good&quot; books and movies, as a genre. This book is almost universally described as &quot;life affirming&quot;. It makes heaven seem like a wonderful place, since you meet people from your past, and learn heart-warming spiritual lessons from them in ways that you never would have expected. However, there is confusion in a couple of areas that need clarification. How can a &quot;life affirming&quot; book be promoting the idea of death (ie, going to heaven)? The author cannot have it both ways here, unless they subscribe to the strange idea that death is in some way life affirming. Also, what's the point of learning important spiritual lessons about life and about yourself when it is, by definition, too late? (ie, you're dead). This could be an OK book, but if the author were to clear up these points of confusion we'd all be better off."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"The &quot;lessons&quot; that are taught are completely uninspiring, and the view of Heaven presented in the story is actually kind of annoying."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"Mr. Album has written a story that my teen-aged daughter would be ashamed to turn into English Composition class. This book is simplistic, poorly conceived, mindless, and trite. I think maybe the wisdom in &quot;Morrie&quot; was clearly and entirely &quot;Morrie's&quot; and Mr. Albom, apparently not much of a writer based on this hackneyed attempt, was a very lucky man to have been there to record Morrie's thoughts. I strongly recommend skipping this one unless you like to be bored pretty much out of your mind. I couldn't take it, even though it's a short book. I'll say one thing though.

When he died, he learned what a horrible person he was on earth. He felt pain, sadness, and guilt in Heaven. I agree with the reviewer who said the novel should have been called \\"The Five People You Meet in Purgatory.\\"The novel was a simple story you could read in an afternoon, but it was poorly written and depressing as hell.

Maybe I will meet these people before I go and then it will be better because if I can only hang out with 5 people for eternity I want them to be 5 people I like.

His most recent novel, &quot;Zero Station,&quot; is a politically charged page-turner that pits its main Gen X character (John Saylor) against his Baby Boomer parents, teachers, etc., during the winter of 1991 -- in the heart of the Persian Gulf War. Right now, Ippolito is still a relative unknown (a friend turned me onto his work)...but this is a must-read. You can check him out and read an excerpt at:http://www.zero-station.netDon't miss it."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"What a great book! I read it all in a day, and I couldn't put it down!"},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"Before I read this book, the people I knew who had read it were firmly in one of two camps: 1) &quot;Hated it...too schmaltzy.&quot; or 2) &quot;Loved it...very inspiring and thought-provoking.&quot; Having now finished the book myself, I can clearly understand both positions. I find myself conflicted...occupying the middle ground between the &quot;love it&quot; and &quot;hate it&quot; camps.Yes, absolutely, it is schmaltzy. I sometimes found myself getting annoyed at how hard Albom was working to make me care about Eddie...to be meaningful...or to play with my emotions. And yet, there were times when I was genuinely touched by the writing or something that was happening. I really loved the ending...and that's as much as I can say I really loved.In the end, it is certainly thought-provoking in regard to his view of heaven. But I found it (at least most of it) too depressing a view of heaven...i.e., if that's what I have to look forward to, why would I want to go?"},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"Quick read. Worth buying and keeping on your shelf to read over and over."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"The book has large print, it failed to deliver a decent plot, and it was written for those who can't be bothered to think. Just one of those books written quickly for a fast buck. On the best seller list? I still can't figure out why. Save your $ and read it from the library. It will only take you 30 minutes to read it all."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I have had 3 major operations in the last 15 months and when I awoke from the first one I had a recollection of meeting up with my father who had been dead for 41 years. I'm convinced it wasn't a dream and some of the experience I had is similar to what Mitch Albom imagined. I am writing a book based on my life, medical history of the last two years and this experience. 'The Five People You Meet In Heaven' is a must read for everyone who has some belief - Mitch is not far off the mark - I've been there!"},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"Sorry, but I was not impressed with this book. At the beginning, I was sure I was going to love it. I like the set up of the old man and his last day on earth counting down. And I liked the old man, too.This is followed (of course) by the old man's death and the experience he has in heaven, which you've probably guessed is meeting five people. Anyway, at this point the book became predictable and somewhat sappy. And the worst part is that I think Albom used the Footprints in the Sand poem as the format for his book. That made it cheap to me -- not that I didn't like the poem -- but that he used someone else's idea to end the book."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I really liked this book. I read it in a day because I simply couldn't put it down. What a nice way to think of heaven."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"There is nothing I like better than to read a book about faith and spirituality (i.e. the Secret Life of Bees by Susan Monk Kidd, Peace Like a River by Leif Enger) and so with much anticipation I bought this book for our book club. From the beginning the shallowness of the main character Eddie almost smacks you in the face. He is a man disappointed in his life who has been at loose ends since his wife died. Unfortunately all of his thoughts and feelings appear contrived. Eddie is a clich&eacute; character with shallow thoughts. The plot, about Eddie's death including the five people he encounters in heaven, is totally predictable. I wish I could rhapsodize about unexpected plot twists or well-fleshed out characters, but the plot could have been written by a young child as the unfolding contained predictable people and no surprises.To be fair, many people in our book club enjoyed the book. Only a former nun and I were bothered by the shallow spirituality. One woman in our club said that Eddie's faith is the faith of a man and not a woman, and perhaps that's why it appeared so contrived and shallow. For whatever reason, I have never been as disappointed in a book as I was in this one. I read approximately 150 novels every year and have read about 6,000 novels in the past 40 years. This is the worst book I have ever read. For people who seldom read novels or are just dipping their toes into spirituality, then you may enjoy this book. For heavy readers and spirituality mature individuals, you may want to save your dollars and pass this one by."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I bought this book simply based upon the few pages that I could read off the Amazon site and I was glad I did buy it.I started reading this book at around 4:30pm this afternoon and finished it around 3 hours later. It is a short book and easy to read plus it has that \\"can't put it down\\" feel to it. In fact, I was disappointed that I had to put it down a few times when it came time to start preparing dinner.This isn't a book that challenges any theological theory on the nature of heaven but it gives an interesting perspective on what could happen when you die.The main character, Eddie, dies in an accident and the story deals with how he comes to understand the meaning of his life by meeting with 5 people whose lives intersected with his and these people then teach him a lesson from their perspective and from the part of heven they have chosen to wait for him. That is the basic plot but it is a much deeper story and to talk more about it would give it away.Even though you only get to see each of the characters that populate this view of heaven for a short time, you feel that you have known them long enough to trust them.I would recommend this book to anyone."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"This book, for me, is a difficult book to review. Without really knowing what it was about, the title (and an overhead comment or two), left me with a fair idea of the story line. Its' popularity and the previous book of Albom's that I read (\\"Tuesdays with Morrie\\") left me with high expectations. Reading the book itself, left me with a certain level of disappointment.Let me clearly state that Mitch Albom came up with a terrific idea for a hear-warming feel-good book. In fact, the idea was so good, I found myself thinking ahead to what would likely happen next. My expectations exceeded the author's delivery on at least two our of the five people whom our hero, Eddie, met in heaven. If you haven't read the book, read it. It won't take long and you'll be the better for the experience. I will not try to spoil anything for you in this review. What I will say is that the experience with the second and third person Eddie met in heaven were the primary cause of my disappointment. As far as the second person goes, the way that person chose to deal with the problem he faced left me wondering which of several other options he knowingly chose to ignore. It may have been a minor point and maybe there are some combat vets out there that have a similar story to tell. However, this reader was left with a \\"what the heck was that all about?\\" reaction. The experience with the third person was the deepest disappointment. This person comes across as a jerk. The author leads us to dislike him and then gives us a scenario that essentially changes nothing. I mean, if you are a jerk all your life and, towards the very end, you do a sort of nice thing in anger...doesn't that still mean you were a jerk all your life? The better approach to person number three would have been to reveal a story about the jerk as a child or young man and let that story tell us how an otherwise well-meaning person ended up the way he did. Then we could see from that how those events in that person's life went on to affect other people's lives. Anything but the \\"he was really trying to do something nice\\" story that we got. If you read the book, I think you understand what I'm trying to say.Person number 4 was so-so, message wise. It was persons one and five that carried the book. The strong finish made for a stronger vote (but not a \\"5 star\\"). There is an excellent message in this book but it varied in its' clarity. It was a beautiful idea for a story and I suspect most readers were thrilled not only with the possibilities but with the results as well. The greatness of Albom's book \\"Tuesdays with Morrie\\" wasn't so much about Morrie himself. It was about the notion that we all could learn so much if we just took the time to visit with those who've seen so much more of life than we have. I guess the greatness of \\"The Five People You Meet in Heaven\\" isn't so much these five people that Albom gives us. It's wondering about who our five will be and in whose life will we be one of the five."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"Another touching and thought provoking book by Albom. In my opinion not as deep or meaningful as \\"Tuesdays\\" but still an interesting perspective on the myth of heaven. This book is a quick read, but like \\"Tuesdays\\" it will make you think about your mortality and your place in the world."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I defiantly recommend this book to someone who is looking for a good book to read. This book was a page-turner because you always wanted to know who the next person Eddie was going to meet was, or what the lesson he learns is going to be. I enjoyed the style of writing and how the book was put together because it flashed back to Eddie's past birthdays and also, the chapters were about either the next person he meets in heaven or the next lesson he learns. Someone who likes fiction books would love the story because it is very well written and the author actually makes it seem real, although we all know it isn't."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"\\"The Five People You Meet in Heaven\\" starts at \\"The End\\", the first chapter of this novel. In this chapter,we read about Eddie's last few moments on Earth. Putting \\"The End\\" as the first chapter seems to symbolize Mitch Albom, the author,'s perspective on death: the death of a person does not end everything, but rather, it's a new beginning; a new beginning that gives people,Eddie in this case, the opportunity to find out what has been their purposes in life, what they had managed to accomplish. It also provided Eddie a chance to seek the answers to the questions and puzzles that had been bothering him for a major part of his life.After reading Mitch Albom's other excellent novel, \\"Tuesdays with Morrie\\", I was deeply touched and inspired and I expected the same thing to happen after I finish this one. True, it is a very good read and it does give me some insights and a new perspective on the idea of death, but I couldn't seem to connect with Eddie's situation, perhaps because I am quite a lot younger than he is in the context of the novel.Overall, \\"The Five People You Meet in Heaven\\" is definitely a must-read if you have already read \\"Tuesdays with Morrie\\" and enjoyed it. For those who haven't, what are you people waiting for?"},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"This book is full of suprise. Everyone is connected to each other. The story will convince and lead you to the atmopsphere of believing. Everyone has his own value of existence. This book really tells so. The five people Eddie met in the heaven are not only the most important but also the most unexpected. This fantastic book influences me the ways of thinking what I should do in the rest of my life. Five points for five great examples and lessons. You must read it. Great book."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I would highly recomend The Five People You Meet in Heaven to anyone who is looking for a different type of book that has a different way of viewing life and what happens after. Mitch Albom is a truley creative writter and knows how to capture the reader in such a way that its almost impossible to put the book down. His perspective of life and why things happen are completly unheard of which is why this book is such a good read. The author has a unique idea of what happens immediatly after you die which puts a whole different perspective on life. He has a theory that in Heaven there are five people that are waiting for you to arrive whos job is to explain your life to you as well as explain to you how your life was connected to their whether or not you knew them. It is the authors beliefe that everybodies are intertwined in one way or another. It's an interesting possibility that everyone who dies goes through this process and in turn then waits to explain to another their life when they get to Heaven."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"When I started to read this book, the first thing that came to my mind is it's easy for me to read. So I read it through from cover to back and figured it's also a good book which gives me a whole new idea of \\"heaven\\". I used to think heaven as a place where we won't feel pain, hunger, or even grow old. However, in the story, Eddie, \\"re-lives\\" his life as he meets at different points of life.This story is not only interesting but also touching. When I read about his meetings with his captain in the army, and with Ruby, they really moved me into tears, and it inspired me to look at life in a new light. That is, you can be someone's hero even you think you are nobody. It all depends on how you look at things.After meeting the five people in heaven, Eddie knows his life better. And I think Mitch Albom is intelligent to organize the story around Eddie's birthdays. Besides, every person he meets in heaven is a surprise. All in all, it's an interesting, touching, romantic, and warm book with witty twists. I really recommend this story to all. I love it."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"This book is one of the most exciting books I have ever read. The simplicity of it made it even better. This book teaches us that everyone's lives are important to ourselves and to everyone else. Everyone's life is connected to everyone else's. Eddie thought that his whole life was a waste because he never became an engineer, but in reality, he was one of the most important people in his town. He kept all the children and all the adults safe as they rode the attractions at Ruby Pier. If it wasn't for him, many kids would have been hurt and even killed. This book will definitely change the way you look at life."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"The Five People You Meet in Heaven should be considered a classic. There are so many lessons taught throughout the entire book that can dramatically change a person's outlook on life. Mitch Albom explains the main character's life on earth during his time in Heaven. His explanations of why things occur to us on earth are all a significant part of life. For example, Eddie changed people's lives who he had never even met, yet these occurences are all explained in to him in Heaven.I highly recommend this book to readers of all ages. It can appeal to almost anyone. It's an easy read yet it maintains the power to change the way you see things in your life. You might even alter your priorities after reading this book, it explains how important it is to live life the way you want it but even if things don't work out the way you want, it will all be resolved in Heaven."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I really liked the book THE FIVE PEOPLE YOUE MEET IN HEAVEN by Mitch Albom because I thought that it was very well written. Every time I picked up the book I felt that I could read it forever.I would recommend this book to anyone and everyone. Its a great book that everyone will enjoy!!!"},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"There is an old American Indian saying that 'we stand on the shoulders of those who came before us.' Albom uses this maxim to show how the past affects the nature of our lives and the paths we are placed on...whether we want them or not.This is another solid book by Albom that gets one to think about life, truth, serendipity, and destiny."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I read this in a matter of a few hours and it really was tremendous. Not just a great, original story but also a story that will stay with you for a while. During the read you'll enjoy each person that you meet and at the end you'll say \\"wow\\". Albom does a great job bringing it all together in the end and since a good ending can make or break a book---this is why I give it five stars."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"Mitch Albom's book of pop theology, \\"The Five People You Meet in Heaven,\\" is about an ordinary man named Eddie who dies on his eighty-third birthday. Eddie was not a particularly happy man during his life. He had a bad relationship with his father, he suffered a crippling injury during the war, and he spent many lonely years without loving companionship. He worked as a maintenance man in an amusement park, a job that he inherited from his dad. Eddie had always wanted to be an engineer, but nothing ever seemed to work out for him.Eddie proceeds to heaven where he meets five people who teach him life lessons. Some of these people he knows; others are complete strangers. He learns that everything, no matter how inexplicable, happens for a reason, that all lives are somehow connected, and that his existence on earth did indeed have meaning. This novel is a natural follow-up to Albom's smash bestseller, \\"Tuesdays with Morrie,\\" a non-fiction account of life lessons that the author learned from his former teacher, Morrie, an amazing and wise man who was afflicted with Lou Gehrig's Disease.As in \\"Tuesdays with Morrie,\\" Albom's writing is simple yet affecting. He talks of old-fashioned values such as forgiveness, compassion, sacrifice, and loyalty. He also demonstrates that an ordinary man who works at a menial job, lives alone, and has few material possessions can still be a person of worth. Although at times \\"The Five People You Meet in Heaven\\" borders on the sentimental, it has undeniable power. We live in times of violence, uncertainty, rampant materialism, and an abandonment of basic moral values. One reason that this book has struck a chord with the reading public is that Albom comforts us with the theme that death is not an end, but rather a beginning. Although here on earth we may miss the big picture, there is hope that someday everything will become clear."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I really loved this book. I had to read it for the women's book club at my church and I finished in one day. It reads very quickly. I had to make myself put it down so I could start dinner. LOL LOLI think everybody should read this book, because at some point in everyone's life they have a moment when they felt like Eddie. You feel as though your whole life has no meaning, that maybe you've wasted it away doing nothing. But Eddie's story shows you that everything is done for a reason, everyone has a place in this world.READ THIS BOOK... IT'S AN EYE OPENER!!"},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"THE FIVE PEOPLE YOUU MEET IN HEAVEN is a novel about one mans experience of life after death.

He finds himself lying in heaven face to face with his \\"first person.\\" From this person he learns that there will be four more people, each one telling him small parts of his life. And each one shares a lesson he needs to learn.This book in my opinion was great! It shines a dim light on one of the most age old and controversial questions. What happens when we die?

The time commitment is minimal seeing that the book is quite slim and is easily absorbed at a brisk pace - the average reader should have no problem finishing this one off in 90 minutes or so. As for myself, those 90 minutes could've been better spent in my opinion. For the most part I found the tale trite and extremely derivative, couldn't really understand what all the fuss is about."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"This book is a story that is about the life of Eddie, and how he affected and interacted with the people around him. The story begins with Eddie an older Maintenance crew member at Ruby Pier. One fatal day, when one of the rides fails to work properly, Eddie dies trying to save a little girl. When Eddie reaches heaven he is encountered by five people, the blue man, his previous captain, Ruby, his wife Marguerite, and a small girl named Tala. Each of the people he meets teaches Eddie a lesson according to their previous life experiences with Eddie on earth. These lessons not only teach Eddie but also teach us in how to live our lives while we still are living on Earth.This book is a fantastic, thought provoking novel. Its smooth transitions between the past and present help develop the story very nicely.

Very thought provoking. It was a quick and easy read, I read it in one day."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"This book is a book that you shouldn't pass up. Mitch Albom uses many details about the characters and gives you a positive look on life with many moral values. Many people often say, \\"You can't put this book down, it keeps you hooked,\\" and that applies even more to this book. I found myself actually reading it while walking, it was that good. I think that everyone should have a chance to read this book, it isn't long and it is a short read that inspires you to live your life to the very best. I will never forget this book and I recommend that you read it and really think about what the author is portraying as a message."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"The Five People You Meet in Heaven was a very interesting book. It talked about afterlife and things you would never really think about. I thought that the book was really easy to read and comprehend. Every bit of the story seemed to all tie together and make sense. The descriptions of the characters really caught my attention because the author would make them broad looking. The things that I didn't like were the birthday flashbacks because it always got me off track. I would always have to go back to see where the scene left off. That really distracted me. And also, there were not enough vocab words and that didn't make it challenging at all. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone. I mean the text is really easy for ages 12-15, but the ideas that the book puts out there is so creative. It has good morals that I think that would be useful to everyone."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"The books The Five People you meet in heaven is about an older man and about his life after major things happen. Personally, I thought the book was very uplifting because it shows you that when you go to heaven that you meet people both that you were close with and with people you realty didn't know. I really liked how the book explained how the people that he met impacted his life or their life and why he is meeting them. The people he met taught him a lesson and helped him understand that everything happened for a reason. I also liked that he couldn't talk in the beginning when he got to heaven because then he had to listen to the people when they were talking and couldn't flip out. I disliked how the people he met couldn't tell him weather he saved the little girl or not. I also disliked how the little girl that was in the fire was the final person he met. I think people who had an imagination and people that believe in going to heaven should read this book. I don't think that kids under the age of 14 should read this book. It is more of a high school level book. I wouldn't change anything about the book besides how the little girl was the last person he met."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I very much enjoyed this book. It was sentimental and heart warming. I have always questioned what life after death would be like and who we would see again. I'll just tell you that it makes me feel more safe with death. It was so wonderfull to the extent that I had to stop myself from reading it so it would last longer. The level of wonder and life long questions followed by lessons was wonderfully heart warming. I would recomend this book to anyone who is looking for wonder in life after death. This will not be a book I will soon forget."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I hadn't wanted to read this because Breakfast was so awful I was just expecting more melodrama.

At the same time, though, I suspect that when we get there we won't really care, it won't really matter, and we'll be worshipping gloriously all day every day! Either way, based on my read of the Bible and my understanding of God, I've always looked at Heaven as a wonderful, happy place. I thought this book started out with good intentions by looking at significant people in the main character's life and using them to help explain why things happened. In the end, though, I found this book more depressing than uplifting. At the risk of sounding like a Pollyanna, I was hoping this glimpse of Heaven would be more inspirational. Instead, I closed this book feeling more despairing. Nonetheless, it does rate a few stars because of it's interesting perspective on what Heaven might be like in the sense of having some of our eternal questions answered and exploring other areas of our lives on earth that we may not have even recognized as having such significance."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"This is a story that will grab your attention and keep it, and the finish won't disappoint you. It may even make you cry.The concept is that after we all die, we meet five people in the afterlife, one at a time, and each person tells us things about our life that we find eye-opening.It is a damn stupid concept. Why five? What happens next? Where do we go next after these five people are done with their stories? Answer: there are five because the author wanted to write five. We don't care where we go next, where we spend eternity, because the concept of the book is that we are told five stories, and that's that. The author doesn't seem to realize that the more important issue is where we go when we die, not these five little interviews. So the book is sold to us as some important stories about heaven, but in fact it's just about making up five stories, and who cares about heaven.The protagonist is Eddie Maintenance, the guy who is responsible for keeping the rides safe in an amusement park. He ends up getting killed by one of his rides, which is not much of an endorsement of his work, is it? He must be pretty awful if he gets killed by one of his own rides. That isn't addressed in the book though.The big question is whether he succeeded in saving the life of the little girl who is standing right under where the ride is about to come crashing down. Will Eddie get there in time to save the little girl? The first four people he meets in heaven don't tell him because ..... because ..... because the author wants you to wait for that information until the end of his book. A bit hoky, no?If you like emotional endings and you don't care if the book makes any sense or if it is transparently hoky and suspense-building, you will tend to enjoy this book more than if you are more critical and demanding of some sense and some integrity.The first person that Eddie meets after his death is a blue man. Why blue? No particular reason. The blueness of the man has absolutely nothing to do with anything in the story. The guy is blue. He took too much silver nitrate and his skin turned blue. Isn't that interesting? That's why he's a blue man. Because Mitch Albom decided to throw in a blue man.Another character he meets, another of the five, is the wife of the guy who built the amusement park. Why her? Who knows. No particular reason.So, the story most definitely has weaknesses, and the biggest weakness is that it pretends to tell you about heaven but it actually doesn't tell you a thing about it, doesn't even try, so it is a bit of false advertising. It just tells you five stories, then sayonara, we're done, no more stories today kiddies.But this book can make you cry. It is emotionally powerful. There's something strong here, which is why I gave it 3 stars despite its stupid concept.And there is a wonderful lesson here, that although we may think we are doing something meaningless and beneath us, we may actually be doing something noble and meaningful, like Eddie, who is making rides that are safe for children, when someone more careless, someone less dedicated and talented, would be letting children die left and right from these rides. What could be more noble than saving the lives of children? Maybe even your stupid job is worth something. Maybe you yourself, dear reader, are not the useless nonentity you think you are."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"This is a story about a guy who dies and meets five people in heaven yet one would easily be mislead into thinking that these are five people who offer some meaningful insight. Instead, each person follows a bland story formula about how they died and why it's ok.I too like many others who read this book, read it because of the glowing reviews and personal recommendations. For someone who never reflects on his/her life, perhaps this could be a meaningful book because it can wake you up. The only other good news is that it's a quick read.Unfortunately, this book does not have a captivating story, interesting characters or any meaningful insight to offer. If you must read this, have the person who recommended it to your loan you their copy or borrow it from the library. Don't encourage the author to put out any more of these types of books by rewarding this piece of work."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"Mitch Albom is a remarkable writer. I have enjoyed all of his works whether in the weekend \\"Parade\\" Magazine, his books or numerous other works. He is fantastic...humanistic, deep, thoughtful, even philosophical, yet down-to-earth.Regardless of the tone, he is guaranteed to touch your heart, your spirit and your soul with his writing. Here he doesn't disappoint his fans, and he makes new fans as well.What a wonderful, heartfelt *fantasy*. But is it a fantasy? The reader quickly believes that this fantasy is a reality for all of us. What a completely wonderful tribute to our elderly: a group that has become *second class* in our society, a group that has a unique and important stories to tell us about our past, our lives, our future. Why are we the only nation in the world that doesn't always respect our elders? Besides other important topics, this book really shows us how important history is: our family, our upbringing, our heritage, our background, our uniquely individual journey through life.The story surrounds a wonderful man named Eddie. A man who has had a very full life and is about to die at the ripe old age of 83. Although Eddie thinks his life is *mediocre*, he quickly learns that, at his death, he isn't the schmuck he always thought he was. He learns that he has contributed greatly to humanity.I don't want to ruin the story-line by divulging the plot and entire story, but I can say that I hope that Albom's philosophy about what happens when we leave this earth is true. Even if it is only 50% true, I would be happy. If you believe at all in angels, you'll be happily beside yourself while reading this book.I laughed and I cried along with the author. When I finished the book I was changed. Life is short. Life is precious. Love is eternal. Life and family is all that matters while we are on this earth. Don't sweat the small stuff. Bask and revel in your every day life. Seize the moment and the day. Be kind, be honest, be good.Highly recommended. A+"},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I just loved this, loved the ending, and after finally closing it wanted to take the time and think about it for a while.This easy-reading but rich with meaning story is about an old man that is killed on the job at the amusement park where he has worked for most of his life. The tale that the author then constructs gives meaning to his (the old man's) life, and indeed to all of our lives. Just a wonderful read.A few side notes for you - This book seemed to be a \\"slow starter\\" and is written in simple language. Do not mistake that for simple ideas or what will be a boring book. By mid-book you will probably find this one to be a page turner. I read the last 50 pages in one sitting because I could not put it down. There are pleasant surprises even in the last paragraph.Importantly, I would would remind the reader that this is a fictional novel. People that look here for a lesson in theological truth, or a peek into the hereafter, are looking into an empty box. Does not acceptance of the concept of \\"heaven\\" imply a belief in a diety creator? Indeed, Albom briefly alludes to God a couple of times, very briefly, in the novel. I would pose that the God alluded to here (apparently the Judeo-Christian God of the Hebrews), provided us with a revelation of heaven and the mechanism for reaching it . . . as recorded in the Bible. The Five People You Meet in Heaven is totally disconnected from the Biblical view. So it contains little more theological truth than a Harry Potter book.I STILL maintain that this is a wonderful read. One could even wish that it were truth, not fiction. But don't confuse the two. And it does contain many true and important concepts.Enjoy the book, I know you will."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"great book!!!! i couldn't put it down. the movie is okay, but not as good as the book. i highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"In the author's world people are basically good-natured, but are often oblivious to their connections to others and the long-term consequences of their actions (usually good). However, life does have its pitfalls - it's not necessarily fair. This essential nature of life is finally revealed to Eddie, an amusement park maintenance man, when he dies in a freak accident and then meets five individuals in heaven with whom he had some association and learns something about himself and them.Though the book has religious overtones, it can be read more as a simplistic examination of the intricacies of life. Plot and character development barely exist. The book is rather sappy. Fortunately, it's short. The book really does not aspire to be much more than a three star book."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"The book The Five People you Meet in Heaven, by Mitch Albom, has to be one the most inspirational books I have ever read. The book starts at Eddie, the main characters death. Eddie is an old man whose life has been very rough. He worked at Ruby Pier, an ameusment park, as the maintenance manager all his life and hated it. In fact, he hated most of life after his family and loved ones passed away. But when Eddie dies and meets five people in Heaven who's lives he influenced, he sees his life differently. He realizes all the terrible things he had done or caused, and all the great things he had done for others. His life was not the disaster he had thought it had been, and this insight made him realize the things he took for granted.I strongly recommend this book for anyone over the age of 10 because of the strong influence it has on how you see yourself and other people."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"When a book can draw a lump in a 57 year old man's throat and still give you goosepimples feeling good about it, that is testimony alone.I started to read the book on a business trip yesterday.

The books I have purchased have either met or exceeded my expectations."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"In terms of having writing skill (I'm talking delivery), Albom is pretty good. I enjoyed the beginning of the book leading up to the main character's death. It intrigued me to read through him going about his day with only a half hour left to live...just going about his daily mundane activities with no clue that he was down to his last few moments. It struck me because it isn't something people usually think about and Albom did a good job at capturing that. With that captivating opening I really thought I was in for some great big philosophical, mind-boggling, insightful and intellectually stimulating journey into the 'unknown'.However, after the character died the book turned into pure fluff! At one point I realized I was only reading the book out of curiosity to see who the five people were and nothing other than that. To his credit I did appreciate the message that we're all interconnected in some way. Others will certainly find this book to be beautiful and touching. For that kind of reading audience I'd say Albom truly delivered. Too new age-ish and fluff for my liking though."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"Great value.

Who would your five people be?"},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"The light beyond deathThe Five People You Meet in Heaven has a very bright perspective of what life after death is going to be. It is captivates it's readers by taking a look through the eyes of another. The book shows hope that there is something out there after death. That same hope brings life to people when there seems to be none. Different people and religions have different outlooks of what the after life consists of. This book brings hope and a bright future to see that their goals go further then death. In the book Eddie Maintenance or Eddie for short goes to heaven to learn that there is no penalty or reward but the simplicity of the matter was that you learn what REALLY happens on earth. Eddie learns 5 different lessons and with that 5 different people to learn from. When reading the book I felt I learned with Eddie and walked with him in a splendid paradise. I felt the emotions run through my finger tips as I gripped page by page. The main lesson was that everything happens for a reason whether you see it or not. Mitch Albom gently placed this in Eddie's unimaginable story. I loved the way Mitch Albom creatively wrote the story going back and forth to the present sate of heaven and his past here on earth. The book shows the connection of what Eddie could not understand on earth to what the real meaning of the situation was. His life was normal seen through others eyes but looking far behind the scars and his crippled leg you will find stories unknown to many. The book not only carries war stories and love stories, but a life like many, a life like you and me.I would recommend this book to people who are interested in life after death. This book is for the people who have the hope that these goals and achievements don't stop at death. Come take a stride with Eddie maintenance to learn about the other side of life, because life as we know it doesn't last forever.A BOOK REVIEW BY LESLIE CRUZ"},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"Mitch Albom's, The Five People You Meet in Heaven is a compelling story that shows how much each person impacts the lives of others. I loved this heartwarming story of unusual connections and Eddie's introduction to heaven. Albom's ideas about the afterlife in this story are believable and give hope to the reader that all things after we die turn out well. The lessons learned in this story give powerful meaning to our everyday lives. Albom's melodic tone flows through the story as he tells the life of Eddie and the five people he meets in heaven. It is a story of everlasting love, hope, and twisting connections that bring a tear to the eye, that generations to come will enjoy and embrace."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"The Five People You Meet In Heaven, written by Mitch Albom, is an original thought provoking page-turner that keeps you guessing page after page. Albom, also the author of Tuesdays with Morrie, gives a different outlook on life after death through an 83-year-old man named Eddie. I felt the book was carefully written but powerful and largely entertaining. It was more than enough to melt my heart.Eddie has lived near Ruby Pier all his life. He once had big dreams of becoming an engineer and moving away but those dreams quickly faded from a war injury. Instead, Eddie worked the same job as his dad did and spent everyday feeling his life had been a waste. At 83 Eddie died in a tragic amusement park accident. Rather than floating up to the clouds to a heaven of leisure Eddie found himself on a journey that would help him to understand the meaning of his life. \\"That's what heaven is. You get to make sense of your yesterdays.\\"Everyone's lives are connected. Our actions affect other people whether we realize it or not. In this book Albom demonstrates how we are individuals apart of a whole. \\"You can no more separate one life from another than you can separate a breeze from the wind.\\"Through detailed descriptions Albom paints a vivid picture of the characters and scenes. \\"... Scrambled backward wildly into a porous wall of stringy vines that hung from a massive banyan tree.\\" Eddie becomes so real you can imagine him as part of the family. Albom also uses frequent flashbacks that have you questioning the relevance and guessing about what's to come. Although you learn about Eddie's life in pieces it all makes sense and comes together in the end. This strategy makes it difficult to put this book down.Albom is a talented writer whose words have the power to suck you right into this book. The description and mystery will satisfy your cravings, and the message will have you talking about it for days. I recommend you give this book a chance."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I must say that this is one of my favorite books. This book starts out with an old man and his last hour on earth. He has lived and worked at an amusement park for all his life and that is where he dies. After he dies, he goes on a journey of meeting five people who have all changed his life in some significant way. I won't ruin the story for you by telling who the five people are, so you must go and read it. This book is very inspirational and teaches you what the meaning of life is. I found a lot of quotes in this book that were really true and made me think a lot. I recommend this book to everyone, and it is really worth reading. This would also be a great present to your loved ones. And this book also makes you wonder if this is how Heaven is like. It's a wonderful book to read and you'll find yourself having goosebumps at the end because I did. I wasn't able to put this book down once I have started on it. I have read this book about three times because it is very touching and you won't get tired of it. This book is wonderfully written and I also want to read Mitch Albom's other book titled Tuesdays with Morrie. I think he's a great writer because he writes with great detail and I could almost imagine myself in the book. This book hasn't changed my life after reading it, but I loved reading it."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I thought this book was very preachy. I don't think it had any fresh ideas. I am glad I took it out of the library rather thanbuy it. This way I only wasted my time rather than my money."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"Albom's conception of heaven is trite and unoriginal. Other reviewers seem to disagree. Other reviewers also seem to think that \\"Chicken Soup for the Soul\\" is the word of God. If you like books that are humorous (e.g. Catch-22) or profound (e.g. Siddhartha), then reread one of those because you're not going to find any of that here. On the other hand, if you want something sappy and serious, but upbeat, then you've found your bathroom-reading here.This is a fast read but a short book. You're probably paying about a dollar a word here. Albom pulls out all the college student tricks (e.g. small pages, half-blank pages) just to stretch his pamphlet into 198 pages. Still, in his defense, the book shouldn't be any longer. It already starts to wear thin in parts. 2 stars."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"Remember when everyone became enthralled with Robert James Waller and his sickly sweet reads like Bridges of Madison County and Slow Waltz in Cedar Bend? Five People is on par with those previously trendy reads. Poor writing quality and a painful, aching grasp to be philosophical made this book hard to digest."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"When a co-worker told me that she only liked books that made her think, I immediately recommended this book. I knew, at the very least, it would do just that.I originally read The Five People You Meet in Heaven three years ago when it was first published, and recommending it only made me want to pick it up again. On my second read, I breezed right through. It still hits close to home, and is definitely the type of book you can revisit time and time again when you need a little perspective. For, yes, it does make you think, and it offers a great perspective on life. There are many lessons and many moments that make you think, and for me the most important of these is the fact that all your actions affect other people and that all the actions of other people affect you as well. We are all connected in this life - and our actions do matter. It's a big message, but told in such a simple and heartwarming way.Having just finished this book for the second time, I don't doubt that I'll pick up this book again in a few years. It's that type of book. Tuesdays with Morrie was a great read - but I have always felt The Five People You Meet in Heaven was better. It's definitely on my favorite book list. And as of our last conversation, my co-worker agrees!"},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"Have you ever thought about life after death? Well, Eddie hadn't until he died in an amusement park accident while trying to save a little girl. He also wants to know another thing; did the girl survive. When he does go to heaven though, he meets five people that were somehow involved in his life. They each teach him one thing that is important. But he ultimately wants to find out why God does this.I chose this book because I like reading books that talk about God or the bible. I connected to the book because I feel how Eddie felt in all the confusion about life after death. I also like the book because the author writes with such power and detail in the book. He wrote the detail so well, that I even further believe my faith in God. I would recommend this to people who want to read books about God and who would want to know more about the basic idea of life after death."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"This book reminds me of \\"Chicken Soup\\" series.

Mitch Albom allows readers of his \\"The Five People You Meet In Heaven\\" to realize this and understand that every life has a purpose. Albom's book takes the reader on a heartfelt journey through the life of an amusement park maintenance man named Eddie who, on his 83rd birthday, gives his life to save a little girl from a falling Freddy's Free Fall cart. He then takes a journey of his own, through heaven, where he meets five people who either had a significance to his life or he had one to theirs. Eddie's five people all explain their connections to him on earth and enable Eddie to shed light on many mysteries of his life. He learns that his life on earth had purpose and wasn't as meaningless as he had once thought. This book compels readers to think back on their own life and try to discover whose lives they've impacted and what importance their life has. \\"No life is a waste. The only time we waste is the time we spend thinking we are alone.\\" I would recommend this book to people of all ages."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"It is no normal day at Ruby Pier. With only minutes left to live, Eddie continues to do what he has done for almost all his life. He hobbles around the pier, searching for loose screws, broken boards and slow motors. Eddie stops and rests in a beach chair. A little girl shyly approaches him and asks him to make a pipe cleaner animal for her. \\"Eddie Main-ten-ance...\\" She reads his shirt label as all the children at the pier have learned to do. \\"Please?\\" she begs. He makes a rabbit. The girl skips away to meet her mother. Eddie goes back to resting.Twelve minutes later, Eddie is dead. An accident with one of the rides causes him to give his life for the little girl's. With enormous courage he leaps in front of a falling cart to rescue her, but has no time to move himself out of the way. He is killed instantly.Eddie arrives in Heaven with no recollection of his death. He remembers that accident, and the little girl's hands in his, but he doesn't remember dying. He floats to a scene that he knows very well. Ruby Pier. But it's empty. And it's old. He finds himself in the Ruby Pier of his childhood. It is there where he meets his first person.Filled with vivid scenes and life's most important lessons is Mitch Albom's The Five People You Meet in Heaven. He guides you through Eddie's deliciously mysterious past, and shows you that every detail makes a difference.In heaven, you meet five people who played a role in your life. You don't necessarily know these people, but they know you, and they all have something to teach you. Each lesson is beautifully paired with a piece of Eddie's past. Each one of Eddie's five people show him how his life changed another's in one way. Eddie meets himself and the people he loves all over again, and he gains some self-respect. The lessons teach both Eddie, and the reader something about life.I really enjoyed The Five People You Meet in Heaven because Albom did such a wonderful job of telling a story. He made everything the most important thing, so I never wanted to put the book down. He painted a brilliant new picture in my mind for every page. I grew to feel as if I had spent my whole life with Eddie, and when I was through, I wanted more. I wanted to follow Eddie through his life after life. I guess I'll just have to wait for Albom's next book."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I totally enjoyed reading this book, even more than Morrie! A very clever idea! A heaven that unites us!I liked the idea of an integrated world where every person has a role and whatever each person does affects another whether you know it or not. I think Mr. Albom wanted to makes us feel more responsible and more considerate to all around us. It is a universal message as human beings living on Earth: show respect and caring for all around you. He created a world where nothing else matters, not religion nor race nor age and called it Heaven.It is sad that Eddie had to die to realize what it is all about, to understand why things happened that way. It is amazing how one life.. one soul-thought to be useless, boring, harmless- can intertwine into the lives of 5 people and change the path of each ... great read!"},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I love a good tear-jerker. I love a book that tugs at the heartstrings and makes you think. I like to read deep, thought-provoking novels that stay with me long afterwards. If you do too... don't buy this book.As a huge fan of \\"Tuesdays with Morrie,\\" I saw this and couldn't wait to begin reading. I figured if it had only half the depth of his first book, it would be wonderful. Then I started reading it ... it was absolute torture to get through. I kept reading figuring surely there would be great meaning. I kept reading faster and faster figuring the meaning and the emotion would come on the next page... or the next page...? or maybe the next page...? It never came. At the end, I thought, oh here it comes; we're getting close. Nothing... I kept thinking I had to of missed it. I just didn't get it. I wanted to cry, or at least feel like I've read something completely thought-provoking. I even sat there afterwards holding it, waiting... I tried. I tried to feel it; I tried to like it. But I just didn't care. I didn't care about Eddie or the dull 5 people he met. And a book like this is supposed to make the reader care.And after Albom's first book, this was a huge disappointment. Actually, I take that back. No matter what Albom did previously, this was a disappointment. I just expected so much more from this sports writer after 'Tuesdays'. But I guess maybe he should stick to sports. It will definitely make me think twice before purchasing a book by an a new author just because I liked the first one. I was actually angry after finishing it because I wasted my money on it. For the first time ever, I wanted to return a book I had already read. I felt jipped. Complete disappointment."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"In my mind, \\"The Five People You Meet in Heaven\\" is a fine book. Regard it as a fable of what might happen to some of us after we're dead.People have argued that it's too sentimental -- and riddled with more cliches than what's found in director Frank Capra's filmography.But its structure -- as a book -- is marvelous. \\"The Five People You Meet in Heaven\\" moves quickly and is never dull. I believe it's the kind of title that will never go out of print. And yet it will forever polarize readers.I think it's too easy for intellectual snobs to scoff at works like \\"The Five People You Meet in Heaven\\" -- excluding or denigrating all that's mainstream and \\"popular,\\" as if the unwashed masses who made this book a success are all wrong -- and they themselves are clear-headed and right.Just ignore them. \\"The Five People You Meet in Heaven\\" is for you if you find thick and weighty titles a little daunting after a while. It's the perfect \\"break,\\" a refreshing change of pace for a guy like me who's used to reading so many books that feel like work -- filled with depressing themes or mind-numbing sentences -- determined to impress critics or juries who give out prizes.\\"The Five People You Meet in Heaven\\" cuts through all that and gets straight to the point in fewer pages. It's not designed to please snobby critics who are always suspicious of commercial success. And in my view, it's mean-spirited to read reviewers accusing Mitch Albom of \\"selling out\\" -- when it's obvious that he's tapped into something that resonates and brings optimism to many people who might otherwise avoid books.\\"The Five People You Meet in Heaven\\" is a great response to fashionable pessimism among wine-and-cheese intellectuals. This book isn't Hemingway. So what? As I raced through its pages, I began thinking to myself, \\"gee, the content is good and the writing is solid -- why can't more books be as effortless to read like this?\\"Reading so many books over so many decades, I was still blind-sided by what is revealed on the last page. (Don't cheat -- it has no text -- but it's a doozy.) Only a person with a heart of stone will feel nothing after he or she sees that last page.However simplistic, I won't fault Albom for knocking out something aimed straight from his heart to mine, even if he doesn't always connect. \\"The Five People You Meet in Heaven\\" refuses to be dismissed and its fans will always outnumber its critics. And this is a great thing, you know, people arguing the merits of ANY book.In sum, \\"The Five People You Meet in Heaven\\" is on my list of \\"guilty pleasures.\\" But in truth, I don't feel guilty. And you shouldn't either."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"This is not about atheism or New age pop psychology. It is a novel, period. Mr. Albom shows that life is not as short or shallow as we think. The connections between people have more depth than we recognize on the surface. Although this book is cut from a different genre, it reminded me of Charles Dickens \\"A Christmas Carol.\\" Eddie, a once wounded WW2 veteran is now 83 years old. He feels that his life has been dank & uninspiring. He dies in a tragic accident saving a little girl. He soon meets 5 souls, some he knows, others not.From childhood to old age they show him his life, revealing a haunting secret behind his anguished question. \\"Why was I here?\\" This was a quick & entertaining slide show of very different characters. It made you want to have the author delve deeper into the five souls so you could feel their experiences as much as we felt Eddie's. Nonetheless, it was a great read."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"(This is the first book review I have done on anything since I think I was in grade school when we had to do book reports to earn gold stars, so forgive me if I am not as eloquent of a writer/reviewer as people before or after me might be.)I am a U.S Marine Veteran and current college student. I am a female and 27 years old. I am still trying to find my reason for being here on earth I guess.I read this book late last year.... then months later I started seeing ads in papers/flyers telling people how wonderful the book was. I simply nodded, and smiled in agreement. I think it was the title that caught my eye... as I am one of those who always wonders what life will be like after THIS life... what is in heaven... and those can be scary thoughts. My grandmother had passed away in Apring of '98... and after reading this book... I kind of smile from time to time and think about all the lives she must have touched in some way over her years... and that puts me at peace with it all.Read this book if you want to be at peace with everything...I know it helped me, and it's a book I will forever cheerish."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I would highly recommend this book to anyone searching for a beautiful, life-affirming way to spend an afternoon. Mr. Albom has written a book that is a cut above and well worth your time. I could not put this book down!"},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"The author comes up with an interesting idea and then fails to develop it to its full potential. I read the book from cover to cover in less than three hours and felt less than satisfied when I had finished. It is easy reading, and the story is entertaining, but I couldn't get involved enough in any of the characters to feel the emotions that some of the other readers have mentioned. Perhaps a few more pages to develop the story would have helped. I don't know, but I wasn't shocked or saddened. I felt as if I were reading about a stranger in the newspaper.If you read enough of the customer reviews of this book you will find out who the five people are and get a rough idea of their roles in explaining Eddie's life to him. If you are like me, you will disagree with the author's logic. As recreational reading it was ok. As inspirational reading it was not very deep."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I will be brief. This book is outstanding. Everyone should read this book, regardless of their religious background. The message is universal, simple, yet astonishingly profound. I am of the opinion that this book should never take up space on a bookshelf, it should be forever in motion, from one person to the next untill it is in tatters. If you havent read this book, read it. If you own this book give it away to a dear friend with instructions to do the same."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"This was truely an inspiring book. Once you pick it up it's hard to put it down. I found myself reading the entire book in one sitting. The story of an elderly man who see's himself as not accomplishing anything with his life, (a feeling that I believe many people have felt at some point in their lives) and yet when Eddie dies he encounters 5 people who help him realize that his life indeed did have meaning and did have an affect on others. As many of us have heard, we have all been placed here on earth for a reason, and this book goes beyond that and gives examples. Picture this, you're five and you're playing ball with your friends, the ball rolls out into the road and you chase it, a car abruptly stops, you get your ball and go back to playing with your friends. How does this affect someone's life. Read the book to find out.A truely great book with no loose ends. Mitch Albom has done an amazing job with this book.... Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"The title and book concept have intrigued me since I first heard about the book. I don't know any religions that describe the experience in Heaven as beginning by meeting five people from your past life, so I took the book to be a parable rather than a literal attempt to describe Heavenly life. I was quite pleased (for the most part) with what I found. I recommend this book to anyone who will not feel like their religion is being cast in doubt by the book's premise.Many self-help gurus encourage us to imagine our funeral service and what would be said about us. I think there's a lot of merit to that concept. Mr. Albom has added another important element to that concept: What were the unintended effects that others had on our lives and we on theirs? Cast in that light, even the most mundane life is suddenly filled with drama and greater significance. I hope Mr. Albom will consider writing a self-help book that allows us to think through the lessons of this book for our own lives.To describe what happens in Heaven in the book would be to spoil the book for you . . . so I won't. I found the book constantly surprising and interesting, and a quick read. One of the underlying themes of the book is the need to be more accepting of one another . . . and the consequences of our actions. In that regard, I thought the story was weak only in developing the resolution of his relationship with one of his parents. Other than that flaw, I would have enthusiastically graded the book at five stars.Let me quote the book's intriguing opening paragraph to give you a flavor of why you may want to read this book:&quot;This is a story about a man named Eddie and it begins at the end, with Eddie dying in the sun. It might seem strange to start a story with an ending. But all endings are also beginnings. We just don't know it at the time.&quot;I think that's the best opening for a book that I have read in many years. Much of the rest of the writing is just as good.As I finished the book, I began to think about how my &quot;failures&quot; may have actually helped others to &quot;successes.&quot; That was a new thought for me, and one that will make me act quite differently in the future. That was a great gift to receive from reading a single story."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"The magic to Mitch Albom's approach is that he touches upon something that we all think about - What happens after we die? No one has definitively been able to answer the question and what Albom has done is to take the comforting reply to that question (we go to heaven), and add A Christmas Carol story-twist to it. Heaven isn't necessarily filled with rolling hills and bon-bons. It's about making sense out of your life and bringing it to its natural closure. And in many ways, Albom's way of dealing with death is quite comforting for me. I've always had a fear about dying. At one time in my life, it was about the act of dying. Would I be in a lot of pain? Would I be by myself? Would I die of natural causes? Would something horrible happen to me? Then, it proceeded to this helpless feeling of never being able to be again. I couldn't imagine not being. Not touching. Feeling. Hugging. Kissing. Smelling. Death - before, during, and after - is scary. Albom's approach isn't totally unique but it is theraputic. He has a way of making sense of it all.

I am looking forward to reading the book."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I loved this book! I was not a big fan of \\"Tuesdays With Morrie\\" so I hesitated before picking up \\"5 People\\". Shortly after I purchased it, my grandmother passed away and so I put it aside for a few months, worried that the subject might be upsetting. I could not have been more wrong! It is a beautiful book, with life lessons, and tells the story to all of us about how nothing in our life is a mistake--there is a reason for everything. Although written as a fictional story, Mitch Albom's ideas about afterlife were eye-opening, and made me pause and think about how we all interact with one another during our lives here...and about which five people I might meet in Heaven. I highly recommend this book, it will open your mind, your heart (and maybe your tear ducts!)."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"The Five People You Meet in Heaven is a moving and beautiful book.Perfect for this time of year."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I thought that Tuesdays With Morrie was the only masterpiec this author had in him.

It is a little book. Just like a diamond is a \\"little stone\\".

The story of Eddie, and of the lessons he learns, is both entertaining and inspirational.A must read!"},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"To be quite honest I recieved this book under unusual circumstances, it showed up at my front doorstep in a box a few days after the passing of my brother in law. Although there are some reviews that say that \\"The Five People You Meet in Heaven\\" is cliche or even has a story line that has been heard before, I have never once read a book so emotionally moving, as this one. Albom's offers his view of afterlife, and our first encounters when we pass, his view was one that I had never heard before. Some may call me stuck in the clouds, but I have never had someone describe their idea of heaven with such vivid imagination, thought, faith and emotion. You do not have to be of particular faith, or maybe even have faith at all to enjoy this book. What it does give us an answer to is how every human on this earth is connected in a way that when we live on this earth we may never understand. Give this book to family, friends, because anyone would appreciate the insight this book offers. For the daring, warm hearted, inspiration loving readers I cannot recommend anything but \\"The Five People You Meet in Heaven\\"."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"In my 'youth group' at church, we had a speaker come and talk to us about life. Sorry to say, I didn't listen, but when I was handed a book I was delighted. I wasn't really a reader, but when I was handed a book, it suddenly would become a mistery. I wasn't really interested in the book at first, but I decided to read it anyway because all other books in my possesion had been explored. I was surprised by the way this simply expressed explanation for the way we all have purposes in life and how it all seems to fit in a complex puzzle could hold me in rapture. I of all people was the first to actually read it let alone FINISH it in my youth group. It was a moving example of a thought expressed by every single youth group teacher I have had; everything has a purpose, unknown to you at the time, that effects the rest of the world. I have continually passed it on from friend to friend (I have to admit, I sort of forced it down one of their throats because they were reluctant to read it) and each one said that the book changed thier view on life. It is a truly moving book."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"If I read a book that bores me after the first few chapters, I put it aside, maybe to try again sometime. If not, I give it away. Every book doesn't have to be life-changing, but if it can make me think, laugh, cry, inform me or fill an otherwise boring evening, it's done it's job for me.This book does that. Granted, I was thinking of \\"A Christmas Carol\\" meets John Edwards when I read it, but I have to admit it was a thought provoking, uplifting read. I enjoyed it!"},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"The title appealed to me, so I began reading the story of Eddie after he was killed in an amusement park while trying to save a young girl. Somewhere in between \\"It's a Wonderful Life\\" and \\"A Christmas Carol\\" is \\"The Five People you Meet in Heaven\\".Eddie grew up poor while his father worked the amusement park. Eddie wanted to be an engineer and get out of where he grew up and take the love of his life with him. Unfortunately World War II got in the way of his plans. Wounded, he returned home with a bad leg and spent the rest of his life continuing in his father's footsteps.The Five people he met were people he had both known and not known in his life, but they all had an influence on him, or he influenced them without their knowledge. He never met 'The Blue Man', but learned from him how he was indirectly responsible for his death. He also meets his Commanding Officer from the War, his wife, the woman whose husband built the park, and finally a young girl who he was never sure existed, but did.This book is full of sentiment, which isn't a bad thing. We need books like this along with the Stephen Kings and V.C. Andrews of the world. It deals with friendship, relationships, and had much to do with understanding an uncaring father.After I finished the book I thought it was a nice story, though had a bit of a strange ending. If Heaven is different for everybody, I'm sure I'll end up on a beach just as Eddie got his Ferris Wheel."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"It was such a good book.

I am not a Mitch Albom fan anyway, and I didn't want to spend $20 on a tiny little book to make his head even bigger (I won't mention his ears), so I bought it at my local bookstore, intended to handle it carefully while I read it, so that I could take it back. Reading it quickly was easy to do, because once I picked this book up, I just couldn't put it down. I read it and loved it, but I still carried out my fraudulent plot. But then, weeks later, I regretted it. I wanted my wife to read it, so I bought it for a second time, canceling out my previous return. This is one of the best novels I've ever read, and I implore secularists to not be turned away by the apparent religious nature of the title.

It contiues, showing the moments right before his death and the events following after, where he meets his five people.The Five People You Meet in Heaven is by far the most entertaining and delightful book I have ever had the pleasure to read. I highly recommend it to anyone who is looking for a short 'feel-good' story.Although I was a little skeptical about this so called 'fantastic' book, its carefully chosen words keep you entranced and on the very edge of your seat, waiting for what's going to come next. The book is perfect for people who are big fans of reading, and for those like me who will do anything possible not to. It's about 180 pages, which is fairly short so it should take you only 24 hours to complete, 48 at the most. The text is pretty large, so for those with glasses shouldn't have much of a problem.I would say that there is no age limit to this truly amazing book.Whether you are 15 or 51, its wholesome life lessons about how life, death, and how we are all part of an intertwined web of fates, are highly enjoyable for all ages.

It has been a good week."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"After returning from war, Eddie lived his life in a nondescript town, working at a job he did not choose, but felt relegated to. To him his life was full of nothingness. Mitch Albom's THE FIVE PEOPLE YOU MEET IN HEAVEN cast Eddie as an elderly man during his last days on earth, working at the Ruby Pier Amusement Park. As head of maintenance, his responsibilities include the maintenance of the park's rides and the supervision of staff within the department.As the story opens, a terrible accident occurs that sends Eddie to his death while trying to save a young girl. As the story progresses, he is in heaven and he comes into contact with five people who have been waiting for him. Predictable and not so likely, they are there to assist him in seeing the meaning and value of his life.The structure of this tale flashes back to Eddie's birthdays, each complete with cake, candles and people around to help celebrate. The author proceeds with the story in relation to the particular birthday cited, he returns to the scene in heaven and moves on to another year and another birthday and so on. There is a small lesson on the history of amusement parks and why they were built and what it took to sustain them. Simply written, however penetrating, THE FIVE PEOPLE YOU MEET IN HEAVEN is a look into life's balances, citing that nothing is random; heaven is there to help you make sense of your yesterdays; lost love is love taking a different form and sacrifice should be viewed as loyalty. This is a read to be savored, mulled over and one man's opinion of what heaven can be like.Reviewed by Dawn R.

Every one of Mr. Albom's books that I've read leaves me struggling to find the will to put it down. This one is my favorite.Albom has this way of striking you at your core, reducing a grown man such as myself into tears. I'm not the least bit embarrassed to admit it. Everyone has conflicts in their lives, with themselves and those around them. Albom makes you see those conflicts and offers you a way to realize that they should not be conflicts, that the only reason those conflicts exist is because we misunderstand others.Albom provides so many life lessons, so many eye-opening scenes, and most of all, so many reasons to make you realize how much you have, and how much you should treasure it. That is why he is my favorite writer. It's not too far-fetched to say that Mitch has saved my life and my relationships with those I love. I recommend this book to anyone who has trouble in their lives, whether they are religious or not (I am not, and yet this is my favorite book of all time). I hope that it can save you just as it saved me."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"Seventeen hundred plus people have rated this book for an average of four stars.

The book then travels back to follow his life and the connections and interconnections with five people who knowingly, and sometimes unknowingly, shaped those 83 years.The book is short, at around 100 pages it can easily be read in less than a day, and its message is simple.

It's definitely a feel-good book, the written equivalent to a chick flick - and one of the best out there. The way Mitch Albom connects minor details throughout an old man's piteous life, weaving his triumphs and his failures together to change his perspective is masterful. Even the worst thing he ever did was part of the bigger picture. It was thought provoking and beautiful, and I absolutely loved it."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"The Five People You Meet in Heaven is an Inspiring story about life and death. It is a story about a man named Eddie who dies and wonders if he has accomplished anything in life. Eddie meets five different people in Heaven who teach him five different lessons about life. With these five lessons, Eddie learns what life is all about, and what his purpose on earth was.I enjoyed this novel mostly because of the lessons I learned from it. As Eddie learned lessons about life, I also learned them. This novel inspired me to do things in life, but it also made me feel like we are all important to this world.I liked how the author of this novel made the main character an average person who went through normal things. He is like anyone else because everyone wonders what their purpose in life is. Eddie is a lovable character who is very interesting to read about. I also enjoyed the imagery of the novel. The scenes of Heaven that the author decribes makes you wonder what Heaven really looks like. I would recomend this book to anyone who likes to read about deep subjects like why we are put on this world."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"this book made me realize that people could be affected by the things that i do without my even knowing it......"},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I like this book because of the missing links element. I really had to look for Eddie's life. He was a simple man and in beginning this book I thought he had been alone all his life. That missing element started my pursuit for the hidden details. This book was hard to get into at first. It is referring to such a simple non complicated man, so I think as I read to his death. My thoughts were \\"this is so depressing.\\" However, when I got past the whole dying part, I found myself wanting to know more about this little man, who as a main character was left a little to be desired at first. I think that anyone who reads this book and takes the messages seriously will find connections to their life.The death of a person is a sad thing. Seeing a person having had so few people in his life that would remember him in a sense of making sure he had a proper burial was odd. Yet his story portrays a different person. One that lived and loved and learned, even though some of his learning came after his death, it sends a message of hope that in the after life, no matter what beliefs we have, there is forgiveness and there is peace.I think anyone who reads this book can make connections to their own life. The end of the book is definitely worth reading through some of the slower parts."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"This novel was incredibly inspirational. A lesson in each chapter that leads to a thought provoking period of time where you apply it to your own life. It is easy reading, yet don't let that fool you. It is a very well written novel without the use of SAT vocabulary words. Albom relates it to the common man, where one can identify with many of the situations throughout the book at one point of their life or another. The main character is so well developed, you feel like you know him, as though he was your friend, and he is telling you about his life.READ IT!! I definitly do not regret purchasing the novel."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I would have to say though that &quot;Tuesdays with Morrie&quot; had a greater impact on my life than this one did, but nevertheless, it was a great book to read.

The story begins as Eddie, a carnival-ride maintenance man., is killed while trying to save a little girl from a plummeting carnival ride. Heaven, he discovers, is a place where we learn to understand our yesterdays from 5 people from our own lives (and not always the people you'd expect!).While Eddie learns important lessons after his death, we, through the beautiful simplicity of the plot, get to learn along with him while still alive. We are thus reminded about the interconnectivity of life, sacrifice and love before it's too late. This is definitely a book I could read again!"},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"Albom gives an interesting and refreshingly original take on heaven, painting a picture of a place in which the human quest for meaning continues on even after we die. The Five People You Meet in Heaven is the story of an average Joe maintenance worker who goes through life mostly unseen, but through a post-death series of encounters with other spirits, shows that peoples' stories are often interconnected in ways we don't notice.The story reads almost like a modern day fable or fairy tale, with a diverse set of characters- everything from a blue-skinned man to a young Vietnamese girl to a drunk and crazy father. There are some subtle, but noticeable parallels between the sprits in this story and the Ghosts of Christmas Past in Dickens' A Christmas Carol. Five People You Meet in Heaven is a worthwhile book with a positive, humbling message and if nothing else, at just under 200 pages, is a pretty quick read."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"A good book to help keep you grounded with the important things in life. (people)"},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"This book is one that I simply couldn't put down. I read it from cover to cover the day that I bought it.

It keeps your attention and makes you want to turn the page to find out what is next. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"This book was an easy read, but not in a boring childish way, but in an interesting, moving kind. It made me think of life on earth and what it means to truly live and make something of our lives. I've learned so much from this book. It teaches us about forgiveness, understanding, perceptions, love, guilt, and heaven. Every individual lives in their own joyful world in heaven-heaven may be the time in our life on earth that we truly enjoyed. It will be filled with happiness rather than pain. I realize that God will give justice once we die-he makes us realize our mistakes and past like Eddie before letting our soul rest eternally. If you read this book, you may get a different message out of it, but that is the beauty of this book- that we all read it and make our own interpretations of heaven."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"Albom gives us a glimpse of a heaven we'd love to embrace. The messages Eddie receives remind readers that our lives have meaning beyond our understanding, always. Alas, we all fall short of our dreams, seemingly. This is not to say that our actions don't affect others in fortuitous and blessed ways. The book is gracefully rendered and valuble reading, if for no other reason than to live faithfully and do the best we can, every moment, every day. As others have noted, it is truly a feel-good book, and Lord knows, we all can use a dose of feeling good, every moment, every day. Read the book."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"Mitch Albom has written a powerful parable about the interconnectedness of human life and about the value of seeing meaning in our lives and the lives of others. His writing style is simple, direct, and very concrete. His points are simple, like a lot (but not all) of good philosophy. The ethics of living them out are sensibly left to other works."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"This is one hell of a book. I read it three times and still don't understand all of it. I'm going to read it again tonight and tommorow so I'll keep you posted. Some good stuff here, get it while it's hot !!"},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I have to say this was a good book, although my favorite is still Tuesdays with Morrie. For the most part I think what this book does is it provides a person with comfort in knowing that when you die you are not alone in your journey to the afterlife. It also reminds a person to not take life for granted and to value the people you do have in your life. Although I found this book to be slow in some parts it was a good book overall."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"Interesting makes you wonder who are you going to meet in Heaven?From your pass to the present? who will you run into?"},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"This book really touched my heart. Superb Writing from Mr. Albom as always. Very good read for all ages. Thank you_"},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"The book was interesting from the beginning to the end.

This book was for my son's school project. He read it quickly and loved it. It was suspenseful the whole time and very intriguing."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"This was an okay book for me. Granted, it kept me reading, but I just didn't care for it the way I did Tuesday's with Morrie. It was interesting to see who the 5 people were. Eddie is a grizzled war veteran who feels trapped in the same work as his father before him - fixing rides at a seaside amusement park. On his 83rd birthday, Eddie is killed in an accident at the park while trying to save a little girl. He awakens to find that Heaven is a place where your life is explained to you by 5 people who were in your life. It's an interesting premise, but I wasn't as thrilled with this book as I thought I would be. Thought provoking, yes, but it just didn't quite do it for me."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"After reading Five People I still don't know why all the fuss. It is not a well written book. The story relies far too much on sensational events - a POW camp escape, a failed rescue in a stormy sea, a successful rescue at an amusement park tragedy, blah blah blah. The book is at its best when it doesn't rely on such third grade nonsense, i.e the parts that focus in Eddie and his wife."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I just read, \\"The Five People You Meet in Heaven.\\" Have you read it? If not, you should know it's mistitled, and should be called, \\"The Five People Eddie Meets in Heaven.\\" The only universal elements of this novella are the sappy, sentimental, predictable messages Eddie's five people give him. Eddie is a simple-minded man of meager, crushed ambition, and just to give you a prelude of what you're in for, every significant event in his life just happens to take place on his birthday. Oh, the richness and irony when significant events happen right on a man's birthday! I'm not saying there aren't parts of the book that are moving. But you know what? Oprah is moving too, and her show has more literary value."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"The writing is fine. Good grammar, good sentence construction, and nicely laid out paragraphs. It's not difficult to read, and it's not exactly boring.I guess what I have a problem with is the whole point of the book. It's very \\"Christmas Special.\\" Moreover, it's just been done. A thousand times. There's nothing new here. And there's nothing much to learn from reading this.It might be the kind of gift you give someone you don't know very well."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"This book was a good read. I found it enjoyable and at times quite sad...The author writes quite well.However, I don't see what all the fuss is about. Sometimes I am confused by the books that are bestsellers when there is so much out there that's so much better. This book is nothing special."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I had heard what a wonderful book this was, but after reading it, I found it sappy and began to think that this is one of those books that people feel obligated to like when really there isn't much there. I definitely wanted to like this book much more than I did, I enjoyed Tuesdays with Morrie, also by Mitch Albom, and I liked the idea of heaven being an exploration of our interconnectedness and an answer to the question \\"Why am I here?\\" but it was not the life-altering experience for me that I've heard about from other people.Things I did like about the book (in addition to it being a quick read) was that it made me think about how you affect others daily, sometimes without ever realizing it. I also liked that the story showed a portrait of a man who hated what his life had become, but in the end (through the mentors he meets in heaven) he comes to find out that he wasn't as worthless as he believed he was (the sappy part).The mentors were 5 people he had touched/encountered in life, some he affected knowingly, and others he affected unknowingly. The book left me disappointed as it never did answer, for me, what the point of Eddie's life was...nor was I convinced it was not worthless."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"Sappy. Simple. Saccharine. These are words Amazon reviewers have used to describe this book. Thus warned, I gave it a shot.Weighing in under 200 very light pages, this novella is a work of wonder. Albom uses minimalist prose to gain the greatest effect. I've never read his work before, but I was impressed with his ability to capture character and settings in few words. His people are working class, average joes--people we can relate with. I thought the opening scenes and the war narratives were exceptional.Sure, the themes here have been explored before. No, Albom doesn't offer any particularly new revelations. He doesn't even try to appeal to any one religious faith. But he does succeed in reminding us of the value of life and the interconnectedness of fate and relationships and God's plan. As the title suggests, the book will require a leap of faith and credibility. If you're willing to make that jump, if you're willing to open your heart to this simple, yet profound tale, you'll be won over by the magical quality of &quot;The Five People You Meet in Heaven.&quot;"},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"Yes, everything we do matters, even if we can't see it at the time. But, where are the ideas to help us to see what we should do at the time, where are the real problems solvers and insights to get deeper into real-life situations? 5 People is a feel-good story, but if you want real guidance and ability to know how to recognize opportunities when you see them, you'll want to go deeper - get a book like Psychic Gifts by Tiffany Snow is a good one I just finished, or find a good workbook on developing skills beyond the ones carried by us at the surface of our souls."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I actually only bought this book because Amazon had it &quot;linked&quot; to David Chartrand's book &quot;A View from the Heartland,&quot; which I had bought earlier. Both are wonderful, wonderful books that should be read by everyone! Both Albom and Chartrand show us how the average, normal person finds meaning and purpose and value in his or her life. I wish both authors a lot of luck and hope both books get wide circulation."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I no more know what Heaven may be like than the author. That said, from the fertile mind of Albom, if these pages hold what Heaven &quot;could be&quot;, then bring it on! Masterful story telling. One of those books you hate to see end."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"The Five People You Meet In Heaven is Mitch Albom's second novel I have read -- and if you liked Tuesday's with Morrie, I believe you will like this one too. Don't expect anything earth shattering....there is not necessarily ONE profound message that this book sends. Rather - it sends five messages -in the form of people, as they are each presented to Eddie - head of maintenance at Ruby Point amusement park, after he dies trying to save a little girl from a falling cart.Heaven, instead of a lush garden, is a place where the similar earthly pain is revisited WITH each of the five people that Eddie meets. They are each part of Eddie's life and are people he knows, or they can be distant strangers whose lives have impacted or have been impacted by that of this tired and hopeless 83 year old man.Though pain is experienced in heaven, there is also a beauty that Eddie finds in bringing closure to each of the five people he meets in his heaven, for even though death is looked at as an &quot;end&quot; Eddie is able to see how it IS really the beginning....It is the beginning of the journey to finding out what meaning one's life carries with it....and also what one's life has meant to others, and how it has changed them. Even if you didn't realize it when you were on earth. The skies of heaven shed light on those reasons.While this book was simple and perhaps not as complex and detailed as the drawn out death we see in &quot;Tuesdays With Morrie,&quot; I did find that it shed a brighter light on the whole idea of death itself. In his first book, I felt that Albom was making the reader feel comfortable - and coming to terms with - the fact that death is nothing to fear. Yet in this novel, I found that there was a more positive message, because it doesn't focus only on endings and accepting one's wrongdoings.....it is rather more focused on new beginnings, and remembering not just one's own wrongdoings - but those of others (or the perceived ones of others).It makes me think, who would be the five people in my own heaven?"},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"This excellent fable, by the author of Tuesdays With Morrie (also excellent) tells of Eddie, a maintenance worker, who dies as the result of an accident. He meets five people in heaven who tell him about his life. Various points are marked with \\"Today is Eddie's birthday\\", as an introduction to the various ages in Eddie's life where significant events take place, e.g, the first time Eddie helps his father \\"fix\\" something, and so on. His father seems kind of cruel, and his mother, doting; as some mothers are likely to be, tells the significance of life. It also serves as a fable to illustrate the meaning of life. It tells us how, even when we do not think we mean much, if we do not think we have achieve anything great, the impact we have on others, with our lives, might be enough. There is an excellent introduction by the auther, Albom, and an interview following, which help to explain the means and message of the story. As I said, it is sad in places, and I can relate it to someone in my life, my late father, but it is a great story. Worthy of a listen."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"Lets start at the end. Eddie died on his 83rd birthday. He died from a cart from a rollar coaster falling on him while he was trying to save a little girl. Eddie worked as a maintenance guy at Ruby Falls, a amusement park. When Eddie gets to heaven it is not what he thought it would be. The first person Eddie meets in heaven is the \\"Blue Man,\\" his skin is dyed blue. The Blue Man tells Eddie about how he died and teaches him a lesson about why some people live and why some don't. The second person Eddie meets is the Captian, who commanded him in war. The Captain showed Eddie why some things happened to him in war and about his knee and teaches him a lesson about sacrifices in life. The third person Eddie meets in heaven is an older woman whoses name is Ruby, her husband built Ruby Falls and named it after her as a gift. She taught Eddie about why somethings happened to him by his father. Ruby taught Eddie about forgivness. The forth person Eddie meets in heaven is Marguerite, Eddie's wife that died at 47. Marguerite showed Eddie a bunch of weddings and then they just talked about everything that had happened since she died. Marguerite taught Eddie about true love and how that feeling never goes away. The fifth person Eddie meets is a little girl named Tala. When Eddie was a solider, he burnt a house down and he didn't know it but Tala was in the burning house. In heaven Tala told Eddie how much he meant to all the little children that came to Ruby Falls and that everyones life has a purpose. Tala also told Eddie..... well i guess i shouldn't tell you that. In the end Eddie gets to go to heaven and met God and be with Marguerite again. This is a awesome book and everyone should read it. Although I am warning you it is a tear jerker and I cried alot in it. It is a very good book."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I had read \\"Tuesdays with Morrie\\" some years ago, and liked it so much that I bought several copies as gifts. This time, I had decided to bypass Albom's newest, \\"The Five People You Meet in Heaven.\\" My reasons? The book was getting so much hype, and, well, something about that process, perhaps my personal bias, but I go into avoidance when I smell \\"sheep mentality.\\" Unfair, no doubt, and no doubt with such a bias I do miss a good book now and then. But this time I had also caught a portion of the movie based on this book (Jon Voight is an excellent actor, and so I let the remote cool during my channel surfing), and while Voight still impressed me, the storyline did not. Man dies in accident via doing good deed, feels generally discontent with his life, but meeting 5 key people in heaven whose lives he had touched in either good or not so good way, he learns key lessons and finds the value he had missed in life. (If this seems a reminder of the much meatier classic, \\"It's a Wonderful Life,\\" you're right, it is, and I prefer the former classic.)Pass.Then it was Christmas. In my household, books are a traditional gift. My niece, a reader and writer in her own right, gifted me \\"Five People.\\" (A few years prior, I had gifted her \\"Tuesdays.\\") Okay. It was meant to be. I cracked open the cover and tried to keep an open mind. So, yeah, not bad. Simple if not at times simplistic writing. Predictable plot. No new message or moral of the story. But on occasion Albom did manage to please my sensibility for good writing, and now and then, I admit, the story moved me.\\"Five People\\" is not high on my list of favorite books. Not even the high range of middling. But that it was a gift from my niece makes it a treasure, and it is a pleasant read if one is looking for a moment's escapism."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"When I picked up The Five People You Meet In Heaven, I wasn't expecting some groundbreaking work of literature. Just the fact that it was only 196 pages long clued me in that it was going to be a \\"simple\\" book. Simple is exactly what the book is. It sets out to make a point, and it makes it very well. The point that we are all connected, that random events aren't really random. We all have a purpose in life. Whether that purpose is sacrifice, or something less, we are stilll here to fulfill our purpose.Do I think the book could have been more powerful? Yes, but it didn't need to be. If it had been stretched into 400 pages, we probably would have cared more for Eddie, the main character, but the point of the book isn't to care for Eddie, although he does serve as the main drawing point for the book's emotional power. Each person that Eddie meets in heaven serves as a gateway for understand how important his life really was, no matter how unimportant he believed it to be. The ending of the book is also very well done, as it reinforces the point of the entire book: our lives are all interconnected.This isn't some life-changing book, but it is a really good book that actually has a message."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"This is a tale about a man who basically relives his life through heaven. Its very complicating due to the fact that it starts at the end of his life and talks backwards through his life, until hes young again. This tale is very bitter yet sweet. It has its moments where you want to cry because Eddie is talking about how he was mistreated by his father, and how he struggled to make it through all the hard times that he had to deal with him not being able to feel his legs; and other times when your really happy, like for instance when Eddie is saving the little girl from the ride that is breaking down. I would recommend this book to anyone who has ever lost someone due to an accident, any kind of accident really because I believe that it helps you cope with the fact that your loved one is gone."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"Like all great stories it has metaphors we can associate with the realities of our lives. There are five such metaphors in Albom's story that touch upon ignorance, hate, resentment, longing, and guilt.So, what's the lesson?A great story must be able to give a perspective about life to better it. Five People, five lessons, five emotions, five perspectives, like the glistening facets of a gem, all intertwined and related to one another ending up in a needless trap we call worrying. Events in our lives happen for a reason, though not always good. But what makes us worry is not the bad outcome, rather lack of understanding why.There is salvation in knowledge. While I'm telling you this, Albom is showing it in his story The Five People You Meet in Heaven."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I listened to the audio version of this book, and it was great. The accompanying music helped set the mood for the narration, and dramatized specific events in the book. As I travelled along with Eddie in heaven, I felt at various times numb, shocked, happy, sad, afraid, and nearly brought to tears. I found this book to be an inspiration for me, and an acceptable tale about life and death. Sure it's a fantasy view of heaven...Mr. Albom's fantasy...but even fantasies hold messages that can impact reality. This fantasy about heaven was endearing, and provides lessons for the living."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"This is the kind of book and story, with its wonderful character portrayal, message, and theme that lasts forever. It's a simple book, and simple means beautiful in the way it is written. Read it for the messages. Read it for the inspiration. It's a beautiful story and a fantastic read."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"This book was assigned to my son as a summer reading requirement.As I read it I kept me wanting more and more. I brought Eddie to you so that you could get to know him. It was like you could see this as what could happen when you go to heaven.

I was anxious to read it since I was very impressed with Mitch Albom's other book: Tuesdays With Morrie. Albom is a very sensitive writer...and I enjoy his style. I enjoyed The Five People even more than Tuesdays with Morrie. It is very thought-provoking. I highly recommend this book. I have just recently purchased 3 other copies to pass along to special friends because I know they will want their own personal copies of it."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I positively adore this book. The writing is exceedingly simplistic, the emotions just a little too sappy, and the characters a little one-dimensional... but despite all that, I still love this book.To start with, I find the idea of this story to be very creative and original. When I first heard of it, I thought the obvious -- that the main character would meet Jesus or St. Peter or whoever. But instead, the five people that Eddie meets appear to be somewhat random -- two of the people are people he has never met, and one he only barely knew. However, each person he met in Heaven had a profound impact on Eddie's life, and in the end they helped him to make sense of his seemingly meaningless existence.If I could choose only one word to describe this book, it would be \\"sweet.\\" Practically anyone can relate to Eddie -- his childhood, his first love, his dreams, his heartbreak, his unremarkable life. However, through Eddie, we come to realize that we all have a place in this life, and that our lives influence others the way others have influenced our own."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"A very lovely, interesting and meaningful book. well deserved on your bookshelf.

Truly incredible view on life after life. On how everyone is connected to the next person, and how through this web of connections we are each inevitably touched and effected by another, no matter how far fetched. How each event is necessary for another event to occur. A building block. A necessity to history. No matter how inconsequential. And beneath this theme are so many more indispensable life lessons.

The story follows him as he re-witnesses the events and moments that happened in his life, and how knowing what happened from another angle may change the way you feel about someone, or something. The story tells us how Eddie felt \\"in the moment\\" and then the events are re-explained or re-written when Eddie meets one of the people who affected his life in Heaven.Whether you believe in Heaven or not, Albom still tells a story that will affect you and how you are affected by events in your life, and by people whom you meet.It's a lovely story and a fast read."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I haven't finished it yet, but I really liked the beginning.

I throughly enjoyed it and have recommended to several friends already. It challenges you to think about how every person you meet is somehow intertwined in your story, some in a small way, and other in a very big, life changing way.

These five people--sometimes strangers, sometimes lovers--will help Eddie to understand his long life, and his significance within it.The Five People You Meet in Heaven is a powerful, emotional roller coaster ride, filled with tear-jerking moments and heartwarming revelations, leading to a conclusion that could melt the hearts of even the most Nihilistic of readers. Written in a simple, easy-to-read style and finely paced, one can finish this 200-page work in a day--as I did.A brilliant tale about meaning and the tremendous impact one person's life has on countless others, this book will tug at your heartstrings and its message will keep with you long after you turn the last page, regardless of your beliefs on Heaven, God or the afterlife."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"The writing in this book was fabulous. It's simple, and it rolls at an easy pace, tugging the reader along with it. It was very easy to follow, even with the occasional flashback.The characterization was great! I know I really felt Eddie's pain and confusion as he went on this journey, learning things about others and himself that he never knew. All of the minor characters were well developed as well. I certainly didn't find out everything about them, but I knew enough to realize their contribution to Eddie's life and Eddie's life to theirs.The ending of the story fit very well. I was kind of worried about it because I wasn't sure what to expect, at all! I was suprised how it ended, in the best way possible. You know that feeling you get when you end a book, and it feels so right? Like the story ended exactly as it should? That's how I felt when I ended this is story.Overall, this is a great read that you should definitely give a try. I think you'll enjoy it!"},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"This book has a wonderful message and is written with great skills. One of my favorite books.

From astonishment to even more surprises, he learns his final answer from the least expected source and even more importantly the lesson \\"that each affects the other and the other affects the next, and the world is full of stories, but the stories are all one.\\" Albom forces you to reflect on every aspect of life and appreciate it. It is inspiring and inquisitive and leaves you with countless questions: Who are your five? Who was that man that walked across the street? Whom have I affected in this lifetime? The Five People You Meet in Heaven is a great read whether you are the sappy reader or the world's greatest Curious George. The novel ascended to make the Best Seller's list equivalently to his other novels such as For One More Day and Tuesday's with Morrie. Give a copy to a friend; read it if you are bored. Regardless, it is a book that is sure to remain in someone's hand and away from the bookshelves."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I love this book, i've already read it and i wanted to own it. It makes you think about all the decisions you've made in your lifetime and kinda makes you get out of that selfishness we sometimes fall into."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"The five people you meet in heaven was a very moving and touching story to read. At first I was just reading the book because it was the shortest one to choose form our selection for our English Class. But as I started to read the story I started to get into it. The only part of the book that I didnt like was at the end of every chapter there was a part about Eddie's birthday. This was interesting but I felt that it didnt belong in the story. I think Mitch Albom took the right direction with this story. The colorful setting and lively characters show how this man's live was. Through the good times and the bad he stayed true to character. I would reccomend this book to a lot of people. If you like a short very interesting story with a great storyline, then this is the book for you."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"The story is very nice, creative, and a little sad- as would be expected considering that the main character is in heaven and you probably already know that he has passed on. I actually expected more out of the book. I just felt like it could have been more substantive. Having read the book after recently loosing my mother, I guess I needed to feel reassured and inspired. But I am not sure that the book accomplished that. Maybe at a different point in my life I would have appreciated it more. Still I thought it was great and definitely worth reading. Good enough to read again."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I thought this was going to be a really long emotional read. But this was really pleasant. I loved the idea and how well it was presented. For some reason, it was less moving than I thought but nice overall."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"For me, this was just a nice story and easy to read, until the clincher at the end. Mitch Albom came up with a twist that made all the other pieces of the story make sense and told me how eventually what we do in our lives does come back to us. In this story it was a good thing at the end of a man's life. How many Eddies are there out there?"},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"This deeply moving book about one man's trip through heaven is a great book for people of nearly every age. It's easy enough for some children to read, yet mature enough for adults. Due to several intense fire and war scenes, including and a scene involving a burned person, I would suggest young kids not read this book. When a little girl becomes trapped underneath a falling ride, Eddie, an elderly mechanical worker at the park, tries to save her, but dies in the attempt. When he arrives in heaven, he finds that upon arrival, you meet five people that made a difference in your life, in order to learn the purpose of your life. Does Eddie save the little girl? Who does he meet in his journey through the ultimate paradise? Read this powerful novel to find out."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"A nice journey through heaven reminiscent of What Dreams May Come in terms of it's visual intensity. It seems almost written to be re-enacted on stage. Was suprised that it's being made for TV already, though I guess it could have been expected. Has a touch of The Alchemist from Paolo Coehlo in terms of the parabolic nature of the text. Would have loved to give a copy to my Grandparents but I was afraid that they might take it the wrong way. I'd love to read a book like this later in my life.Definitely worth a quick read with the right state of mind."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"Why are we here? What are we here for? These are the questions that this book tries to answer through telling the tale of one man's life, death and journey in the after-life. It's a fast, thought-provoking read that offers a unique spin on the purpose of life. What's unique is the point of view - one of a purpose for every life that doesn't necessarily imply a religious bias. This is a good selection for a vacation or relaxing weekend."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I really enjoyed this book and found it hard to put down (like many other reviewers on this site). As a Christian, I already have a strong belief in the biblical idea of heaven and really wasn't looking to this book for further confirmation of those beliefs. If you are looking for that in this book, I would not recommend it to you.However, if you are looking for an uplifting story that gives some much-needed perspective on how each person's actions and decisions (even the most mundane) can affect others (sometimes those they have never met), I would highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"This little book put an interesting perspective on our overall place in the world. For those who like the thought that everything is connected, this is a good little tale. But I guess if you're reall introspective and questioning, this book leaves you wanting more answers than you'll ever get. And maybe that's the whole point."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"Mitch Albom's book cannot help but to inspire deep thinking. The connectiveness we should feel throughout humanity is lacking in our modern busy world. Albom reminds us through this work how we are connected knowingly and unknowingly. This book was a quick read. I caught myself only perusing the first life and had to reread. The great thing about his work is that it could be enjoyed on a surface level and delved into it slower for more self reflection. I was definitely glad that I picked it from my library."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I read this book about 5 months ago...It has given me pause to reflect on the way we enter and leave each others lives and what a profound influence we can have on one another without even realizing it...I know it has affected the way I think and feel about the intangibles of life and that there may be fewer perchance occurrences in our lives than we imagine... I found it an easy and fast read that kept me coming back to reread and rethink its words...very thought provoking. thank you."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"This book is the author's interpretation of what heaven may be like. After reading the book my first thoughts were that if I was to die and sent to a place like this, it would not be so bad. The main character in the book, Eddie, is an old amusement park maintenance worker who dies while trying to save a little girl after one of the newer rides malfunctions. Eddie dies during the heroic act and is then sent to five seperate locations to meet five people. Each person teaches Eddie a lesson and shows him finally how he and their life was somehow intertwined. Everyone's story is one and the same, according to Albom, but we sometimes must die first to understand in what way we touched other individuals' lives. The essential message in this book is that everyone matters. Our life is touched and changed by others just as we touch and leave an imprint on others in this process of life. The book is short, well-written, and thought provoking. In short, it is a delightful little book and better than the author's previous best seller, &quot;Tuesdays With Morrie.&quot;"},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I found &quot;The five people you meet in heaven&quot; to be very moving. I couldn't put it down. In fact, I read the entire book within five hours of picking it up. This is definately a keeper. I am sure that I will find myself reading this again and again through the years."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"In many ways, The Five People You Meet in Heaven is a simple little book; as is so often the case, the most profound of answers are revealed most clearly in the simplest of explanations. This is not a book about heaven in a religious sense; the truths it establishes are to be found right here in our own lives: every life has a purpose, every person and every action is related, and while you may not be able to discern it now, it all makes sense in the end.Eddie represents all of us to some degree. Looking back on his life with regret over all the things he should have done or not done, he is almost a ghost of himself. Since the death of his wife, he has basically gone through the motions, working at the same job his father worked before him, dealing with the bad dreams brought on by his wartime experience, watching his body deteriorate to the point that he can barely get around, waiting for nothing, feeling nothing but regret. He always wanted to get away from his father and live an entirely different sort of life, yet he wound up taking over his father's job, living in the same building, failing to achieve any of the hopes and dreams he embraced so tightly as a young man. His wife was his only anchor, and she has been dead a long time now.When we first meet Eddie, he is about to die. The end is just another beginning, however, and we learn the story of Eddie's life as the novel progresses. Heaven is not what he expected; he finds no peace here at all. Happiness cannot come without understanding, however, and five people are waiting to explain Eddie's life to him. They include people he barely knew or did not know at all, yet he soon learns what a huge influence he had in their earthly lives. Each one imparts to Eddie a lesson he must learn in order to find peace. I won't describe who the five people are or what they tell him; but I will say that the overall message is a really touching and significant one. Understanding is not a pain-free process, but it leads to the complete unburdening of Eddie's soul. The ending was nothing short of beautiful. It would have been easy to sit back and let an overly sappy conclusion ruin the whole story, but Albom does not let that happen.While this is a great and rewarding read, some readers will never give themselves fully to the story and will thus wonder what the big deal about this book is. For many, though, The Five People You Meet in Heaven will provide an important level of comfort and inspiration for those who see only a past of regrets and no future. We all sometimes wonder why we are here and whether it's even worth going on day after meaningless, monotonous day. This book does not provide the definitive answer to such profound questions, but it does provide an answer - and it is a comforting one."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"When I finished the last page of Mitch Albom's TUESDAYS WITH MORRIE, I knew I had to share the book with as many people as I could. I proceeded to buy 41 copies, inscribe them all to my friends and family members, hand them out, mail them --- whatever I had to do to spread the word. The book was that moving, in my opinion. So I was eagerly looking forward to THE FIVE PEOPLE YOU MEET IN HEAVEN and I am happy to report that Albom did not disappoint me. He is a first-rate storyteller, and THE FIVE PEOPLE YOU MEET IN HEAVEN is an imaginative, creative tale in the tradition of the best fairy tales or folklore.Eddie is a maintenance man who keeps the rides safe at the Ruby Pier amusement park. His 83rd birthday seems like any other day --- he inspects the rides, watches the people, makes pipe cleaner animals for the children. However on this day he dies unexpectedly, trying to rescue a young girl in harm's way.Eddie wakes up in heaven --- but not to the &quot;paradise garden, a place where (we) can float on clouds and laze in rivers and mountains,&quot; not the idyllic place that heaven has been described as throughout time. Eddie awakens to a series of introductions --- or reintroductions --- to five people whom he had met during his life, either in passing or at length. They each carry answers to the whys and hows of Eddie's life. With each meeting he relives in part that time of his life, but now the gaps are filled in. For maybe the first time he sees what REALLY happened. &quot;There are five people you meet in heaven,&quot; the Blue Man, Eddie's first encounter, explains. &quot;Each of us was in your life for a reason. You may not have known the reason at the time, and that is what heaven is for. For understanding your life on earth.&quot;All five are of course deceased, and they all impart knowledge of Eddie's life and life in general. For instance, the Blue Man asks, &quot;Why do people gather when others die,&quot; and his explanation is at the very core of the meaning of Albom's book: &quot;It is because the human spirit knows, deep down, that all lives intersect. That death doesn't just take someone, it misses someone else, and in the small distance between being taken and being missed lives are changed.&quot; It is insights like these that leave the reader asking, &quot;What does Mitch Albom know that we don't?&quot;What he knows is that we all seek answers. We look for meaning behind the experiences in our lives. More often than not, we never get the answers but we continue --- we plod on, happy or unhappy, fulfilled or unfulfilled, pain-free or in pain. We live. Albom doesn't pretend to offer us the answers, but he does offer us an almost Taoist interpretation of life. It is. It just is. The answers may never be revealed. And do they need to be?THE FIVE PEOPLE YOU MEET IN HEAVEN is a beautiful story. Eddie is human and likable for his foibles, fears and faults. The writing is often lyrical and fable-like. And though the book is fiction, behind it lies Albom's lifelong love of his uncle, which lends a tenderness and intimacy to the tale on par with TUESDAYS WITH MORRIE. You'll want to share this with your friends, family, acquaintances, and even those nameless people you pass on the street who may have played a larger role in your life than you ever could have imagined.--- Reviewed by Roberta O'Hara"},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"This is a relatively short book and a pleasant read. It's kind of a roller coaster plot where you follow a person's walk into heaven. It really explores the character of a person and gives you an interesting look on what heaven could be like."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"The story is very touching, and takes a new and refreshing perspective on what happens after we die.

That's how I feel about this book. After the absolute masterpiece that is \\"Tuesdays with Morrie,\\" I really feel that Albom attempts to go back to the well but there is very little water. Although it may not be fair to compare a non-fiction book to a fiction book, Albom sets himself up for this by writing about and reflecting on death again. I'm not against the possibility that all of us affect other humans on a daily basis in ways we can't imagine, I just don't really like how Albom portrays this in this book.The book is a quick read and has some good thoughts but nothing compared to the incredible lessons that the real-life Morrie bestowed upon us."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"\\"the five people\\" is an outstanding book. about 200 pages, it's very easy reading. it tells the story of a man who goes to heaven and meets various people who share with him secrets that had affected him at various times throughout his life. this book is brilliantly developed. it is highly recommended!!!"},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I am so glad I decided to read this book. I was really feeling torn as to whether I wanted to start a book that was known be slightly controversial, because I have a hard time \\"ditching\\" a book midway. However, this was a quick-read that proved to be more inspirational than entertaining. It was, however, exciting to attempt to predict who Eddie's \\"next person\\" in Heaven was. (Not so predictable, it turned out!) I will mention that while I am a Christian woman, you do not need to be a Christian to relate to this book. It simply describes the \\"pre-heaven\\" state that Eddie goes to directly after his death where he meets 5 different people that explain to him how their lives were connected and explain different aspects of his life that he didn't understand before. It really is interesting and really makes you think. There are more than a few phrases and paragraphs from the book that I think will stay with me forever :)"},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I really liked this story about 83 year old Eddie who dies saving a girl from a carnival ride and going to heaven meeting 5 people who have changed his life on earth.

I can't wait to get For One More Day written by him as well."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"This book, is one persons view of what happens after we die.

The story is about Eddie, an Eighty year old man who dies an meets five people who help him understand the life he lived, and how it impacted the world.I loved how Albom goes from the heaven experiences of Eddie to his birthdays through out his life.While I'm not sure I can make the book completly jive with what I believe about what happens after this life, I found it not to be sacreligious or defaming in one religion. In short it could happen this way for all I know.If you like a good read that will inspire you look for opportunities to make a lasting impression then take the time to pick this book up."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I absolutely loved this book.

I read this book for an assignment in school and found myself unable to stop reading it. The vivid details and real-life connections made throughout the story made it come to life. I found myself relating many of the things in the book to my life and to many of my close friend's and family member's lives.I thoroughly enjoyed this story of love, loss and friendship. By page count, this story is short however, the number of deep thoughts and heart grasping events in the book made it anything but short. I would suggest this book to anyone enjoys realistic fiction with a dreamy twist."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I have the audio CD version. Read perfectly by the author. Very interesting...held my attention."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"Written in clear, spare prose, this slender tome is a pleasant little book that can easily be read in one sitting. It is a sentimental look at life and the hereafter. The book focuses on an individual named Eddie, who is the chief maintenance mechanic for the rides at a seaside amusement park called Ruby Pier. It is around him that the book revolves. Eddie is a somewhat embittered and lonely old man who tragically dies on his eighty third birthday, while trying to save a child from certain death when an amusement ride comes loose from its moorings.When he dies, Eddie meets five people in heaven. Each of them imparts a special lesson about Eddie's life. Each lesson allows him to understand the meaning of his life a little better. The five people that he meets show Eddie, and the reader, how we are all connected, and that the smallest acts can often have great impact on others, both positively and negatively. The book's bottom line message is that everyone has a purpose in life, whether or not it is readily apparent to one. It is as if there were a cosmic tapestry, with the life of one interwoven with the life of another, the threads crossing unknowingly but creating a larger picture.Although the author definitely manipulates the sensibilities of the reader, that is not necessarily a bad thing. The book, however, is somewhat predictable and, at times, a little reminiscent of a treacly Hallmark greeting card, both schmaltzy and touching. It was no surprise that the book ended up as a Hallmark Hall of Fame production and turned into a made-for-TV movie. The film is quite enjoyable, and Jon Voight is terrific in the lead role. I actually saw the film before I read the book, and the film whetted my appetite for the book. While not as good as the author's other book, \\"Tuesdays with Morrie\\", it is still a book that will resonate, if only because many will find its simple message comforting. Profundity, after all, may be found in simplicity."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"an awe inspiring book that I desperately needed to read. So much has happened in my life. One of which was abuse. I have had the &quot;why me&quot; feeling for years.Recently I bought this book and Nightmares Echo. I think it was a higher power that talked me into getting The Five people you Meet in Heaven...I bought Nightmares Echo because I thought it would mirror my life. It did, it was everything I had hoped it would be. The Five people you Meet in Heaven...gave me hope. Gave me a reason to let go of the past. Read this book if you do nothing else"},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"This has to be one of the best books I've ever read. In fact I read it in one night because I couldn't put it down. The author Mitch Albom combines the three separate parts of one mans life in a way that I found myself amazed at how each part flows together without confusion from going back and forth from the different parts of the man's life. I also found his fictional account of the afterlife very intriquing. Almost like a jigsaw puzzle the pieces fall into place without giving away how the book ends. Where many books have a predictable ending, Albom is able to keep you in suspense throughout the book to the last page. An excellent read. Karen M. Smith"},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I absolutley loved this book. It is so well written that you can stop reading. On the surface it is a nice story but when you start thinking about it you really begin to think about your own faith and how you viewed heaven. I strongly recommend this book to any and everyone. It has an awsome ending and will leave you satisfied and better off for reading it."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I had a hard time paging through the first chapter, entitled &quot;The End&quot;; it read like an episode of Highlights. Mitch Albom maintains this style throughout the book, somewhat similar to the style in Tuesdays with Moorie, and that style deters me as a reader somewhat. I would expect more from a well-spoken drive-time radio commentator.The message in the book is profound, however. I myself did not find it preachy. Albom has a way of working in his principles that, if taken seriously, can offer an altering view on life. While I would not read the book again, I would advise anyone seeking to read it to deal with the low-level storytelling to in exchange reap the benefits of his underlying message."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"&quot;The Five People You Meet In Heaven&quot; is another beautiful novel written by the bestselling author of &quot;Tuesday's with Morrie,&quot; Mitch Albom. He tells us of &quot;the secret of heaven:that each affects the other and the other affects the next, and the world is full of stories, but the stories are all one.&quot;Here we are in Eddie's heaven - the 83 year old war veteran dies trying to save a little girl from a falling cart at Ruby Point amusement park. In heaven he meets five people who explain his earthly life to him. They may be good friends, family members, or total strangers - or so he may think they are strangers. But Eddie learns that what he had thought was a waste of life was not only one human being's life, but also how it affects others in the world, what people mean to each other, and how one act of kindness can produce hatred and the opposite too.This book was truly an inspiration - it was simple but sweet and all to the point! I thought this book definitely had a much more POSITIVE outlook on life, even though it is about dying and death. Whereas in Tuesday's With Morrie, I felt it was more about coming to terms with the negative &quot;ending.&quot;&quot;The Five People You Meet In Heaven&quot; is an outstanding novel that told me how endings are also beginnings, and how they too can be positive. Earthly life may end, but the heavens bring you - and those around you - to peace.A MUST READ - for anyone with an open heart!"},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I found this book not only entertaining but enlightening.

That's how good I think it is."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"This book certain presents an interesting view of the afterlife, but it's overly simplistic with almost no depth or real texture to the story.

I just finished it and rushed to buy this book. I'm sad to say I thought this book was mediocre at best. Mitch Albom's view of heaven was interesting but not the heaven I want to see.Each of the five people met in heaven are supposed to give you a better understanding of why things happened during your life. There is only one, Eddie's captain, that goes into detail. The remaining four have chapters that are too short without great enough detail. I did not feel like any lessons were really taught except perhaps by one of the five people met. Wonderful premise for the book but just not enough elaboration. Also, like Morrie, too short."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"Mitch Albom's &quot;The Five People You Meet in Heaven&quot; is an incredibly uplifting and inspirational book. Page after page, you come across many similarities to your own life to relate to in this easy read.

I know I did."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"This book is simple but holds a strong and emotional reflection over how our choices surrounding our faith calls the shots on our journey through life, now and afterwards. Some reviewers don't like it while others love it. If you think you are a know it all - you may not like it. If you are creative and open to ideas, you will probably enjoy it. It makes one think about what our choices have been and how we can make better ones from this day forward. Also recommeded: Hannah's Prayer, an insightful spirited filled book, and for parents who need thoughtful parenting skills, Mommy-CEO, by Jodie Lynn. These three books will make most individuals stop and think about actions today and how they will affect our tomorrow."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"Heaven is a place where your life is explained to you by five people who were in it. What a great idea for a book! And who isn't at least a little bit intrigued by a book about the afterlife?Two reasons why I bought the book and, I would surmise, two reasons why the book was written. Unfortunately the book read like a conscious effort to create a story that would fit a preconcieved premise. My expectations may have been too high, but I still enjoyed this book! Even when it became somewhat predictable, I couldn't wait to find out who he would meet next and how their story would fit into his life in a way that would give meaning and purpose to it.Its a short read, and I would recommend it with your expectations in check."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"In this rich little novel, you meet Eddie on his 83rd birthday just before he is about to die. His life is like many others, maybe yours...where he questions &quot;what's it all been about?&quot; Eddie soon finds out when he awakens in his familiar amusement park in the teacup ride only to discover that he is dead and he is meeting with the side show freak that he vaguely remembers from childhood. He informs Eddie that he meets with five people to help him answer his questions about the life he has lived and to learn what he needs to know to move on. At first Eddie is confused, but as he moves from this piece of the afterlife to the next things become clearer and clearer and Eddie realizes that the smallest events can make the biggest difference. Mitch Albom has created a loveable and heartbreaking character in Eddie. We watch as he begins his life with enthusiasm and suppleness of body as a child and young man then witness the gradual deterioration of his body through age and lifes disappointments. You can't help but see yourself in this character because it is the human experience. Life as Eddie finds out is a grand plan without mistakes, without coincidences and that we are connected to our fellow man in a spider web like way that can reach back before we were even born. There is redemption, there is peace and there is a purpose. A very touching and insightful book."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"Although a good story and a peek into what someone else thinks heaven might be, I found The Traveler's Gift a better more compelling story.

No matter what your history, background, gender, class or whatever else may be, you were placed on this planet for a reason, even if you don't think you've figured it out.This book does a great job of showing one man's life's purpose. Even though the earth he lived on seemed empty and didn't support him, he had a purpose and his life was seen through giant lenses in heaven. Great read for those looking for philosophical quotations and the author's insight on life."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I just loved this book.It is based on the premise that our lives are interconnected with the lives of those we meet as we walk the earth and there ia a magesty and a greatness in the things that we do for others and in what they do for us.Eddie meets five people in Heaven who in turn reveal the true nature of all the small kind acts that he did in in his life but that he took for granted without realizing how much they meant to others.The well rounded and flawed personalities are very developed, each having their own life story, and each one contibuting to the whole.We see things now \\"though a glass, darkly\\", and this book illustrates a revalation of the deeper implications of Eddie's life and the true meaning of a lifetime of small contributions and how they ad up to a larger happiness for others.These are truely happy thoughts that we do not often pay enough attention to in our daily rat race."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"So, what can I say that 1397 other people haven't already said about this book? Not much. If you're looking for a feel-good book that will make you laugh and cry, an Oprah's-wet-dream kind of book, a book with a big message, big print, and no big words, a book that doesn't force you to think too much, but just allows you to feel and enjoy....well, this is it. Yes, it's sappy, but it teaches inspiring lessons about how every life has meaning and is connected to countless others.Even though Mitch Albom clearly knows the formula for building to a shamelessly emotional climax, this book does not feel in any way manipulative. Sure, we know he's trying to get us all choked up, but at least he doesn't hide that fact.This is the kind of book that grandmothers give to their granddaughters, and that granddaughters give to their grandmothers. It's the quintessential book-club book for the month after you've read Gravity's Rainbow, when your head is hurting. It's a book to read on the couch on a rainy Sunday afternoon with a cup of cocoa."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"Never judge a book by its cover! This small novel could easily have passed me by as the cover sucks. However, the story is a compelling read, and is truly a little gem. Well done, Mitch."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"'Five People You Meet in Heaven' is a disappointing book. The title itself suggests some interesting ideas about heaven. But the idea is a simple one; that could be covered by the first person the hero meets in Heaven. Making it five people is just a way to make a short story long. As an online short story it would live up to its expectations. As a long story, hard-cover book, it does not."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I loved Tuesdays with Morrie, but was horribly disappointed in Five People You Meet In Heaven. I found the premise interesting and the beginning very well done, but once Eddie got to heaven, I thought the book deteriorated into a bad marriage of It's A Wonderful Life and What Dreams May Come."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"This book could have been good.

And the first few pages do get you interested. BUT I read it with my mouth open wondering why anyone would praise this book. Mr. Albom made heaven sound like a place where people hang around waiting to dump guilt on the new guy. I found the war stories ugly and the entire book depressing. So glad that its not my version of heaven!!"},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"This story will move you. I don't think I've ever bought and finished a book in the same day, let alone in the same evening. It only took me five hours to devour this little gem.The subject is the life and death of what seems to be a nobody -- or perhaps an everyman named Eddie. His journey is told in a non-chronological manner that spreads the tapestry of Eddie's life. His life is cryptic, and the mysteries are gradually solved through the telling.As the title suggests, Eddie meets five people in heaven that explain to him &quot;how we are all connected.&quot; Each person provides a bit more understanding to Eddie's enigmatic life. Albom gracefully teaches Eddie such lessons with vibrant phrases such as, &quot;you can no more separate one life from another than you can separate a breeze from the wind.&quot;Though short [196 5X7&quot; pages], this is no short story. The crucial characters are fleshed out well, and the end isn't as predictable as you might guess.All in all, it's a good read. Take an evening to learn about Eddie, and perhaps a bit about yourself.http://www.dreifuss.org"},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I read this book in one sitting and I thought it was a beautiful book. The summary of the book is at the top so I'll skip that and just go to what a special book this is. It makes you think how every action you do in life has a reaction and it helps you appreciate the people in your life and accept them for who they are. I think this book is the type of book that comes along so rarely, it is the type of book that everyone would like.

You learn about Eddie's life and how it intertwined with other lives thru his &quot;trip&quot; to Heaven. The story is told thru his &quot;visits&quot; with 5 people in Heaven.This book does not tell you what to believe, it does not claim to be a religious book or a true story - only a possibility of what the afterlife, if there is one, has in store for us.&quot;The Five People You Meet In Heaven&quot; is a truly thought provoking book, and easy to read. It is best described by the words inside the front cover... &quot;...an enchanting, beautifully crafted novel that explores a mystery only Heaven can unfold.&quot;I highly recommend this book to all. It is very thought provoking and makes you view your life, and the lives of those around you, in a different light."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I decided to pick up this book after I watched the TV Movie on ABC.

Answers the age old question: Can one person make a difference?"},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"After reading \\"Tuesdays with Morrie\\" I had my expectations set very high for Mitch Albom's next book, and he suprised me with a brilliant novel about a man name Eddie that I soon grew to love as I read about his life, death, and all those who he touched.Albom's \\"spiritual\\" ideas about the afterlife and the interconnectedness of life and humanity is very touching."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"This book was recommended to me by a fellow book club sistahfriend (thanks Sheryl) and it took me a few months to actually pick it up and read it. My only regret is that I didn't read it when I initially purchased it. A great quick easy read powerpacked with spiritual prinicples that are so powerful...you have to take a breath before continuing on. I enjoyed the book very much and have recommended it to all of my reading buddies. I especially like the description of funerals and the author's take on life after death and how we (left behinders) are affected by it. I will definitely be buying this book as a holiday gift this year. Powerful, highly recommended book. The movie (on ABC recently) was close to the book and I enjoyed it too.The book left me with thoughts of heaven and wondering what five (5) people I'd be get the opportunity to meet when I get there....."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"If the other reviews are any indication, it seems most people enjoyed this book. It was just okay for me. Yes, in one way it was compelling because I wanted to know if the little girl was saved by Eddie before he died and went to the great beyond; but overall, the book didn't offer anything extraordinary; which I had expected from the title. Actually, the title is misleading. A title which would serve as a better descriptor would be, \\" The Five People Eddie Met in Heaven\\"."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"The Five People You Meet In Heaven is a novel about how a man has affected the lives of 5 people. When he dies at Ruby Pier trying to save a young girl, he is sent to heaven to meet the five people. The first one he meets is the blue man. The blue man talks and describes how he was affected by Eddie when he was sent to heaven because of him. The next person he meets in heaven is his old army captain. The captain takes Eddie back to when he was in the war. In his journey, he also encounters Ruby, his wife, and a young girl.In my opinion, this book was a great read. The novel was always interesting and kept you on your feet wondering what would happen next. The Five People You Meet In Heaven is a thrilling novel that also teaches one about how people are affected by your actions. The novel describes how even though you may not know it, lives coincide in magical and unusual ways."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"Usually, stories about heaven are filled with variations on the tired clich&eacute;s we expect to find. Not this book. By making the main character a down-to-earth, average guy, and heaven an almost mundane place, Albom puts a fresh new spin on the hereafter. Those who pick it up expecting a \\"preachy\\" book because of the title- one that will confirm their religious beliefs in a fire-and-brimstone sort of way- are in for a big disappointment. And those who doubt the afterlife or otherwise aren't particularly religious will find it a refreshing change from the strict dogma of most organized religions. Albom rejects the exclusive \\"country club\\" image of heaven for one that serves people whose lives weren't quite so perfect. Even the five people the main character meets in heaven aren't necessarily who he (or the reader) might expect- and yet they turn out to have been the most significant people in his life, since Albom's allegory is meant to show how lives can be profoundly altered and affected in ways we never quite realize. Another book with a similar theme is An Audience for Einstein, a novel about second chances, ethical choices, and ultimately doing what's right."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I finished this book in bed, on a blustery but sunny, Saturday morning in May. I had pulled back the bedroom curtains a little earlier so I could read by daylight and then snuggled down again to find out who were the fourth and fifth people Eddie was to meet in Heaven.When I closed the book, and brushed away my tears, I found myself watching the summer clouds being blown over the blue sky and contemplating Heaven...who would be me MY five people? Who would I wait for? I can't remember the last book I read that made me think for so long afterwards.A powerful, yet simple book and one I would recommend to anyone who contemplates life...or death and the way our threads of life are interwoven."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I don't have the words to describe how I felt while reading this book. I cried & laughed at the same time through most of it. A wonderfully written story/theory of what to expect in heaven, it also trys to answer the question \\"why were we put on this earth?\\".This is a very quick read!"},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"What Albom has done is to help us see that even the most seemingly meaningless life is precious, valuable and worthwhile. He illuminates a fundamental question that troubles us all by skillfully blending artful narrative with essential characters, whose lives and feelings and intentions mirror our own. When Eddie meets those whose lives he has touched, his insight becomes our own. We are not conceived in sin. We are not born in sin. We are not sinful, shameful and disgusting by definition. In fact, what we discover in these few pages is that we are luminous beings, eternal in nature and perfect in shape, form and purpose for our time on earth. It is small wonder that Mitch sells so many books - his work is essential to healing the woundedness that typifies the Flatland we all live in. Kudos to Mr. Albom. A lovely piece of work."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"This book was a very simple, fast read. The concept interesting and the author had a nice literary style. This book lacked depth and emotional pull. My book club unanimously agreed that this book was \\"okay\\" and was missing something to make it truly spectacular. Not a bad read, but I would not read it again."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"Why did it take me over a year to read this book? I got it as a Christmas present for the 2004 Christmas, and I never read it. Last night I finally found it, and finished it within 2 hours.What can I say that hasn't already been said about this book? Eddie is an old man who has been working at a boardwalk carnival all his life. One day he dies from an accident involving one of the rides. He then goes up to heaven and meets five people who helped shape his life when he was alive. The blue man, the army captain, Ruby (the woman Eddie never met), his wife and an Asian girl.Each one of these people tell Eddie how they shaped his life without him even knowing that they have. My personal favourite is the blue man, otherwise known as the carnival freak. His skin wasn't always blue, it turned blue in an accident, so the man was forced to be in a freak show because who wanted to hire a blue man in any job? Anyway, when Eddie was a child he accidently kills this man. When they're up in heaven and Eddie forgives the man, it then describes how the man's skin turns from blue into a gorgeous caramel colour, then the man disappeared into heaven. To me that was one of the most beautiful parts of the story.Anyway, this is a wonderful book, easy to read. I just can't believe I waited so long to read it.--Kat"},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"This book should be seen for what it is; a lovely, well written story for readers at all levels and of all ages. It is the type of book you will keep on your shelf for years and perhaps go back to it from time to time to read a chapter or two.

In a nutshell: the amazing story of the simple man's simple life. Yes, this book is simply written (but very interesingly constructed!) story of a human life. The author doesn't try to colorize anything, avoding unnecessary moralization or exaltation, but still he manages to deliver a very moving story at the same time. It's good to read it anytime you ask yourself why, what would've happened if?\\" and you feel confused about your own life, which doesn't always live up your expectations. In general The Five People...\\" is a story about the wheels of fortune and how a total stranger can influence your life, whereas one single second can determine your future. A bit saddening, however very enlightening and thought-provoking story."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I have never liked reading but when I purchased this book I couldn't put it down!!

Mitch Albom's writing is easy to read, and not too flowery. I almost didn't pick this up, because I don't enjoy reading philosophy or any kind of self-help books, and the title sounded like one of those books. It isn't. Albom has written a beautiful story about one man's realization that we affect more people than we can ever know. I gave my copy to my husband, and I will buy another for my father.

He is a well-known newspaper columnist for the Detroit Free Press and has received several honors and awards for his writing. Mitch Albom also is a radio personality and television commentator.Evaluation: The title of this book is actually what caught my eye. The title \\"The Five People You Meet In Heaven\\" seemed really interesting so I decided to pick it up. This book got me hooked right away. I don't know what it was about it, but once I started reading, I didn't want to put it down. My favorite part of the book was reading about the lessons Eddie learns in heaven. It really made me think about my own life. I also liked the way that not all the people Eddie met in heaven were his family and friends, but people he didn't necessarily know or people that may not have even lived in his lifetime, but he was effected by all these people and/or they were effected by him."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I was thought THE FIVE PEOPLE YOU MEET IN HEAVEN was very interesting.

In this beautiful story I have found a real starting point to examine these very questions.It is a book I want to read over and over again."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I found the book to be very well written and in some senses very poetic. I had to re-read it just to go through it again and hi-lite all the beautifully written sentences I find myself re-reading over and over.

But I was surprised at this new veiw of Heaven and by how quick of a read this was. I read it in less than 3 hours and I cannot believe how much I liked it.The reason I gave it four stars was because at times I got distracted, which means it wasn't keeping me entertained enough. But overall, very good and interesting."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I'd already read Tuesdays With Morrie and had expected another well told tale, but this book goes beyond telling the story.

At times it got too sentimental, but I enjoyed the Eddies journey through Heaven and the books process of accepting one's fate.The story is about a older man, who has spent most of his life maintaining the various rides at an amusment pier. This story has touches of Capra's 'It's A Wonderful Life', but with a slight twist.I don't view this book as a life changing event. It is a very enjoyable read that may make a person think a little.

Workers go up to save the people and they all get rescued but the cart falls, and it about to hit a little girl when all of the sudden Eddie pushes her out of the way and it lands on him.~~~I dont wanna tell you the ending and mess it up for you so im gonna stop at the but if you ever want to read a REALLY good book the i would reccomend this to you..~~~"},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I must say the five people you meet in heaven is one of my favorite books I have ever read. This book starts with a old man and his last hour on earth. He has lived and worked at a amusement park all his life and that is where he dies. This book is very inspirational and teaches you what the meaning of life is. I recommend this book to everyone, and it is really worth reading"},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I just finished reading this book and was \\"touched\\" by it like so many other readers have been since its release. Like many reviewers before me have said, \\"Five People You Meet in Heaven\\" is a short and quick read that has it's flaws but always keeps you turning the pages. It accomplishes the rare (in my opinion!) feat of establishing the characters and caring for them in only 200 pages when he could have easily filled it up with fluff or doubled the page count to do so. But, I have two theories on why I believe this book has had the affect on people that it has.First, the \\"spiritual\\" or \\"religious\\" overtones in this book were written in a way that could apply to any religion in a general way. Most, if not all, religions believe in a heaven of some sort. While they all have a specific view of what heaven is like, this book's depiction provides a common wish among us all of seeing our loved ones once again in the afterlife. A lot of us long for another chance to love, forgive and be forgiven by the people we meet throughout our lives, righting our wrongs and saying the words you've always wanted to say before it was too late. This book provides that hope that it will happen for us, when it's our time.Secondly, the people who question why this book is so popular or cannot understand why others have said this book has \\"changed their lives\\" is a simple one... They're reading this book to see how it has or will affect/change THEIR lives. Once again, this is my opinion, but a book like this one is not meant to change your life, per se. Its meaning is how it has affected SOMEONE ELSE'S life, or how they hope someone who has passed on will be affected. To prove this point, and I haven't read all of the reviews (1350 and counting!), I'll go out on a limb here and say that every 4 and 5 star rating from those reviewers who said this book had a positive affect on them write about an experience with someone else, while the 1 and 2 star raters complained how it had no affect on them! Think how this book might affect others, and you'll answer your own question of \\"Why is this book so popular?\\"I think my review is longer than this book! :)"},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"This was not at all what I expected, but found myself caught up in it. I will never meet another person with out looking at them in a different way. I loved it."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I really enjoyed this book. Light reading, but a very astounding perspective. Very good reading!"},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"\\"This is a story about a man named Eddie and it begins at the end, with Eddie dieing in the sun.\\" This is an important but unique quote from The Five People You Meet in Heaven by Mitch Albom. This quote starts Eddie's adventure through the five levels and lessons in heaven.Eddie works at Ruby Pier Amusement Park and is 83 years old. He is lonely and unsocial, but children seem drawn to him. At this time in Eddie's life he feels like his life did not mean anything. He dies trying to save a little girl and as he travels through heaven he discovers that he, like everyone else in the world that had a purpose. He also gains more respect for others as well as himself in this book.After reading this book, it became my new favorite. It has a very surprising and emotional ending. This book is wonderful for anyone who likes spiritual or fictional books."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"For anyone having doubts about reading this book, just read it. I just finished it and it is so good that I want to tell everyone about it. This is a book that you can't put down. It can be read in a day. Take a Sunday afternoon and just read it. I wonder what 5 people I may meet someday."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"The book is about the first steps in the world to come of Eddie a blue collar worker that works as maintenance manager of an amusement park and loses his life at old age trying to save a little girl from a falling cart that drops in free fall during the malfunction of an attractionToo simple for the complexity of the subject, themes are the meaning of life and the afterlife. It is good to mention that neither religion elements are introduced and no descriptions of the classical meanings of heaven and hell are made.As Eddie meets these five people, he learns \\"lessons\\" and finds out why certains events happened in his physical life, as the book progresses the life on earth of Eddie is shown, telling what happened during some of his birthdays from the time he was a little a kid until the time he gets old and die."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"This is a short book; I read it in one sitting. It had that kind of flow. It won't change your life, but it does give you a sense that everybody has a part to play in the big scheme of things."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I can't remember the last time I was so enthralled by a book. It wasn't tough to put this one down, because I didn't want too. This book illustrates that everybody has a purpose on Earth regardless of your social status. After reading this book it occurred to me that our circumstances in life should be celebrated, rather than looked down upon. I beg you to pass this one along to complete strangers, I know I will."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I've heard it all, from the simplistic and painfully clich&egrave; plot to the ranting and raving of the brilliance of Mitch Albom's first piece of fiction. Some call it a quick dollar while others call it original and creative, but without being swayed by anyone else's interpretation of this novel, I was thoroughly and utterly impressed by 'The Five People You Meet In Heaven.'I will admit, first off, that I am not a reader. Some may see that as a negative, being that I haven't scratched the surface of intellectual literature and can't defend the originality of Mitch's writing if I have nothing to compare it to. However, for a person that cannot sit still and is constantly playing sports or listening to music, I had no problem coasting through this novel. It may not have been the most appealing book to someone with an IQ of 150, but it's a read that reaches out to a very wide age range and calls the name of every person who believes in heaven and the afterlife. I know that there could be people's lives that I've touched over the years and not really known it, but Albom surfaces the question of \\"who?\\" and \\"how?\\" in the five people that you meet upon crossing the threshold to heaven. It makes me believe every time I go to sleep thinking I wasted my day that I still have a purpose and that tomorrow is another chance to right the wrongs. In it's brilliance and creativity... Yes... the novel does have its predictable moments:~ Eddie's resentful feelings toward his father's shortcomings ~~ Vital changes always taking place on Eddie's birthday ~~ The premature passing of Eddie's wife ~~ The emotional effects of war ~It's really nothing the common reader hasn't heard before, but haven't most of those stories been told in life, not death? Have they ever been intertwined and retold from multiple points of view so diligently and, yet, at the same time, effortlessly? I believe some reviewers are mistaking the concept of bad writing and easy flowing. 'The Five People You Meet In Heaven' isn't supposed to re-construct how we live our lives and inspire all nations to take a new perspective of our world and the worlds we'll never truly know about. It's just a very creative, very touching new impression. It could be a hit or miss depending on how open to possibilities you want to be.This book, despite being pure fiction, enriches my soul and makes me wonder about the mysteries of the world on a daily basis. If you died today, who would your five people be?Highly recommended.Grade: A-"},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"Mitch Albom is a great writer and this book I feel is better than \\"Tuesday's with Morrie\\". That might seem like a stretch, but with the small stories about how people are affected by everything in life, it puts things into perspective to think things through."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"This is a great book whether you beleive in heaven or not.

The movie is also great."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I liked this book, it was an easy read, i usually don't go for this type of book, but i would highly recommend this one."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"One of the absolute finest stories I have ever read and loved. Mitch is my favorite author."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"Nice quick beach book. No intricate story line.

Other books enjoyed as such:'Life of Pi' by Yann Martel and 'Hemorrhage in My Head' by NMR"},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"A beautiful story told by piecing together other stories viewed from many angles. The story is well planned, every chapter has a perfect transition to the next. It made me finished the book in 2 days, I couldn't put it down... And this is coming from somebody who doesn't like to read."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"Everyone should know that they are cherished and have made a mark in someone's life. And I know that at times, we all feel underappreciated. My friend recommended me this book saying that it helped her through some hard times. I didn't think twice, knowing that Albom had also written the exquisite 'Tuesdays with Morrie.'I bought 'The Five People You Meet in Heaven' with the expectation that when I was finished, I would be enlightened and feel more self-worth. I thought that I would be bawling through the novel, as my friend had. Call me void of emotion, but although the book was touching, it didn't really touch me or help me on my spiritual journey.I like, however, Albom's new idea of heaven. It was so interesting, and I couldn't wait to see who the next person in this man's heaven would be.The book is worth reading, and if it speaks to you, great, if it doesn't, then you just read a great piece of literature."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I almost didn't read this book simply because it is a bestseller but thankfully I overcame my prejudice and found it comforting me at a time of great need.Mitch Albom has written a sweet little adult fairy-tale that reads easily, leaves an impact and even graces you with a bit of fable type wisdom. The main character, Eddie, is an old carnival man living his life alone and feeling practically useless until the day he dies trying to save someone on a ride. We follow Eddie on a magical ride through the stages of death. As Eddie goes through the death process he also reviews his life and discovers that several people he encountered in his life changed his life significantly. Some of these people were merely strangers and some loved ones, but they are all sent to meet him in his after-life process. Each small story is powerful and imaginative.Little did I know how much of an impact this little book would have on me but I read it only a few short weeks before my own mother passed away. Enduring such an experience is difficult at best but I credit Mitch Albom and this little fable as a huge comfort during a time of great need. I imagine the five people my mother must be talking to right now and I smile. Imagine the lessons we will learn if even a smidgen of this book's message turns out to be true!"},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"The little book is pretty straight to the point. Each person teaches readers a lesson of life. An easy-to-read page-turner that's suitable for readers of all ages. If you're looking for something 'sophisticated', like another reviewer said, this is not your type of book. But it's a light-hearted summer reading book."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"This book offers a very thoughtful and interesting view on heaven. I am not one for tearjerker novels, which was why I was leery of it, thinking it would be sad. But Albom created a story about a man's experience about death and the afterlife that wasn't hokey or depressing. It was truly a unique book and a quick read. I definetly recommend it!"},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"A quick reading book that you won't be able to put down. I'm now an avid Mitch Albom fan."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"The main character in this book is Eddie, an 83-year-old man who still works at an amusement park called Ruby's Pier, doing maintenance on the rides. He is a lonely and bitter man, limping on a leg which was wounded during the war and mourning the loss of his beloved wife 36 years before. He dies soon after the book begins and begins his entry into heaven by meeting and talking to five people whose lives were entwined with his in ways he never dreamed. Eddy learns about love, life, and forgiveness and most importantly, he learns what the purpose of his life was. This is a lovely little book which will touch your heart."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"Someone recommended this book to me and spoke so highly of it that I was a bit skeptical as a critical reader. But the story is so well-told and thought-provoking that I could not put it down.I'd previously been recommended (at last a dozen times) &quot;Tuesday's With Morrie,&quot; but thought &quot;yada yada yada,&quot; but now, after reading &quot;The Five People You Meet in Heaven,&quot; I can't wait to read it, and am off to order it ..."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"A friend gave me this book and told me to &quot;read it &amp; pass it on&quot;. It's not the type of book I normally read &amp; I didn't think I'd like it but I did! This short book tells the story of Eddie, a maintenance worker who dies in a freak accident then meets 5 people in heaven who influenced his life. I couldn't wait to find out what happened when he meets his dead wife in heaven &amp; I kept skipping ahead in the book to see when that part was coming up. The book goes back &amp; forth with Eddie's stories of his life &amp; what's happening to him after he dies. I liked how the books chapters all started with different birthdays he had. In the back of the book there's a picture of Eddie. Rest In Peace buddy."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"This story typifies what I hope 'Heaven' is like. Discovery awaiting us is an exciting concept. Kudos to Albom for exploring the ordinary person and revealing the extraordinary human. This book renews the spirit!!!"},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I loved this book. I couldn't put it down once I started reading it. It gave me chills at the end. Whatever you do don't read the ending (I have a habit of doing that). Read it from front to back."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"The way this books is written makes the reader think of what hidden turns they were in their lives. The version of heaven described here just goes to point that we all create our own heavens. I would truely recommend this book to anyone. It is a unversal that any one can read and enjoy. You wouldn't want to put it down after opening the cover."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"i read this book in the bath tub and loved it. I recommend you do hte same."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"Eighty-three year-old Eddie finds his life as a soldier, son, husband, and amusement park maintenance worker has had much more value than he allowed himself to believe. We become emotionally involved with this character as we identify with the relationship he shared with the woman he loved, and the father he didn't understand. We watch as he discovers that he has been given a great gift with death, an understanding of his life. Simply written, and packed full of human emotion, this book leaves the reader with a new appreciation of their own life."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I would love it if life after death were like that. I believe that what we go through many incarnations and learn things each time. This could be one way of reviewing what you've learned. This book is not about reincarnation though, I don't want you to get confused. When Ed dies, he meets 5 people in heaven that touched his life in someway. Some he hasn't even met. But his life and their life were altered in some way. It's a great read if you are interested in life after death, or how life is interconnected. It is fiction but it does carry with it a lesson about interconnectedness. We are all connected in some way.Even if you are not interested in these things, if you like reading about other's lives, it's a great book for that too. This book is definitely highly recommended."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I love this book. It is simple yet very thought provoking. The whole time I was reading the book I kept thinking, Tim Burton needs to make this into a movie. The characters and cinematography would be awesome. Are you listening Tim??"},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"It is amazing how a book can give us new perspectives on life. I highly recommend this one so you can be enlightened too. This was a touching story that left me in tears at times. Don't miss it."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"This is by far one of the best books I have read this year. It makes you wonder who you will meet in heaven when you pass. It also makes you realize that everyone on earth is here for a purpose, and that every life does matter. Even though the book is fictional, I would highly recommend it to anyone who loves to read, and has questions about his/her purpose in this world."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I love -- LOVE -- this book. There are hundred of reviews, so I'll be brief: An old man dies saving a little girl. In the afterlife, five people -- some he knows, some complete strangers -- take turns explaining how events in his life have impacted the lives of others. Much to his surprise, the lives of others have had an equally profound impact on his own life. The reader learns that at the core of this cynical, resentful old man is a lonely individual who longs for the woman he loves, and the acceptance of an absent father. This book is rich in its character development and deeply profound in its underlying message, which is simply this: We are here to do what we are here to do. Grown men will cry. I sure did."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"This book draws the reader in from the beginning. You open the book to find that the story begins with &quot;The End&quot;. The author's cleaver writing, naturally, pulls the reader to find out how the story began.The main character, Eddie, feels as if he has lead an insignificant life with nothing extraordinary to offer to the world. Through the author's depiction of heaven, Eddie learns of his importance on earth.A deep, thought provoking book that I found to be a little depressing at times. Though I did find some of the content to be somewhat dark, overall I was left with a good feeling in the end. A quick read and good discussion book."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"Eddie a wounded war veteran who works at Ruby Piers as the maintenace representitive for the rides. The beginning of the story takes place on Eddie's 83rd birthday. You live through the last minutes of his life knowing down to the minute how much longer he has to live. Though Eddie has no idea wat is coming. The author even goes into such detail as to tell you wat Eddies last words are going to be. You read your way to Eddies death. But the story doesn't start there, its more of where it all begins. ITs now time to follow Eddie through his adventure in Mitch Alboms idea of heaven. Eddie will now meet five pivotal characters who help him on his journey of understanding by teaching him one lesson.

It is a comforting view on what heaven could be like!"},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I sat down and read the book the other night, expecting to enjoy it. I found it to be a lot more substantial than I ever expected, and I loved it. Mitch Albom has a very imaginative and provocative idea of what happens to us when we die. There are also some quitely profound thoughts woven into the story. As opposed to hitting us over the head with the five lessons Eddie learns as he completes his journey, Albom voices them in simple ways, through the five very different people Eddie encounters. There are no lightning and thunder claps when the messages are delivered; the understated tone actually gives the book more impact. The story was dark, sad, funny, biting, magical and warm. Albom cares not only for his characters, but for those of us reading the book. It has echoes of &quot;It's a Wonderful Life&quot; and &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot;, but &quot;The Five People You Meet in Heaven&quot; is a tale that holds its own."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"This book has made me think a lot about my relationships with other people. This book is an outstanding read and I would suggest it to anyone. I have just found a new author whose first two books have also caused me to pause and think about my personal relationships as well, Kirk Martin. His first book Shade of the Maple deals with romantic relationships and his second books deals with the relationship between a father and a son. I would highly recommend them as well."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"Great book!"},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"As the story goes back and forth from heaven to earth, you keep on wondering where its going, when it finally gets to the point (all 5 times) its almost like there is no point at all."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"Wow! This book is terrific. It is not \\"simple\\" when a writer can make you think it's simple, yet do so with such mastery that you never realized how deeply into your heart and mind his words would impact. Treat yourself to this book. It may just change your life forever."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"The Five People You Meet in HeavenBy Mitch AlbomReview by Aaron LeeWhat is heaven really like? I can't say, but author Mitch Albom lays forth his ideas in his book The Five People You Meet in Heaven. Albom says, \\"All endings are also beginnings.\\" His story begins at the end, on a sunny day at Ruby's Pier, with the death of the main character, Eddie.Eddie is a lovable old man who seems to enjoy children as well as his job at the amusement park. As the story continues, we learn about the past mistakes he's made and regrets he has had after 83 years on earth.Eddie's journey through heaven is slowed by five people from his past. On a rollercoaster ride of emotions Eddie progresses through heaven with the aid of people from his past. The Five People You Meet in Heaven is filled with interesting characters whose lives in one way or another intertwine with the main character.The main theme of the story shows that what we do in our lives on earth can have a more significant impact on others than we can possibly imagine. From each person Eddie learns how he affected his/her life, sometimes positively and sometimes negatively.One of the strongest attributes of the book is the organization. Each chapter is cleverly titled to give the reader a sense of what is to come. There is a chapter recounting Eddie's encounters with each of the five people from his past, as well as a chapter for the lesson he learned from each.This book does a fantastic job of helping the reader relate Eddie's life to his/her own. It causes readers to recall many moments in life that were once considered insignificant. Those moments may not be insignificant after all.This book is a must read."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"Mitch Albom integrates many of the lessons we learn through our life with a interesting story. \\"The Five People You Meat in Heaven\\" asks you yourself if you are fulfilling the life that you wish to live and accomplishing the goals that you have set in your life. It teaches you to live your life to your fullest and how you may affect other peoples lives.\\"The Five People You Meat in Heaven\\" may be an unrealistic interpretation of a man going through a harsh life; but people are still able to take things out of it. It is a book that you will look back to as you wonder where you stand in such a big world and how you affect the environment around you. Something as little as presenting yourself as a friendly person may do more than you may believe.In all, I enjoyed the book and would recommend it to anyone who would like to listen to one of the many interpretations of what happens after death that many people ask themselves."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I just loved this little book, its really a short story that has been turned into a Sunday night movie. Its very fitting for a two hour tv movie.It's starts off with Eddie as a young child and how he gets sucked into working at a local amusement park from then on there is tragedy, love and more tragedy. The story takes you through Eddie's existence as a mechanic at Ruby Pier, he finds love and loses love and then sadly loses his life. This is where the true heart of the story begins, Eddie learns more about his life from the five people he meets on his way into the afterlife. These five people have either occupied a large or small part in his life, but they have crossed paths somewhere along the way. They are there to show Eddie the true meaning and value of his life.Its a very endearing story and before you know it, you'll be weeping. Keep the tissues close."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I can't quite figure out why some people enjoyed this book so much. I very much agree with the reviewer who said it would be a perfect made for TV movie. It isn't very thought provoking, at least it shouldn't be for adults. I think this book would be a good choice for middle schoolers, and I don't say that sarcastically. I honestly think 12-15 year olds might really be able to take something away from this book. Personally I think the book is much too simplistic for adults. If what you are looking for is a light hearted story that you can read in a few hours and not so much a thought provoking one that leaves you thinking about it for days, then Five People might be a great choice for you. But I would never recommend the book to a friend. I had planned on reading Tuesdays with Moorie too, but after Five People, I am not going to waste my time."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"Mitch Albom provided readers with an intimate and heartfelt classic in TUESDAYS WITH MORRIE, which provided many rich insights into life and living...and death and dying. Now, Albom has done it again with this beautiful and moving story, which is an intriguing parable. I learned a long time ago in Sunday School that a parable is a short story that conveys a deep spiritual truth. Albom isn't preachy here, and he's not trying to convert anyone to any particular religious creed. What he does do is peek into a scenario of the afterlife for clues about how to live life here on earth in the time that we have, with the people that we meet. As in IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE or A CHRISTMAS CAROL, we see vignettes of one man's life through the lives of other people that he touched. Cynics may scoff, but most folks--even highly educated ones--will recognize the sublime and profound truths that this simple, unassuming book conveys. And again I must say, Albom conveys a lot of truth without being preachy, pushy, or heavy-handed. Some geniuses are faulted because it seems like they aren't sweating enough. This book goes by like a gentle, refreshing breeze. I don't know if Albom set out to write WAR AND PEACE here...it certainly doesn't feel contrived, artificial, or even labored. But at the end of the day, the lasting value of this little book will likely greatly exceed that of many \\"more sophisticated\\" bloviations."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I've known Mitch for a number of years as a sports columnist at the Detroit Free Press as well as through his afternoon radio show. Mitch has always been an interesting writer whether it was about sports or another subject. This book isn't really quite my style but Mitch is so good I figured I'd give it a try and I'm glad I did.The Five People You Meet in Heaven is an Inspiring story about life and death. It is a story about a man named Eddie who dies and wonders if he has accomplished anything in life. Eddie meets five different people in Heaven who teach him five different lessons about life. With these five lessons, Eddie learns what life is all about, and what his purpose on earth was.Mitch Albom's simply written tale provides the reader with the comfort of knowing that the afterlife may in fact be even more rewarding than we could ever imagine, as it may in fact serve as the conclusion to life's unanswered questions.This book was great! It was a great read, didn't take that long to convey the message, but was heartfelt and wonderful! I enjoyed it more than I thought I would"},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I read this book in just a few sittings. I wouldn't call it boring or entertaining. I was disappointed. As an avid reader of non-secular spirituality books, this one just didn't offer much at all. In fact, it was kinda creepy I thought. And, without ruining it, there were few revelations or surprises about most of the people met in heaven.It's a nice read, but The Way of the Peaceful Warrior, Travelling Mercies, Chasing Grace, Barn at the End of the World, etc etc etc are all much better with stronger messages and better \\"storytelling\\" than this."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"This book was well written, but not necessarily well told. It's not a story but a morality tale, and a christian morality tale at that. I read it for a book club and would not choose to read it otherwise. But if you like self-help parables, you may like this book. It's an interesting concept and is generally well-written; and I can't slight the author, who executes his concept nicely. But it's not really a new concept--that in a christian heaven you'll meet people from your past who will set the record straight for you and allow you to forgive your sins. This is age-old stuff. It's a short, quick read. Unfortunately, that's all it was for me."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"this books keeps you turning page after page just to see who's next.

This author is awesome!"},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"This is an incredible book that makes me want to know whose path I crossed in my life that I could have impacted. I have learned that no matter who I come in contact with to always be positive, to smile and say hello. I look at life differently, because no matter where I am, who I am with, or what my financial status is, I know I am right where I need to be, learning the lessons of life through struggles, friendships, relationships, jobs and family. I cried so hard at the end, that I had to read it all over again. Truly a book, full of lessons for young and old. It is never to late to learn, even on the path to heaven!"},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I have not read the book yet, but I have heard good things about it. I was excited to find this book at such a great price. The delivery was speedy. Thanks."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"This was on the reading list for our family book club. I recieved my Kindle for Christmas and was excited to be able to download my 1st bookclub assigned book of the year. It was a great book which I got through quickly because I didn't want to put it down. Loved the main character. I will definitely read other books by Mitch Albom !!"},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I just finished reading this book. What an incredible story this was! It was so touching and brought tears to my eyes. I highly recommend this book!"},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I am a fan of Mitch Albom and this book doesn't disappoint, it is a quick read but you will find yourself picking it up time and time again.A must read."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"Mitch Albom does a good job in choosing creative titles for his books. The five people you meet in heaven caught my attention right away. Once I started the book I could not put it down until the very last page. This book tells of a heaven where five people meet with you and discuss your life. These five people are not chosen at random. They are people that have been changed by you or vice versa. Each person leaves you with a life lesson. When you meet with these people you will be in the same condition as you met with the person. For example if you met with one of the persons as a child. Then you will feel and have the same energy like a child when you talk with this person in heaven.My favorite part of the book was anticipating who the next person he was going to meet next. While I guessed some right, there were a few twists that made the book a more enjoyable read. I recommend this book to anybody that loved reading Tuesdays with Morrie. It is a great book that will question the life you are currently living in. Mitch Albom does a great job writing the book and I plan to read his next book titled for one more day."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"Fun read, and a great story. It does make you think and I think if you can stand back and take the lessons at face value without trying to read too much into it... you will love the story as much as I did."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"Honestly, this book is so trite it's insulting. Get it from the library if you must, but don't buy it. And don't insult the ones you love by getting it for them either. I gave it a chance and read a good 50 pages before I couldn't stand it any longer and skimmed through the rest of it to confirm my impression that it was overly sentimental and patronizing. That's the best way to summarize what I felt: like I was a little kid who needed to be taught that there is more to life than money. It's simply an annoying read. If you are over the age of 12, you already know all these life lessons. Trust me.Personally, I think it insults those who have an average income and aren't going to have a million in the bank by pat patting them on the head. I don't remember exactly but the part when the lawyer (ie rich person) goes into his apt. and looks for his will - the lawyer thinks 'this poor fool who had no money unlike me who has a lot, I'm so better than he is'. The characters are too black and white. No one is that one dimensional.In response to the reviewer that claims that anyone who doesn't like it is a literary snob: what bothered me the most was that that it's patronizing and lacks depth on a basic level not that it isn't great prose. I don't look for the profound and deeply insightful all the time. I can enjoy a Nicholas Sparks book - which is also a bit sentimental - but The Five People You Meet in Heaven was simply annoying!"},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"People keep recommending this book, and for the life of me, I can't figure out why! If you've seen \\"It's a Wonderful Life\\" (and who hasn't), you pretty much get the drift here. Sappy, dopey, and for me, unenlightening. Completely forgettable. If I'm being generous, perhaps I would say the book is \\"cute\\", maybe suitable for people in the hospital recovering from surgery, for whom the left-over anesthesia in the body makes concentration on works that are though-provoking difficult."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"Not a good book. Guess that says it all. I hate when a book receives this much press, and turns out to be so bad. Was it well written at least? Not really. Was it funny or thought provoking? No. Was it a tear jerker? No. Do I feel my life is enriched because of reading this book? No. Was it at least mindless entertainment? Not even. Quick read? Yes, it was that.Meaning of life? No. Something to think about? No. I picked this book up as a free selection from a book club, and I'm glad I didn't pay for it. Want inspiration? Hope? Faith? A meaning to life? Perhaps the Christian Bible, or some other Holy scriptures will suit you better. I wouldn't recommend."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"Watching an old episode of Lost in Space would be more entertaining than this book.

It sounds good, but believe me it's a WASTE OF TIME.I read the whole book because I have the habit of ending every book (even if they're like these). It was a big punishment, an agony, It took me a week to complete it.I didn't connect with the story, the book promises a lot and at the end is only a very soft book, that PRETENDS to give you THE spiritual message that will change your life.An advice: If you really, really, really hate a person give this book as a gift."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"Reading this book was a big disappointment.Why does Mitch think everyone needs to hear about his bizarre ideas about a Godless heaven? All you really need to know about this book is that Amazon is selling it at a discount if you also purchase &quot;The DaVinci Code&quot;.The Detroit Free Press (the paper Mitch writes for). Killed a review of this book that they had paid for because it was negative.This was a big cheesy yawner..."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I can honestly say that I have never been more disappointed in a book.

I wish."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I got this book as a gift and I know it was meant to be a good one and I dug right in until I couldn't take it anymore. The only thing I can figure is that the people sending in the five star reviews are with the publisher of this horrid little book. It simply does not measure up to all the hype. If you buy it, just be aware you are being sold a poor bill of goods. There's no story here and the writing is, well, lousy."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I'll admit, I sloggged through the ridiculously sentimental and poorly written &quot;Tuesdays With Morrie&quot; just so I could see what the fuss was all about.

If this is what the &quot;average&quot; reader finds intellectually stimulating, God help us all.

This book will have you up all night just to finish it."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"After Tuesdays with Morrie, The Five People You Meet In Heaven was very disappointing. I get what he was attempting to impart, that everyone in our lives has some meaning. But I was puzzled, but most always finish a book and did. I then read the reviews and wonder how people raved about the book...not sure it is worth reading again to try and \\"get it.\\" I gave Tuesdays with Morrie to everyone for Christmas...not this book. Sorry, it was too off the wall. I like to enjoy the journey, this was just a puzzle I was hoping had a great finish. Hopefully, Albom's next book will be a more touching...this wasn't for me. No tears here. No movie here either. I've read Tuesdays 3 times and never without a tear."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"If it were a bowl of cereal, I would have needed a gallon of milk to get it down. I enjoy reading books but I have found this one in question.I could not understand how editors rated this book as they did. I have read more interesting plots that were well composed to determine this was not one fitting in the category. I have determined that it is not what and how you write that gets your book selling, it is your journalistic credentials and who you know.On a scale from 1-10. I would give this book a four. I am attempting to give the book another chance when I decide to not do chores and errands.I am still attempting to find what others see in the book and why it intrigued them so much. Any supplemental chat boards etc or additional references posted above would be considered."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I read this book today in one sitting, partly because it is engrossing to the right kind of person and partly because it is just very short.This book's prevailing characteristics will either be its great weaknesses or great strengths, totally dependent on the person who reads it. If you're the kind of person who is already drawn to somewhat maudlin stories about the afterlife, then you'll probably be happy with TFPYMIH. I myself am something of a sap and therefore the book drew my interest. If you're a little irked by the title and cover of the book, well, I advise you to steer clear. (The cliche goes that you can't judge a book by its cover, but then the writer and publisher decide what it will look like.)At many points in the course of this book, I looked at the way things were worded and thought to myself, &quot;I would have written it differently.&quot; Not that I am some impeccable writer, mind you, but Albom's style doesn't always work for me. However, Eddie is a vivid character and he made a lot of sense to me, so maybe Albom got something right.Overall I am glad I read this book but I am equally glad that I checked this out of the library and therefore paid nothing for it."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"This book is very short and should be read in 2 or 3 days. It manages to be very spiritual and thought provoking without being religious, which I appreciated very much."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I was wondering what all the hype was about - weeks on the best seller lists so I picked up a copy. Like &quot;The Da Vinci Code&quot; the book is no where near as good as the hype and ratings.A small, thin book not worth the retail price (but Amazon has a nice discount) and it is a quick read.Like or poor man's &quot;It's a Wonderful Life&quot;, nothing really that new or exiting.Pick it up at the library, or better still borrow from a friend - SOMEONE you know must have purchased a copy, they have sold millions of them."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I thought this book was very imaginative.

Good read for traveling or if you have an afternoon caught with nothing to do.Go ahead, read it!"},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"What a wonderful story! I could not put it down. I read this in one afternoon and was sad to see it end. This story will make you wonder the five people you will meet in heaven. I will pass this book on to everyone in my life. I cried mostly through the book, some happy tears some sad. The last chapter is definatly an eye opener!"},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I just loved this book! I couldn't put it down and highly recommend it to everyone and anyone. A MUST for anyone who enjoys a quick read with tons of meaning.Read this book!!"},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"This book struck me as a lame combination of A Christmas Carol and The Lovely Bones. At one point, Eddie asks, &quot;How much longer is this going to go on?&quot; And I felt exactly the same way. Albom asks us to swallow a lot of malarkey in this book. A Blue Man who changes color before Eddie's eyes? People flying around and disappearing in great whooshes of air and color? I did find the chapter about Eddie meeting his abusive father who can't hear or see him interesting, but it was too much like Jimmy Stewart in &quot;It's A Wonderful Life&quot;. Well, it's a stinky book."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"Mitch Albom begins \\"The Five People You Meet in Heaven\\" with an introduction that acknowledges that everyone has a concept of heaven, whether right or wrong, and he is not proposing that this fictional account is the way it is. This scheme has been used in a wide variety of books (including bestsellers like \\"The Lovely Bones\\") because everyone is curious what the afterlife is like. For Albom's Eddie, heaven is a chance to meet five people that had some influence over his life and whose lives he affected as well.In his opinion, Eddie has led a disappointing life; he has worked as a maintenance man at the Ruby Pier amusement park, filling the shoes of a father he has hated, never seeing the things he expected to see out of the world. Eddie is killed in a freak accident at the amusement park on his eighty-third birthday and must make his way through heaven, making sense of the life he lived on earth. The five people he meets in turn surprise and admonish Eddie with truths he never realized and lessons to teach him so that he can move on.While at times trite and cliched, \\"The Five People You Meet in Heaven\\" is a unique read. Mitch Albom has crafted a story that is engaging and heartfelt even if a little familiar in its themes. The story weaves back and forth between Eddie's journey through heaven and his memories of life on earth, including numerous birthdays. \\"The Five People You Meet in Heaven\\" is a story that comes full circle, starting at the end, and ending with a beginning."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"Amazingly well written. Fantastic reminder of what life should be for all of us here. Wonderfully uplifting."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"This Book was a rivetingly, great story for those of us who believe that when we die, our lives and the good we do, don't just stop there. thanks you so much for this moving tale."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"This is a wonderful story about a maintenance worker, in his early 80s, who works at Ruby Pier. Eddy spends his days fixing rides and wondering what his meaning in life is. When it is his birthday, a screw becomes loose on a ride. A little girl is having trouble getting out and he jumps to the rescue. While he is getting the little girl out of the ride, he drifts off into his death while holding her hands. He ends up in heaven with no emotions and a strange blue man walking toward him...I thought this book was excellent because the way Albom writes is very deep, imaginative, and descriptive. One example is whenever Eddie meets a new person in heaven, he describes how Eddie feels, what he is thinking, and what Eddie thinks of the person. \\" \`Don't be afraid ...' THE BLUE MAN said, rising slowly from his chair \`Don't be afraid ...' His voice was soothing, but Eddie could only stare.\\" Also when Albom talks about Eddie's past, it comes in at the right moment, such as when Eddie meets his old captain and Albom tells you the story of the war, and how he hurt his knee. Even though this is an adult book, I think middle schoolers and up can read and understand it too."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"This book was really cool because i actually liked it and the man (Edddie) is so inpirational and he loves what he does but all of a sudden his life is cut short by him trying to save someone from a falling rollar coaster. but when he dies hes goes to heaven and of coursemeets five people who have inpacted his life in some way or another but the first 4 people i really didnt know but when he meets his last person it makes you sad because that person really impacted his life. So i totally recomend this book to anyone even if you dont like reading it really gets you hooked because you wanna know who the 5 people are!"},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"This was recommended to me - but I was disappointed overall. I think there were so many avenues left unanswered. Too many questions remained about his parents and brother. I found the ending rushed.

He is greeted by five people one after another who have had the greatest impact on his life, whether he realized it while he was living or not, these people changed the path of his life forever.Outstandingly written, the five people you meet in heaven is a thoughtful and inspiring journey that takes you beyond the realms of your own imagination. Any fan of Mitch Albom's writing will not be disappointed, as no other tale could capture the beauty of life as this does and be as appealing to audiences of all ages."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"This novel alters the way we perceive life after death and shows that life isn't over when we think it is. We are shown by Eddie that in Heaven we realize why what happened in our lives happened in that way. We are taught that things always happen for a reason even if we don't pay attention to it when it happens. Even if a certain situation doesn't affect us we sometimes have an influence on them. For instance in the novel Eddie was a little boy riding a bicycle when a car almost hit him, Eddie didn't think much of it and rode off. From the driver's point of view he was so frightened that he almost hit the child that he died of a sudden heart attack."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"People who know me well are generally surprised when I tell them that I'm a fan of Mitch Album's books. I usually don't go for overly sentimental, touchy-feely, warm and fuzzy types of books, and you can definitely lump Albom's work into that category. However, every book I've ever read by this author is incredibly heartfelt, honest, and inspirational. \\"The Five People You Meet in Heaven\\" is no exception. This book tells the story of Eddie, an old man who is employed as a maintenance worker at a seaside amusement park. One day Eddie is killed by a faulty ride when trying to save a little girl's life. He winds up in heaven, where he visits with five different people who had a massive impact on his life. Some of the people knew Eddie very well, but some of them he doesn't even recognize, and he is stunned to discover the roles they played in shaping his life.This book stresses that every life, no matter how seemingly small or insignificant, is worth living and impacts the lives of many other people. It also reminds us how every little thing that we do can have major consequences for others. I really enjoyed this book, and if you're in the mood for an uplifting story, I suggest you check it out."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"The book describes what it is like to die and meet people inthe afterlife through the character of Eddie. The charactermeets with an untimely death by accident and awakens to findan associate of 75 years earlier. Another story depictsa mountainous and snowy field with elderly people eating piein a diner. Yet, another story shows his wife, Mary with handsextended in heaven to welcome him home.The book provides a preview into life after death. As such,it helps us accept both life and death dispassionately bypersonalizing the after death experience. The stories arerealistic and the audience develops an empathy for thecharacters portrayed."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I don't pretend to be an expert in book reviews, so my take on this book is short and to the point for those readers who simply want a great book to read.I have purchased this little book for more people than I can count. I keep a stash on-hand for anyone who I may feel needs a \\"breath of fresh air\\" or a little inspiration.Yes, it is about death. Strange that such a subject has inpired so many like myself through this story.It's a great beach read, easy ready or philisophical read. You will feel satisfied at the end that your time was not wasted. Buy it!"},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"This tiny book is huge in provoking thoughts about life after death. It provides the reader with another theory of the after-life, the author's. According to Albom, five people whose lives we have touched, meet us in their very own heaven, endowing us with answers and experiences. It is a moving, thought- provoking, and uplifting book.I would have enjoyed it more if the characters had been more finely developed. But in this little book, there wasn't enough time."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I love this book. This was the second time I read it and it was better than I remember."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I thought this book was a good read. In the beginning it talk about how he was going to die and I didn't stop reading until I found out how. It was also suspensful be cause it didn't tell whether or not he saved the girl, so I kept reading to find out if the first person told him. The second, the third, the fourth, and finally the fith old me. I also kept reading to see what the next persons life had to do with his. This book could be a very good and interesting read depending on what you like in books.

He ends up in heaven and he meets five people that will help him to better understand his life. I liked this book because it attempts to explain what heaven will be like when we get there. I also liked this book because there were multiple stories within the story. If you really thought about the book you could tell what parts of the story go together. This is helpful because you can better understand the story. I think this would be a good book for people who want to better understand what happens to us when we die. This book is fictional, but as I was reading I thought that it was an actual encounter with a man in heaven. Nobody really knows what our life after death will be like, but this gives you some kind of an idea of what it is about. Also people who have large imaginations would like this book because there are so many sub stories within the story. I wouldn't really make any changes to this book.

I loved how the author made the story interesting for me to read. When the story reflected Eddie's past about his family and going to the war, it reminded me of my family because we have gone through the same problems that he had faced. I thought that the flashbacks in the story was quite confusing because I didn't know where the story left off. The author made the story sound so real, just like I could actually be there watching the whole story happen. Kids like me, who have lost a loved one would love to read this book. It might not be true, but it's a exciting book to read if you imagine that it is."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"The book The Five People You Meet In Heaven is about accepting your life when you die and realizing what your life was meant for. I thought this book was enjoyable to read; it had many interesting ideas about heaven and what it is like. The book portrayed heaven to be what you want it to be, it takes the setting where you were happiest in your life and it makes that your own special heaven. I liked the fact that the book says when you die you receive a present; the present is finding out what your life was meant for and how it was impacted by others and how your life also impacted others. I didn't enjoy reading the part of the book where Eddie finds out he was shot by his captain because it was very depressing but the book would not be the same without that piece of the book. I think this book would appeal to people who are older and maybe out of high school. This book is more about the end, where as in high school I feel like we should be thinking about the beginning of our lives because we have so much life to live. This book was a fun read and I would not change anything about it.By Arlee Myers"},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I read this book as a class assignment not too long ago and I decided that I had to read all of it before everyone else was done. The writing style was easy to read and it made me want to read more. Throughout the book, the main character goes to heaven and meets the 5 people that made a difference in his life and the people's lives who were effected by him. I never would have guessed some of the people that he met. This book has a deep meaning to it and has some wonderful lessons intertwind with a great read. I reccomend this to anyone who wants a fast good book.

Eddie died while attempting to save a girl from a falling cart, as sad as it sounds it was his turn. He learned that there were five people that you meet in heaven and they all teach you a lesson. This book was very good, I liked the way the author found a way to connect each person he met in heaven to some part in his life. And the way each one of them had their own unique story to tell.How when each person died it was connected to him. Like the blue man from the freak show, he died because when Eddie was a boy he was playing ball with his friends in the road and the ball got away from them and Eddie ran to get it. It ran in front of a car, one that the blue man was driving and he swerved to avoid hitting Eddie but ran into an alley way and hit a wall and died on impact.How the author chose who Eddie met in heaven. The five people that he met in heaven were the blue man from the freak show, his General while he was in the war, his own father, his teenage sweetheart Marguerite, and the fifth and final person that Eddie met in heaven was a little girl Tala he saw run in to the burning barn while he was in the war.How each person had their own story. Like his General, he was trying to save Eddie because he ran into a burning barn because he thought he saw someone run in. His General had to shoot him in the leg to get him out of the barn and when he went through the woods to see if it was clear he stepped on a land mine.I enjoyed this book very much, it was interesting and unpredictable.

I couldn't really tell you the name of the actor but he play a role in \\"Enemy of the States\\".What is the meaning of YOUR life? Why is your love one leaving you so early in life?

In a way, I'm glad I did. I have not read a more depressing story since Old Yeller, and that was a substantial number of books ago. While I get the comparison's to It's A Wonderful Life and A Christmas Carol (and no, the book does not have anything to do with Christmas), this is a sad story about a sad man who lived a sad life. The fact that the people he meets in Heaven can help explain why, does not make it any less sad. I think I'll skip Time Keeper."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"Mitch Albom has been one of my favorite authors since reading his book, Have a Little Faith. So I jumped at the chance to read The Five People You Meet in Heaven. What a moving, heart-warming book!Eddie is a maintenance worker at Ruby Pier Amusement Park when he dies in a freak accident. One of his rides malfunctions, and the 83 year old dies trying to save a little girl from a falling car. Before his death, Eddie thinks that his life has been wasted. Everyone he loves has died before him and he never achieved what he wanted professionally. But once he dies, he is met in heaven by The Blue Man--originally from a side-show decades ago at Ruby Pier. The Blue Man will give Eddie the ground rules about heaven. Eddie will meet five people as he passes through heaven. Not all of them have met Eddie personally, but they will attempt to help Eddie make sense of his life. \\"Each of us was in your life for a reason. You may not have known the reason at the time, and that is what heaven is for. For understanding your life on earth.\\" Eddie's five people will take him through his childhood, his war years, his marriage, and his career at Ruby Pier. And in the process, Eddie will see that even though his life didn't play out like he wanted, that his life did matter and that he was loved and respected. He also learns that the path of his life was changed by many people--which only becomes evident to him after meeting his five people.Albom writes with beauty and meaning. When Eddie enlists in World War II, \\"Young men go to war. Sometimes because they have to, sometimes because they want to. Always, they feel they are supposed to. This comes from the sad, layered stories of life, which over the centuries have seen courage confused with picking up arms, and cowardice confused with laying them down.\\" As for Eddie's neglect and abuse by his father, \\"All parents damage their children. It cannot be helped. Youth, like pristine glass, absorbs the prints of its handlers. Some parents smudge, others crack. A few shatter childhoods completely into jagged little pieces, beyond repair.\\"The Five People You Meet in Heaven is a small book with a big message. It is comforting to know that although all our stories may be different, in some way, all our lives intersect."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"This book is so inspiring.Throughout the whole book i felt like i was eddie and i was meeting his five people.Albom really did a great job capturing his readers.I will recommended this book to everyone"},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"Wow, what a heartfelt story. I couldn't put it down. The way it depicts heaven, regardless of what religious background you have, is very VERY interesting and really makes you think about your own life.

Easy read, hard to put down!"},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"&quot;The Five People You Meet in Heaven&quot; by Mitch Albom deals with Eddie who met five people in heaven after he died trying to save a little girl in an accident that happened in the amusement park that Eddie worked. Eddie, a war veteran, was somewhat of a loner and who felt that he did not accomplish anything in his life and that his life was basically wasted. These five people were a combination of loved ones and strangers who impacted Eddie's life or Eddie impacted their lives. Each person taught Eddie a lesson and from these lessons, Eddie will developed a deeper understanding of his life and his actions.I truly enjoy this book as I find it utterly mesmerizing. Once I started reading the book, I was hooked. It is fascinating to see who is the next person that Eddie will meet and why this or that person is one of the five people. The good thing is you can never predict who are these people and that is why the book is truly amazing. Some reviewers were not satisfied with this book for various reasons; some felt that the story seemed unbelieveable and some felt that the way Mitch Albom explained heaven is problematic. It is crucial to realize that this is fiction and just like Albom's bestseller &quot;Tuesdays with Morrie&quot;, this is also a simple story. I highly recommend this book along with others such as &quot;Life of Pi,&quot; &quot;Bel Canto,&quot; and &quot;The Secret Life of Bees.&quot;"},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I thought this book was boring.

And if you haven't already done it it will prompt you to ponder the meaning of your own life from a new perspective. Unless you've avoided all introspection for your entire life, this book is not going to be life-changing - but it always helps to be reminded again to step back from the rush of our lives now and then to think about our significance in the greater scheme of things.So as long as you're not expecting too much from it, it's hard to imagine anyone not liking this book except for those people who (missing the entire point) get their knickers in a twist because this picture of heaven isn't consistent with their religious viewpoint. :)"},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"\\"The Five People You Meet in Heaven\\" is \\"good\\" until you get to Eddie's person number five. That's where the uncontrollable and audible \\"sighs\\" come to the surface and it rises to terrific. The book is made right there, with little Tala. She is actually the only one of the five people I feel really had anything to do with Eddie's purpose in life. The others it seems are illuminating Eddie's mistakes or possibly explaining why things happened the way they did. I found those a little empty. Tala gives Eddie's life meaning and purpose and eventually, the peace he needs to move on.I didn't find any life changing or affirming moments between the pages, but the author didn't promise any, did he? .I only gave it 4 stars because I felt Mitch Albom made a big oversight with Eddie's funeral. Considering the way he died, I felt it was a huge betrayal.\\"The Five People You Meet in Heaven\\" leaves you thinking about the events that shaped your own life and wondering if there is some meaning in them that escaped you. It is a light read, I was done in a few short hours but little Tala is still lingering with me, days later."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"This book first caught my eye while I was browsing Amazon online. Many people on the site talked about how this book was life-altering and that it showed the real meaning of what life is all about. Sadly, the book was very mediocre to me. The moral of the book (I won't ruin it for anyone) was very cliche - something we've all heard a million times. The book didn't have enough sustenance to keep me very entertained and the storyline got tedious after a while.If someone is truly looking for the real purpose of life, I would not recommend this book as an appropriate read. Save your money and get another book that will be more worthy of your money."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I hope there is more to look forward to in heaven than meeting five people who will try to explain the significance of my life. This is the experience of Eddie, the 83-year old widower who dies and goes to heaven in the Five People You Meet in Heaven. At the time of his death, Eddie is a \\"squat, white-haired old man, with a short neck, a barrel chest, thick forearms, and a faded army tattoo on his right shoulder.\\"Albom introduces us to Eddie and informs the reader that he is about to die. Eddie is in charge of maintenance at the Ruby Pier amusement park. He spends his days, as he has spent most of his adult life since coming home injured from World War II, making sure the rides run safely for the many visitors to the park. After a brief countdown of events in the beginning of the book, Eddie is killed by a broken ride after rescuing a little girl from certain death.We then learn about Eddie from three separate narratives. One is the story of Eddie in heaven meeting the five people God has chosen to help him understand his life. Interspersed throughout these scenes are flashbacks to several of Eddie's birthdays during his life that reveal his interactions with family and friends. Albom also takes us to events from Eddie's life that are associated with the five people he meets. Meanwhile, we see the events that follow Eddie's death at the amusement park.The first person Eddie meets in heaven describes the roles of the five people he will meet, \\"Each of us was in your life for a reason. You may not have known the reason at the time, and that is what heaven is for. For understanding your life on earth.\\"In helping the reader understand Eddie's life on earth, Albom presents a spiritual story but avoids religious or theological issues. This story centers on the afterlife and on relationships we develop during the course of our lives. The condensed message of the story is that each person's life matters, even when one is ignorant of his or her impact on others.Eddie views his life as having been wasted and of little significance to anyone. What he learns in heaven is the opposite. During his life, he suffered several tragedies that have caused him to overlook the contributions he was making to those around him. He looks at his war experience as having been particularly detrimental to the rest of his life. In heaven, his Captain from World War II and a little girl show him the truth about what happened in the jungle of the Philippines during the war.Albom succeeds in writing an entertaining, imaginative narrative that provides a positive, inspiring message. The message, however, lacks spiritual insight and is narrow. It fails to address many of the issues that a story about heaven causes to arise. For example, God plays only a distant role in Eddie's experience in heaven, and Albom does not address good and evil. His version of heaven is pure fantasy.The five people Eddie meets challenge him to accept his life and himself so that he might enjoy peace and contentment in heaven.I think most readers will find the Five People You Meet in Heaven entertaining and thought provoking but will gain little insight from it. The story should be read as what it is--an imaginative, enjoyable fable based on the author's fantasy rather than on any theology about heaven."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"Great literature invariably draws the reader in and invites him to think, to make comparisons between what he is reading and how it compares to ones own life and thoughts, to weigh in on whether there is agreement or disagreement. Story telling, on the other hand may be as simple as watching the latest brainless sitcom on television.So where does &quot;The Five People You Meet in Heaven&quot; by Mitch Albom fall out? After reading the book my opinion--and obviously opinion is as different as fingerprints--is that Albom's book firmly fits the former and not the latter.The book tells the story of a good man who lives a full life but doesn't know it. He feels shortchanged and, following his death, wonders what it all might of meant. The five people he meets help him to accept life as it was and to find some closure for the future. Some of the five are individuals he remembers some are mere phantoms that passed by without leaving much of an impression on him--or so he believes. Each teaches a lesson (and, yes, each lesson has applicability to every life) and clarifies how his interaction impacted life.I hesitate to say more because Albom's book is written in such a way as to make it an entirely different statement and experience for each reader. My memories, feelings and experience are markedly different from yours and Albom's story struck chords with me that simply won't be the same for you.Don't try to compare this one to &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot; (there is no opportunity here as Scrooge had to go back and make amends). Don't compare it to &quot;It's a wonderful Life&quot; (this really isn't a story about how a life made life wonderful for his peers). Some have compared it to Homer's Odyssey. This is a stretch because, again, our hero here is not trying to get back to his former life.Instead Albom, I believe, in &quot;The Five People You Meet in Heaven&quot; makes a simple statement: one life touches so many others, both known and unknown, in a variety of ways. Often we like to think that we are alone here and that an action today has no impact on anyone else. Instead Albom poses questions about how a boy's simple act of retrieving a ball from the street might result in an ultimate consequence for an unknown passer by.I did not find Albom's book to be preachy in any sense. Instead the author seems to simply state that a life lived has its wonders and consequences and when it's over it's over. Or is it? &quot;The Five People You Meet in Heaven&quot; does offer the interesting scenario of a newcomer becoming a player in the unfolding drama of Heaven's next arrival.Don't look for answers about what Heaven might actually be. I don't think Albom in his work was trying to offer anything new to the established canon of accepted Christian scripture. Rather enjoy a very interesting story about one man's view of what might be. And if you're not interested in a thoughtful, introspective ride, there's always Seinfeld reruns.Douglas McAllister"},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"This is an extraordinary little book that one could easily cover in an evening. It's about a man who lived a rough life, and he felt unimportant for practically his whole existence.The only brightness in his life was the love of his life; who he managed to make his wife. She is one of the FIVE persons he meets up with in Heaven when it is his time to go.The other FOUR persons are really circumstances that the man had encountered while living his life on Earth.They are really metaphors and I have to devote some time to thinking about the meaning behind them.He didn't really know them like friends while he was alive, but he impacted their lives in tremendous ways.Or their lives impacted his life with tremendous influence.The objective of the author, Mitch Albom, is to remind all of us that we are important to many others in this world and we should never, never underestimate this truth.If you are a mother or a father--- this book is influential.If you are a brother or a sister -- this book is important.If you are a child of somebody, this book will help you.If you leave your house for any job on this planet, remember your role and take it seriously.Your role that you play does affect many, many people.It is up to YOU to decide the caliber of your own life's work.The story is about a man named Eddie,but really it's a story that's all about us...the reader.BIRTHDAYS are also treated with respect and importance. I have always valued birthdays and I think they are extremely important in the ongoing validation of people that we know and love.Never foget a birthday -- at least give the person having a birthday some acknowledgment of their special day.After all --- the world changes every time there is a birthday (for better or worse.)It's brilliantly thought out,the words are simple, well chosen and paint a lovely picture.I think that the FIVE people I meet in Heaven will be mostly folks that I knew on Earth, but then again, I can be like Eddie and learn about things in the background of my life that I never considered.One thing this book encourages isTO DO YOUR ABSOLUTE BEST at whatever role you play in this world.Be a good parent. Be a good spouse. Be a loving child to your aging parents. Take care of everybody that needs your help or asks for a hand. Share the love that you have in your heart, because one never knows how long we have to live in this beautiful world.This book has influenced me greatly and I have alot more good to offer this world....it's changed my attitude tremendously.Perhaps this book will change you too, in ways that can only be described as postive and uplifing."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"This was the most wonderful book I have ever read. The story makes you think about your own life and who you would meet in heaven. I coudn't put the book down and didn't want the story to end. I laughed and cried. Mitch Albom is a talented writer and I hope he writes more fiction novels."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"With the media hype surrounding this book and its placement on bestseller lists I expected a powerful read. This is not what I got. The book is contrived at best and sappy at its worst. Although the premise itself is genius I found that the story did not live up to its potential. There were moments while reading that I expected the next page to be more engaging but this never happened. Poor Eddie spent his first moments in heaven full of angst and confusion trying to determine why certain people greeted him. The fifth person to greet Eddie was probably a tear jerking event for some readers, but I felt cheated. The ending was lame. I agree with several other reviewers that the best thing about this book was its quick readability. For those that have not read \\"Tuesdays with Morrie\\", do not let this book be a guide for you. Tuesdays is a great book!"},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"This is a lovely little book. Take it seriously or don't, but just enjoy the original and thought provoking story. Readable in a few hours, the author doesn't ask you to invest a lot in his tale of Eddie, the ride maintenance man at an amusement park called Ruby Pier, and the five people and ensuing five lessons he learns upon his accidental and heroic death.With \\"The Five People You Meet in Heaven,\\" Mitch Albom attempts to tackle the oft-mused subject of what happens to us after we die. I, for one, appreciate it when creative people-writers-spin their yarns and offer their own, unique versions of heaven. Who, after all, hasn't thought about \\"life\\" after death? There are probably as many versions as there are people who attempt to create them. And Albom's presentation is an exercise in simple language and has a very pleasant voice.Not at all morbid, or even overly emotional, this tale made me feel good about my life and my loved ones. My recommendation is to read it, enjoy it, and pass it on.Michele Cozzens, Author of A Line Between Friends and The Things I Wish I'd Said."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"This book was so predictable and cheesy. As a reviewer aptly mentioned above, it was SO written to be a movie of the week.If you are looking for a moving book or a book that makes you think about life, don't pick this one up, you'd be better off reading Chicken Soup for the Heart (kidding), but honestly, don't expect much. I think this book was probably written in a week."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"THE FIVE PEOPLE YOU MEET IN HEAVEN by Mitch AlbomSuch a small book but what a big message it sends to the reader. THE FIVE PEOPLE YOU MEET IN HEAVEN by Mitch Albom is the follow up novel to his very popular TUESDAYS WITH MORRIE. Both have similar themes - living and dying - but HEAVEN takes on a different approach.The book starts right off with the reader knowing that Eddie is about to die. He's a simple man, worked nearly his entire life for the beachside amusement park called Ruby's Pier, and spent his time maintaining all the rides at this park. He's in his 80's, lives alone and has lived alone for quite a long time. He talks about his dearly beloved Marguerite, but his co-workers have never met her. Basically, outside of the children that come to the pier and his coworkers, Eddie is alone in the world.Eddie's life flashes before our eyes, the years rolling by as we see him \\"celebrating\\" one birthday after another. These birthday scenes are significant, showing us what Eddie's life was all about, from the time he was five years old, till many years later in his old age. At the same time, we also watch his death, how his co-workers react to it, and the preparations that take place for the funeral.The third story line is what happens after Eddie dies. He is taken to what he thinks is heaven, and before he can \\"pass\\", he is to meet five people that he made some important difference in their lives. He doesn't even know some of these people. But as their stories unfold, Eddie finds out why they were chosen to be his five people, how he touched their lives, and yet he cannot see why his life was so important, to them or to anyone. Not until he meets that last person, the fifth person in heaven.For that is how Eddie lived his life. He feels that his life was unimportant; that it meant nothing whatsoever to anyone. He feels his life was a waste and that he probably wishes he had done things differently.Without giving much of the story away (for this is a very short book), the moral of THE FIVE PEOPLE YOU MEET IN HEAVEN is this, and Albom did an excellent job at getting to this point: NO person is unimportant on this earth. We are all here for a reason, for a purpose, even though it may be so small that it is hard to see. In Albom's heaven, every person who has died meets their five people, and through these five people, they learn the significance of their lives on earth. Even Eddie learns the meaning of his life, and it is far more significant than he could ever have imagined.It is needless for me to say that I am going to probably give THE FIVE PEOPLE YOU MEET IN HEAVEN the number one spot for books read in 2003. It has an important message for all of us, and was written in such a way that it should make a big impact on anyone that reads the book and understands the message. Mitch Albom once again has written a classic, and it will be enjoyed by many for years to come."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I cannot understand the good critics I have read about this book. I don't like to leave books unfinished, but when I had reached the second person that Eddie meets in heaven, I could not read one more word... I find this book terribly boring, easy and unrefined, bad literature, that doesn't know how to transmit feelings. Moreover it is supposed to be a lesson of morality, but it is such an empty morality. Does not inspire me at all. I definitely do not recommend this book to people who like real, good literature."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"The best thing I can say about this book is that it is slightly better than \\"Tuesdays With Morrie.\\" And this leads to an obvious question: If I disliked \\"Morrie\\" so much, why on earth would I bother reading another book by Albom? The answer is simple: a friend told me this book made sense and contained great truths. But it didn't.The book is disjointed, scattered, self-consciously arty. It is very little more than a series of platitudes and banalities; it reveals secrets that have been known for centuries. There's really no point in going into the plot or characters or atmosphere after that."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I read Mitch Albom's \\"tuesdays with Morrie\\" several years ago and loved it (it struck a cord). I had high hopes for his \\"the five people you meet in heaven.\\" Except for some minor glitches, I was not disappointed. What a great concept of heaven! I can only hope that I meet up with some of those who've changed my life--for good and bad--when I'm done with this world. The ending threw me; I had some ideas about who would be there based on the story Albom laid out, but how it actually turned out and why? I wasn't expecting that. What a nice twist. I recommend this book to those who question their value and impact on the people around them. With \\"the five people you meet in heaven,\\" Albom reminds us--he reminds me--of how we're all connected, whether we recognize it at the time or not. I look forward to adding more of Albom's work to my collection."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"The five people you meet in heaven is a outstanding book that talks about a guy who travels through heaven and along the way he meet five people that have effected his life in one way or another or they have done something to effect his life for the future.

It is a little hard to follow in the beginning because it was jumping from when he was dying to when he was little and then to when he was in Heaven meeting all of the five people. But the author Mitch Albom did a wonderful job of keeping the book in order and making it easy to understand even though they were jumping back and forth between different parts in his life. I think that everyone who has not read The Five People you Meet in Heaven needs to read it because it shows you even the people that you dont think will help you in life accutally do help you. You may not always see what someone does for you but when you get to Heaven you will see it all."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I liked the titled and it caught my attention. The theme of the book, like its title, is commendable. The author has put genuine efforts in sending a message, albeit differently, which earns him points. Considering that so many people have been able to relate to it (saw the reviews), the author has been largely successful.Unfortunately, the book is full of cliches - the view of heaven or what each person has to say (although the five people he chose were a surprise). This is the first book by Mitch I read, and even though he has tried to keep the writing simple and \\"for the masses\\", I am a little disappointed by his choice of words in many passages. Considering the applaud that this book has received, I am not very impressed. It could have been a much better book, if the author could have woven a much tighter story. The passages get dull at many places and the plot becomes hackneyed.Overall, a mediocre read. But the idea (that every person in this world has a meaning for his/her existence) is refreshing."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":". . . I just wish it weren't so superficial. \\"Five People\\" is well-written and you're hooked early on by wanting to know the outcome of the situation in which Eddie dies. And there's a neat twist to the war story. But I balked at the message--yes, we all have a chance to make a difference, but there are people who live hard and sad lives, like Eddie, and to make it all \\"OK\\" by this vision of heaven left me cold. Isn't it all more complicated than this? I think my Mom would like this book."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"Riveting and profound, this novel, Five People You Meet in Heaven, can make even the shallowest minds experience a sententious shift. Written by Mitch Albom, author of Tuesdays with Morrie, would lead one to expect yet another sentimental heart-wrencher that would leave the reader with tears in their eyes. But rather, this book leaves you with a new feeling, one which conveys a great review on one's own life between each turning page.We are brought to relation with out main character, Eddie, a bereaved war veteran who works the rides at a local amusement part. Eddie, once young, happy, and chipper, has slowly lost his spirit through his passing years. As time slips by, he loses his spirit, stamina, and youth, as we all do. He now works alone checking the running equipment on the rides at a fun park. He is 83 and has a barrel chest and a torso as squat as a soup can, nevertheless, children love him, and he discreetly loves them in return. He stays at the park all day, just doing his job, and in between, he listens to the aging world around him.We meet Eddie, fifty minutes before his unsuspecting death, as he is checking the gears on a ride. Tragedy strikes and our timeworn and unacknowledged hero sacrifices his own life in a desperate attempt to save a little girl on the ride. We face Eddie's tragic final moments, his funeral, and his friends as they move on with their lives, and yet, Eddie moves on with his as well. We are there as Eddie passes into heaven, where he meets five people that were a part of his life. Some he knew well, others were strangers, and yet each and every one of them was affected by Eddie one way or another. Piece by piece, Eddie's life begins to come together in a whole new understanding.Powerful and fast paced, you will understand both Eddie's life, and a little of your own with this simple, yet beautifully written novel. It's not packed with meticulous details, and yet it is to the point and never slows. I recommend it to anyone looking for a new thought on life in an un-preachy way. For teens and up, Eddie's story will be stuck in your head for years to come. And after those many years, you will indeed be compelled to read this book again.After reading this book, I have found both entertainment and meaning in our protagonist's journey through the afterlife. It has compelled me to wonder whose lives I may have changed, and if I will ever meet five people who will help me to understand life and put my heart at ease. This is a fabulous and well written novel that is a must-read for all of humankind."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"Amazing. This book is incredibly well-written and well-thought out. I finished it in a 4 hour sitting, as I just could not put it down. Being a 20 year old female, who has often questioned life since my mother died 12 years ago, this put a lot of things in perspective. It showed me the importance of living, that I DO matter and that I DO effect others on a day to day basis. I learned that forgiving is okae, people die for a reason, that the most simple task may have a huge outcome, etc. etc. I suggest anyone who has ever questioned their existance, to read this book. It'll give you a new insight on this thing we like to call life."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I really liked this book. When I first got this book, I just couldn't put it down. The story was about a guy named Eddie, a maintainer for the rides at Ruby Pier, that died on his birthday, by saving this little girl's life from a falling cart. Everything happened so fast so he didn't know if he saved the girl's life or not. When he went to heaven, he met five people that was very important in his own life. Some people are not who you would expect they would be, and all five tought a lesson to Eddie. Read this book because it is very good!!!"},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I had read &quot;Tuesdays with Morrie&quot; and was absolutely blown away by the power of Album's tale... Of course, when I realized he had written another &quot;inspiring&quot; book, I immediately put it on my &quot;To Read&quot; list... Once I did read it, however, I did not find that I got what I was expecting... This is not to say that I was disappointed, I was instead taken off guard by the angle at which &quot;Five People&quot; is told.Anyone who knows what &quot;Morrie&quot; was like know that it is told directly from Album's perspective. He interacted with Morrie regularly and he wrote his story for all of us to read... I thought that &quot;Five People&quot; would be similar to this because I knew that Eddie was his uncle.The fact that this book is entirely fiction, based loosely on things that Eddie had told Album while he was still living, changes the angle of the tale dramatically. Suddenly, the novel is no longer entirely philosophical, as was &quot;Morrie,&quot; but it is now Album's interpretation of what he believed Eddie would say.The story is inspiring at parts and the way the characters mesh together and interact is laudible. I also enjoyed the factual information that was woven throughout the tale. However, I can see where many people may be disappointed with the book.One reviewer stated well that this book is entirely subjective... Of you are the type of person who enjoys &quot;touchy-feely&quot; reads, then this book is the one for you. If you are looking for a deep and insightful guide of what Heaven may hold for you, then I'd say that you should pass."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"While on vacation, I devoured this book in a few short days. It would have been a quicker read, however, I had to stop for several hours due to my emotional sobbings and release.This wonderfully written book brought out many buried issues and memories that kindled great release and fond remembrances of years gone by. Good answers to issues and problems long buried.I'm buying six copies to give to my brothers and sisters in hopes that they too can remember, forgive and forget. Truly one of my best books ever. Hope you enjoy it as I did. Bud S."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I have heard so much of Tuesdays with Morrie and went to buy it, but it wasn't in stock. I bought Five People instead and was a little disappointed. It was well written though. I really like Albom's writing style, but by the end of the book I felt sad for Eddie. I felt like he learned his life lessons when his life was over. Maybe that is the point Albom was trying to make...Learn in life; not in death. I don't know."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"This story had its twists and turns. Some of it was fairly boring but the idea of meeting different people for different REASONS (the REASON, not the person, being the main idea) was thought provoking.I finished this in one day."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"The time when I became familiar with this book has, unfortunately, been a time of premature losses for me, and I give a great deal of credit to Mr. Albom's book for helping to sustain me through such dark times. Obviously we cannot know, while we remain on earth, what the ultimate destination will be like, but I would very much like to hope that it is indeed an answer, a state where we can come to fully understand the *why* of our lives. You do not have to adhere to any particular religion to read this book, but I do recommend that readers be spiritual in some way--otherwise, it may be much more difficult to be truly moved by The Five People You Meet in Heaven.One of the nicest touches Mr. Albom puts in this story is choosing a very &quot;ordinary&quot; man to be his main character. As he so wonderfully illustrates, many of the people who make a real difference in our lives are unsung heros. They are people we may not even recognize as we go about our lives, but their impact is tremendous. Eddie himself is, to countless many, one of these, and others have been to him. This book, as well as being an idea of Heaven, also becomes a tribute to the everyday, unsung hero. We would be nowhere without the Eddies of this world.There are too many enlightening and comforting passages to ever hope to name them all, but I'll highlight one of the best here. This is probably the one that's been the most helpful to me in dealing with recent losses: &quot;Lost love is still love...It takes a different form, that's all. You can't see their smile or bring them food our tousle their hair or move them around a dance floor. But when those senses weaken, another heightens. Memory. Memory becomes your partner. You nurture it. You hold it. You dance with it. Life has to end...Love doesn't.&quot;Be prepared for things to be revealed in a fractured, often out-of-sequence manner where things don't always make sense until the end. This is, in fact, how we remember our own lives: in pieces, not always able to see the subtle interconnections that give them meaning and purpose. Heaven, according to this tale, is the lifting of that veil, a place where the gaps are filled in and the total picture becomes clear. This is a Heaven I would very much like for my lost loved ones to experience, and one I'd also love to have waiting for me when my time comes.But The Five People You Meet in Heaven is not just a daydream about what will someday be--these are also wonderful lessons and comforts that we can apply to our lives, here, now. Take it from me...this is worth it."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"Beautiful, meaingful, incredible writing style, magnificent attention to detail (some of which had to be preceeded by exhaustive research), and so much more. Your ability to &quot;hook&quot; a reader at the very beginning of each chapter &amp; paragraph is marvelous. You made me not ever want to put the book down. I was properly teased so I had to read on; and I was never disappointed. Everything you write is only enhanced by your apparent laborous task of describing either the individual(s), and/or scene. As a non-fiction writer for adults and children, and more importantly, as private tutor to novice writers, yourbook is a marvelous teaching tool that young writers can learn from."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I didn't/wouldn't take this book literal enough to think it's painting a picture of what heaven is, or is supposed to be. The whole heaven spin is just a mechanism for making the point. That's why there's never any consideration about &quot;Eddie&quot; returning to life or fixing it. It's simply a matter of understanding it. It very simply made me think of how complicated life is. Next time you see that old veteran geezer marching in the parade or getting drunk in a corner....just think of what kind of story is behind each one."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I enjoyed Tuesdays with Morrie and was just as pleased with The Five People You Meet in Heaven.

Who has been pivotal in mine? Who would I meet if, indeed, there is such a thing as \\"heaven?\\" And how would heaven look to me? I must admit the book was a little overwrought, maybe a tad manipulative. But darn it, the tears flowed and flowed, nonetheless! And I'm not so sure that's anything to be embarrassed about. Eddie wasn't really such a sympathetic character, but he is certainly \\"everyman.\\" We've all known him. And every man and woman has a story to tell, even if (s)he can't quite find the words. It's a spare, quiet little book that will undoubtedly gain Albom more fans and reinforce those he gained with \\"Tuesdays.\\""},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"This is very enjoyable reading and is a wonderful book from any perspective. A very typical life, &quot;Eddie,&quot; had lived, but with more wonder than (on his part) most, finds out just about everything in the afterlife. I was very amused and didnt feel like I had to finish the book quickly. I don't think I found any new answers here to the why's of existence, but had definitely pondered the given reason much more than I ever had before. Has ways of truly making a person stop and contemplate. I strongly suggest reading about an Eddie in the book SB 1 or God by Maddox, some new and exciting afterlife thoughts."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"Interesting book - a very fast read, I read it in 3 hours. Pretty straight forward as it shows how easily we often dismiss people in our lives. The book lives up to the title - the guy dies, goes to heaven, and meets five people. I found the true meaning of the book was not necessarily the main character's struggles, but the fact that each of us is a force in more lives than we ever thought. Is this a re-telling of A Wonderful Life? Not quite, but it's worth the read and smile."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"The book The Five People You Meet In Heaven is a touching tale of a man and his journey to heaven.

Well-paced yet unforced, it asks, in very simple language, some of the most profound questions connected with being alive.

There were parts of this books that brought me openly to tears. I recommend this wonderful book highly! Also recommended: A CHRISTMAS CAROL by Charles Dickens, THE LOSERS' CLUB by Richard Perez"},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I read this book in a matter of hours. This book gives another possibility of the afterlife. It makes you examine the impact that even the most mundane activity,or most innocent mistake, could have, or have had on people you know and don't know.

It was such a creative idea that you meet five people in heaven that tell you about your life and why things happened as they did. Maybe my expectations were too high but I did not enjoy the book. The book jumped around a lot from past to present. Many of the scenarios presented in the past were uninformative and not necessary to the plot or character development. The focus was mostly on the main character, Eddie, and his actual life and not his afterlife. The sections on his afterlife were brief and very disappointing. I was expecting some profound words about life and life's lessons but the author's take on the meaning of Eddie's life was a disappointment. I finished reading the book only out of curiosity as to why others found the book interesting, and in hopes that it would get better. I would not recommend this book for it did not captivate me nor cause me to think."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"This quick read, about 2 hours, will delight the reader with a tale of life and after-death that fills the heart with joy and provides peace by reaffirming the soul when life seems an ill-spent monotony of wasted time, missed fortunes and what-ifs.

I finished it in a weekend.Nice to read something uplifting...edifying...reassuring. The theme of the book is that everything a person does on this earth in some way touches all people. If you personally subscribe to this theory, then the book is a must-have.The author has a low-key manner of character development. He unfolds a plot the way his young oriental child/character probably unfolded some object of origami: complexly, delicately, artistically.Most of all, though, I enjoyed this book because I am thoroughly romantic.

While Morrie's story is more about proving his life was valuable - to others, Eddie's story is about what the meaning of life is intrinsically and learning the mistakes, the causes, and the consequences of the decisions made in his life. For, the book begins with Eddie - a war veteran at 83 years old, head of maintenance at Ruby Point Amusement Park, and his attempt to save a girl from a falling cart. And how it took Eddie's life. Eddie wonders about the girl, and when he goes to heaven he is thinking that finding out whether or not he saved her is his answer to his meaning of life on earth. Was his &quot;ending&quot; successful, he wonders?Yet Eddie's supposed &quot;ending,&quot; he learns, is also a beginning. It is a beginning for him to explore with five people who have impacted his life or been impacted by it, directly or indirectly. While it the beginning for Eddie, through meeting each of the five people, he is also able to bring his heavenly visitors closure on their own lives' on earth.There is no hero in the story, but yet a regular man, living in the regular world...and yet Albom himself is a hero for providing such an interesting outlook on this possibility of the afterlife.I ask myself after reading this, &quot;When I go to heaven, who are the five people who will explain my life to me?&quot; -- and this is certainly thought provoking in that it can make one think about, knowing that there are going to be five people that in all of life's decisions, there will be several that can change one's own life - and those of others' - forever. People have called this earth shattering, yet I would say it shows how tightly knit the people on this earth are and how things can never truly be shattered."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"Mitch Albom's \\"The Five People You Meet In Heaven\\" takes no time to read, but stays with you forever.It is a view of life after it has ended.Eighty-three year old Eddie (head mechanic at an amusement part) is killed in a park accident---his final act, his attempt to save a young girl.He seeks validation for his life from the five people he meets by asking if he succeeded in rescuing her.Eddie learns that one's life is not substantiated by any one act, but by all one has done---and how each life affects so many others.We get Eddie's life story in flashback form. And, it turns out to be both full and meaningful.A book like this could become sickenly sweet and gag you----however Mitch Albom makes it passionate, touching, heartfelt and profound."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"While I read \\"The Five People You Meet in Heaven\\" I was struck by a rather pleasant resemblance to Jonathon \\"Livingstone Seagull\\" (showing my age here, aren't I) and \\"All I Ever Needed to Know I learned in Kindergarten.\\" Each of these books has the I-knew-this-already-but-this-author-sure-says-it-better-than-I-could factor.In this case, what I knew already and Albom says better is that all lives are interconnected - a twenty-first century variation on \\"no man is an island.\\"Albom starts with the death of a very ordinary person, 83-year-old Eddie who is the head maintenance man at a place called Ruby Point Amusement Park. From the first lines, we know that Eddie is going to die - soon. Albom tells us that. But, it's what happens next that is important, what happens to Eddie when he gets to heaven.There, he starts his journey to reconciliation and peace. To do that, he meets five people, who are in various stages of their own journeys. Each of the five had passed through Eddie's life, changing it, or being changed by it.It is a wonderfully told story, simple direct and very honest. Albom treads carefully between inspiration and sentimentality. He intersperses Eddie's experiences in heaven with vignettes from his life. Rather like the little pieces of a picture puzzle, all of these bits of information eventually come together in a portrait of Eddie, an ordinary man who never realized what effect he was having on those who crossed his path.This is a quick read, possibly in one sitting, but extremely enjoyable - a good gift item for those friends who like a bit of contemplative reading."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"Albom does it again.

It is different story ^_^ start with the end of life the man. it is sad"},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"Apparently a rift exists where Albom's 'Five People You Meet in Heaven' is concerned, as people appear to gravitate towards either the a) disliking the simplicity of the work or b) enjoying the beauty of the sentimentality behind the work. This of course leads to the plethora of either 1-star and 5-star reviews, respective to the camp you're siding on.Clearly, I'm siding on the side of the beauty of the sentimentality. There were a few times near the middle where I barred the flood-gates, and there were a few times at the end where I couldn't hold them back. While not all of Albom's aphorisms are good ones (I don't yearn my father's attention)there are enough beautifully vague quips to attempt a philosophy.I personally, am not a believer in most things associated to God / Spirituality / Religion, Heaven being amongst them. So, if I give 5-stars to an 'after school special' it's because of the beauty of the story.Eddie works at Ruby Pier, it's the last day of his life. He doesn't know he will be killed by a malfunctioned amusement park ride. He also doesn't know if he will be able to save the little girl in the rides plummet-path.SPOILERS:Eddies Five People:1. The Blue Man - He worked with Eddie's father at Ruby Pier, the Blue Man was part of the 'freakshow' attractions. One day he borrowed a car to 'practice his driving' and in so doing nearly hit Eddie as he chased a baseball across the street. The Blue Man suffers a heart-attack and dies alone in the streets after the miss.The Blue Man represents something of Saint Peter. Welcoming the guest, telling a brief fable about life and what is important 'This is the greatest gift God can give you: to understand what happened in your life.' (335).The Lesson: \\"... there are no random acts. That we are all connected. That you can no more separate one life from another than you can separate a breese from the wind.' (437).Interspersed with Birthdays (upon which usually something bad happens - his dad goes into hospital and dies a short time later one year; his wife Margaurite is in a car accident on her way to get Eddie from the track in another & this ruins their plans for adoption) to break the action between persons and to offer snippets of Eddies life back on earth, the story clips along alternating the earthly life past and Eddies transcendance through his 5 people.2. The Captain - Here we learn about Eddies time as a war vet in Vietnam. He was shot by one of his own men after being held captive by a break-away sect of Vietcong. Eddie was shot because he would leave the area without being forced; he thought he saw something in the fire his squad had set to burn down the village. The Captain, it's made known, is shortly after killed by a landmine while doing recon.Lesson: 'Sometimes when you sacrifice something precious, you're not really losing it. You're just passing it on to someone else.' (882)3. Ruby - She whom the amusement park is named after. She is the keeper of the souls of those who have lost their lives or been intimately involved with the park since it's emergence. She harbors Eddies father. He must go, make peace with his father for the years of neglect and abuse. Eddie pretty much blames his father for the wreck that has become his life. But he learns that his father died in very noble fashion, attempting to save a man's life. A man whom may not have deserved it at that given point in time.Lesson: 'Holding anger is a poison. It eats you from inside.' (1356).4. Marguerite - Eddies wife. The only woman he ever loved. Sadly she put up with a lot of his bad behaviors and emotional distance. But he loved her and he wasn't ever painted as a vile man, but a distant, distracted and torn man. Marguerite spends alot of time with Eddie, she is young when he sees her but she is 47 when she is taken from Eddie.Lesson: 'Lost love is still love, Eddie. It takes a different from, that's all.' (1669).5. Tala - Returning to the second person Eddie meets in Heaven, The Captain, Eddie is confronted by the shape he sees in the fire that got him shot by a friend. It's a young girl, badly burned, told to 'hide' in a most inopportune location. Eddie 'made me fire.' but Eddie's salvation lies in the work he did, keeping children safe. Tala brought Eddie to heaven to keep him safe.Lesson: \\"'Supposed to be there,\\" she said. 'Where? At Ruby Pier?'\\" She nodded (1831).We're all right where we're supposed to be."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"If you want to imagine that you ripple move through life, this is a great way to see ones impact.

I just completely enjoy all of Mitch Albom's books!I am not a writer nor a good critic so each reader must decide on their own"},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I read this book some time ago.

Each decision we make is like a pebble thrown into a still pond, the ripples spread out and affect everything around us.."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"Like many reviewers, I read this book in one sitting. While I found the story sweet and touching, I didn't learn anything &quot;new&quot; from the read.My faith teaches that we'll meet our ancestors in heaven. To me, that's a given. The author uses &quot;real life&quot; settings in heaven to tell his story. Frankly, I like the streets of gold theory, but what really gives me hope for an everlasting life is the prospect of being surrounded by those who have gone before.I've always assumed that life's greatest questions will be answered after death. If it only takes 5 people to do the job, that's cool.If you've never contemplated the world after this one, this book might be a good first introductory read. For me, it held nothing new."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"Mitch Albom uses the life, and death, of Eddie the elderly maintenance man at a amusement park to share some very valuable lessons of life. After an accident at the park, Eddie meets five people in heaven and the links between he and them surprises both the Eddie and the reader. What does come through in this book is that subtle links between different parts of our past are not always apparent until much later in life and perhaps death. Related to this is the question of when and why we must move on to greater rewards. As was brought home to me this holiday season with the totally unexpected passing of my bosses wife who was only 39 and so full of life.There is a great deal of wisdom within the pages of this little book. For example, when talking with his WWII Commander in heaven, the commander offers, \\"Sacrifice is a part of life. It's supposed to be. It's not something to regret. It's something to aspire to.\\" And the relationship between Eddie and his father where Albon suggests, \\"All parents damage their children. It cannot be helped. Youth, like pristine glass, absorbs the prints of its handlers. Some parents smudge, others crack, a few shatter childhood completely into jagged little pieces, beyond repair. This little book will surprise you with a story that keeps your attention and offers numerous pearls of wisdom. You won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"The title intrigued me; who isn't drawn to the possibilities of our afterlives? In The Five People You Meet in Heaven, we meet Eddie, a pathetic old man who is bitter about is life. He thinks he has accomplished nothing, and feels reminded of it every day. Then he dies on his 83rd birthday during an accident at work, and he is carried off to heaven to meet his five people. Each person has a lesson to teach him, and each one of them was completely predictable. The themes in the book are nothing new, and many a philosopher would walk away uninspired.I also found this a quick read, and was skimming over many of the paragraphs. However, I did like the ending as it summed up all life's lessons from the novel. It was a nice little reminder that we are important to others even if we forgot it from time to time."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"Quick and easy to read. Very touching and thought -provoking. Not based on theology or biblical doctrine but spiritually lifting."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"This is the first Albom novel that I have ever picked up -- I guess I was simply intrigued by the title. This book is, in simpliest terms, excellent. The colorful descriptions actually painted vivid pictures for me. The narrative was comfortable and easy, like reading a letter from a lost relative...filling me in on the years that we missed.This book so struck me that I read it cover to cover in a few hours, something I rarely am able to accomplish. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I enjoyed reading this book. It was thought provoking and one of those tear-jerker, feel good kind of books. It wasn't as strong as Tuesdays with Morrie, but it was still interesting. If you let it, it makes you think about your own life purpose...and how every action has a reaction...how each person affects others, without even meaning to do so."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"This book is very quick, easy to read, and has a nice, thought-provoking, not \\"too\\" predictable story. After you finish reading it you're left with something to think about. This being the first Mitch Albom book I've read, I will definitely read another. I reccommend this book for people who like to read almost any type of book - most people will find something to like/appreciate about this book.Oh and as for the comments from several other reviewers about this being too \\"preachy\\" - I didn't find that to be the case at all. If you're open to new ideas, you won't find this preachy at all; just another point of view."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"Thought provoking and powerful.

Bring readers face to face with the meaning of life from their unique perspective."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I for one am not a fan of a book about the after life, however this is truly one of the best books I have read in quite a long while. Though some people attack this book for being to simple I believe that because the book is so simple it can then be enjoyed by people of numerous reading levels (for lack of a better word) to different extents. This is truly a \\"new\\" type of classic for the reason that it can be enjoyed by all. I read it in one sitting amazed that over 3 hours had passed by in what I believed was a much smaller time interval. I have not yet read 'Tuesdays' so I did not have any previous expectations of this author. I will be picking up 'Tuesdays' tomorrow in the morning but no matter how good 'Tuesdays' is nevertheless \\"The Five People You Meet in Heaven\\" is an amazing book that I recommend for more or less anyone."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I thought this was an easy read with some important concepts about how we live our lives in general.

But I started getting into it and realized how much of an influence you can really make on someone's life. Eddie learns something about each character that helped him understand why some things in life are the way they are. I was impacted specially in the part of the book where it talks about he blue man's death. How Eddie as little boy unintentionally caused his death and finding out after he dies makes him realize how something that could've been prevented created a tragedy. Also Eddie concentrated on himself only, how bad his life was and his depression without thinking about other people's feelings, but after he died he learned how wrong he was. This book is great because it has a good concept of the afterlife. It makes you think about how important is to be considerate to other people and treat them nice. I really recommend this book; it is easy to read and teaches you about life lessons that we can all learn from."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I liked this book because although lacking significant depth it is light, original and intriguing read. The story itself is touching and it reminds me of a few similar books. [...]"},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"This is a great \\"feel good\\" book. Everything comes together at the end. Have a tissue handy, I cried a few times. This is my new favorite book!!"},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I picked up this book because I enjoyed \\"Tuesdays with Morrie.\\" Unfortunately, \\"5 People\\" was written very much in the same style, a style that works well for a memoir but badly for a novel. It was appropriate for Morrie to say, bluntly and without innuendo, \\"the lesson is this.\\" The same style is annoying and preachy when it appears in a novel, and violates the first rule of good writing: show, don't tell. Describe to the readers what happens, and let them draw their own conclusions, don't lay it all on the table and spoon-feed it to your audience. The depiction of heaven in this book was undeniably interesting, and the physical descriptions of the people and places were well done, but each of the 5 people waiting in heaven with their lesson to teach did their teaching in the most ungraceful way. Mr. Albom should stick to non-fiction."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I liked this book because it makes you think about your own life and the people you influenced and the people who influence you. I would recommend it."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"A tale of spirituality and love is a fitting description for Albom's follow up to his beloved first book, Tuesdays with Morry. We meet Eddie, a common everyday maintenance man who is barely noticed by those who brush past him on a daily basis, yet seems to have a special talent for entertaining children. As the book progresses, we are shown brief glimpses into Eddie's past in the form of his birthday celebrations that act to build the character who is slowly approaching his moment of death. The moment comes when he rescues a little girl from peril, and then he begins his own journey as he meets five people in the afterlife who were impacted in one way or another by his own existence. Each one has a story, and a lesson, for Eddie, as they themselves all encountered their own \`five people' at one time. What's revealed is that Eddie's seemingly meaningless life was quite influential to some and was downright precious to others.This book is a quick read that will take your spirit on a journey that, at the end, will leave you feeling refreshed and inspired. Albom's development of the main character is brilliant, and I almost felt as if the man was an acquaintance of mine for years. Albom illustrates in a profound way how our actions, however sublime and inconsequential they may seem, impact others in ways we never could imagine. This in itself is what makes this book a pleasure to read. The reader will find themselves asking common questions that Albom no doubt intended for us to ask: \\"Who will I meet in heaven?\\" and \\"Who did they meet before me?\\" The mere reflection that follows is more than enough to make the book worth the time."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"It may not be much on the page count, but it is one little book with a lot of meaning. No matter how mundane or meaningless your life may seem, it makes a difference and an impact on the rest of the world."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"This is a great read; very sentimental, and the deeper interconnected lives make for an interesting read. After closing the book (which I was so engrossed in I read in one sitting), it made me think about life."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I just loved this, loved the ending, and after finally closing it wanted to take the time and think about it for a while.This easy-reading, but rich with meaning story is about an old man that is killed on the job at the amusement park where he has worked for most of his life. The tale that the author then constructs gives meaning to his (the old man's) life, and indeed to all our lives. Just a wonderful read.A few side notes for you - This book seemed to be a \\"slow starter\\" and is written in simple language. Do not mistake that for simple ideas or what will be a boring book. By mid-book you will probably find this one to be a page turner. I read the last 50 pages in one sitting because I could not put it down. There are pleasant surprises even in the last paragraph.Importantly, I would remind the reader that this is a fictional novel. People that look here for a lesson in theological truth, or a peek into the hereafter, are looking into an empty box. Acceptance of the concept of \\"heaven\\" implies a belief in a diety creator. Indeed, Albom alludes to \\"God\\" a couple of times in the novel, but only very briefly and non-specifically. I would pose that the God alluded to here (apparently the Judeo-Christian God of the Hebrews), provided mankind with a revelation of heaven and the mechanism for reaching it . . . as recorded in the Bible. The Five People You Meet in Heaven is totally disconnected from the Biblical view. So it has no more theological truth than a Harry Potter book.I STILL maintain that this is a wonderful read. One could even wish that it were truth, not fiction. But don't confuse the two. And it does contain many true and important concepts.Enjoy the book, I know you will."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"An enjoyable and easy read. Mitch Albom's style is very easy to dive into and his usual deeper meanings are found. It is not his best work, but good nonetheless."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"This was a great book! It speaks to the person who feels like their life is boring, meaningless or unimportant. It shows how we all are intertwined somehow and how everything happens for a reason. I'd recommend it to all readers."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"This is a novel about 83 year old man named Eddie, the head of maintenance at Ruby Point Amusement Park. The story begins at the ends where the chapter started just hours before Eddie upcoming death. When death came unexpectedly, Eddie finds himself in an older version of the amusement park, except it was empty and he couldn't talk. There he meets his \\"First Person\\", The Blue Man, where he tells him the story of his own death and his connection to Eddie. Then, he meets his, Captain from the war he was in as his \\"Second Person\\", Ruby the person whose was the reason why the park was name for as his \\"Third\\", his dead wife as his \\"fourth\\" and then there's the little girl as his final one. At each encounter, the author recounts the events that happened in Eddie's birthdays, his ups and downs. The author managed to weave the point out that everyone are connected and affects everybody else.The book is an easy read. I found myself striding through the pages as I read through, drawn in the paragraphs. The plots are pretty simple but insightful. The characters are written in such as way that you feel like you are interacting with them. In the end the story did strikes me as a memorable read and I would recommends it to anybody."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I really enjoyed \\"The Five People You Meet in Heaven\\". The idea that our lives are inter-connected with the lives of others in ways we often are not aware resonates with me. A great book!"},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I'd heard of \\"The Five People You Meet in Heaven\\" several years ago. Not being a very spiritual person it was not exactly on the top of my must read list. As it so happens my 8th grader is reading this book in class and brought it home during spring break. This weekend I took a look at it, well, I couldn't put it down. It's not very long but it holds your interest. Towards the end I had tears streaming down my face and could bearly finish without a break. For those who feel at times that their life is unfulfilling or has no purpose, this book is for you. It was an eye opener and possibly life changing."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"After reading this book I changed my outlook on life, interactions with people and developed a perspective on life and death that was vastly different. We impact everyone we come into contact with regardless if we think so or not or whether we actually speak. It is one of the best books I have ever read. You get out of the book (and life) what you put into it."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"Let me begin this review by saying that when I purchased the book I had no expectations of it at all. It was simply meant to be something I read for around 15 minutes before I drift off to sleep. At first glance it had all the criteria to meet such a standard. It was short, uncomplicated, and on the best seller's list so I could count on a medium of entertainment.The first night I began reading it I couldn't stop until it was finished about 2 hours later. It absolutely ruined my sleep for the evening but I found myself captivated and enraptured by the tale.I am not what you would consider a religious person. I hold onto a minor belief in god but do not belong to an organized religion and probably never will. Neither did the main character. He did not have a religious experience that showed him \\"the way\\" to Christ, Budda, or the like. What he does come to understand is how his life, the lives of other who came before him and the lives of those he was with (whether they ever met or not) are intertwined. The five people that he meets grant him \\"solace\\" by showing him how his life had meaning. It's not always good news but along the way he is able to let go of the anger, worry, resentment that plagued him his whole life.Whether you believe in God, heaven or religion doesn't matter in this book. I think we are all connected under a common belief that our lives have meaning and that our choices affect others. What this book gives you is a story of a man we have crossed paths in our everyday lives. On the outside his life doesn't seem extraordinary and upon first meeting we are more struck by his flaws than his talents. It is because he is so starkingly human that almost any reader can connect, sympathize, and befriend him.Read this book and you will love it."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"My mom made me read this book as it is not something I would normally read. The book is about The Five People You Meet In Heaven. It was about a guy named Eddie who was an 84-year-old widower. He worked at an amusement park and made sure the rides were safe. There was a ride that was stuck, so one of the workers went to fix it. Something went wrong and there was a little girl standing on the tracks. Eddie pushed her off the tracks, but he was killed. He met five different people. People he killed, people who saved him from dieing, and other important people. They told him things that happened in their lives that was a part of Eddie's. They told him things so that Eddie could understand things that happened in his life. The book wasn't really about God, but more about things that happened in Eddie's life. I thought the book was OK, a little to mushy but I would recommend it to someone who likes to read."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"The Five People You Meet In Heaven is so engaging you will learn an abundance in life mottos to live by. I understood Eddie's life and why things happened the way they did. This book struck me and actually gave me hope in life's regard and I think it will leave you with a revised persepective on life as well. This is the type of book that everyone should read and will certainly enjoy! It's a fast read!"},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"The Five People You Meet in Heaven by Mitch Albom will touch the introspective side in your soul. Mitch Albom writes of Eddie, a maintenace man who feels that he has lived an ordinary life. When an accident takes his life one day, he is visited by five people whom he was connected. Whereas Eddie did not see their profound effect from his point of view, each of these souls certainly were shaped by Eddie.The story of the Blue Man really opened up how one action can cause a chain reaction of emotions. The tale of Eddie's father shows how toughness on the outside can hide the gentle kind soul on the inside. Also greater insight is given to the war is hell statement in two of the other lessons. And we can not forget about the feelings of true love and how it effects us when someone is here and later gone.One can certainly gain good perspective on life's lessons by reading The Five People You Meet In Heaven."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"The Five People You Meet In Heaven will not only engage you but it will teach you countless life lessons. As you read you'll come to understand Eddies life and why things happen the way they do.

For someone who takes forever to finish a book due to what I used to think were &quot;time constraints,&quot; I discovered that if there were really something meaningful enough to hold my attention, I would put everything else aside, and indeed I did. It must have taken me a couple of hours to read the whole thing (granted, it's not that long, but what an impact!). Eddie's story goes beyond a religious view of the afterlife.Although it asks, &quot;What if...?&quot; it implies a certain kind of concrete reality about the hereafter that we can all incorporate into our lives, regardless of our beliefs (or lack thereof). It extends that here-and-now aspect of our present lives into eternity, makes it tangible, and has the potential to help bring the mundane into long-term perspective. I have learned to look at the miniscule parts of my life and at the very least, speculate their impact on the universe as a whole. It makes you not only aware of your past, present, and future, but the lives you touch and those that touch yours each and every day.I loved Mitch Albom's simple, direct, narrative style. It is a metaphor for the way we can view life -- the simpler it appears, the more profound and far-reaching it actually is. This book is more than just an easy read -- it's ingenious!! Highly recommended and on my list of Top Five all-time favorites."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"The Five People You Meet in Heaven is a great book. Albom hits a homerun, it is touching, poignant, and thought provoking, the next logical step after Tuesdays with Morrie. Both Albom's uncle \\"the real Eddie\\" and Morrie would be proud of this work. Albom's writing skills are superb as Eddie flows from one scene to the next flawlessly making for a quick yet very enjoyable read.In the end the reader feels at once happy for, and sorry for Eddie, as he learns the meaning of his life and the part Ruby Pier played in that story. It is a gripping story, destine to become a favorite with book clubs and casual readers. I would highly recommend reading it to anyone searching for meaning in his or her life.This would be the perfect book for a cross-country plane trip."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"Upon recommendation at a Bookstore, I got this for a read and find it's about Sharing Life's Lessons. Three stories told about the same person 'Eddie' and in last, rying to save a girl, Eddie meets with an accident and dies. The author follows him to heaven where he meets five people of his life who had been waiting for him in heaven. Each one of them is a stranger yet they have in some way played a role in Eddie's life. The true meaning of life and the mystery of living is identified as they share the secrets, share the life's experiences. Mitch Albom has a great preaching sort of tale as each soul reveal the wisdom ways of living. Why am I here, What is the reason of living and all these puzzling questions meet the answers in Albom's meeting the five men in Heaven! People get lost in cultural obsessions and life drifts away with the mystery unfurled and the author has insightful thoughts on Living and Sharing the Life's lessons. Nice Book n a Nice Read."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"This was a simple book with a simple theme. It was a very quick read that most can probably finish in a day. It wasn't the best book I ever read, but I liked the ideas presented in the book nonetheless. It made me think that no matter what we think of our own lives, we really never do know how we have impacted other people's lives and to a certain extent how others have effected our lives. It's a nice thought that once we die, we meet people in heaven who finally teach us how we mattered during our lives. This book is definitely good if you are looking for a good short read that doesn't get too complicated yet presents an endearing story."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I must say this was a very different book. Dealing with death and life. I read this book with a very open mind and it has to read as such. It changed me and gave me a new view point on heaven and the afterlife. Eddie the main character death is the main subject of the story. His goes through five phases as I like to call it. They were life lessons, I felt should be done while living but it took Eddie to die to learn them. Like I said you need to be very open minded to read this. It was a very easy book to read.

Read it with an open mind and open heart and you too will be rewarded."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"This one has been reviewed so much that there is actually little I can add other than I did enjoy this one. The writing is simple, the story, simple, but good. I suspect those that set around \\"claiming\\" to read nothing but Joyce, et al, may turn their nose up at this one, but hey, that is their loss. I am a bit surprised that this work brings out such opposing emotions and opinions in people, but am rather gratified that so many seem to have read this work. All in all I recommend this one for anyone wanting a good, mellow read. I was surprised that more reviewers did not note that this work reenforces the widely held belief that what we are is built of the sholders of those who came before us and that there are so seemingly random acts. I suppose it is my total lack of sophistication, but I enjoyed this read very much."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I loved this book's simplicity, both in format and language. This unique approach to making sense of our lives made me reflect on the many times I've jumped to wrong and hasty conclusions about so many things in my life. The best part was the reminder that there's ALWAYS at least two sides, two perspectives to every story. I must admit to being generally biased against stories that jump back and forth in time, and found Albom's time frames - heaven, birthdays, past events, and real boardwalk time - sometimes confusing."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"Great read that means something to everyone, whoever we are and whatever we do. This book will make you think more about who have we became. It is a meaningful reading with nothing deceiving about the author strking resonances on human emotions. Best book I have read this year and time well spent!"},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"Once you start reading this book, you can't put it down until you are finished. It was phenomenally written, and gives alot of insight about a different perspective of heaven. It was a nice change from some of the more standard views of heaven. I give it five stars because of its depth and quality. Albom does an excellent job covering all his bases and providing readers with an interesting read that is appropriate for all ages and encourages confidence and commitment in people's lives.This book is definitely a must read."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"Albom's \\"The Five People You Meet in Heaven\\" is a quick read that can help one appreciate the subtlety and connectedness of an individual life to many unknown people. The underlying premise is that there is a higher purpose in every event of a person's life.The plot centers around the character of Eddie who struggles with feelings of disappointment because he has never made more of his life then replacing his abusive father as the head of ride maintenance at a small amusement park. Only after his death and encounter with five people in Heaven does he realize the impact of his life and finally \\"understand\\" it.An easy read that can tug at various emotions and help one keep life in perspective."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I absolutely LOVED this book! It took me two nights to read. The first night I didn't want to put it down and all the next day at work, I thought about reading it. The way it was written was so unique to me, and I really liked reading about Eddie and how he felt about himself and his life.THE FIVE PEOPLE YOU MEET IN HEAVEN really made me stop and think about how we are all connected in some way and how we don't even realize it. My favorite part of the book was the part telling the same story from two different points of view. It really made me think of how self centered people can be without even realizing it.In my opinion, this was a great book and I will definetly read it again."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I loved the book. It jumps around a little but once you get used to the pattern it makes more sense. I cried and laughed and the author was so descriptive, I could see the characters in my mind as I was reading."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I have to say if this book doesn't touch a soft spot in you, then your really not an open person. What this book will find in you is who you are linked too. To me, even though this book was piloted around a &quot;semi grumpy old man&quot;, what really was interesting was the way the author was able to connect my memories with the variety of &quot;memories&quot; that Eddie goes through as he retells his life though the 5 People he meets in heaven.I'm by all means not a wimp, but I am 6' - 220 - 12% lean. Run a fitness store and I don't cry..... Well, maybe it's just me but I connected emotionally with this exceptionally well written book.Thank you Mitch AlbomI went out and bought the movie today. $12.99 at Best Buys.I can't wait to watch the movie version.In Awesome Health,cducharme@katewwdb.com"},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"This is an interesting book that will challenge your theological thinking.

The readers, along with Ed, are introduced to a string of five fascinating people in heaven who have, either by direct or indirect means, touched Ed's life in a bold way. Their stories, pieced together like an immaculate puzzle, shed light on the most trying, most questionable times in Ed's life as he searches for the answers he needs to make peace wih his past and, most importantly, with himself. \\"The Five People You Meet in Heaven\\" is a triumphant story of overcoming past failures and regrets and understanding the meaning of life and your own significant role in it. I couldn't help but be absorbed in the story, wondering with each flip of the page, \\"What's going to happen next?\\" and \\"Who will he meet next?\\" A definite page turner, the end of this story brings closure, not only for Ed, but for the audience as well. A Must Read!!"},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"Having read \\"Tuesdays with Morrie\\" I was hoping for another profound and touching read. My high expectations led to disappointment as this book was lacking depth comparatively.A better way to describe \\"The Five People you Meet in Heaven\\" would be a phantasy novel with a clever use of chronology, and a fable that reminded me somewhat of \\"A Christmas Carol\\" by Charles Dickens where you meet the Ghosts of Christmas Past, Present and Future. Dickens however is able to convey more emotion and more profoundness."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"My daughter gave me \\"The Five People You Meet in Heaven\\" for Christmas, knowing how much I enjoyed \\"Tuesdays with Morrie.\\" I began reading the book today, during my 6 hour chemo treatment...& finished it when I returned home. There are times when we all wonder if our lives have touched people, and if we made a diiference at all... even those of us who appear not to have accomplished much. I am saddened that Eddie didn't realize these things while he was alive. Perhaps it teaches us to live life to our fullest and shouldn't leave our lives with unfunished business. I gave each of my children \\"Tuesday's with Morrie\\" to read. They enjoyed it and shared it with their freinds. I will give each of them a copy of \\"The Five People You Meet in Heaven.\\" I have no doubt it will affect their lives in a possitive way."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I bought this book expecting to find a tender and moving story as in Tuesdays with Morrie. It is not as much. Perhaps if you feel depressed, lonely and sense that life has no meaning for you, well, then this book might be for you. Otherwise, its just a nice, little, quick-read book. Don't expect too much from it and you'll enjoy it."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"Mitch Albom wrote a masterpiece when he wrote this book!Did you ever wonder what happens to you after you die? -Do we have a soul? -Is there a heaven? -Is there such a thing as reincarnation?... This book does not tell you what to believe, it does not claim to be a religious book or a true story - only a possibility of what the afterlife, if there is one, has in store for us.Eddie dies on his 83rd birthday. You learn about Eddie's life and how it intertwined with other lives thru his \\"trip\\" to Heaven. The story is told thru his \\"visits\\" with 5 people in Heaven. These 5 people were a part of Eddie's life at some point or another and had an impact on him. Just how much of an impact Eddie learns thru his visit with each of them.\\"The Five People You Meet In Heaven\\" is a truly thought provoking book, and easy to read. It is best described by the words inside the front cover... \\"...an enchanting, beautifully crafted novel that explores a mystery only Heaven can unfold.\\"I highly recommend this book to all.

I have passed my copy on to those closest to me and they all loved it."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I think Mr.Albom is an excellent writer! I thoroughly enjoyed Tuesdays with Morrie along with this book. I've even given this book as a gift and the recipient really enjoyed it. I highly recommend this book to anyone who enjoys reading inspiring and interesting stories whether they are religious or not."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"The editorial reviews made it out like this book had profound meaning and a lesson to be taught. That is a profound misconception. This book basically says that the only reason people survive is because death missed you and killed someone else. What kind of message is that. The ending was a little charming, but that was about it. Also it was way to short. I read the entire book cover to cover in only a few hours. I have to say I was expecting much more."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"This book was a very interesting look at one person's idea of heaven. Overall, the book is good for someone who has regrets in their life and sort of gives the reader a means of coping with those regrets. (Things happening for a reason and all that jazz.) For anyone who is strong in their faith, this is not a must read book. If you read it, read it as a good work of fiction and not the gospel, because of course no one knows what heaven has in store for us. The author seems to have a lot of animosity toward his parents (at least the comments he makes lead me to believe that he thinks parents are destined to hurt their children - and I don't mean just make them cry. It seems a bit cynical to me and maybe a product of his own possibly less than wholesome upbringing?) Lastly, this is a not a book for a young reader as there are several descriptions of war like situations that are rather graphic and somewhat disturbing. Might give them nightmares. A lot of people I know were awed by this story, but when I read it, I got something different out of it. This is a good story overall, but I am not going to let it control all my expectations of what the afterlife will be like. Really, and pay close attention as you are reading, it is a fascinating if rather conveniently laid out look at how we are all interconnected and how what we do affects those around us. Thanks for reading my opinion and happy reading!"},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"An incredible book about the meaning of life as seen through the eyes of a gentleman who was killed in an accident.The author uses profound metaphores. It is such a powerful book that I am still affected days after reading it. Best to read in two settings and then ponder the words that you have read. A very good gift to give anyone who is a thinking , loving person. Excellent! It packs a powerful punch of reflection, so be advised!"},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"The 5 people I'll meet in heaven:1. That guy I borrowed $20 from in 19832.

A great book gives you a new perspective on things, and this one surely does. It's got a simplistic depth and an honest message that is undeniably inspirational.What gets to me, though, is that some people choose to right off this book, deeming is simplistic and typical because you don't need to read it with an Oxford at your side or for whatever other reason. This kind of \\"you're only well-read if you've read these classic books\\" philosophy walks hand-in-hand with the same judgement made on this book by some reviewers. Simple does not equal uninspirational and not worthy of your time.Don't miss out on this read."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I thought this was a great book. Very meaningful and full of surprises. I have recommended it to more people than I remember."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I really liked this book.

When I picked it up in the store, I immediately knew I would like this book and it turned out to be one of those you \\"Can't lay down.\\" It is a page-turner for sure. It is much like Dickens \\"A Christmas Carol\\" in theme but much easier to read and not nearly as long. I think they should make a movie of this novel. It is full of profound sentences and thoughts like \\"children are pristine glass and parents leave their prints on that glass. Some are only smudges, some are slighly cracked and some are broken beyond repair.\\" It has so many nuggets like this one, I will have to re-read it several times to get the full benefit.

It is by far the best book that I've read. Reading this book inspired me to read more books by Mitch Albom. In The Five People You Meet In Heaven you really start to connect with Eddie and see where he is coming from. Eddie is a confused repairman at a local amusement park who believes that his existence doesnt have an impact on anyone and he doesn't quite understand the meaning of his life. While trying to save a little girl from a falling ride he dies. When he reaches heaven it is nothing like he envisioned it to be. He then meets the first person he meets in heaven and the person tells him a story that happened in Eddie's life and explains to Eddie why things happened the way that they did, and this happens for the next 4 people. I won't ruin the ending but i recommend that everyone read this book, it will touch them in some way."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"The book I read was The Five People You Meet In Heaven. It was about a guy named Eddie who was an 84-year-old widower. He worked at an amusement park and made sure the rides were safe. There was a ride that was stuck, so one of the workers went to fix it. Something went wrong and there was a little girl standing on the tracks. Eddie pushed her off the tracks, but he was killed. He met five different people. People he killed, people who saved him from dieing, and other important people. They told him things that happened in their lives that was a part of Eddie's. They told him things so that Eddie could understand things that happened in his life. The book wasn't really about God, but more about things that happened in Eddie's life. I thought the book was OK. I would recommend it to someone who likes to read."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I read the book over a few days after reading the hype about it.It was a pleasant read - but I found it very hollow.

Enjoy."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"Five People You Meet in Heaven reminds me that each persons life impacts other people's lives. In heaven, the main character Eddie meets people he knew on Earth and others he never knew.

There are undoubtedly a great many more than five persons like that."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"Read this as a book club selection. It was well written and thoughtful, and that's always a big first step for me. I can't honestly say it was a significant read, for me; no startlingly new insights, nor heights of inspiration, for me."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"Mitch Albom is an angel for writing The Five People You Meet in Heaven. \\"Eddie maintenance\\" is a lonely man who devotes himself to the only thing he has left, his job at Ruby Pier. The story begins counting down to Eddie's final seconds, and then begins his journey through heaven. Like anyone, he is confused once he enters this new atmosphere and he meets his five people that tell him stories about he affected their lives or was affected by theirs. Wondering through the five different heavens, he finds a new man inside himself as well as finding out why he lived the life he did on earth. The novel is life changing and will give each reader a new outlook on their own life as Albom shows how all lives are intertwined and one may change someone else's life in a matter of seconds without even knowing it. I love this novel because it is a good book for a rainy day or if life doesn't seem to be going the way you planned; it shows how even a smile can change someone's entire day. Eddie weaves in and out through other's lives and he is so upset with how he lived his life that he doesn't see how he affects the other people he met during his time on earth. Mitch Albom introduces the tragedies of lost love, lost family, and what Eddie's believes is a lost life and takes the lessons out of them to create a strong, heart-felt novel that will make it impossible to put down even after it is finished being read."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I don't pretend to be an expert in book reviews, so my take on this book is short and to the point for those readers who simply want a great book to read.I have purchased this little book for more people than I can count. I keep a stash on-hand for anyone who I may feel needs a \\"breath of fresh air\\" or a little inspiration.Yes, it is about death. Strange that such a subject has inpired so many like myself through this story.It's a great beach read, easy ready or philisophical read. You will feel satisfied at the end that your time was not wasted. Buy it!"},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I saw the film starring Jon Voight and was inspired to buy the book, assuming that the book would probably be better. I was surprised at how short the book was considering the length & intensity of the film. The book is basically short & sweet, and written more like a creative short story. I felt it didn't \\"pack-the-punch\\". For me, the message it bears is best expressed visually. I was happy to find out that the story is not quite as the title implies- such as the cliche meet Saint So & So at the\\"Pearly Gates\\". As a Buddhist, I found it more in line with eastern thought and how we are all connected. My advise... buy the film for content, buy the book as a momento."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"Another great book by Mitch Albom! Thought provoking! Which five people from my past will be waiting for me? We all need to do more sacrifice! Loved it!"},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"This book followed Albom's Tuesdays With Morrie, and is \\"only a guess, a wish,\\" of his view of heaven. READ CAREFULLY: Albom is not saying this story is what heaven will be like. It is only a story, a way to convey his view that all people are important and affect everyone they meet in some way.As far as the literary content goes, this book is fair. The writing isn't generic, but it won't wow you, either. The story moves along nicely, and Albom is careful not to reveal the characters himself, but rather allow them to tell their stories. I appreciated that aspect.If you are looking for any theological content about heaven in this book, please turn elsewhere. That was not Albom's intention, and there is a lot of New Age rhetoric in this book. But if you keep in mind that this is just a story, then it's a good way to pass time when you're not seeking too much intellectual stimulation. (That's a compliment, I promise)"},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"Why you SHOULD read this book:- Sense of harmony and balance with life and death- The acknowledgment that you have a God-given purpose- Simple and quick read- The flashback to the past references keeps you entertained and cleverly unfolds the present- Mental picture is easy to orchestrate- The epilogue!Why you SHOULD NOT read this book:- If you cannot let go of your own view of heaven- You can't read in pictures- Or you over-analyse**This is the first story-telling book I've read in about 10 years! This isn't a book about death, nor is it a book about heaven; this is a book about LIFE here...right this very moment! I couldn't have been happier with reading this.

The Five People You Meet In Heaven, weaves a story of how one man impacted the lives of so many people and yet, never realized it until he met and talked with them in heaven.The Five People You Meet In Heaven is author Mitch Albom's first novel. This is a story of Eddie, who at eighty-three feels his life has been a waste of time and energy. He dies while attempting to save the life of a child. In heaven he meets five people whose lives were impacted or changed because of having known him.In a sense, the end of Eddie's life is really the beginning of his journey of self-discovery.The Five People You Meet In Heaven started me thinking about my own life. Little do we know how our life touches and influences the lives of others. Honestly, how many times have you thought about how a simple \\"hello\\" to a stranger or a helping hand to a neighbor could positively impact the rest of their life? I believe we'll all be more conscious of our day-to-day encounters with the people we meet after we read this book. Believe it or not, everyone passes through our lives for a reason.This is the first time I've read a Mitch Albom book. Growing up in Michigan I thought of him strictly as a sports writer for the newspaper. The man has fiction writing talent! He was able to draw me into Eddie's life. Each story, flashback or snippet of Eddie's life has a self-development theme and lesson from which we can all learn.The overall theme: Your life has special meaning and that meaning can have a profound impact on others.Self-development lessons come in all shapes and sizes. The Five People You Meet In Heaven demonstrates the power one person has to affect many lives. All the people who have passed through your life go on to then affect the lives of hundreds and thousands of additional people. Each person you meet carries with them a sense of your purpose in life. The bottom line - you are important and your life has meaning.If you're feeling as if you've lost some of the meaning in life or your life doesn't have focus, this book is for you. If you're living a life without joy, passion or pleasure, this book is for you. If you're wondering if your life even matters, this book is for you.The Five People You Meet In Heaven is an easy read but it's not a simple book. It has a deep message if you are truly on the road to self-discovery. I have a question for you - Why wait until you're in heaven to discover that your life has purpose? Let's use the insight from this book to live our lives with meaning, purpose and joy."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"The Five People you Meet in Heaven by Mitch Albom, is deceptively simple on the surface. There is great depth in the underlying message of the novel.I believe after reading it, people will rethink their own lives and ponder the people and events that have impacted them almost unknowingly.There are more than five reasons to read this book, but I have given you a starter list (...)1. It will make you reflect on your own life.2. It will help you to reevaluate who and what is truly important3. It will make you realize how we are all inter- connected on this earth.4. It will make you cry.5. It will make you smile and it will change you in some meaningful way."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I bought this at the airport and read the whole thing that evening. It does keep you wanting to learn more, but I suppose I also was expecting more after all the hype this book has received. Don't expect any life-changing revelations! I'm glad I read it once, but I would not read it again. I preferred 'Tuesdays with Morrie', as it moved me to tears several times, this book did not. Albom shows that he is a talented story teller, but the story left me disappointed with its ending. If you are a frequent reader, I'd recommend it."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"This is the best book that I've read in a while. I was afraid it would be a very spiritual book because of the title, but it really focused on the story and not so much on religion. The author really developed the characters well, and I felt like the ending was a surprise, although other people that I discussed the book with were did not find it as surprising as I did. This is a good story for an afternoon read. It only took me about 2 hours to finish it."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"&quot;The Five People You Meet in Heaven&quot; is a great sequel to &quot;Tuesdays With Morrie&quot; Mitch Albom is very creative and did a wonderful job explaining his thoughts on what happens after you die. This book is the only one that has ever made me laugh and cry at the same time! There are many lessons that I have learned from this book, and shall always remember. One is to understand sacrafices and why they are made. Eddie's sacrafice was his leg instead of his life. I also learned that everything happens for a reason. Mitch Albom is an inspiring writer who has touched and changed lives to many readers around the world. Another Mitch albom book that I recommend you to read is &quot;Tuesdays with Morrie&quot; which is about death and the meaning of life.

I did not read any reviews prior to reading it, so I had no preconceived ideas about it. I liked that the people in heaven got to pick what their heaven was. Everyone got to be where they wanted to be and do what they wanted to do. It is a light read, with a reminder that all lives matter."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"This was a very good book. I borrowed it from a friend and read it in one sitting. It was easy reading, and that's why I never put it down. I kept wanting to know more about Eddie's life on earth and who he met in his afterlife. I enjoyed who Mitch Albom chose for the five people Eddie met. He is an excellent writer. It was inspirational and moving. Each character meant something; The Blue Man, the company commander, Eddie's father and wife, and the little girl who Eddie burned in battle. He mends all ties in heaven and is forgiven for his sins. He learns what his life meant. His soul can finally enter eternity with a clear conscious. A clean slate; Eddie's anger and anguish over his &quot;meaningless&quot; life is removed; he holds no more burdens and is finally free to be with the people that mean the most to him, like his wife. This is an excellent book; enjoy reading it as much as I did."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"A big fan of Tuesday's with Morrie, I looked forward to his next novel. Unfortunately, I left disappointed. This is another book of a common man who may not have realized his worth to the world. And while I agree with this tenet, I don't think his particular telling of the story was as touching as I had hoped. Please keep in mind, my expectations were extremely high from Tuesdays with Morrie.In fact, it seemed like the esteemed sportswriter had discovered his &quot;formula&quot; book to now turn out for the dollars he may not be making in the sports world. Sorry to be such a cynic. I did casually enjoy the book but not nearly as touched as my wife."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"Despite some claims about the book being &quot;preachy&quot;, the fact remains that it is a well written book with the right elements of a great tale. I could not get my eyes off the book and kept on reading as each chapter prompted the will to find out what is next. Albom should have made Eddie meet 10 people instead of 5 so the book would last longer!"},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I feel this book is a must read for people of all ages. I am 22, and after reading this book I found myself becoming more aware of the people around me, family, friends and strangers alike. This book has a great message that you can greatly affect the people you meet throughout your life without even knowing it. I feel this book is also a comfort for those who lost someone and are trying to go through the grieving process. This book shows that even when you die you are not alone, and no matter what life you led here on earth, you are forced to face the life you lived the good and the bad in order to rest in peace with the rest of your loved ones that followed before you. I found this book to be a quick and enjoyable read. I hope others receive the positive and comforting message that I received after reading this book."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"Mitch Albom's \\"the five people you meet in Heaven\\" is a heart warming tale of a regular man named Eddie. We follow him throughout his last day on earth and his journey through heaven. Along the way Eddie learns five valuable lessons about life. Mitch Albom does an excellent job of mixing entertainment with wholesome life lessons.Albom uses a tale based on his own late uncle to teach some very important lessons we should all know. He uses Eddie's journey through Heaven to convey them to the reader. While in Heaven, Eddie meets up with five people who each played a significant role in his life. From these individuals, Eddie learns that even though he was ordinary, he was also extraordinary in his own way.I felt an honest connection with Albom's character. I believe Eddie possessed qualities everyone can relate to in some form or fashion. The stories behind each character draws the reader in wanting to know what will happen next or who will he meet now. I feel that if everyone could incorporate all or a few of the life lessons in this story to themselves then we would all be better individuals.In conclusion, this book was an overall success. Sometimes it was confusing with the flash backs, but the overall prose was great. It used vivid scenery and physical description to bring the reader on a fantastic voyage of one man's journey through Heaven."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"Very interesting, creative, confusing little book. I enjoyed its uniqueness and found myself very engrossed in the plot. Very touching in parts with good character development and believable dialogue. I enjoyed the writing style as well which shifts back and forth in time perspective. The ending left me feeling a bit unsatisfied however. I still have a question or two. But I guess that's a good thing too. A good read that makes you think. Recommended."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"Mitch Albom once again presents us with a story which many of us can relate or associate ourselves. He does this easily because, like his college professor in 'Tuesdays with Morrie', this book draws on his relationship with someone personally close to him, an uncle. A reader who can see him/herself, or their own life story, between the lines of a book finds that book very comfortable.....and this is certainly one of them.I started this book on a Saturday morning, and with three kids, was finished Saturday night. An easy, enjoyable read.I'm already awaiting Albom's next release."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"Tuesdays with Morrie would be a hard book to follow. Mr. Albom has met the challenge. Remembering Morrie's words, &quot;Death ends a life, not a relationship.&quot; has brought a a poignant suggestion, via Mr. Albom, about the connection between heaven and earth. I loved the book, yet, had to pace myself in reading it. Much to think about, including who would my five people be? An emotional, thought-provoking, literate, and novel. Keep talkin', Mitch. I'll listen."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"Like so many, I long awaited the follow up to Tuesdays With Morrie. Mitch Albom has done it again. &quot;Five People....&quot; is a beautiful fable that is easy to read with its messages very easy to comprehend. Mitch's character development captures the reader in a way no other writer can. He is masterful at describing the clouds and color and the true meaning of both. Bottom Line -- Read The Book. I finished it in one afternoon. If you are looking for a book that gives one mans version of the after-life than this is your book. I've got to tell you -- Mitch Albom has become my favorite author!!!!!!! And for those of you who haven't read Tuesdays With Morrie by Mitch Albom -- SHAME ON YOU."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"This is one of the most beautiful, soulful books I've read in a long time. Well-paced yet unforced, it asks, in very simple language, some of the most profound questions connected with being alive. It follows Eddie, a self-sacrificing war veteran in his journey from this world to the next -- and in doing so, comes to re-examine his so-called 'meaningless' life. There were parts of this books that brought me openly to tears. I recommend this wonderful book highly! Also recommended: A CHRISTMAS CAROL by Charles Dickens, THE LOSERS' CLUB by Richard Perez"},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"Eddie was an old man, who pretty much all his life worked at Ruby Pier,Except when he was 22 he went into the army and when he came home he had other plans to do something with his life but it didn't work out. Ever since he was a little boy his life was pretty much Ruby Pier. So he saw everything that went on there. He saw the changing names of rides and putting in new rides and taking out rides. Eddie was a kind and generous man who loved children. One night a cart off of one of the rollercoasters snapped and fell and a little girl was standing under it so Eddie tried to save the little girl who was about to be crushed under the cart, while he tried to save her he was to slow to save himself. So Eddie went to heaven and me five people who have affected his life deeply and he didn't even know it. They teach him life is all about sacrifices that people make for other people to live and how it's just apart of life. But during the trip of meeting these people, he tries to find out if he saved the little girl. All Eddie can remember is feeling two little hands and then nothing."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"Tis book opens your heart and your mind. It is so inspiring! Its even better then Tuesdays with Morrie! It is written in such a uniqe loving compassionate manner you can't help but fall in love with Eddie. Also you evaluate yourself maybe just maybe you are something more then you realized. Its a fantastic read and a quick read! You won't be disappointed!"},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"You have to give Mitch credit, he has a simplistic writing style and tired worn out feel good messages that appeal to the masses. This book is flat-out shallow, and will be enjoyed by the same readers who think the Da Vinci Code is a good book. I laugh at people who say this is a classic. If you're one of those readers whose lips move when you read and you use your finger to keep your place on the page then &quot;5 People&quot; is for you!!! Otherwise, don't waste your time like I did."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I am not in agreement with the other reviews posted here. I think this book is a dud. Wish I hadn't wasted my money."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"This book does not have any substance. If you are looking for a light read, you might be satisfied. But if you want any truth, anything real, anything that makes you think, you should look elsewhere. My daughter had to read this book for school - what a waste!"},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"This book is not this reader's genre of book, but it was recommended to me and left within my reach. The first few pages and I admit I was hooked. It is almost a single sitting book. The style was very interesting and it being a short book, it moves right along towards the ending. Except the ending appears, the book is over, and you are left scratching your head saying what was the point of the story."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I am fond of imaginative stories and I must say I was intrigued by the coverslip summary of what to expect. The book is an easy and fast read but although it starts out interesting and suprising in terms of who the main character meets in Heaven - it leaves you utterly dissapointed. The characters are stereotyped as in bad TV series, and there are scences that are unconvincing to say the least. What really annoyed me when reading this book was, that one major part of what Eddie found in Heaven was about war - as if everyone should have participated in one so as to have something to find in Heaven that will give meaning to it - as there is no meaning to war. My advice, spend your time with something else - what about inventing a story yourself - I am sure you will come up with something better."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"Author Mitch Albom must have phoned this one in. So disappointing. The concept is excellent and I expected great reflection and life lessons. Instead I got sap, sap and more sap. Read Tuesdays with Morrie and hope for better in Albom's next book."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"Perhaps the worst book I've read all year. It would have come off better as a B rated movie of the week.It is obvious the success this simply written story has enjoyed has come from riding the coattails of other well written books that have appealed to our sense of spirituality.There is nothing apealing here."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"What a disappointment! I can't believe I fell for the hype on this juvenile offering by Mitch Albom. Nothing in this booklives up to advance praise."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"This is a hacked out piece of garbage, completely unoriginal, poorly written, monumentally boring and insulting to readers in a manipulative, almost devious way. It's also a major disappointment to someone who LOVED Tuesdays With Morrie. Mitch Albom can do so much better... right?If this manuscript was submitted to a writing teacher, it would get sent back, marked up with lots of red ink and comments in the margins that would go something like this: HUH??? WHAT??? PATHETIC WRITING! WHO ARE YOU TRYING TO FOOL WITH THIS TRIPE???If one of the people we all get to meet in heaven is a hack writer, don't be surprised if his name is Mitch Albom.I hope one of the people I'll get to meet in heaven will be a gullible book buyer who will pay full cover price for this sad little volume of cliches!"},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"Five People You Meet In Heaven is a tale of life and death; and about the five people the main character meets in Heaven.The writing is horrible. The format is strange. The writer often has the skill of a high school teenager writing a paper for his English class.I have to give credit to his vivid imagination, but in the end, you don't really care about what you just read. The title is a bit misleading. It's not five people you meet in Heaven, it should have been \\"Five People Eddie Meets In Heaven\\" since apparently, each person has their own unique five that they meet.Anyway, the tone and the skill of this book is on level with those nice inspirational emails your mom forwards you. Except, those are short, sweet, and to the point, while this book useless and self-indulgent."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I had read a small excerpt of this book somewhere and I made it my mission to find it and read it. I found it in a new Borders store and it was 40% off also.Maybe because I had hyped myself up so much to read this book that I found it to be a complete flop for me. It would almost seem that the author would be on to something and just as he is ready to dive in, he holds back and moves to another character.It was a cute book that did not have an inch of depth. I can really see how this could have been a real winner of a book if the characters were fleshed out with some details. It needed to have several sub plots to make it over the hump.It made a nice Christmas stocking stuffer. I would have been better off sitting through \\"Its a Wonderful Life\\" once again."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"This time of year is the perfect time to look over the past 12 months and ask ourselves, did I do something that really count? Did I grow spiritually, spending time in reading and stimulating conversations, continuing to answer the questions that really matter? Did I share what I knew with others, to encourage and promote love and understanding? If your answer is one where you wish to do more, jumpstart your personal advancement this year by reading this book!The author captures the reader very well, and my excitement compelled me to finish this book within a few days. I live in the San Diego area, and would invite you to also read the books of three local authors, all of which I have heard at various speaking engagements, and were extremely impressed with, and subsequently bought their books. If you haven't read their books this past year, I would recommend them for your New Year, to help create a new, more powerful and intuitive New You in 2004:- Deepak Chopra: The Spontaneous Fulfilment of Desire- Jack Canfield/ Mark Hansen: Chicken Soup for the Soul: Living Your Dreams (Not Local, but excellent, uplifting stories)- Tiffany Snow: Psychic Gifts in the Christian Life - Tools to Connect- Marie Jones: Looking for God in All the Wrong Places"},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I LOVED this book! When reading anything relating to Heaven, I always have the fear that my Heaven and the author's Heaven are very diffrent. My Heaven is being greated by loved ones and surrounded with happiness, joy and LOVE. Mitch Albom and I share many of the same beliefs of Heaven. This book made me cry in sadness and with great joy. I can't wait to share this wonderful book with the people I care about. This review is dedicated in loving memory of my Gabrielle and Potch."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I am not much of a reader because my life is so hectic most of the time but I was passing by the book section and this books title seemed to speak to my soul.I will never walk through my life again thinking that its all in vain and every face I see will be a reminder of the lessons I am learning and the realization the we really are all connected at the end of the day. What a beautiful story to say the least."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"Unfortunately, I couldn't get this book to download right on my tablet. I was pleased to find out I could return for a full refund within a few minutes after the purchase, which I did. However, after reading the sample, I had to finish it. So the next day I went to my local library....it was great! It really gets you thinking about your life and how it affects others. Would definetely recommend, especially for a summer read!"},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"This book is flat out awful. Don't waste your money. I had just finished Tuesdays With Morrie when I bought this. I would put this in the to 3 worst books tht I have ever read."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"It's not a hard read, but the book was pretty amazing. I loved it. Def recommend it to anyone that has an interest in the \\"after life\\". The way the book works itself out makes it way more interesting."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"the item was just what we were looking for. it is the first book on our kindle and we are excited to order more."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"FAVORITE BOOK EVER, gives you a lot to think about. Now on to Tuesdays with Morrie. The book is much better than the movie"},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I bought this book for my friend and have ordered many things through Amazon and have never had a problem. The book came quickly enough, but there was a grease smudge on the front bottom. when I carefully tried to gently rub it off, it rubbed off part of the cover and discolored it. I expected better quality. It wouldn't have been such a big deal if it was ordered for myself, but it was a gift."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I hated this book, as did everyone in my book club. Not uplifting at all or inspirational. The only reason I give it one star is that it is a very quick read. I was really hoping for more and was greatly disappointed."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I was so disappointed with this book! I expected something intriguing &amp; poignant...Something, that even if it was not well-written, it was at least going to be meaningful. Well, at page 70 I was still waiting &amp; by page 140 I just wanted to throw the book in the trash &amp; move on to something WORTH READING!Every &quot;Person in Heaven&quot; is so self-important &amp; yet, there is nothing to their messages. It even started to feel like I was being condescended to, because who doesn't already know that decisions one person makes directly &amp; indirectly affect many other people?? Only the dopey, boring main character, that's who!I'd be afraid to give this book to anyone I know for fear they'd feel I've insulted their intelligence.If you absolutley must see what this book is all about, get it from your local library - And if you just want to get the message it's claiming to contain, then watch &quot;It's a Wonderful Life&quot; for the 500th time. That would be far more satisfying."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I hope the five people I meet in heaven are more interesting than this book. What a bore and on top of that I agree the writing is bad. The book reads like a first draft, instead of a well thought out story with meaning. Tuesday's with Morrie was a great book, but this was a disappointment."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I am a veteran and I resent this book. It's supposed to be about this guy who's taken prisoner on some Phillipine island. I was in the south pacific, buddy, and the Japanese didn't do it that way. They took a lot of prisoners on the Phillipines when the war started but they all surrendered in mass. After that, no Japanese soldier sneaked in and put a rifle to your head and took you prisoner. They just shot you. They hated prisoners. So right there, I knew this books hadn't been researched very well. I was told it would make me feel better that my wife is in heaven. Well, my wife would tell those five people where to go and it wouldn't be in heaven, I can tell you. I'd just soon watch Touched by an Angel. At least, I know that show is just trying to get me to buy something. Let me save you the price of the book and tell you what it says. When you die, you go to heaven and people will tell you what a neat guy you were and it's all OK. Are you buying that? And it's supposed to make me feel better that this writer made up this story? Like he knows? He don't know. Nobody knows. Me, I hope to see some of my buddies there and have a beer while our wives roll their eyes at us old cranky guys."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"One of the best books I have ever read where I was not actually assigned to do so. It's a keeper."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I had first read Tuesdays with Morrie by Mitch Albom because it came highly recommended from friends and family. After finishing Tuesdays with Morrie, I had realized why this book had such great reviews. It was written beautifully and had lessons in it that I wanted to keep with me forever. Because of this book, I was excited to read The Five People You Meet in Heaven.The Five People You Meet in Heaven met my high expectations that I set from reading his first book. This book was creative, thoughtful and stuck with me afterwards like any good book should do. This book is about an amusement park maintenance man named Eddie. The book begins on his 83rd birthday while he is at work. He dies that day trying to save a young girl from a freak accident when something goes wrong with a ride. When Eddie dies, he arrives in heaven and meets a series of people who were connected to him in some way. Each person helps Eddie figure out some unanswered questions from his life and teach him a life lesson. His first person that he meets mentions, \\"Each of us was in your life for a reason. You may not have known the reason at the time, and that is what heaven is for. For understanding your life on earth.\\"I feel that we all have unanswered questions and uncertainties, but Mitch Albom gives the reader something to hold onto while thinking about heaven. Everyone also has different views of the afterlife. I am a Christian, but I like that Albom represents his belief of the afterlife in a creative and non \\"traditional\\" or \\"common\\" manner.My favorite part about this book was that it changed my outlook on life. It made me want to forgive more, love more, experience more, and live more. I think that any books that can make you want to life more fully, or change for the better, are great books. I would highly suggest that everyone reads this book."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"This was really an wonderful book. inspirational and intriguing to say the least. So the next time you hold an elevator door for someone or do a favor, know that it was meant."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"This was such a beautiful story that put a different twist on afterlife. I really enjoyed this book, and my only complaint was that I wish it was longer. Lots of things to ponder and consider in this book. It will definitely be a book I think back on in the future. I look toward to Timekeeper coming soon."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"This book is great! It's another way to look at Heaven and what happens. A good read. Good to read the book, then watch the movie."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"A very enjoyable book. A page-turner not knowing what was to come next. An easy to read book. My husband is reading it now. A \\"good-feeling\\" book."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I bought this book hoping to get a little inspired but it did the opposite. Though I am confident I am going to heaven, I hope it is nothing like Mitch describes."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"This book lacks the charm of Tuesdays with Morrie. The writing is flat and the story is rather old. The author has reworked material from Its a Wonderful Life, so the idea in the book is not original. Perhaps when the author meets his maker he can explain to the five people he will meet why he wrote this book, since the reason is not present in the text."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I'll admit, the book is very simplistic. It was recommended to me, and was a quick read, so I picked it up. I read it in a day. I gave it 3 stars to keep from giving it 2 (one star I granted because, being that it isn't my kind of book, it wouldn't be fair to criticize what I wasn't anticipating). I guess, to me, it seemed the ideal choice for &quot;Oprah's Book Club.&quot; Given that she had a field day with &quot;Tuedays With Maurie,&quot; I guess I couldn't get that out of my head when I was reading &quot;Five People.&quot; To me, it just screamed to be picked up as a screen play or a movie of the week. Which is fine--they're authors. That's how they make their dough, in some cases...but, to my mind, it just seemed very commercial. It's very uplifting, it's very feel-good, and it might make some people think. I'll admit, I didn't know quite where it was going--but, I can also say that a lot of it was predictable. Bottom line, if you're lying on a beach and don't want to think too much--this is perfect. If you're like me, and don't see the world through rose colored glasses 24/7, then, you might find it a little too fluffy to digest."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"This book is good for the simple minded reader. If you are looking for something that you must think about don't even buy into the hype of this book. The 5 People is riddled with cliches and predictability. I myself am into books that make me think and are unexpected. However this book did not even come close to my expectations. If you are simple minded you will love this book but if you are searching for something more like a book an author had to research and actually spend more than a week on avoid this read!!"},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I was given this book as a Christmas gift, and I read it in a couple of hours. Albom presents a &quot;heaven&quot; without a God and without joy. I found it trite and depressing. As far as I can figure, Albom thinks heaven is a way to create closure and explanation for one's life that is not possible in this life. That makes far too little of both heaven and life on earth. If you are at all introspective or a believer in any kind of loving god, this book won't get you any farther along the road."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"Well, this is not Tuesday's With Morrie. That book was really good and based on a real person. Here we have a fable that is poorly written and rather flat. I did not feel inspired at all. This is really a reworking of It's A Wonderful Life, so the idea behind the book is not original. What gets me is the publisher's attempt to market this book as a sequel. The book looks like Tuesday with Morrie in size, shape and color, which makes me think that one really should never judge a book by its cover!"},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I don't care what religion/ lackthereof you are this book is heart warming. I am an atheist but this is such a beautiful book. I never cried. But this is the only book that has managed to grab my attention long enough to finish it in the past few years. It makes me feel very happy and wishing this heaven did exist."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"What a disappointment. Eddy, an old maintenance worker at a theme park, dies in an accident at work and encounters 5 people in heaven who had a heretofore unknown impact on his life, or vice versa. The book starts out well. The events and timeline leading up to his death are actually suspenseful, and made me think this was going to be a great book. But the narratives with the 5 people he meets once he's in heaven are just painful to read. Long drawn out passages in which Albom must've been getting paid by the adjective -- \\"perfect caramel skin\\", \\"skin as tight as stretched rubber\\", \\"peach sky\\", \\"jade sky\\", \\"blue sky\\". OK, enough. Problem was, nothing really happened after Eddy died. Just a lot of long winded dialogs with people from his past, and an annoying ploy where every so often we're brought back to earth and in time to look in on one of Eddy's many birthdays he had. And the sappiness of it all was ridiculous. \\"Life has to end, but love doesn't\\". Grab the Maalox. I guess \\"Love means never having to say you're sorry\\" was already taken. The characterization is also too predictable. Much of the book dwells on Eddy's estranged relationship with his father. The stereotypical European immigrant who is too hard on his kid (Eddy), never has anything good to say about him, and Eddy taking over his father's job, leaving him with feelings of inadequacy. How original. There's also the curious aspect of Eddy's war injury following him into heaven, and taking on various forms of severity at different times...now it hurts like heck, now he doesn't even feel it. He can run like the wind, then he can hardly walk. Huh? Since when do people age in heaven? Goofy. The last two thirds of the book are dull, and resemble a screenplay for a bad chick flick or one of those Hallmark specials you used to see on TV. I kept waiting for something to happen, something that held my interest, but it was not to be. Just a lot of weird imagery that wandered all over the place disjointedly. Go rent \\"It's a Wonderful Life\\" instead."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I read this book at the recommendation of a friend. It was too sappy for me. I am not a fan of reflective literature and preferred high-action novels."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"Meh. Largely Schlock. If you like Lifetime movies, this one might be for you. Read \\"what dreams may come\\" for a better version that is less LMN."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"Anyone who'll find inspiration in this book needs some serious counseling, because they've got some serious issues to resolve. That being said, anyone who says that this book is well written is out of their mind.Mitch Albom is a terrible writer. I think that Morrie Schwarzenegger, author of the \\"Mitch Albom is a Terrible Writer\\" blog on Blogspot (do a search of that term and you'll prolly find the blog) is absolutely right. This sports-columnist-turned-Lifetime-channel-writing-moron should hang up his hat and retire. He hit his high-point when the Bad Boys were still bad and Mo-Town still had a reasonable chance at a renaissance.Unlike Morrie S., I do enjoy Mitch's columns and I even sort of liked his first book. But this dreadful piece? Sigh. Clich&eacute;s and insultingly obvious attempts at tear-jerking aside, let's look at the plot: Basically, you die. And at that point you realize you affected people. Until you've met all of them you're out of luck.That's the plot of this book, people. That's it. If you still want to read it after reading this review (and if you still respect Albom after reading Morrie's blog) maybe you should save your cash and put it away to hire a good psychiatrist instead. It's not that there's anything wrong with you. It's not even that fans of Albom's books are mentally ill. It's that if you can find any sort of happiness in his drivel, you could *definitely* benefit from Prozac. Trust me.This book gets a sympathy one, out of a tear-jerking five."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"If you like the art of Thomas Kinkade, you'll probably like this book."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"Let me start out by saying that this book touched me in a very personal way: my husband of thirty-three years, Rube, died last summer. And guess what? He had put in 15 years of service as a maintenance man at Chuck E. Cheese's. So you can see the similarities. Some think heaven's a big golf course in the sky, others a beautiful place where you can eat as much pie as you like and if you're lucky get to shake the Big Guy's hand, that is the Lord himself. But for my money Albom's heaven was one of the best, with a real good balance of spirituality to amenities. It made me glad that I am a Christian for all of the rewards I can look forward to in the afterlife. My only problem with the book was that one of the five was Eddie's mistress -- I have a real problem with infidelity and know I would be very upset if Rube were up there having it off with someone he stepped out on me with.But still, Bravo to you Mr. Albom for your beautiful book. I hope next maybe you will write something about dogs - my cocker spaniel, cheddar, is getting a bit long in the tooth and I'm not sure how I'll handle it when he goes. It be nice if now that Mr. Albom's helped us to deal with the loss of a loved one, he could help us with our pets."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"The only reason I kept reading this book was to see if it could possibly get any worse. The answer: it could and it did. It was poorly written, sappy, and dripping with nostalgia and cheesy, Hallmark-card sentimentality.Now I know why this book is sold in airports and supermarket checkout aisles."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"This book was given to me as a gift as I am a true fan of spiritually uplifting literature. The plot line was completely predictable and lost my interest immediately....but I finished it anyway. I regret wasting the time. Read The Celestine Prophecy instead. It is an oldie but a goodie that makes you think and leaves you with a new outlook on life, which is what this book poorly attempts to do....and fails."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"While it was a relatively interesting read, it was nothing I would've purchased on my own.It had a very disappointing ending, possibly because I was expecting heaven to be about truth, and the main character is lied to by one of the people he meets there. I won't say more on the subject for those who want to read it for themselves, but my copy is going up for sale. Definitely not a keeper."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"Are you kidding me, are you seriously kidding me? Don't read it, it's a JOKE! This book reminded me of a childrens book."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"Really a much lighter read than I wanted."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I was fortunate enough to hear Mitch Albom at a reading in Iowa City not too long ago. I was curious to hear this award-winning sportswriter who, more than coincidentally, also wrote one of my favorite books, &quot;Tuesdays with Morrie.&quot; All I can say is it was a great evening. Mitch regaled the 300 or so people with his experience of sleeping in O'Hare airport while coming to Iowa. He is a gifted, natural story-teller.Suffice it to say Mitch has done it again. He has written another heart-reaching book that should be on everyone's must read list. &quot;The Five People You Meet in Heaven&quot; speaks to all of us with humor and truth. It tells the story of Eddie, a man who doesn't feel he's had a good life. I'm sure you'll recognize the &quot;Eddie&quot; in you while the story unfolds through the five people he meets who help him see his life as extraordinary.My wife was sick in bed with the flu when we read it together aloud. We both agreed it was the best sick day either of us had spent. I have since bought 5 copies and sent them to family and friends. It is that good!"},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"The latest offering by Mitch Albom, The Five People You Meet in Heaven, is dissapointing, at best. I happen to enjoy listening to and reading Albom when he is in his best element, and that is sports. He is a fish out of water, to use a tired, old cliche, when it comes to this non-sports related fictional attempt.The story is trite and highly predictable. I won't spoil the ending for anyone who has not yet read the book, but several of the five people the main character meets in Heaven, are predictable, as well as his reaction to them.The book left me empty. My advise: For Albom, please stick to sports, and for the potential reader of the book, skip this one. Better luck next time Albom."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I received this book for Christmas and after all the gifts were opened and the kids busy I settled in and got reading. Well I couldn't put it down until I finished it!I passed it on to my mother and my husband immediately. I couldn't wait for someone else to read it and discuss the issues it arose. It had given me much thought of the people I had come across in my life. Those who I may have briefly known and those who stayed around longer. You never know how something is going to turn out.I found this book kept me going and wanting to know who his next person was and never being able to anticipate who the next one would be. I felt for a sports column writer, I was blown away and touched with this book and that he had been given a gift from above to send a message to us still here.Happy reading!"},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"This story was highly enjoyable, but more so, it was thought provoking. It makes one realize that even what we may view as an ordinary life, might have an extraordinary impact on the lives of others. Very well done and its brevity was a plus. A quick read for a busy Mom."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I absolutely loved this book. I have never read a book that made me feel so many things so intensly. Each of the five people introduced brought another layer to the story and to this man's life. I would highly recommend this book. In fact, I already have. I want every one I know to read this book just so I can talk about it. It has truly changed the way I see the world."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I was looking for a light book to take on the plane and I grabbed this one. Unfortunately, I read the first page a few days before my trip and finished the book a few hours later! I kept picking it up for &quot;just another few pages&quot;. It's great for the imagination as it gives a novel way to view heaven and it starts making you wonder who would be in line to meet you. I recommend this for anyone who doesn't have a ton of time to read and hates to take months on one book. I thoroughly enjoyed it!"},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"It is a pleasure to experience a creative person at the hight of there craft. In this case, Albom, doing what he does as well as any contemporary, writing in simple easy to read expression. I recommend this book to anyone who has ever had questions about the value of the life they are living, Which is everyone i know."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I cannot say enough about this fabulous book! I picked it up on a whim and had finished the book in three hours. I could not put it down. Albom does a fantastic job taking you through this man's life and showing how events you aren't even aware of can change your life and the life of those around you. Although a book about &quot;people you meet in heaven&quot;, I think Albom does a very good job at dealing with philosophical aspects instead of overly religious aspects, so if you are not a religious person, don't let the title scare you away. This is a book I will read over and over again and have already bought several copies for family and friends. THe premise of the book - how your afterlife is designed to help you understood the life you just led - is fantastic, as is the way everything comes together in the end, in a very realistic way. If you don't read this, you are robbing yourself of a truly great experience."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I bought this book this weekend on a whim. Even though I normally research my purchases ahead of time I occasionally like to go on instinct. I have never read &quot;Tuesdays with Morrie&quot; so I have to say I wasn't influenced at all by any preconceived ideas of what the writing would be like. I loved it. I found it hard to put down and I am still thinking about it - mulling it over - several days later. I have a list of people I've encouraged to read it, and it is such a quick read that if it's not their cup of tea then no harm is done. I think I found the idea of your life finally being fit like a puzzle piece into the grander sceme of LIFE so comforting. If you believe in God, or a higher spirit of some kind, you inevitably have to let go of past pain - times when you prayed for an intervention or guidance and felt that your prayers went unheeded. In this version of Heaven you are invited to see how the pieces fit - how things do balance out. I approached my mundane Mommy chores with a renewed sense of purpose this week - so I didn't become a Professor or an Engineer - the older I become the more I think I'm right where I'm supposed to be. I suggest you read the book with an open mind and see what you think! Anyway I'll be mulling over my Five People for some time to come . . ."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"Anyone who gives this book a poor review isn't saying much about the book, but a lot about themselves. This is the kind of book that will comfort you when you feel like no one cares, and recommended for those who have lost a loved one."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I have read and liked Mitch Albom's other works, especially the brilliant \\"Tuesdays With Morrie.\\" I was given this book as a gift, and was a less sure about it because I am not generally fond of fiction, especially spiritually-based fiction. I shouldn't have been concerned: Albom delivers as usual.The book concerns the life, and more to the point, the death of a man who had lived an ordinary life, and who finds himself entering heaven as Albom envisions it. While I certainly don't agree with or endorse Albom's specific spiritual or religious views, the point of the book isn't really about the specifics of heaven or life after death, but rather it is a reflective parable which focuses the reader on the relationships and situations of genuine importance in life.The book follows Eddie, an elderly widower, as he meets five people who played key roles in his life on earth, even though their roles were rarely what they first seem to be. I was most impressed with the two lives which intersected Eddie's in wartime, the Captain who was his commanding officer in World War Two, and Tala, a little girl whose life most dramatically intersected with Eddie's in a defining moment of his life. I read the book in one sitting, and while I was captivated by the entire book, the encounter with Tala was one of the most emotionally charged passages I have ever read, and is in and of itself a good enough reason to recommend the book.This book is easy for intellectual snobs to dismiss with an elitist sniff, but I think that's an inappropriate response. The book, while not conforming to the specific religious beliefs of many (including myself), is a great reminder of the importance and value of relationships in this life, and teaches readers to never take people, especially friends and family, for granted. With that in mind, I can say that the book is generally excellent, and has moments of utter inspirational brilliance. I recommend the book highly."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"Last night when my wife and I were shopping in the local warehouse store I saw this book and bought it. I could not put it down and finished it in one night. Most of the other reviewers have already said what I could say. At one point I thought I would cry and wanted to read the rest by myself. When you are finished the book you will feel better. The book gives you a whole view on living and dying, the author makes the connection with both. If you have leanings towards another life and the hereafter read this book. The book goes very fast. Foregiveness is the key to life, do not be consumed by hatred or bitterness. Enough said, read the book and look at life and death from a different point of view. Be careful on what reviews you read on this book because you really do not want to know who are the 5 people the fictional character meets in heaven ( some of the other reviews reveal this)"},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"If you're looking for a good book for the infantile mind, please go with a little classic like &quot;Goodnight Moon,&quot; or even the beautiful and underappreciated &quot;Runaway Bunny.&quot; These books may not be more substantive than Albom's, though they certainly aren't any less, but at least they have integrity and aren't sentimental drivel."}]`),H={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:S},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:M,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},P={class:"card-container"},x=["disabled"],E={key:0},q={key:1};function F(n,o,s,u,r,a){const c=f("PoemCard");return e(),t("section",null,[o[1]||(o[1]=i("div",{class:"top-banner"},[i("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[i("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),i("div",P,[(e(!0),t(y,null,p(a.visiblePoems,(h,m)=>(e(),w(c,{key:m,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),a.hasMorePoems?(e(),t("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:o[0]||(o[0]=(...h)=>a.loadMore&&a.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(e(),t("span",q,"Loading...")):(e(),t("span",E,"See more"))],8,x)):g("",!0)])}const C=d(H,[["render",F],["__scopeId","data-v-b69604b0"]]),j=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"quotes/61.md","filePath":"quotes/61.md"}'),W={name:"quotes/61.md"},B=Object.assign(W,{setup(n){return(o,s)=>(e(),t("div",null,[b(C)]))}});export{j as __pageData,B as default};
