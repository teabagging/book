This one kept me reading...reading...etc. I'm reading so fast, I can't find enough mysteries! Gina"},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"Light-hearted reading. Very cute, very different cadence to the narrative. Enjoyed it. Not a strong plot, especially if you like page turners. This book meanders like a collection of short stories. America-bashing while glorifying Botswana. I guess readers have a love affair with Africa and I think that's why this book gained great reviews.There was a lot of male-bashing, but some good guys too, though expressed more subtly. The characters are entertaining, but again the plotlinein this book is dull. The novel is just barely worth reading for the pleasant local color, but as far as mystery fiction goes, I would rather reread Ellis Peters, Anne Perry, Elizabeth Peters, or Cynthia Peale.The back cover led me to expect &quot;the case that tugs at her heart, and lands her in danger, is that of a missing eleven-year-old boy, who may have been snatched by witch doctors.&quot; What?! Where?! The missing boy case was a teensy part of the book, and certainly did not tug at my heart strings at all. There was barely anything made of it at the end. I would have liked to see at least two of the stories to be tied together, or for some clue from another case to help solve the case of the boy's disappearance. Nothing like that is part of the book."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"First, I have to say that this is not a detective novel; at least, not in the traditional sense of having a murder take place at the end of the first chapter and then the rest of the book is spent by the detective solving the mystery. This is more of a novel with some snippets of mysteries thrown in for good measure. The writing style appears to be simple but as you read on, you realize that the prose is deceptively simple. There are layers beneath the surface that give an unexpected depth to the book. I find Precious Ramotswe, the \\"lady\\" of the Ladies' Detective Agency, to be an incredibly interesting character. She has suffered with a bad husband (now ex), the loss of a child, and the loss of a beloved father but is strong throughout and keeps her humanity intact. I cannot wait to read the further adventures."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"I just loved this book. It will quietly draw you in and take you to another world. I went to Botswana for a brief trip last year and fell in love with the country and I love reading McCall's descriptions and his own love for his country through Precious. This is not a book full of wild, bloody action, so if you're looking for that, you will be disappointed. Rather this is a wonderful escape from the harried world of the U.S., written with charm and love with characters that are fresh and that you wish you could meet in real life. I read the Tears of the Giraffe last week too and it was even better, introducing more wonderful characters."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"When Mma Romotwe's father dies leaving her his cattle to sell in order to open a business, she decides to go against recommendations of a butchery or some other regular business to open the first detective agency in her country. She feels it is her \\"duty to help [people] solve the mysteries in their lives\\" (2). A series of moral tales with a focus on honesty and doing the right thing range from the case where a doctor does difficult procedures one day and is completely incompetent the next, to wives who want to know if their husbands are cheating, to a woman who is unsure if the man who claims he is her father is really just using her. The best tale gives hope of the country progressing to allow women to use their intellectual potential and independence freely when an overprotective father hires Mma Romostwe to find out if his daughter has a boyfriend, but she relates and befriends the little girl, Nandira, who displays traits of Mma Romostwe herself. Woven throughout these smaller cases is a more sinister and bigger case involving the taboo witchcraft circles in Africa where young boys' bones are used for certain medicines. Mma Romotswe's intellect, which she learned early from hard work and simple things like counting trees, always prevails and her intuition (\\"the eyes allowed you to see right into a person, to penetrate their very essence\\" (5) ) proves correct. A beautiful and uplifting read, this unconventional detective novel is much more than solving a few mysteries. Also, while tackling everyone else's mysteries, Mma Romotswe still finds time to learn about, fight, and sometimes love both snakes and men as her private history of independence and love unfolds. At the end of the day, Mma Romotswe focuses on the little things: \\"you could think and think and get nowhere, but you still had to eat your pumpkin\\" (81)."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"I selected this book essentially at random. I knew nothing about Alexander McCall Smith. I was pleasantly surprised to be totally delighted with the book. The characters are believable and sympathetic, the plot is engaging, and the sense that we are being told the truth about place and culture is remarkable. When I read in last week's Economist magazine about Smith and how the series has sold over 5 million copies, I was not surprised. He deserves the success for giving us such a positive, rewarding reading experience."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"Interesting book with nice written style by the author. The language and style ring true and the Stories are interesting snapshots of life in africa but I really couldnt figure out what the big noise is all about? maybe I need to go to the today website (this was their selection for book of the month) and see what other people thought. I think V.S Naipal or Chinua Achebe are better options if you want to learn a little about africa. This is a sweet gentle book and i agree with other reviewers about it but this is no earthshaking examination of africa."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"This is a different kind of mystery novel, so much so that it doesn't really seem like a mystery. Even though the main character solves several different mysteries throughout the story, the interesting part of this book is how it is written. It's set in Africa, so it's different from your standard mystery novel right off the bat. Plus, Smith's writing style is quite different from anything I've read before. In addition, there is no one central plot to this story, although there is one big mystery that Precious must solve. I didn't love this book, as many reviewers did, but I found it interesting and unique, so I must commend it for that."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"Many of us in the United States know very little about Africa. This book, the first in a multi-volume series by Smith, provides an insightful, thoughtful, and sensitive look at Botswana, its people and its lifestyle.This book is fun and informative, and I strongly recommend it to anyone who wishes to enjoy a few hours a pleasant leisure. I just wish that there were similar books on Eastern Africa and Western Africa that provided the same enjoyment and insight into the wonderful continent of Africa."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"All I want to do, after reading (devouring) this special, fabulous, unique, wonderful book is to sit on the veranda with Mma Ramotswe and drink bush tea. I want to take a ride in her tiny white van. And most of all, I want to help her solve people's problems as part of her Number One Ladies' Detective Agency.I want to go to Botswana. I want to look out for snakes and smell the dust and worry about the rains. I want to take part in the courteous greetings, and I would not at all mind having a boyfriend named Mr. J.L.B. Matekoni. I would speak in the lyrical tongue of a people who seem much more in touch with the realities of life and death than anyone in my own world.This is not a book to lose. This is a book that has so much simple wisdom on almost every page that you will find yourself, as I did, marking the pages, writing in the margins, copying certain phrases to keep forever!!!Wonderful, enchanting, charming, outstanding. Read it!"},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"This was such a nice surprise to find when doing my usual browsing at the book store! And so exciting to find there were three more books in the saga!Right after reading all four, I met a woman who had been in the Peace Corps in the 70's and had stayed in Botswana for eight years. Her description reaffirmed my desire to visit.It is not so much a description of the land and atmosphere that makes you want to hop on a plane, but of the people there and how straightforward and uncomplicated everything seems to be."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"You'll love it all! The descriptions the characters and, above all, the story. The author writes with such beautiful simplicity that you won't want to put it down till it's all done. That's a guarantee. If you've ever been interested in Africa, you just can't miss this one. I eager to see what comes next. A definite must!! And if you're looking for a few other great titles, look no further than these, Buckland's Hot List: most creative, The Butterfly: A Fable (Singh); most engaging, The Alchemist (Coelho); most interesting, Life of Pi (Martel); most enlightening, 9-11 (Chomsky); most thrilling, The Lovely Bones: A Novel (Sebold); and finally, the most creative, engaging, interesting, enlightening and thrilling book of all, The Little Prince (Saint-Exupery). These are the books I'd recommend to my family, friends, students, and wife. There are many more, trust me, but these are the first that come to mind (for having left an impact slight or proud as it may be). If you have any questions, queries, or comments, or maybe even a title you think I should add to my list, please feel free to e-mail me. I'm always open to a good recommendation. Thanks for reading my brief but hopefully helpful review. Happy reading. Donald S. Buckland."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"Writers are regularly admonished to write about what they know and Alexander McCall Smith evidently knows Botswana; the land, people and their culture which he gently introduces to the reader through the life story of his unique heroine, Mma Precious Ramotswe. Sometimes dubbed the Miss Marple of Africa but this is a disservice to both characters. Mma Ramotswe is younger than Jane Marple and her youthful experiences are related so the reader has a more complete understanding of what motivates Precious. She also opens the first ladies detective agency in all of Botswana publicly announcing herself an investigator, something Miss Marple never did.Her detecting adventures are not the main plot but are a part of her wonderful life adventures. AMS doesn't need graphic sex or violence to keep the reader's attention. Cuddle up before the fire or spread out at the beach. You will breeze through this 'precious' tale and hunt up the rest of this excellent series for more of Mma Ramotswe!"},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"The audiobook started out pretty slowly and I nearly stopped listening about 45 minutes into it. Suddenly, the story \\"clicked\\" for me and I gladly listened to the whole 8 hours and 15 minutes.Narrated wonderfully by Lisette Lecat, a native South African who injects a touch of authenticity with her lovely accent and voice rhythms, this book is much more than a series of detective stories. It is also the story of Botswana and its culture and the complex interactions between traditional and modern, male and female, rich and poor, and white, black and Indian.A lovely book and a real joy to listen to. Sometimes laugh out loud funny, sometimes deeply moving.Well done."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"The rest of this series is WONDERFUL. This first volume falters a bit, but it is best to start with it. Don't give up, head to the next book and devour the rest of the series. When you re-read the series over the years, as you surely will, you will probably skip this first book.I absolutely love this series and hope the first book doesn't deter people from falling in love with the rest of the series and these wonderful, wonderful characters."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"I've read almost all the books in this series, and they are all wonderful examples of great, funny, compelling writing.

I can't wait to read the last 2 books that are out."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"To be honest, I started this book about 3 times and then put it down, until I read the reviews here on Amazon. It was recommended to me by a friend who said I would love it, but I did not know what the heck it was about at first. Then I read the reviews and started it again and I love it. I am about halfway through, and really enjoy \\"Precious\\" s character and her honest take on life. It is a lovely, honest book about life in Africa and the detective agency Precious creates. I will defintiely check out the next books in the series!"},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"When Precious Ramotswe's father, Obed, dies and leaves her all the cattle with the advice to sell it and buy herself a good business, she decides to become a private detective, the first lady detective in Botswana, and perhaps in the whole of Africa.Mma Ramotswe, smart, fat and good-natured, equipped with a detective handbook, great memory, and unfailing sense of right and wrong, sets out to help her neighbors and solve the crimes and mysteries happening around. These are not very serious crimes - an impostor, a naughty daughter, a cheating husband, a dishonest employee - but Mma Ramotswe takes her clients seriously, like her role model, Agatha Christie's Miss Marple, and solves the problems using all her abilities, her wisdom, intuition, cleverness, wit and tact.Mma Ramotswe enjoys her freedom, her house in Zebra Drive in Gaborone and her detective agency in her native country she loves. She is, by all standards, a successful, happy woman. Thanks to his father's cattle she can live in a town, do whatever she wants, drink her favorite redbush tea and have no problems, but she is compassionate and friendly, and really cares for other people. Her detective agency functions also as a psychoanalytical service, although her clients are grossly unaware of this fact. She also loves her country, Botswana, where Kalahari desert dictates the conditions of life, where people live simply, in harmony with nature, believing in the strength of their society and their banks full of diamonds, and wish only to be left in peace. Only her memories, intertwining with the stories of solved crimes, show the dark side of her and her father's life in Botswana, hard work in the mines, dishonest, hurtful people and misery, which she narrowly escaped and which is the fate of many other ordinary people in her country.Alexander McCall , who lived in Africa for a long time, has managed to pour his love for this sun- dried, rough continent into the pages of his novel, creating one of the most life-affirming and optimistic books I have recently read. \\"Ladies No. 1 Detective Agency\\" is written with a lot of humor and easy to read. It is also warm and cheerful, like its main protagonist, the charming Mma Ramotswe. It is a simple book, not aspiring to formal sophistry, but it is good because of the feelings it evokes in the reader - it is not cerebral, but heartfelt. I am very happy this unusual detective story is the first of a long series, because it is a promise of many delights to come."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"I'm not entirely sure what genre \\"The #1 Ladies' Detective Agency\\" fits into, and that may be why I resisted reading it for a long time. I avoid books that get a lot of press by mainstream media (like the Today Show, Oprah, Regis, etc.), figuring it is just a sellout and not real praise. However, this book has real charm and a sweetness about it. No twisty Agatha Christie style plot, just a compassionate lady using her brain, intuition and common sense. The author communicates atmosphere beautifully and paints the culture and landscape of Botswana with a loving brush."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"This book, set in Botswana, opens up the world of the lady detecitve, her friend and the countryside. A really fun read that brings the characters to life and pulls you in from the first page. Read it and love it."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"This entire series is well worth your time. The books are quick and great for vacations, but are also quite informative since they are set in Botswana. The characters are VERY FUNNY. These books are in my top 10 and I'd highly recommend them to anyone."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"I'm a High school Freshman within the United States and as a class assighnment, I had to read the novel, The No.1 Ladies' Detective Agency. I really liked this book because this book was so joyful to read and I learned many new things from this book such as about Botswana, Africa. Also, this book shows a protagonist, Mma Ramotswe, the first woman detective in Botswana and very independence woman and she solves problems such as, struggles between people and people. There are many interesting stories each chapters and almost entirely, I really liked it. But, this book is not that much serious as Sherlock Homes. This book consists with light stroies like we can often see in our surroundings. If you want to read really exciting and scary book, I don't want to recommand this book but if you want to read just light and interesting book, I'm sure that you are not goint to dissapoint. And also, if you are woman, I really recommand this book because, Mma Ramotswe is so great woman."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"Unusual outlook on life for a European reader. Gives a good impression of life in an African country we don't hear much about in Scandinavia. Good sense of humour, some unexpected twists in the plot. Look forward to reading more from the series."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"No text-to-speech. Luckily the library had the CD set. So I bought the Kindle version to read while the lovely voice of Lisette Lecat narrated the story to me. I think her voice added a taste of the culture to the reading of the story. Even still, I think I might have been just as happy with the robot voice on my Kindle. This is an expensive read for me. It is hard to try and get the whole package from the library on anything. When a part comes in that's what you have to drop other reads so as to get it done on time. I don't do well with just the audio version, I have to immerse myself in a book to finish. And because of all that I just said, this story leaves me not caring if I read any more of these books.The story was of a sing-song feel and I often found myself drifting to sleep or off to other thoughts. The author did capture the love of country and the evils that still exist. It reminded me of reading missionary books at my grandmother's house. I loved seeing a different world than the one I live in. But sad to say the attitudes of men seem universal. I was so disappointed in the ending. I thought we had finally grew a strong self-sufficient woman. Meh!Unless the Kindle and Audible versions of the rest of the series fall into my lap, I will not seek out the rest of the series."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"This series slowly takes you in with the simple language, but compellingly strong, intelligent characters. Africa is the setting and becomes one of the main characters. Mma Robotswe is such a fun, strong character that I could not wait to see what she did next without the tools of computers, Internet access, etc. She completes her cases with sheer intelligence and logic \\"in the old Botsswana way.\\". The only thing I could say in a negative way is the pricing of these books. They take so little time to read but still cost too much to read all at once."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"Modern fiction that is not full of crass vulgarities or brimming with sexual excess. This is a fine work of fiction. A story, or rather stories, told well. And told with a gentle tone and great charm. It does not hide from all life's hardness but it approaches what it encounters with a deft literary hand. Kudos to Alexander McCall Smith for creating interesting stories that draw readers in, and for giving us characters that we might actually want to meet."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency is a delightful book written suspensefully and in excellent English.

There is depth of character and I learned about a culture very diffrent than ours. It is a quick read.

I will look for more books in this series."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"The wonderfully imaginative, absorbing and playful plot of this novel is almost as fabulous as the brilliant creation of Mma Ramotswe, in my opinion one of the best characters in print. With all the gorgeous quirks of culture and language her nationality entails and her penchant for red bush tea, as well as her total integrity and endearing personality, she makes for a series one can dip into as if hearing the stories of an old friend, albeit a very interesting one.The heat, smells and beautiful details of life in Botswana are instantly transferred into the living room, train carriage or damp bus stop of the reader in this amazingly atmospheric book."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"If you are looking for a true escape to visit 'friends' in Botswana, this is the book for you!

Can't get enough!"},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"I loved reading the first book but when I reread it by listening to the CD, I heard so much more than I did by reading it that I listened to the rest of the series by CD. Suddenly the 40 minute drive to work was no longer a dreaded waste of time. The bottle-necks I ran into during rush-hour traffic meant I could enjoy the book even longer.I had no idea how to pronounce certain African words and when I heard how the reader Lisette Lecat spoke it, it became a complete different word than I how I spoke it in my mind.Even words such as \\"Khaki\\" and \\"Zebra\\" had what I assume is an African accent and endeared me even more to the characters and the book reader. When I heard what sounds to my American ear like \\"Clark-Wayne\\" road, I realized that I had been mispronouncing \\"Tlokweng\\" Road. Another tickle to my ear was the way the \\"M\\" in Mma was drawn out.I can't wait to find out what the J.L.B. in J.L.B Matekoni's name stands for. Most of all, I hope Alexander Mccall Smith keeps this series going as well as my other favorite of his, the Isabel Dalhousie Novels."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"The book was for my son's school reading assignment.

I was pleased with the fact that after looking all over the place I was able to get the book from you in a matter of days."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"There is so nuch negative about Africa that it raises your spirit to read this charming book about all that can be good and loving in Africa. The traditions, culture, good government and good citizens of Botswana give you hope for the rest of the continent. Add to that the life story of this wise and wonderful woman and it's a winner. It's a fine travelogue also."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"While reading The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency, I felt as if I had gone on a trip to Botswana without leaving my chair. This book is a simple, elegant, mystery read.The main character is Precious Ramotswe, a thirty-five year old woman who with inheritance money from her father decides to open a detective agency. She becomes the first and only woman to operate a detective agency in Botswana--thus the title.According to the author, Alexander McCall Smith, Precious Ramotswe is a traditional built African woman. Mr. McCall is telling the reader that in Africa they like their women with a little meat on their bones. There is a difference in the way that Precious is perceived by the men and women in the chapters. Women consider her to be \\"fat\\", while men consider her to be FAT (fabulous and thick). This does not seem to hinder Precious as she takes on her cases.Precious has endured the illness and eventual death of her father, an abusive marriage and the lost of her only child. These events have shaped her into believing that she can do all things with God's help.Along with her secretary slash office manger Mma. Makustsi, she takes on several cases in one book. Even though you might figure out the outcome of the case mid way through, the story will keep you reading.This pleasingly plump detective will keep the pages turning as you enjoy your trip to Botswana. This is the first in a series, and also the source for the HBO series by the same name. You will see Jill Scott in Precious Ramotswe. I look forward to continuing my journey with the No. 1 Ladies Detective Agency.Reviewed by Maricia D. C. JohnsFor BBW Reviews"},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"What fun!

They are mysteries, but very \\"soft\\". Love the characters and interaction between them. Some say that the style is alittle \\"preachy\\" but it was refreshing to have a story with morals."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"Mme Precious Ramotswe finds herself taking care of her father after suffering through an abusive marriage in which her husband leaves her. When her father is on his death bed, he tells Precious that he has enough cattle for her to be able to sell and buy a business so that she can have a good life. She decides to open her own detective agency rather than purchase an existing business. Since a woman owns and runs the the No. 1 Ladies Detectives Agency, that makes it the only agency of it's kind in Africa.I will admit that I didn't expect to like this book, but it turned out to be a surprisingly enjoyable read. It was very charming and pleasant. The cases that Precious has are not the kind of criminal cases that I typically read about. They're more human. She looks for missing persons, tries to catch cheating husbands, even follows around a teenage girl for her father. I enjoy her ways of thinking and the way she deals with these people. Some of the cases are touching, while some are slightly humorous. I look forward to reading the next installment in the series."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"I decided to read the book because being an avid reader, I am always looking for more to read. This looked like a book that has gained popularity and is also a series book, so if I really enjoyed it, there's more to look forward to. I found that Precious Ramotswe is a good person and someone I'd seek out as a friend after reading about her. The book had an unexpected format, and I found myself drawn in to life in Botswana, of which I knew nothing. The characters are quietly real, as opposed to colorful caricature, and I appreciate this. The book reads from a woman's point of view, which only illustrates the author's talent. The book has very different pacing from the average detective type fiction, yet it does nothing to take away from the plot. I have subsequently read three more of the series and look forward to reading the rest of them."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"This book took me a little while to get 'into' it but was a good read.

The writing and story flow smoothly throughout the book without any dullness or letdowns. Smith has created an enjoyable main character that is a lady detective in Botswana in Africa. She gets involved in interesting situations that provide stimulation and entertainment without overdoing it. Although this is about a ladies' detective agency, the book is not just for ladies as I had imagined. I found it delightful reading and look forward to reading the remaining books in the series."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"Even though some of her cases were a bit predictable I found Precious Ramotswe to be delightful. She commits a series of rookie faux pas, some of which are pretty funny, but she's always honest and humble. She has suffered an abusive early marriage and the death of a premature baby, but she takes it all in stride and is always ready help those in need. She is also a member of a large and largely ignored set of demographics: She is black, over 35, and wears a size 22. Most refreshingly, she doesn't give a crap about dieting and she's not preoccupied with finding a man. She tools around Botswana, and occasionally South Africa, in a small white van."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"This is a unique and very entertaining book. Smith's warmth and sense of humor shine thru every page. I thoroughly enjoyed the story, and really look forward to reading the rest of the series."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"I picked up this book because I thought it might be different, and it certainly was. It is set in Botswana, and the heroine is Precious Ramotswe. She certainly is Precious, and this book is a delight. The book is very well-written and the cases that Precious works on as she sets up her detective agency in Gaborone in Botswana are complex and interesting. These cases are presented as vignettes in the book, and I found that each one was remarkable in its own right. And Precious herself is a treasure. She is portrayed as a full-figured African woman who is terribly interested in everyone else's business. And really, shouldn't a private detective be interested in everything that is going on? This looks like a promising series."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"I thought the book was great. So much so that I have purchased the rest of the series. The author does a great job of making you feel like you are right there in Africa with the characters. I couldn't put it down."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"It was fun to read about Mma Ramotswe and her investigations. Her use of common sense and observation was a delight, as was the unique setting in Botswana. Some of the cases that Mma solved were very funny (the woman whose husband was going to bars to pick up women; the man who stole the Mercedes); and some were sad (the boy that was kidnapped).I did not think that there was anything grand and ground-breaking here, but nevertheless a fun, light read."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"Precious Ramotswe inherits her father's cattle herd and sells it to start a new life. The options are limited for a woman in Botswana. She sets out on an uncharted course, opening the first private detective agency run by a woman. At least in Botswana. Mma Ramotswe is a commanding figure. She's stout, observant and reasons with precise logic. She would have made a great politician. Instead, she buys a house, an office, hires a secretary, installs a telephone - and sits down to wait for clients. It seems she's likely to shut it all down within a week.Instead, clients come calling. The result is a series of vignettes of her clients' problems and their resolutions. There are wandering husbands, rebellious teen-age children [are there any other kind?] and a missing, probably murdered child. Justice, although never mentioned by either McCall Smith or Mma Ramotswe, is an important element throughout these episodes. Justice and the value of being an African. McCall is knowledgeable about Southern Africa and its people. He imparts that understanding with marvelous skill. His Scottish background never intrudes or distracts. Except perhaps in one of Mma's more bizarre cases. The Scots treasure their reputation for producing fine doctors. One of Mma Ramotswe's mysteries is the occasionally inept doctor. It is clearly the highlight of this superb book.Mma Ramotswe, in establishing her unique agency, might be thought to have shed her personal life. After all, she had a brief, unhappy marriage. Men are to be watched, controlled, and manipulated in ways to prevent their wandering. Yet, as might be expected, there is a man in her town whose value transcends the image dominated by wandering husbands or lovers. He knows her worth and she his, but his stumbling proposal is rebuffed. There's no strain on the friendship, however, and it becomes clear the two will be useful to each other in the future.McCall Smith has accomplished something very special with this book. It cries out for a sequel [of which there are now four] for many reasons. It certainly shatters the long-standing image of the &quot;detective&quot; novel with its stacks of corpses, inept policemen and implausible characters. Mma Ramotswe is simply a capable woman without special powers. She focusses on the problem at hand, keeps distractions at bay and refuses to deal in absolutes. McCall Smith's powers of characterisation, locale and story place him far above the traditional examples of the &quot;mystery&quot; genre. He is compelling reading for anyone. [stephen a. haines - Ottawa, Canada]"},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"For a book so utterly unassuming and undemanding, this first volume in the adventures of Botswana's only lady detective, Precious Ramotswe, accomplishes an impressive amount.It gives us, first of all, a fictional character who breathes. Mma Ramotswe has none of the infallible intelligence, the glamor or colorful pugnacity of stock detective fiction. She is an ordinary woman nearing middle age - but it would be more accurate to praise her as &quot;perfectly ordinary.&quot; Her considerable girth is emblematic of her general solidity: ambling through one small case after another, rarely sure of the next step, succeeding not because of brilliance but by dint of cheerful confidence, good humor and common sense.It gives us, second, a glimpse into the day to day life of a modern African town. It is perhaps a little exotic to us, but it is perfectly natural to Mma Ramotswe, and her familiarity with and affection for the social order, the dry expanses of the Kalahari, the flow of favors expended and called in, lure us into seeing it all simply from her point of view, as just the way things are at home. It kept reminding me, oddly enough, of the small town life in Tom Sawyer. There have been many presentations of Africa as the Dark Continent. Here we have a credible portrait of it as the Sunny Continent, as it can be in those times and polities where history is kind enough to leave it alone for a while.It gives us, third, a break. The language is as simple and direct, though not as self-consciously so, as Hemingway's. Even when witchcraft and child murder darken the storyline, the pace is unhurried, the goodness of a shared cup of tea and a back porch conversation celebrated. The pain of all Africa's history touches our heroine's life, and colors the edges of the story; the vastness of the interior somehow generates and gets reflected in the personal dignity of the townspeople; yet everything takes place on a human scale. It is hard to imagine anyone sitting down with this book and coming away less than disarmed."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"In this book, Smith writes about a place very little known to his American readers, his story is located in Botswana. This country is a free, independent, Democratic state that borders South Africa. But given its placement in world geography, it is at a very different stage of development, than our world in the USA. Botswana has telephones, and electricity. But no high speed Internet. And not that many paved roads.Life is much simpler there than it is here, but by no means easier. And a traditional morality is still pervasive, although diminishing. But the beauty of Alexander McCall Smith's book is that it is so simple, yet so elegant. It seems very much like he went to the &quot;J.M. Coetzee&quot; school of authorship. He is able to convey intense human feelings and interactions without resorting to 'highbrow' vocabulary. He conveys the values and the visual images of Botswana with tremendous aplomb and creativity.The entire story is based on a tremendously creative and almost brazen assumption. This concept being, that a lady, could actually become a private detective in Botswana. Not only does she make this attempt, but in fact, she is the ONLY lady detective in Botswana. And without any of the high speed computer data base technology of America and Western Europe, she solves her cases, the very old fashioned way, as they did about 50 or 60 years ago in America, with good, hard work and research, and great intuition.But more than the plot lines, Smith seems dedicated to helping his readers understand, that even though some things may be different in different cultures and different locations, people are still people, and there are some universal values, that are shared, by most of the hard working and industrious people all over the world.This book is truly a very thought provoking one. It is also a wonderful example of cross-cultural interaction. For, even as it is cross cultural for Americans to look at Botswana. It is also cross cultural, for a Botswanian to look at the other cultures of Africa in comparison to their own. And they are very proud of their own. This book is high level conceptual philosophy in a format, that masquerades as simple mystery, but is much more. Truly, it is one that no one should miss."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"This book is a very charming one. Its heroine is both adorable and admirable, and its author is a master of story telling, from comedy to tragedy. All that has been said by other reviewers, of course. I just want to add that the unabridged audio version of the book is a real winner. Its narrator is terrific with accents and characterizations and she really brings the book alive. Apparently she has been recognized for her narration, and deservedly so. This is easily the best-read book on tape I have ever experienced. My husband agrees. So we'd both recommend the audio version over the print version in this particular case."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"Precious Ramotswe is the thirty-something protagonist of Alexander McCall Smith's successful series about a lady detective in Botswana. The first book of the series is \\"The No. 1 Ladies Detective Agency,\\" in which Smith gives the back story of how Ramotswe came to be the first female detective in Botswana.Mma Ramotswe, as she is known throughout the book, is the only child of Obed Ramotswe, whom she idolizes. Since her mother died when she was young, Mma Ramotswe learned about life from her father. Obed owned a big herd of cattle, which his daughter inherited upon her father's death. She uses the proceeds from the sale of her father's cattle to buy a house on Zebra Drive and set up her detective agency.Using lyrical prose, Smith does a brilliant job of imbuing his book with the ambiance of Botswana. We see the thorn and acacia trees on the horizon, we marvel at the colorful birds as they swoop down from the sky, we taste the sand of the Kalahari Desert, and we feel the leisurely, gentle pace of everyday life in Botswana.Ramotswe is a thoroughly entertaining character. She is fat and proud of her girth, and she is confident in her ability to read human nature. Ramotswe investigates cases of various con men, a misbehaving daughter, and a missing husband. Although she has no experience as a detective, she uses common sense, intuition, and her professional bible, \\"The Principles of Private Detection,\\" by Clovis Andersen, to guide her. More often than not, she comes to the correct conclusion.However, Ramotswe is not simply a female Sherlock Holmes. She is a kind and compassionate individual who is careful to use the information she gleans to help her clients live a better life. Her support system consists of Mr. J. L. B. Matekoni, mechanic extraordinaire (and her not-so-secret admirer) and her talented secretary, Mma Makutsi.\\"The No. 1 Ladies Detective Agency\\" is a throwback to a kinder gentler detective novel. Instead of violence and mayhem, Smith writes about the psychology of human nature and he emphasizes the importance of knowing who you are and of having a secure place in the world. He also stresses the satisfaction that comes from loving your land and your neighbors. If you want an exotic, sweet, and utterly enchanting novel about a most unusual detective, start reading this series. I guarantee that you will be eager to read the rest of the series, as well."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"What a truly delightful little book with such life affirming actions and thoughts . It is just a fun read with the characters coming to life so that you can almost hear their wonderful African English!!!Gives you a real sense of the country and lands within."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"It is a rare gift to combine fiction with quotable extracts about life. Alexander Smith hit a nerve when he created Precious, her supporting characters, and the setting of the book.

Instead, they are a quiet, gentle and heartwarming series of vignettes that provide insight into the human condition and a peak at the Africa of Botswana. Further, they are not entirely saccharine either as they touch on issues such as domestic violence and the trials and tribulations of serious poverty. Yet at the end of each of these books, I always feel better. This is a rare combination indeed.I tend to read what most people would consider \\"serious\\" fiction and nonfiction. You will more often than not find me curled up with something by Camus, Nietzsche or Borges. Rose-colored glasses are not my style and it took an insistent friend to get me to read this first volume. I now gladly admit to being seduced by Smith's deceptively simple prose and characters.These books are meant to be read at the beach or bedtime and later passed on to friends. Gentle wisdom is best undertaken gently. If you can approach these books in the spirit I believe Smith intended, then you might be find in them something sorely missing in this world of ours."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"Written by a man, The No1 Ladies' Detective Agency has enough of a feminist persepctive for me to feel I was reading something actually written for me, rather than feeling as I usually do when reading, that I am trying to take pleasure in literature created for an audience of which I am not a part. McCall Smith' s feminism is simple but fundamental : men should not beat their wives, the better fathers are those who encourage their daughters to be independent and realise their dreams, women have a right to happiness.These beliefs are just part of the basic philosophy of the central character, Mma Precious Ramotswe, the first lady detective in Botswana, who imparts her basic moral philosophy at the same time - murder is worse than lying, relationships are more important than money, intuition is a kind of knowledge. While all of this philosophy may seem clich&eacute;d, as perhaps it is, it appears naturally in the book as part of the character and helps us to understand her approach to solving the cases brought to her.Woven throughout all of this is a picture of Botswana, considered by Ramotswe, and presumably McCall Smith, as the best and most successful country in Africa. Independent from the British since 1966, there is enormous pride in her accomplishments, and only the ongoinging black magic practices of some of the country's witchdoctors cast a shadow on the shining accomplishments of Botswana's diamond-fueled progress.Most powerfully of all, it is the love of the land that sings throughout the book. Botswana - stretching from the Kalahari desert to the Limpopo river, a country where there is a place for me, and for everybody, to sit down on this earth and touch it and call it their own . A country with its distinct riches - that was what her country was so rich in - emptiness...those empty spaces, those wide grasslands that broke and broke the heart . With its thorn trees that know how to survive in the searing heat and the birds and snakes of Mother Africa. Where nature is a family member and where the rising of the sun and its setting at the end of day are events to be savoured in the daily rhythm of life.I read this book in a relaxed afternoon, and felt I had passed my time with a pleasant companion, who had painted pictures for me of a place I might otherwise never visit."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"I am freshman in high school, and I read this book for my ESL class. I had several choices, but I chose this book because I really like mystery. Also, when I first saw this book, it doesn't seem like difficult. However, it is not real mystery. It is just about normal woman detective who lives in Botswana. She investigates such as missing husband, a daughter whose father wants to know whether she has boyfriend or not. However, I and my teammates become like this book because we can feel a warm heart from the main character of this book, Precious Ramotswe. Although she hurts from her ex-husband, she still has warm hearts and thinks about the others. Also, she tries her best to solve her clients' problem. In addition, she is very proud of the fact that she is woman, and she is the only woman detective in Botswana. If you like hard mystery, such as murder, I assume that you would not like this book because my teammates were also disappointed about this book at first. However, if you would like to read a book about a woman who has proud of herself, I strongly recommend this book."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"A friend gave me the first four books and they sat on my shelf for a year before I read them. Africa? Botswana? Who wants to read about those places? I didn't. But I was out of things to read and picked up book number one. What a wonderful surprise!The author paints the people and culture of Botswana in a such a wonderful array of colors - I'll bet Botswana tourism has shot way up since these books came out.I love our heroine, Precious Ramotswe. The mysteries she solves in the books do not involve CSI type gruesome murder plots but more down to earth mysteries such as \\"is my teenage daughter meeting a boy after school?\\" The \\"mundaneness\\" of the mysteries is a large part of the charm of these books.Like Lays potato chips, you will not be able to read just one of these books. I guarantee your laundry and dishes will pile up as you just have to find out what happens in the next book - and the next book - and the next book - etc."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency (2002) is the first volume in this series. Precious Ramotswe is a Botswana woman, the daughter of Obed Ramotswe. Her mother was killed by a train when she was very young and she had been raised by various aunts and a cousin. Precious was married for a short time to Note Mokoti, a jazz trumpeter, but left him after the death of their premature baby.When Obed Ramotswe died, he left Precious a herd of 2000 cattle. Not wanting to raise cattle, she sold most of the herd, bought a home on Zebra Drive, and acquired another building just off the Lobatse Road where she opened the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency. Of course, the agency accepted men as well as women clients, but it was run by Mma Ramotswe and Mma Makutsi.When Precious called the Botswana College of Secretarial and Office Skills to hire a secretary, they immediately recommended Mma Makutsi, an honor graduate, who had achieved an unprecedented score of 97% on the completion examination. Despite her fine qualifications, Mma Makutsi was having difficulties finding a job; the best jobs seem to go to beautiful girls who had only barely passed the examination. Mma Ramotswe liked her immediately. Mma Makutsi proved to be a very competent typist and efficiently handled all aspects of the agency business. Moreover, she made a very good cup of bush tea.In their first case, Precious is asked to find the husband of Mma Malatsi, who disappeared while attending a church service. Then they are asked to find a missing boy and the boyfriend of a young girl. In another case, they are asked to determine whether a certain man is the father of their client. They do well and the success of the agency is assured for a while longer.In this novel, Precious refers to Agatha Christie when she declares her intentions to start a detective agency and many reviewers have since compared her to Miss Marple. While it is true that Precious Ramotswe has the folk wisdom of her people, she is also only in her mid-30's. She has had several suitors whom she has refused, but she has only regretted one denial: Mr. J.L.B Maketoni, owner and operator of the Tlokweng Road Speedy Motors garage.This novel is a true gem, written by a talented and prolific author who was born in Zimbabwe and has lived and taught in Botswana. The author now teaches medical law at Edinburgh University, but apparently has had practical experience in forensic medicine within Botswana. The writing is so authentic that the reader can almost smell the dust in the hot afternoon sun and the characters come alive as you read the stories.Highly recommended for anyone who enjoys interesting people, exotic locations, and realistic detective stories.-Bill Jordin"},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"Every time I listen to this audio book, Alexander McCall Smith takes me directly to Africa. The scene is vivid in my mind and the characters are both exotic and intimate. I feel as though I am there. The narrator, Lisette Lecat, has a pleasant accent and is easy to understand. Her voice is like music. I love all the audio books in this series."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"Dr. Alexander McCall Smith's most famous work, The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency, is a charming and witty novel featuring a cast of equally likable characters. Protagonist Precious Ramotswe, a witty and intelligent woman of size, runs the only ladies' detective agency in Botswana. Her perseverance and sharp mind allow her to solve a variety of crimes, including the kidnapping of a young boy by a witch doctor for \\"strengthening spell\\" purposes. Throughout the novel, Smith integrates a subtle yet exceedingly entertaining humor with deeper moral issues, producing a novel that is at once both thought provoking and light. This quality adds to the appeal of substance of the novel as well as serves to produce characters that earn the reader's approval and respect.At the very heart of her character, Precious Ramotswe presents a picture of happiness and success. Living an extremely laid back lifestyle in Africa, and without a single care to live anywhere else, Precious appeals to the on-the-go American reader in every way. She represents something that Americans long for as they \\"hustle and bustle\\" throughout their busy lives: a certain peace and satisfaction with their accomplishments. In some ways, the stereotypical American is insatiable. He or she embodies the \\"more, more, more\\" ideal, in which no achievement-no matter how great-is ever enough. Precious provides a counterpoint to this drive in every way. She is both effective in her daily activities, and happy lounging the day away with her cup of tea. When she has something to accomplish, she possesses an immense amount of practical intelligence and patience, and when no clients knock on her door, she is content to spend the day with a friend or magazine. As a society, the American public is envious of Precious because of her driven, yet patient attitude. Her lifestyle represents one that few Americans are able to achieve. The \\"businesspeople\\" are on the go at every hour of the day or night; the mothers are constantly running to and from activities with their children; the \\"workingman\\" spends eight hours on the clock and then collapses in front of the television with a beer; the \\"sloth\\" lives off welfare and doesn't ever accomplish anything. And yet, not one of these people can claim true happiness. None of them possess that \\"happy medium\\" in which they are content to glide along the flow of life-enjoying challenges that arise, and just noticing the beauty that exists around them. This fact alone adds an immense amount of appeal to the novel.Also intermingled with Precious's enviable anecdotal lifestyle is a sense of humor that adds another dimension to both the novel as a whole and her likeability as a character. For instance, in many of Dr. McCall Smith's novels he includes mention of a ravenous crocodile that consumes unsuspecting victims. This novel is no different. Precious is asked to find the husband of a woman who has disappeared after attending a baptism. Using her wit and stamina, Precious brings her neighbor's dog to the river and, upon the appearance of a crocodile, she proceeds to kill it, cut open its stomach, extract the man's jewelry, and present the evidence to the man's wife. Surprisingly, the wife is relieved that her husband had not run off with another woman, and is happy for her newly gained freedom. This humorous and unexpected approach to a tragic tale is common throughout the novel, and allows Dr. Smith to present a variety of gruesome stories in a lighthearted, enjoyable manner.Precious's physical description provides another instance for Dr. McCall Smith to utilize his humorous writing faculties. As a large black woman, unconcerned with her weight and extremely practical about exactly what she can and cannot fit into, one can only imagine her going about her detective work. The reader can only laugh out loud while envisioning Precious's attempt to fit into a crowd while following a young girl, or \\"hiding\\" in the overgrown garden of a suspicious doctor-or set of doctors, as she later learns. Obviously, one would presume that the woman's large and attention-drawing stature would impede her sleuthing ability, but instead, this quality makes her more likable and trustable to other characters. This draws yet another contrast between the African and American societies in general. The very nature of Precious's physical character directly contrasts the American ideal of beauty and social acceptability. Yet, the reader is invariably drawn to her as the epitome of the \\"perfectly rounded\\" (no pun intended) character. It is through the humor and dignity of every aspect of her physical nature and lifestyle that she gains the reader's respect and admiration."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"Oh, how I love these stories. I read Tears of the Giraffe first (see Amazon review of 5/24/05), and loved it. I would recommend, as with all series, that you begin here with The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency. This is where you get the full background about how the agency got started, about its proprietress, Precious Ramotswe; Mma Ramotswe's beloved Daddy, Obed; and her friend J.L.B. Matekoni, and others. You'll fall in love with Mma Ramotswe's Africa as well.The story takes place in Botswana, a country just north of South Africa. Botswana is a democracy and has done very well for itself since the mid-sixties when it gained its independence. Precious Ramotswe, who is always called Mma Ramotswe, opens the first and only detective agency in Africa run by a woman, after the death of her father. She is a very clever woman, quite plump, too, which is a good thing...she refers to her build as the \\"traditional\\" build of the Botswana female. She is very proud of her size and her brain, which she puts to good use in helping people solve the \\"problems in their lives.\\"The book is a series of events of a social, personal, and business nature and moves easily along and keeps the reader interested. The best way I can describe McCall Smith's writing is that it has class, from his vocabulary to his style. The story flows smoothly from one page to another; one chapter to another; and even horrible events in people's life are served up with a kind of dignity as presented from the viewpoint of Mma Ramotswe. While Mma is a very gracious and polite lady, she can be ruthless when dealing with vile, evil, and unscrupulous individuals. In the end, she is not afraid of anybody or anything! I'd love to meet her...if she were only real!!Carolyn Rowe Hill"},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"This is a sweet read.If you sit back, relax and start reading - it feels as though the main character is telling you a story while you're both sitting on her porch in the heat of an African afternoon with all the time in the world.You'll find yourself transported to a world away, where things move slower, gadgets are non-existent and the perspective refreshing. I love the way the author matches the tone and pace of the book perfectly to the main character and the setting.A sweet, easy-going read about a time and place where values and character are the riches in life."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"Surprise, Surprise. This is not a thriller as I expected but a book about life and human nature, filled with love for Africa and the African people. It seems that lately Africa has lost its \\"charm\\" in the western eyes and is now mostly related to AIDS, hunger and war. This book seems to give Africa its lost glory.Mma Ramotswe is a fat black African lady who decides, after her father's death, to open a detective agency. Mma Ramotswe is a unique lady. On the one hand she fits the description of the lonely detective operating by himself, relying on her wit (and her car's engine) only, but on the other hand she is a woman who loves human beings, gossip and secrets. Mma Ramotswe likes to summarize to herself the truth she learns about life. She enjoys little pleasures of life, such as drinking bush tea or watching cattle. She is, so I see her, a symbol of Africa herself. Precious Ramotswe had her share of grief but she is a person who grew up being loved and is thus ready to give something to the world.The book was a real pleasure. I felt it was literature of the \\"old fashioned kind\\" in the sense that this is the kind of book that takes you and teaches you of other places. You learn to see Africa through the eyes of Precious Ramotswe. You learn that not all Africans are the same (\\"Ghanaians were Mma Ramotswe's favourite people; they had a wonderful sense of humor and were almost inevitably in a good mood\\"). You see the landscape, the food, but most of all you learn about people, how they think and what they deem important. There are human traits that are similar everywhere; Mma Ramotswe has to deal with problems of cheating husbands, non-believing women and greed of many kinds. But she also has to deal with problems unique to this part of the world, such as witch craft and its dangers. Through the story of Mma Ramotswe life and the cases she needs to solve we learn not only of Africa today and its problems but also of the character of the African people. The cases are not the real essence of the story. They are merely a vehicle to tell us about life. This is not the regular mystery story where one case is solved throughout the book. There are many small cases which are only the glue holding this lovely tale."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"I bought this book on a whim, having gone into the bookstore with the intention of buying a completely different book. I put that book back and bought No. 1 Ladies Detective Agency instead. I'm not a detective or mystery fan at all. I visited Kenya a few years ago and I hoped this book would bring memories of Africa back.I can't even say how much I enjoyed this book. Particularly the opening chapters are very good. It's very simple, powerful, very funny too. It gives a view of Southern Africa that only someone who has lived there all his life can give.My only criticism is a kind of inexperience or clumsiness by McCall Smith towards the end of the book. Foreshadowing which doesn't really deliver. The ending might be a little pat. But there is so much so good about this book that I plan to get the other two in the series and can't wait for the new one next spring!"},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"Mma Ramotswe, an ordinary citizen with absolutely no proper investigative training, uses her inheritance to set up the first ladies' detective agency. While the idea that a woman could not possibly be a detective arises a number of times, neither the book nor its characters directly question Mma Ramotswe's qualifications as a detective. Although she purchases a detective guide-book, its rules and advice cannot be applied to her cases verbatim. Instead, she relies on her innate skills as an African woman that more easily aid in the unraveling of the community mysteries. Early on, Mma Ramotse points out to an attorney that women are more observant than men. Upon sensing his objections, she readily informs him that he has forgotten to zip his fly. Aside from its humor, the beauty of this book is McCall Smith's ability to blend splendid descriptions of Africa's vast landscape with Mma Ramotswe's personal narrative and to show how that product remains very much alive in her heart and in her behavior. In a culture where female dependence is embedded in history, Mma acts with extraordinary strength and courage. It is her painful experience with her own run-away husband and her unique relationship with her father that shed light on her investigations and ultimately enable her to reconcile the fragments of her own life. In this way, her endeavors give voice to many similar unrecorded stories that have been historically gagged."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"I love everyone of Smith's books and own a copy of every one in the series of the No 1 Ladies Detective Agency.

She is a fully-rounded character with an inborn understanding of human nature and an ability to learn from her own mistakes.This book is one of those little jewels that can move you into a character's soul and give you an understanding of the forces that mold a different way of life.And it's a really good story, too, with little twists and turns that entertain and delight. I cannot recommend it highly enough."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"This review is for the first Anchor Books paperback edition published in August 2002, 235 pages. THE NO. 1 LADIES' DETECTIVE AGENCY was on the USA Today top 150 best sellers list for 98 weeks between February 2003 and August 2005, reaching the peak position of number 18.Around 1995, Mme Mma Precious Ramotswe opens the number one ladies' detective agency on the edge of Gaborone, the capital of Botswana, a landlocked nation in Southern Africa. It is the number one ladies' detective agency not because it is the best, but rather the first in the nation and perhaps even the Continent. As such, Mma Ramotswe's first cases do not involve the convoluted intrigue and red herring clues of the typical British and American private investigator novels. Instead, they are vignettes of life, culture and tribulations in Botswana. Instead of a puzzling mystery, the reader gets a strong sense of place.Although the first chapter opens with some action, the next three are devoted to the back story of Mma Ramotswe and her father. The narrative flow is smooth, providing the reader, through story, clear insights into the lifestyle of the common peoples of Botswana after it celebrated independence from Britain in 1966 and up to the narrative present. With this foundation, the author builds our understanding of the culture as Mma Ramotswe resolves varied problems for a half-dozen clients.The author reveals Botswana for us without being pushy. The scent and feel of the country, and the author's obvious fondness for the place, rise naturally out of the story, although perhaps too nicely. The bad guys are not insidious, threats are easily disarmed, issues resolved amiably, no one goes to jail and the only violence is in someone else's country. Although nearly a quarter of the adult population of Botswana is HIV positive, there is only one oblique reference to the disease. It seems this view of place is through rose tinted glasses."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"This is a thoroughly enjoyable and deceptively simple novel."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"I enjoyed learing more about the Botswana culture from this book and the short, mini mysteries were interesting and humerous at times. It was a very quick and easy read. I'm not so sure what all the hype is about this book...it is not one that I would say is a must read, or even a book that I would pass on to a friend. I wasn't drawn into the book or touched in any way by this story, but it was a nice, relaxing read. I did also read The next one in this series and feel the same about The Tears of the Giraffe."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book and the characters. I think that the author did a wonderful job bringing the words to life. It is a mystery, yet not as much \\"who dun it\\" as figuring out the intricacies of others lives, which Mm. Ramostswe does with such class and humor.This is the second time I've read this book and I think I enjoyed even better the second time. A must read for those who just like a good entertaining book."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"It is hilariously funny, a delightful feel good book about life in Botswana. I am sure most people may not even know where Botswana is.Mma \\"Precious\\" Ramotswe had a rotten marriage, lost an infant and then her father, disasters which could send any one to an asylum. But she rebounds and instead of getting a routine job or opt for a run of the mill business, opens a detective agency in a rural town. She has an office, a secretary, a typewriter and a small white van and is open for business.Holmes and Poirot would be proud of her technique in solving her client's problems. Only characters missing are Dr. Watson and Captain Hastings. Mma Ramotswe ploughs ahead with uncanny insight in solving all her client's foibles, sometimes ending up as a victim of her own making. There is a missing boy caper which meanders through out the book with black magic thrown in for good measure.I wonder why women don't start a similar venture here in the good old USA. It could become a booming business as we have our share of the same problems which M solved in Botswana, missing children, philandering husbands, stolen cars, concerned fathers about their daughters, stolen identities, corrupt officials to name a few."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"\\"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency\\" by Alexander McCall Smith deals with Mma. Ramotswe, who is the only female detective in Botswana. With the money that she received from the sale of her deceased father's cattles, she started the agency despite skepticism from others. Despite the fact that it was unusual for a female to be a detective, Ramotswe was able to solve cases using her intuition, creativity as well as intelligence. Her cases are usually small such as finding a kidnapped boy, uncovering a bogus father, etc.This is a light read and rather enjoyable as the author brings his readers through the different cases and the creativity that Ramotswe used to solve the mysteries. The heroine is extremely likeable and has a great sense of humor. In addition, the author was able to bring in bits and pieces of Ramotswe's past which I find very informative and interesting as it shaped Ramotswe to become the strong person that she is. I highly recommend this book for anyone seeking a relaxing and fun read."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"This book was simple and uncomplicated and showed earthy wisdom and a great love of Africa and its people. But I obviously didn't find it as fascinating as others. While I read the book in short order, I certainly wouldn't call it a page turner. There was no real suspense to hold my interest. While it was a decent read, it definitely will not be the most memorable book I've come across. Use it for change of pace reading."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"The Republic of Botswana is located in Southern Africa, nestled between South Africa, Namibia, Zimbabwe and Zambia. The largest exporter of gemstone diamonds in the world, Botswana is democratically ruled and has some of Africa's last great wildernesses including the famous Okavango Swamps and the Kalahari desert. The country's latest claim to fame is \\"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency\\" whose owner, and our protagonist, Precious Ramotswe, is its only female detective - perhaps the only one in all of Africa - thus the agency's name.The delightfully cunning Mma. Ramotswe inherited a herd of cattle from her beloved father. She then sold the cattle and used the money to start her agency in Gaborone. Uncertain of her success as a female entrepreneurial sleuth, she was met with skepticism from all sides. \\"Can women be detectives?\\" asked the bank's lawyer. Her only capital assets are a tiny white van, two desks, two chairs, a telephone, an old typewriter, a teapot, and three teacups. Oh! And she owns the sign outside her office, which reads, \\"THE NO. 1 LADIES DETECTIVE AGENCY. FOR ALL CONFIDENTIAL MATTERS AND ENQUIRIES. SATISFACTION GUARANTEED FOR ALL PARTIES. UNDER PERSONAL MANAGEMENT.\\"Precious Ramotswe, however, does have the \\"Right Stuff.\\" Her most valuable assets are intangible, but I'd take them to the bank any day. She is extremely intelligent, with outstanding intuitive capabilities (that sounds professional!). Possessing a keen perception of the human character, along with perseverance, and a strong set of values, she inspires trust in most all who meet her. She is also good woman with a kind heart. Most inspiring is her deep and abiding love for Africa, and for Botswana and its people in particular. \\"They are my people, my brothers and sisters. It is my duty to help them to solve the mysteries of their lives. That is what I am called to do.\\"This is not an ordinary crime novel/police procedural. Nor is it an edge-of-your-seat mystery thriller. Yes, Mma. Ramotswe is a private detective, but she manages to solve mysteries without the use of guns and violence, for the most part, preferring to use unorthodox solutions instead. Her cases may be small but they deal with issues important to people's lives, and some of them are extremely thought-provoking and emotional. A sinister event comes to her attention when a young boy goes missing. Mma. Romotswe will have to confront one of her country's most fearful traditions - the use of human bones to make powerful medicine.The narrative is written simply, in a clear, uncluttered style. And our Number One Detective is a pure delight, as are the people she deals with, and their everyday problems which she helps them resolve. The details of Mma. Ramotswe's background, her life before she began detecting, are intense and absorbing. The novel is enchanting and I am captivated by Precious Ramotswe. \\"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency\\" received two Booker Judges' Special Recommendations and was voted one of the International Books of the Year and the Millennium by the Times Literary Supplement. This is the first book in a series.JANA"},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"What a lovely book this is!I read it in 3 hours, simply could not put it down.

The characters are well defined and the situations are believable, the Botswana backgrounds take you there. I certainly look forward to reading more from the author."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"Listening to the sounds of Africa, he looked at her in the darkness, at this woman who was everything to him--mother, Africa, wisdom, understanding. Mma Ramotswe, the first lady detective in her village, is all of this and more. This story tells us of the white sky across the endless bush and what it means to say O Botswana, my country, my place. I read this book not because of its recent popularity, and the fact that it is being made into a film for HBO, but because I want to go to Africa. This tale gave me what I believe is an authentic slice of African life in a small village with one foot in the 21st century. Superb, masterful writing provides insights into a culture experiencing growing pains, but rooted in the red soil of Africa. McCall Smith made me want to know, the vast plains beneath huge orange sun and the woof and snort of wild things that go bump in the night, but it also brought me closer to the people who call this dry land home.Linda Ballou"},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"Like many others, I refuse to call this a mystery or detective novel. Botswana is indeed the success story of Africa. Blessed with money (diamonds) plus enlightened, honest leadership, Botswana is slowly moving into the modern world in a way the rest of Africa can only envy. McCall Smith has presented us with a wonderful portrait of a calm and dignified people, in the person of Precious Ramotswe and her friends. The stories of crimes solved are clever, sometimes end with a twist, and are utterly charming. And McCall Smith is a wonderful writer--I almost cried at the end over the beautiful scene with Precious and her friend J.L.B. Matekoni, and he manages to bring this dusty beautiful land (which I have visited) to life. I certainly plan to read more in the series, and can only hope they live up to the wonderful promise of the first."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"I have read every book in this series and I LOVE them all.

Read it and you too will crave this tea...I promise*************"},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"\\"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency\\" is the perfect sort of book to spend a relaxing summer afternoon with... It's charming, it's simple, it's beautifully descriptive and it's has the kinds of characters you'll gladly read about again and again. I know I will. I absolutely loved this book, read it quickly, not wanting to put it down and look forward to reading all the rest promptly...Precious Ramotswe is an independent young woman who, after coming into a tidy sum of money, has decided to open up the first female-owned detective agency in Botswana. She slowly begins her jobs as the first lady detective with cases that involve looking for a missing husband, keeping an eye on a sneaky daughter, unraveling an insurance fraud case and the unusual case of a missing 11-year old boy who may have been kidnapped and murdered for witchcraft purposes...But nefarious schemes aren't all this book is about. It's full of rich, descriptive landscaping tales that bring you to Botswana, perhaps like me for the first time, and make you feel as at home as Precious does. There's also the back stories and history of the characters that makes you feel a kinship to them by the time you reach the end...If what you're looking for is a warm, inviting book, that will please both your senses and your mind, this is worth checking out."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"After hearing rave reviews from friends and acquaintances about this series, I bought the paperback of the first book. I thought the series would be like Murder, She Wrote in Africa. Boy, was I wrong. This book has a charm that is all its own. Instead of having the entire story revolve around one mystery or plot, it has vignettes of mystery and intrigue. Much of the beginning of the novel is narrative background material. At first, this confused and bored me, but then I embraced the meandering story and realized that this is not an intense series about mysteries being solved, but instead a series about a strong woman who interacts with her community and solves mysteries. Once I realized the difference, I enjoyed the rest of the book completely.The cover has a matte texture, but doesn't pick up dirt as easily as I'd expect. This is good since I like paperbacks for dropping in my purse for reading on a train ride or unexpected wait."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"Upper Skagit Book Club Review#1 Ladies Detective Agency by Alexander McCall SmithA mystery novel set in Africa? What is this?! Move over Agatha. Here comes Mma Precious Ramotswe! Oh, but this book is so much more than a mystery. This book has drama, romance, mystery, political insights, and, well, it just makes you feel good. How is that for a winter rain buster?The main character, Mma Precious Ramotswe enchants and delights the reader from the very first page. Precious is a big, size 22 woman that loves her country and loves to help people solve their everyday problems. Her homeland is Botswana. Precious is a woman before her time who decides to go against any conventional notion of what an unmarried woman should do, and spends the money she received from selling her late father's cattle to set up a Ladies' Detective Agency. Once the clients start showing up on her doorstep, Precious enjoys a pleasingly successful series of cases. The mysteries that Precious have been hired to solve make wonderful vignettes that keep the reader turning the pages.Our Upper Skagit Book Club found this the type of book that you just couldn't put down. We loved the way \\"the author uses such sparing words to describe the characters, but the words he chose really hit home.\\" You will remember these characters and the landscape of Botswana years after you have read this little book. That is just how memorable this writer's story is!

I could relate to the names of places in this book having been in Gaborone, Botswana a few times.

A REALLY GOOD read."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"What a charming book! It had been on my to-read list for some time, and I regret that it took me so long to get to. Precious Ramotswe is a clever, plucky woman in her 30s who decides to open a detective agency -- the only such agency run by women -- in her native country of Botswana. Although business is initially slow, the locals soon warm up to the idea and Mma Ramotswe takes on cases ranging from missing husbands and stolen cars to false fathers and fraudulent doctors.Getting to know Mma Ramotswe is a hoot, as is meeting her friends and clients. Throughout it all, Botswana's beauty and charm subtly take center stage."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"I love this leading lady and further enjoyed discussing this in our library sponsored book club whilst we drank African Red Bush Tea; one from our circle checked out the rest in this heartfelt mystery series!My poem says what I felt upon completing this inspired reading experience which highlights its precious moments:A Lady Detective in Botswana Enjoys Her Meal:All around me desert, sinking sandAnd mamba snakesA bite to die forThere In the midst of waterlessnessI stir my soupWomen beaten in attemptsTo dissolve their omniscientPower knowing the painAnd its strange bounty,I sip my pumpkin supper.Tomorrow will find meSearching for lost youthIn the heart of darknessThis woman will make marauders wiltFor now I sit and listen to the night."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"I never would have ''read'' this novel; listening to it however is something else again. It makes for a wonderful audio book. It is the story (or stories) of the main heroine and her family and friends with the occasional detecitve story mixed in for good measure. The ''msytery'' element does keep you guessing. It is greatly enjoyable to hear the background stories of Ma Ramotswe and her life in Africa. I purchased the 2nd volume before even finishing the first and a coworker is hooked on this sereies as well....she bought the other CDS so now we can share! Very enjoyable audio experience and the narrator has a mellow, rich voice that is very easy to listen too and adds alot of character to the telling of the tales. Highly recommend this series."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"The simple rythym of this gentle story transported me back to the arms of southern Africa, whose embrace I am still firmly locked in despite having left for foreign shores over a decade ago. The idiosyncrasies of life for Precious Ramotswe had a smile on my face that lasted the entire duration of the book. It is an easy, although possibly hauntingly nostalgic read, and revealed enormous wit and talent on behalf on a very astute yet unassuming author."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"The book is a series of stories of a dear African Lady who happens to be a detective. Some of them are funny, some of them grim, but overall the books are so uplifting. The author loves Botswana and its people and makes you feel that way too.The books took me to a simpler, kinder place."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"I don't know why I was drawn to this book, but I was. A book that took place in Africa about a Ladies Detective Agency? I thought it would be okay at best. NO! It was simply great, as were all the books in the series that came after it.Alexander McCall Smith just made Botswana come alive for me and the characters...I just wanted to follow them through each and every book. What a tribute to the author to make a simple subject so thouroughly engaging. He knows and loves Bostwana and its people. He made me love them too."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"My mother in law turned me on to these books. I read the first one in a day and went to the library for the rest. I am dying to know what Bush Tea is like. I loved the simplicity and honesty of Botswana. I'd love this whole series to be on PBS or a movie. And the main character had better be a 'traditionally built' Botswanan woman! It's fun and entertaining to read. I love these characters."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"I love listening to Ms. Lecat's beautiful reading of these books. And Alexander McCall Smith reminds me of Trollope in his ability to convey human foibles and the subtlest shades of human relationships -- often by what he leaves out as well as what he includes. The cadences of the African accents, so perfectly rendered, sing in my head all day. (Lecat comes closest to perfection of any non-American I've ever heard when she imitates an American, so I assume her other imitations are at least as fine.) A real joy!"},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"While I thoroughly enjoyed this book and I don't understand the reason why people have praised it to the skies. It is a simple good book and has all the elements in it that make it a fun read. It is well written, and you really get a true feel for all the characters in the book. The mysteries are interesting and are a joy to watch unfold. Another great part of the book is the way the author weaves the african culture into the book without it being very in-your-face. The book also kind of reminded me of \\"things fall apart\\"... same kind of tone of writing making it easy to read, yet driving home a point. Once again, like I said I really did enjoy the book, but may had a little more if it wasn't for all the hype surrounding it. Am giving it 4 stars and not 5, just for that."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"My mother-in-law gave me this book for Christmas one year.

The difficulty lies in pronunciation of the South African names. There is no pronunciation guide - that would help a lot! Nevertheless, I look forward to reading more books by Alexander McCall Smith."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"Alexander McCall Smith's \\"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency\\" is an entrancing work of fiction. Smith's lively prose and witty humour is set in a rich backdrop of exotic Gaborone and the Kalahari, replete with witchcraft and crocodiles, missing daughters and philandering husbands all flowing to the rhythms of Botswanan life. But the most endearing is the character of generously proportioned Precious Ramotswe, of traditional build as she puts it. Mma Ramotswe is human in her uncertainties and self-doubts and has a background and skills quite unlike any other fictional detective. She isn't Miss Marple, but her canny intuition, warmth and unreserved wit has created a character which already has contributed more to tourism in Botswana than the tourism promotion efforts of the local government.When her father dies, Precious Ramotswe sells the hundred and eighty cattle she inherits and sets up as Botswana's only female private detective. The beginning is tough but as she solves her cases in her own unique manner, her reputation spreads and cases start coming in. There's no single big mystery that runs throughout the book, but rather a variety of small cases: a wayward teenager daughter, a missing husband, a strangely behaving doctor and a kidnapped boy. The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency is the first of eight books about Mma Ramotswe.Greatly recommended reading for its heart-warming quality and natural wisdom."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"It's hard to explain this series to someone. I just tell them it's about life and understanding people and their behavior, which Precious does instinctually. She's a thoughtful, caring, discerning individual and the reader can't help but fall in love with her. The most wonderful thing about this book and the series, besides being a great read, is that anyone can read it from youth to adults of any age. There's something there for everyone. Hats off to Alexander McCall Smith for writing something that stretches across such a wide audience."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"This book is the first book I have read with the setting being in Africa.

From a trip through the diamond mines, where our heroine's father once worked, to some unique (bodyless) crimes, which Precious solves with no shots fired, this amusing and perspicacious book will not disappoint!

At the time, I thought, hmm, not my cup of tea and I put it on my shelf and forgot about it. Last weekend however, en route to the pool, I was looking for something to read, so I picked it up and started to read it. WHAT A WONDERFUL SURPRISE! I so enjoyed this book, I read it in a day. I am originally South African so for me it had that extra dimension of home. Precious is a wonderful character and she really comes to life, as do the other characters. The author captures Africa beautifully and left me feeling really homesick. I just finished the second edition and loved it too, and just bought the next two! I cannot recommend these books highly enough - I am also really pleased to see that non-African audiences have loved the book - I would have thought that it would not appeal to Americans, but I'm glad I was wrong."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"I really can't think of anything bad to say about this novel. The heroine is extremely likable, the descriptions of Botswana beautiful, and the tales of Mma Ramtowse's cases light-hearted and entertaining. I enjoyed the stories of the wayward Indian daughter, the husband eaten by the crocodile, and the philandering twins.The only thing about this story was that I forgot it as soon as I finished it. Nothing much there really stayed with me. Even the &quot;big&quot; case involving the boy abducted by witch doctors didn't have much substance. Sweet, yes, but not much meat. Overall, I recommend this book to anyone looking for a pleasant escape--and that's not a bad thing."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"I love this book. It is simple story telling about a sagacious African woman with a wonderful heart and spirit. Great summer reading."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"An omnivorous consumer of gentle detective/mystery books, I find the popularity of this series inexplicable. I have read a few, tried to enjoy them, and in the end, put the book down as puzzled as when I started.The writing is inoffensive (which is in this illiterate age quite an achievement), the detective acceptably eccentric yet just like us, and we can all feel suitably broadminded by reading something set in a part of the world that usually only appears in the bloody bits of the news.Perhaps it is just too much cleaned and comfortable exotic, perhaps the whole middle-class-white-male writing from black-female-poor perspective (do they take the same frock size even?)annoys me, perhaps it is the use of the ludicrous archaism \\"lady,\\" perhaps it is all the glowing reviews from the \\"I don't normally read detective novels/fiction\\" people (if they don't, how do they know these are any good? they've never read any others), and I am prepared to admit it may just be me, but the greatest mystery about these books is their popularity."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"After reading the first chapter I thought what a delightful, but simply written, little book. Then it began to take on more complexities, a fleshing out of characters, and kept me well entertained to the end.This story takes place in Botswana, Africa. After Mma Ramotswe's father died, she used the proceeds from the sale of his estate of 180 head of cattle to open a detective agency. Although she had no training in this field she had lots of common sense and could bring about satisfactory closures to the various problems. This is a book to read over and over. But, the author wrote five more books that follow this one and I look forward to also reading those."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"Mma Ramotswe is the perfect heroine in this charming book. Blessed not with great height but with \\"ample girth,\\" she kills a crocodile with one superbly placed shot, she cuts a cobra in half, and she solves all sorts of intriguing mysteries. All the while, we're treated to tidbits about the Great Questions of Life, such as whether Pumpkin gives one a reason for going on, or just many times per day Men think about Sex.Yes, Precious Ramotswe is the only detective in her detective agency, in Gaborone, Botswana. And when she tells her devoted father than she's going to set up a detective agency, he dies on the spot! But it all works out for the best in this wonderful book, which I highly recommend."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"An endearing story. The protagonist, Precious Ramotswe, is the owner of the only Ladies' Detective Agency in all of Botswana. While she tries her best to deliver exemplary service, she sometimes falls a little short of the mark. Her sometimes bumbling investigatory tactics, however, make her one of the most affable characters I've met in quite some time. Her cases are varied and her \\"hunches\\" lead her to solve several cases - like the woman whose husband went missing. On a hunch, Mma Ramotswe decides to wrestle and kill an alligator to determine if the contents of its stomach includes any belongings from the missing man. Incredible technique, but it worked for her!This story was a quick read and has prompted me to read more in Alexander McCall Smith's series. I would recommend the book for light reading that is different, creative and quite entertaining."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book! It was touching, warm and kept you interested in the fate of each character. Its a perfect Sunday afternoon read."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"The No. 1 Ladies Detective Agency is the delightful first story of Precious Ramotswe, a single woman in Botswana who opens a detective agency and is immediately besieged with calls for help. Precious helps a woman to find her husband, shows another that a man is really just after her money, and tries to determine if someone has been the victim of witchdoctors. Precious is a likable character, and I think it is her warmth that makes the book work so well. She was once, at a much younger age, the victim of bad judgment herself, when she got married too quickly to the wrong man. Precious now has the attentions of a few men who aren't so sure she should stay single.This is a fun, quick read - a delightful story."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"I agree with what everyone else says about this book and the others in the series. Anyone can write about a mystery in New York or Miami or London. However, to take the readers to Botswana, where most of us have never been, and bring the place to life with a marvelous character is truly unique. Mr. McCall Smith is able to communicate beautifully the setting for the story in such a way to bring it all to life. His development of the stories and characters is excellent, making you want to keep on reading his books. I'm sure many of his other works are just as wonderful, I think I will just have to read them too!"},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"This review is more for the whole series than for the first book itself.If you're looking for something light, entertaining, and well-written, this is the series for you. The books are short, and the stories and characters are easy to follow and remember.Flaws I find in the series include a tad too much melodrama and one-sided villians.Check these out from the library and read 'em all in one day. You'll be sad to leave Africa."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"This book shows the mysteries of Mma Ramotske, an African detective. She solves case after case of fellow villagers. These cases involve a man who's accused of stealing a car, a daughter who might be involved in a relationship, and a mysterious disappearance of an 11-year old boy.Although the story was enjoyable, I thought it was very low on plotline. It just switches from case to case. The book might have been better if each case was a short story and had its own chapter.Otherwise, if you enjoy reading mysteries, you may like this book."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"I read this book in 2 days, maybe a day and half! :)I barely know how to describe this book.

I feel as though he has tucked me into bed and is telling me this wonderful story, and I can see the landscapes he describes, and the sweat that drips off of Mma Ramotswe's forehead. It is beautifully written, funny, insightful and just a pleasure to read. I can't wait to start the next one! And the next one!..."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"Just a great book about everything and nothing!

Didn't want it to end. It's a quick read. I was enjoying the book so much that about 1/3 of the way through it I went out and bought the other three in the series. (they all read as independent books, though - you don't need to have read one to read the others). Loaned this to my mom - she was clamoring for the other three books by about halfway through the first one. Big big thumbs up!"},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"Political upheaval, false appearances, and a variety of complicated parental and male/female relationships are expertly crafted into the plot of Alexander McCall Smith?s, The No. 1 Ladies Detective. Alexander McCall Smith places Precious Ramotswe in an environment that responds suspiciously towards women who reject the culturally accepted maternal role. Precious is presented as a successful detective not because of her educational background but instead because of her intuition, common sense, and easy was of interacting with people. Precious Ramotswe handles clients and criminals effectively using a light and sometimes comical manner. Through her work, she enables herself and other women to question their role as women in this society and within the traditional family structure. Precious helps support several of her clients as they stand up to tyrannical male figures. Ramotswe appears most entertaining when interacting with more traditional male characters. Her understanding of the traditional male view of her life and their assumptions of her intelligence allow her to create situations in which the male characters demonstrate their own stupidity. Precious Ramotswe?s life and role in the novel allow her to witness and explore a variety of relationships between male and female characters. Ramotswe seems most admirable for her personal strength and her knowledge of what she wants from her own relationships. These characteristics identify her as a powerful figure who is capable of setting her own guidelines concerning her role in this community and in her intimate relationships."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"Like others who reviewed this book, I picked it up because it's been so popular. One sees it everywhere in bookstores. Also like others, I hesitated to buy it because the most popular novels are rarely that good. Unfortunately, that is the case here. First, it's not really a novel. It's a series of stories and vignettes strung together by the underlying theme of Precious Ramotswe who spends her legacy from her father by starting The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency. In Africa no less, where patriarchy is the order of the day.In many ways Mma Ramotswe is an interesting person and if any of the characters she meets were better developed, they would be interesting too. The dialogue is what sort of stops one in their tracks. Simple, childlike, pleasant, etc., and boring. That and the childlike people who make up most of the characters, make this book condescending and more of a children's book than an adult read. Some of the crimes are brutal and nasty -- like the boy who is snatched from a road at night -- but the perpetrators are by and large not punished or even revealed to authorities.Almost worse than any of the foregoing, Mma Ramotswe is never wrong. She never makes a mistake. Even her little white van keeps running in spite of the roads she takes. (Plus it never has to be filled with gas.) I wanted to like this book and as I started reading I wanted to Like the main character. I just couldn't find any of it believable. Too bad. The premise is an interesting one. The locale could be wonderfully explored. It is a quick read, requiring little thought or contemplation, but reading old Agatha Christie mysteries is more fun."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"I read this book with eager anticipation. It had been of the best seller list with great reviews. I was dissappointed, the story was slow and the plot simple."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"This is a story of a strong pioneering African woman who becomes a detective. Not unlike method actors Mr. McCall Smith has tried, successfully, to write a book through an African eye. What might be mistaken as simplicity in his writing is, to my opinion, an understanding of how people think and behave, of their priorities and beliefs. Colorful and decent characters, clever cases to be solved by the delightful Mrs. Ramotswe and a bit of romance make this book one of the best I've read this year."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"The No.1 Ladies Detective Agency is the first story in a series of mystery novels about Mme. Ramotswe and the detective agency that she opens with the money left to her by her dying father. The catch here, if you hadn't noticed from the title, is that she is a woman, and not only that, the first woman detective in all of Botswana. If you missed that intricate plot detail, never fear, the main character will remind you of it during the course of the story. Again, and again, and again....I debated between one and two stars for this one. It wasn't a total waste. It had some charm to it... some. In the end I give it one star simply because I had much higher expectations for it, and it was a let down. Wow, and what a let down it was! I honestly really thought I would enjoy it. I was interested in the mystery aspect of it. I like a good mystery novel. I have a fascination with Africa, and being set in Africa, I was thinking \\"this looks like a winner.\\"One of the main problems I had with is was the way in which the dialog of the characters was written. Another reviewer described it as \\"baby talk\\", and really, I can't think of any better way to describe it. I keep trying to come up with reasons for why it was written in this manner, but none of them make any sense to me. It just makes the characters come across as stupid, as though African people are incapable of using any words longer than five letters long or expressing themselves with any sort of eloquence what-so-ever.There's also the plot. Mme. Ramotswe solves several cases throughout the story with a certain finesse of Inspector Gadget. SPOILER ALERT! There is the case of the missing Christian husband, who Ramotswe is convinced has run away with another woman (\\"Men are stupid, LOLZ!!!1\\" is a major theme of the book). Turns out he was swallowed whole by a crocodile. Of course! There's the case of the 16 year old girl, who actually outsmarts Ramotswe. The girl is actually the only character in this book that I liked. There's the doctor with seemingly inconsistent talent. Like a plot twist straight out of a daytime soap opera, it turns out he has an identical twin brother who is getting to substitute for him in hospitals so he can hold down two jobs and earn twice the money. Wow! That makes so much sense... wouldn't he spend twice as much since he has to have two places to live? Other than that, I'm sure this is totally probable. And then there is the heart breaking case of a missing boy which challenges Ramotswe the most, and puts her in the most danger... or so says the back cover of the book. Allow me to paraphrase this climax of the book for you:Ramotswe: Your husband murdered a boy for Muti!Witchdoctor's Wife: Not he didn't. The boy is living on a cattle ranch.Ramotswe: Show me.Wife: Okay(drives to ranch)Ramotswe: Are you the boy who was kidnapped from the school teacher.Boy: YesRamotswe: Okay, I'm taking you home now.(drives to the boys house and drops him off)Seriously, if you blink, you might miss this climatic ending. I have watched episodes of Scooby Doo with more drama and suspense.In conclusion. Don't read it. Really, just don't waste your time. The No. 1 Detective Agency furthers my belief that it is now possible for anyone to get a book published.The End."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"This is a very pleasant collection of detective stories, each with a twist at the end which is what you would expect of the genre.It is also an introduction to Botswana and some of its people which is both interesting and entertaining.

The characters are so interesting. And the events that happen really held my interest. I loved the stories of Precious starting her Detective Agency and the people who she takes on as clients and helps.

Very enjoyable."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"I tired of gory, death-on-the-doorstep-everyday mysteries years ago, so was very happy to find this lovely series. Gently and mindfully written, the stories are funny and endearing, the mysteries gripping. Different, refreshing, and a nice view of another way of life. I've also listened to this book on tape and it's read by just the right person!To enjoy them even more, order some roibos (redbush tea:fruity, non-caffeinated and healthy) to drink while you read them, and share both with friends!"},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"_The No. 1 Ladie's Detective Agency_ is technically speaking, a mystery, as the heroine is a private detective and through the course of the book does solve a number of cases. However, the book is so much more.Smith has managed to not only describe Africa, but to capture its essence - the rythms of daily life, the culture, and nuances of the savannah. Precious Ramotswe, the main character is charming, witty and resourceful, but also serves as an archetype for Africa - a woman who is gradually becoming successful and independent after a troubled past. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"Along with 14 other ladies I have read the series of Number one Lady's Detective Agency by Alexander McCall Smith, as a book club. We read one for each month for the span of 5 months. All of us love the books. The humour as well as the charming use of english in the books, telling the stories, we love it all. These days, we sit wishing that Mr. McCall Smith is writting as fast as we read. The writer is so good in writting that we could see the pictures of Botswena and all the characters in our minds as we read and talk about each book. Certainly this is a series of mystry novels written in a very friendly and entertaining way."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"The book is called, The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency. The author is Alexander McCall Smith. The main character is Precious Ramotswe. She is an independent and strong woman and she starts the detective agency in Gaborone. She is drawn to the profession of helping people with the problems in their lives.Precious Ramotswe is hired to track down a missing husband, a con man and follow a young daughter.

She gets engaged to Mr. J.L.B. Matekoni. She is a very inspiring woman. I strongly encourage anyone who likes detective books or books that teach you something about your life to read this book, or any books of the series."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"My typical reading habits usually steer me clear of the current bestseller list. For the most part I find them overhyped, and patently disappointing. Not so with this refreshing little foray into the engaging world of domestic intrigue that is the detective agency of one Mma Precious Ramotswe. Lovely evocative writing, wonderful characters and a simple yet intriguing story. What more does one want in a bestseller? I was so taken with the first installment that I shall certainly be reading the entire series. 4.5 stars."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"In consideration of the book's title I must admit that I was somewhat suprised and excited when reading the first few chapters because there was a glimpse of the culture of Mme Ramotswe's Africa. We learned about customs and acceptable and unacceptable social practices and those items that are &quot;taboo.&quot; Unfortunately, as the author continues with Mme Ramotswe's journey as a detective I found that the author could have indulged us more with an exploration into the &quot;whys&quot; rather than teasing us with shallow information."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"When you've just waded through a gigantic work of serious history, laden with so many facts that it's a kind of literary Death by Chocolate, you need a change. I thought I'd find it with this tale of a Botswana lady detective and I wasn't mistaken. THE No1 LADIES' DETECTIVE AGENCY is as light as a milkweed seed wafting its way across a fall meadow. You couldn't ask for anything less taxing. Though ostensibly it is a detective novel, following any sort of plot is not too tough to say the least ! It is more a slice of life in the quiet, mildly-prosperous country of Botswana in southern Africa, seldom seen in the headlines because it has avoided murderous dictators, wars, and massacres, not to mention starvation and dire poverty. Mma Ramotswe sets herself up as a private detective. We meet her friends and acquaintances, see inside her house, learn the condition of her little white van, and follow her on her daily rounds as she discovers cheating husbands, embezzling employees, teenage romancers, fake doctors, and missing people. She drinks innumerable mugs of bush tea, politely deflects would-be husbands, and reflects on her own unfortunate marital history. Mma Ramotswe is a nice character, and she eventually solves---without the slightest twist or turn, no guns, no car chases---the only serious crime in the book, a murder or kidnapping case. It is all very lightweight. If this is what you are looking for, you've certainly come to the right place. Your brain will not get out of first gear, but you'll experience some mild enjoyment and be introduced to a society which might be a little too sane to be true. Mr. Smith, the author, should have done a bit more research on Indian names and somebody in the whole editorial process might have noticed that \\"Gandhi\\" does not have an \`h' after the \`G'. Whether or not a white man can assume successfully the character of a black African woman can be left to others to ponder. It's not usually a good idea. But the book definitely pleases if you don't get into \\"hegemonic discourse\\" and the like. Just like bush tea, it will settle you right down."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"I THINK THAT THE NO. 1 LADIES' DETECTIVE AGENCY WAS A COOL BOOK. I LIKED IT BECAUSE THERE WERE MANY CASES THAT SHE SOLVED THAT WERE ACTUALLY REALISTIC. IT SHOWS HER THOUGHTS AND FEELINGS ABOUT THE CASES AND HER LIFE. SHE DEALT WITH MANY PROBLEMS IN HER PAST AND SHE OVERCAME THEM. I THINK SHE IS AN ADULT WHO PEOPLE CAN LOOK UP TO; EVEN THOUGH SHE IS JUST IN THE BOOK. I THINK SHE IS VERY CLEVER THROUGHOUT THE BOOK. SHE MAKES REALLY SMART PLANS I PROBABLY DIDN'T KNOW EXISTED. ANYWAY, I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS BOOK FOR ANYONE WHO LIKES TO BE ENTERTAINED. THIS BOOK IS ALMOST REAL. HOPE YOU ENJOY THE BOOK!"},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"I like this book because it is simply written, has interesting characters, and an uncomplicated plot. The setting, Botswana, and the use of a lady detective, are what make the story stand out. The reader gets a feel for what it is like to live in Botswana. The cases, the main character solves, do not involve elaborate plot twists. There is a simplicity to the book that is refreshing. I recommend it."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"A truly NICE book, what might serve as a definitionof 'heartwarming'. The fact that Ms. Ramotswe is adetective is secondary to the insight the bookprovides into Africa. One of the previous reviewersmentioned that Americans in particular don't have muchof an idea what Africa is like. I am guilty as charged...Any one book (even Micheneresque) would have a hard timeremedying that, but the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agencybooks (collectively) come close. Not only do they conveya non-politicized view of everyday life, they inspirea search for further 'Africana' type material. Mr. Smithwill no doubt have a hard time filling the demand, LoL...."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"Like all of Alexander McCall Smith's books in this series, \\"The No.1 Ladies' Detective Agency\\" captures the \\"feel\\" of life in Africa. So much of the printed material that Westerners come in contact with about countries in Africa has a negative or impersonal focus. The \\"No. 1 Ladie's Detective Agency\\" series gets beneath the politics and the news stories about \\"incidents\\" and poverty and disease to give a sense of the beguiling rhythm and charm and fullness of the daily lives of the ordinary people who make up much of Africa's population. McCall Smith captures all of that through stories that are fun to read and memorable in simple ways. His characters are universally recognizeable and at the same time, quintessentially African. He's a great storyteller.Sherry Norman SybesmaAuthor of \\"Two Weeks in a Land Rover, On Safari in Tanzania\\""},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"A very unusual and fun detective story, it was voted one of the International Books of the Year by the Times Literary Supplement. This is the first novel in Smith's very popular series about Precious Ramotswe, the only female detective in Botswana. There is a warm human element-matriarchal, even-about the tales that combine to make this novel that is unlike most other detective fiction that you'll read. Smith lived in Botswana and there's a real authenticity to the stories about witch doctors, missing husbands and con men. The book is a bit like the sign Precious has outside her office: \\"Satisfaction Guaranteed for all Parties.\\" The good news is that this is an ongoing series, and the fifth story, The Full Cupboard of Life, has just been released."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"A friend lent this book to me and when she briefly told me what it was about I was very sceptical. How wrong I was to think the story and country would hold no interest for me. I truly loved it and what is more I got up off my 'Traditionally built' backside and looked in an Atlas to see exaxtly where Botswana is! How many books make you do that? I have lent this and the three follow up books to my Mum and sister and we have adopted a few of the customs we have read about. 'Ko Ko' we call out when arriving at each others houses. We also ask each other if we slept well. Now, if we could only get hold of some Bush tea we would be well away! Don't laugh just read the books and you'll understand."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"This is not your typical mystery story, but then again Precious Ramotswe is not your typical detective. Rather than recounting her attempts to solve a single overarching mystery story, this book is a collection of vignettes dealing with mysteries both great and small, woven in with the details of daily life in Botswana.Alexander McCall Smith knows Botswana intimately, and the strength of this novel is its tremendous sense of place. Reading this book makes you feel like you have actually visited Botswana, and are sipping a cup of bush tea as Mma Ramtoswe recounts her cases to you.Like Miss Marple, Mma Ramotswe's sleuthing success comes from her observational skills and her tremendous sense of the fundamentals of human character. She sees people as they are, whether they be clever or lazy, greedy or hardworking. The people she meets spring to life with all their virtues and imperfections.The short chapters mean you can read the book in short breaks, making it easy to fit into even the most hectic of schedules.A wonderful change of pace from your typical mystery novel, and a treat not to be missed."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"This book was a light read but an enjoyable one. The story is of Precious Ramotswe, a &quot;traditional&quot; African woman in size but &quot;untraditional&quot; in her ambitions. She opens Botswana's first ladies detective agency. Her character is strong, has high morals and when it comes to the truth she is refreshingly blunt. Her frankness and matter of factness had me laughing out loud sometimes. The book is set up in a way where the first part describes her father's life, her life, and a bit of history on Africa. The rest of the book is set up in a format where it's short chapters on her cases. These aren't suspenseful cases with twists and turns like you would find in a mystery novel, but they are more simple and quickly resolved. This isn't a book were the plot thickens and evolves. It remains pretty constant in its plot, speed, and energy level. I suggest sitting down in the bookstore and reading the first 20 pages. If you enjoy it then you'll enjoy the rest of the book. If you don't enjoy it then don't read it as it doesn't change much throughout the rest of the book. This was a different read than I normally choose but I still enjoyed it. Its perfect summer reading! I will definitely be reading the rest of the series."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"I had a good time reading this book, from page one right up until the end. Written in a simple style that evokes African fable, the book is episodic in construction, offering several different tales from Mma Ramotswe's casebook--tales that emphasize the culture in which she moves and the thoughtways of her fellow citizens with remarkable elegance. This delightful novel is set primarily in Botswana's capital city of Gaborone. This story follows the life of Mma. Precious Ramotswe as she sets up shop as the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency. Colorful, inspiring, and easy to read, this is one book you'll want to recommend to friends. Also try The Bark of the Dogwood, Sam's Letters to Jennifer, and The Five People you Meet in Heaven."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"Mma Precious Ramotswe is not your typical 34 year old Botswanian woman. She has her own house, her own detective agency and has no husband. It is with pleasure that the reader is treated to her world and the beautiful descriptions of her native Africa. Alexander McCall Smith has delivered a series of enjoyable vignettes in which the reader is witness to Mma Ramotswe's common sense and considerable intuition as she solves both large and small matters of mystery for the local community. What makes the pages so enjoyable are the descriptions of the characters, local lands, traditions of the African people and the humor in which the mysteries are solved. It is not often that an author can combine beautiful prose, well developed characters and humor in a simple story that touches the heart. I look forward to reading the sequels."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"This is a quiet, charming look at life in a small village in Botswana through the eyes of its lovely, chubby lady detective.

Nor is it filled with magnificent prose. What this book is on the other hand is a remarkably unique visionary and elegant reworking of the traditional sleuth mystery.This is a slow book in many regards. The pace set by Alexander McCall Smith is one of quiet reflection. The story bounces back and forth through time and thus fleshes out vividly the character of Precious Ramotswe. Other than a few hard-boiled cases like Matthew Scudder, and one or two Agatha Christie descendents like MC Beaton's Agatha Raisin, I can't think of many other characters that rival Ramostwe in depth. You will be sucked right into a wonderful world and I promise, you will find a side of Africa that you might not have been aware of.The story itself here is a little unusual. When I say that, I mean that it is not linear. It does not follow a plot from start to finish in one grand swoop. Instead what you have here are a series of mysteries undertaken and solved by our protagonist. Also, as I said before, liberal remembrances are interlaced. Note that none of the individual mysteries are really very top shelf. The problems are not those of end of the world or even of deathly peril. Instead you are lead down a bumpy road that I think will offer you more satisfaction than you might believe possible."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"This is the first of a series set in Botswana (located immediately north of South Africa) telling the stories of a woman who sets up a detective agency with the money she has inherited from her father.

She has a loving family and safe childhood, growing up to become an independent woman. I have often wondered about Africa, the motherland for all of us. This book provided some insight into its' culture, policies, and values of Africa. Mma Ramotswe was lucky to find home where she lives. Her choice of profession surprises many, but she does succeed. It was surprising to see Mma Ramostwe change her values to do the right thing (in her opinion), and convince others to follow her direction. My favorite story (case) is the teenager, who succeeds in misdirecting both her family and Mma Ramotswe. My saddest story, is her first love and its tragic outcome. I alway believed that having a good father, would protect us from choosing the wrong man. Mma Ramotswe followed her heart instead the of the opinions of family.

I will be hunting for Alexander's other books in the series!"},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"Precious Ramotswe is a comfortable size-22 African lady (none of your Euro/American size 6's for her, thank you very much) with a fund of mother-wit and a penchant for minding other people's business. Having survived a disastrous, abusive marriage and the death of her infant son, she turns a small legacy from her late father, whom she adored, into \\"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency\\", the only one of its kind in Botswana, or maybe in all of Africa. From shaky beginnings with non-paying clients and chauvinistic male attitudes (\\"Who ever heard of a woman detective?\\" demands a border policeman; \\"Haven't you ever heard of Agatha Christie?\\" Mma Ramotswe shoots back, not missing a beat), she builds up a small but solid clientele that brings her problems to solve concerning cheating husbands, wayward daughters, malingering employees trying to commit insurance fraud; and a spectacularly sinister case involving a missing eleven year old boy who may or may not have been murdered for witchcraft purposes. Giving Mma Ramotswe quiet but ever-present moral support, while keeping her old car from falling apart, is Mr. J.L.B. Matekoni, who loves every inch of Mma Ramotswe's ample frame and is patiently waiting for the brick wall of her resistance to marriage to crumble, so she can make him the happiest man on earth.Smith has written an enchanting book that is can be described as a cross between an engaging detective story and a love poem to Africa. Mma Ramotswe is as warm and as solid as the red earth of Botswana; she loves every inch of the Africa she knows and identifies with and wouldn't live anywhere else. She embodies the African traits of deep ties to family and community, concern for one's neighbors, and respect for tradition. She commands respect and she gets it. Smith has added a delightful and enduring creation to the pantheon of famous detectives in fiction. Jane Marple, move over. Or rather, make a separate space for Mma Ramotswe. She deserves a pedestal of her own."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"I highly recommend that you read The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency, by Alexander McCall Smith. The author was born in Africa, taught law at University of Botswana and is a professor of medical law at Edinburgh University. I feel confident he draws a realistic picture of life in Botswana. It is one of the emerging African nations, a landlocked country about the size of Texas, located just above South Africa. The Kalahari is right next-door.The author writes about Africa as seen through the loving eyes of Mma Precious Ramotswe, who establishes the first detective agency in Botswana. This is a business she feels will fill a need in the community because people are always wanting to know something.Mma Ramotswe is proud of her country, proud of the first President of her country even though no one remembers him now. Mma Ramotswe is about 35 years old when we meet her--a very likeable woman in control of her life. She is a fine figure of an African woman, not one of these skinny sticks of girls you see nowadays (in her words).The clients who come to her agency each have a story of his or her own. They are told in a simple and direct way and are all the more powerful for their simplicity. For instance: an old man shows up claiming to be a woman's long lost Daddy. She would care for him and gladly give him a home, as is her duty-if he really is her Daddy. Mma Ramotswe is hired to find out. You'll have to read the book to find out for yourself!She had been married when she was young, but the man was gone now, leaving nothing but pain behind. She has no dearth of suitors now, but she is an independent woman with a business, and thinks she does not need a husband.Mr. J.L.B. Matekoni, a good man and owner-operator of Tlokweng Road Speedy Motors, is one of her many admirers. He wants to marry her. Mr. J.L.B. Matekoni says, &quot;Yes, a country needs Government men, it needs doctors and nurses and teachers. But it also needs mechanics for the cars of these important people.&quot; He visits the local orphanage to keep its water pump in good working order and tune up or repair its vehicle.The stories told in this little book are at once shocking and familiar. They are stories of human nature. It is easy to find similarities to her stories in our own lives. These are good people and their stories will draw you right in."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"&quot;No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency,&quot; introduces the reader to &quot;Precious Ramotswe, citizen of Botswana, daughter of Obed Ramotswe who died because he had been a miner and could no longer breathe.&quot; Instead of calling her Precious Ramotswe, everyone commonly addresses the story's heroine as Mma. Ramotswe.We read about Mma. Ramotswe life growing up and that of her father who worked as a miner and later became a prosperous cattle owner. When her father passes away, being the only child, Mma. Ramostswe becomes the recipient of a sizable amount of money. She decides to use the funds to establish what will become the first detective agency in Botswana (in the southern part of Africa). This decision will make her &quot;the first and only lady private detective in the whole of Botswana...&quot; When others scoff at or try to dissuade her about the idea of female detective, Mma. Ramotswe deftly points to the well-known mystery writer, Agatha Christie who solved many mysteries through popular characters such as Hercule Poirot and Miss Jane Marple.This portly, intelligent and amusing woman is an unlikely character, in an unlikely setting - Africa. But why not? There are mysteries to be solved everywhere and by anyone.Mma. Ramotswe's cases are amusing - they range from imposters, missing husbands, lost children, to stolen property and more. What is interesting is the way the premier lady detective solves her cases and handles herself in particular situations and with others.Author Alexander Mc Call Smith, who is also a law professor, was born in Zimbabwe (southern part of Africa) and educated in that country as well as in Scotland. He successfully captures the true essence, mannerisms, greetings and culture of Africa and its characters that are proud to come from that continent.In addition to Botswana and South Africa, other countries such as Ghana, Nigeria (countries in West Africa), Lesotho, Mozambique, and Malawi (countries in the southern part of Africa, not to be confused with South Africa) are mentioned as well. If you are unaware of these countries, it is a nice learning experience.After reading &quot;The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency,&quot; you'll feel as if you've been to Botswana and solved a few cases, yourself! Read it, you'll enjoy it!Fafa Demasio"},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"An absolutely wonderful start to what is hopefully is a long-running detective series set in modern Botswana. This fast-reading book isn't so much a set piece mystery as it is the story of an African woman in her late thirties who stakes her entire inheritance on the crazy idea of becoming the country's first woman private detective. Precious Ramotswe is a intelligent &quot;traditionally built&quot; woman with a keen sense of human nature and a desire to help people in distress. This book tells of her childhood, her loving miner father, an ill-considered marriage to a trumpeter, her strong belief in her own abilities, and skeptical take on the forces of progress and modernization. This volume contains her first cases, which she adroitly solves with the assistance of her expert typist secretary and the local master mechanic, Mr. J.L.B. Matekoni.But the book is not just about her, but also aims to portray a positive picture of modern Africa, one all too rarely seen in the West. The cases often intertwine with issues such as development, social structures, power, and gender, but in a disarmingly light and gentle way. Among her tasks are to find a missing husband, investigate a doctor, follow a teenage girl, and find a missing boy who may have been kidnapped by a witch doctor. None of these are particularly convoluted, and Precious's greatest difficulty often lies in determining exactly what to tell her client in order to effect the best result for all concerned and achieve cosmic justice. The stories are delivered in a delightfully fluid and simple prose with pacing that makes the book quite difficult to put down.The series thankfully continues with Tears of the Giraffe and The Kalahari Typing School For Men, with further volumes to follow one hopes."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"A far cry from the fast paced, violent nature of the Walter Mosely mysteries, Alexander McCall Smith's The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency opens on the doorstep of a calm, warm afternoon in Botswana, Africa, with Precious Ramotswe sipping tea on the porch of the detective agency that she opened with the money from the inheritance bequeathed to her by her beloved father. She lives a difficult life, facing the loss of her mother at an early age, betrayal by her husband, the death of her child, and the death of her father.Initially the townspeople are skeptical of her agency because of her gender, but she repeatedly proves that her wisdom and her instincts are invaluable to the successful resolution of cases dealing with various types of charlatans, disappearances, and crimes. Through the pure, limpid quality of straightforward storytelling, we see that she becomes a community confidante, a \\"fixer of lives\\" conducting herself with dignity and grace, yet doing what she must do to put those lives back together when they fall to pieces.On a continent faced with impending changes due to exposure to the modernity of the western world, Mma Ramotswe represents a passionate tribute to the beauty of the old Africa, recording the \\"unrecorded voices\\" of those who still follow the old traditions and reminding us that, when thought gets you nowhere, you still have to eat your pumpkin."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"In Precious Ramotswe, Alexander McCall Smith creates a beguiling character. Precious is a detective, the first female detective in Botswana and owner of the No 1 Ladies' Detective Agency.Precious is a middle aged woman with a prominent posterior, whose self image and poetic praise of the simple things in life - like a dish of cooked pumpkin - are arresting to a reader surrounded by urban materialism and Western notions of attractiveness.Through Precious, the reader is willingly enticed into a love affair with the landscape and values and people of Botswana.But Precious is far from a simple woman. The stories about the tragic life of her beloved father, her own disastrous marriage and move into the detective business are all enlivened by her capacity to find lessons from each painful experience.It therefore comes as no surprise that she is a very successful detective. Helped along by her handy and hilarious &quot;how to&quot; text, her undeniable intellect and talent for nosiness, she is soon finding answers where others have not.There are three books in this series and they are all wonderful. Each left me with a smile on my face and a desire to reread some of Precious' wry observations (favourites include those about the sad weaknesses of men and a number about the inferiority of neighbouring African countries) or her poetic descriptions of the world around her.The mysteries - plus their solutions - are also satisfying."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"This is a lovely, lovely book. It's extremely readable, with deceptively simple prose. If you've ever visited Africa...or just dream of going...this book is for you. Mma Ramotswe is my new hero...a self-described &quot;fat lady detective&quot;...the only one in Botswana. The author's love of this lovely African country and its people is apparent in every lyrical phrase. It's a jewel of a book, and shouldn't be missed."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"The dry, endless land of Botswana is the unlikely backdrop of Alexander McCall Smith's detective novel (the first in a series) and the beloved home of his creative, unorthodox P.I. Precious Ramotswe. The resilient Mma Ramotswe, having survived a brief, abusive marriage, the loss of her child, and the death of her father, sells the cattle she inherits to start the No.1 Ladies' Detective Agency (wryly noted as the only one of its kind in the country) and proceeds to deftly handle a string of seemingly disparate domestic cases before getting caught up in the sinister circumstances surrounding an abducted boy. Smith crafts more than a detective in the character of Precious, however, as Precious defies cultural expectations by being a one- woman community service, a confidante for those who need somehow to reclaim their own lives. The novel subtly presents a landscape of changing cultural and gender roles as well as the tensions that arise between those citizens who honor the traditional African family bonds and those parasites that would give the old traditions a bad name. But Smith's hand isn't heavy, and his humor is like a warm desert breeze. Finally, his work is a vibrant celebration of Africa and those Africans who strive for a good, peaceful life. The heart of the book is contained in the epigrammatic shape:africaafrica africaafrica africa africaafrica africaafricaThe shape of the continent--Precious--Mother Africa--- a good, fat woman!"},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"#1 Ladies Detective Agency surprised me with it's style and strength. It is the story of a very strong woman in Botswana who opens a detective agency. She tells the stories of the cases that she deals with and solves. Reading this book gives you the feeling of sitting around with extended family and listening to a sage old Aunt telling vivid folktales and imparting her wisdom in a humorous and touching way. The style was so different from the books I had been reading that I wasn't sure that I was going to like this book, when suddenly I realize I was entranced by the tale. It is a wonderful book, full of heart and I have already purchased the next one in this series, Tears Of The Giraffe and look forward to reading it next."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"I left Africa at the age of 6, never to return. Until I read this book, my memories were few and far between. What a special thrill then, for the first time in fifty years, to taste fresh sugar cane in my mouth, thanks to Alexander McCall Smith's loving evocation. Sights, long forgotten, the smell of Africa came flooding back, as I raced through the pages of this book.In terms of detective fiction, I am no virgin. Wilkie Collins, Conan Doyle, Christie, Chandler, Hammett, Rankin, Paretsky, Deaver, Cruz Smith et al crowd bulging bookshelves all around the house. How refreshing it was to discover a new and subtle voice. These pages are not littered with corpses, gratuitous violence, car chases or soft pornography. In a lecture last week, I heard Alan Plater say, that in all his years, he had never seen a fight, let alone a crime. Why should he then litter his screen plays with events of which he, and I suspect most of the rest us, had no experience?If you want to experience a vicarious thrill, don't look for it here. There is more than enough mystery in the normal run of life. Precious Ramotswe can get the answers to the questions she needs to ask without the use of a gun or a blackjack. Heroes and heroines don't have to be misfits on the edge. They don't have to be perfect. They can have very simple dreams, yet their stories can still be riveting.It says something about this book that, without all the usual suspects, I still could not put it down until I had finished and that I raced out to buy \`Tears of the Giraffe' as soon as I had."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"I love these books but I must agree that it did take a bit of time to &quot;get into&quot; the first book. It's not really a mystery book as a story about a strong woman using her basic instincts and &quot;smarts&quot; to improve her life. Now I can't put down the books and the character is a real role model for following your own bliss and doing what you really enjoy in life, regardless of your education or background.BTW -- Mma is pronounced &quot;mah&quot;, and rra is similarly pronounced &quot;rar&quot;. Mma means &quot;madame&quot;; Rra means &quot;sir&quot;. There are many good websites online that give more history on Botswana and language."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"I probably wouldn't have read this except that my mother threw this one my way, plus most of my family's read at least this one of the series by Alexander McCall Smith.Mma Ramotswe's detective agency, the only one in the entire country of Botswana in southern Africa, is, (by American standards), short-staffed and sparsely equipped; she's the only detective, her only equipment a phone, her white van, and a typewriter. She has one employee. She purchased her one room office building with inheritance money she received from her father who had been a small-scale cattle rancher.My favorite case which she solves is a scam, commonplace in Botswana, where an elderly man shacks up with a young female pretending to be her long lost father and whose sole objective is to drain her of her time, energy, and finances so long as he abides there.How she obtains her first confession was my first lol, laughing out loud, incident while reading this book."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"Hardcore mystery fans who live for tightly plotted constructions sporting unexpected solutions may be disappointed in THE NO. 1 LADIES' DETECTIVE AGENCY--but what this episodic work lacks in such staple elements of the mystery genre it more than makes up for with character and setting and style. The novel presents us with the episodic adventures of Mma Ramotswe, a large lady of Botswana brimming with commonsense and self-confidence who--with a little reliance on both Agatha Christie and a mail-order &quot;how to&quot; book--converts her beloved father's legacy into a detective agency and quickly makes a name for herself as one of the most astute investigators in the region.Written in a simple style that evokes African fable, the book is episodic in construction, offering several different tales from Mma Ramotswe's casebook--tales that emphasize the culture in which she moves and the thoughtways of her fellow citizens with remarkable elegance. Whether it is tracing a missing husband, investigating a fraudulent insurance claim, or coping with a loathsome witchdoctor, Mma Ramotswe is clever, practical, and remarkably human, and the book has a gentle irony-laced humor that is almost certain to please.The character is easily one of the most memorable created for the mystery genre in a great many years and her presentation is nothing short of completely enjoyable; most readers will feel they'd like to fly to drop in for some of her bush tea and commonsense advice. This is certainly a one-sitting read, the sort of book that you pick up intending to read only a chapter or two and then glance up to find that you've missed your dinner date. Absolutely charming, strongly recommended, and I'm looking forward to reading more of Mme Ramotswe's adventures in the future!GFT, Amazon Reviewer"},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"Reading the blurb with biographical details about author Alexander McCall Smith, it is obvious that he is an extraordinary man. Still, it is a feat that an upper educated Englishman can so clearly inhabit the persona of a poorly educated black woman in Botswana.Readers who are unfamiliar with that country will come away with a much more thorough understanding of place after reading THE NO. 1 LADIES' DETECTIVE AGENCY. Smith's heroine is a middle-aged black woman who cleverly solves the mysteries that visit her town. She uses common sense and shrewd observation to put two and two together and come up with four when others are not even counting. As such, the individual vignettes are deeply satisfying.There is a poignancy to Smith's descriptions, however, of how difficult life is in that corner of Africa, of how its people are so accustomed to their hard lives, and how they take pleasure in such small things.Other issues, more terrible issues, are alluded to in the book. Yet some of these secrets are not completely explored, secrets about slavery and voodoo and human sacrifice. Certainly, discourse on these problems would have ruined the pacing of the separate stories, but it was troubling to see them hinted at nonetheless.Alexander McCall Smith is an author of immense talent."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed the book, The Ladies No. 1 Detective Agency, and couldn't wait to see what Precious Ramotswe was going to become involved in next! I loved her direct approach to solving the &quot;mysteries&quot;. She comes up with an idea, executes it, and solves the mystery with her innate sense of wisdom and common sense.My question to others who have read this book, or to people who may be familiar with Botswana has to do with the titles used in the book. Precious Ramotswe is referred to as Mma or Mme Mma, and later one of the male characters is referred to as Rra. Does anyone know what those titles stand for? The closest I can guess is Mme stands for Madame or Madamoiselle, but I can't figure out Mma, or Rra. Please offer help it you are able.Other than that, I recommend this book for light summer reading for those who enjoy mysteries or for those who don't. The situations that Mma Ramotswe finds herself in are light enough for even the most squeamish. Thoroughly enjoyable!"},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"There is nothing not to like about this little book. It is well written, colorful and unique. From the moment we meet Mma Ramotswe and follow her story from girlhood, through an abusive marriage and into her ambitious foray as the proprietor of the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency, she earns our respect and admiration-just as she shows respect and admiration for everything around her. Alexander McCall Smith captures the character and culture of Gaborone, a village in Botswana, and tells a sweet and entertaining story. I've noticed other reviewers label it a mystery; however, in my opinion it is a series of mysteries--one about a missing boy kidnapped by witch doctors winds through the book, and others unfold in each chapter where new cases are presented to the fledgling agency. A wonderful and charming book, which I highly recommend.Michele Cozzens, Author of A Line Between Friends and The Things I Wish I'd Said."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"Alexander McCall Smith's The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency is a passionate tale of a love affair with Africa alongside a poignant tale of a struggle for gender equality. Precious Ramotswe, a private detective, sets up her first business venture in the African country of Botswana with her inheritance from her father's death. Coupled with Precious' desire to honor her father's cherished memory, this rotund detective is driven to make a solid place for herself in the male-dominated professional world.Social commentary abounds throughout the text through small details. For instance, the success that Precious meets in her detective endeavors stems not from her trusty \\"Detective Guide\\" written by a male but from following her own female intuition. Also, the author's passion and respect for an independently governed Africa shine through as peaceful Botswana is continually juxtaposed with the apartheid-ridden South Africa.Readers will enjoy the adventures and risks that Precious Ramotswe encounters through this fun, unique, and socially challenging first novel of the series."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"A friend gave me this book for Christmas and like her I have now almost read the whole series. The story is simple and an easy read but beyond that there is a depth of innocence and simplicity which almost has a smile behind it more often than not. Alexander McCall Smith's writing reminds me a little of Rudyard Kipling's writing in \\"Just So Stories\\". I find myself sometimes just wanting to read it out loud for the effects of the writing. The story is joyful, positive and interesting, not only from the point of view of the many crimes that Precious Ramotswe has to solve but in how it follows her life, her intuition and her traditional Botswana ways. The innocence and honesty of the characters takes me back to some of Laurens Van Der Post's writing and that echo for me is also a very positive one."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"I read several Amazon reviews of THE NO. 1 LADIES' DETECTIVE AGENCY before picking up a copy myself. It's not often I read a book cover to cover in one sitting, but I couldn't help myself with A.M. Smith's first in this charming series featuring Precious Ramotswe.The biggest plus of the book is the author's descriptions of Precious' life as she sets up her detective agency, after selling livestock left to her by her father. She says that as a young woman, she took a job as a bookkeeper, which showed her she had a knack for figuring not only numbers, but problems in everyday life. Thus the motive for turning her talents to detective work.In this first episode, Precious investigates a man accused of medical fraud, a husband suspected of adultery and another man accused of a horrendous murder. The murder suspect's story was the most disturbing in a book that has an overall playful and cheerful tone. The descriptions are not graphic; rather it is the circumstances of the murder I found unsettling because of the victim's age.Looking very much forward to reading the next books in the series. I do hope Mr. Smith has several more planned beyond the four he has already written."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"Satisfaction Guaranteed for All Parties\\" reads the sign on The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency and so should the cover of the book!

I felt this more to be a fiction story about Africa, with simple mysteries a way of moving plot forward and allowing back story highlighting African history and culture. Still, Precious Ramotswe is a likable character, and fans of Agatha Christie's Miss Marple are likely the readers who drove this book to the top of the National Bestseller lists."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"Well... this book had a good overall story line, but it really wasn't for me. The No. 1 Ladies Detective Agency is about a fat African woman named Mma Ramotswe. She is a very sly lady, considering the fact that she manages to follow her victims around unknowingly in her tiny white van. Throughout the story, she solves many people's mysteries with her logic. In the first half of the book, each chapter has its own uniqueness. It's almost like a bunch of short stories put together. One chapter she's solving one person's problem, and another chapter someone else's problem. As the book progresses, the chapters start to morph together and it actually becomes a fluid story. Because this book is set in Africa, it also has its own writing style. I think it's written in a type of British-English because they spell color with a u (colour) and other words with odd lettering. There's one thing that sticks out a lot in the book as you're reading through the chapters: bush tea! What is with all the bush tea? Every other chapter it seems that either Mma Ramotswe and/or another character is drinking it. One of the reasons that I didn't intensely enjoy this book like other people have is because of the perspective from which it was written. I really didn't get into it! The first chapter was so silly, too. Some lady named Happy needed to find out if the man living with her was really her daddy. Mma Ramotswe did her magic, and the happy returned to Happy. As for my recommendation, I'd say don't read it if you don't like mystery books written from a woman's perspective. This would be a good read for someone that likes odd mystery books, though."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"Hats off to the author for attempting to deviate from the mainline sleuth stories (with protagonist being a gent that is tech savy or a martial art/sharp shooting expert chasing around in expensive cars in a story where atleast a dozen people end up dying).This is quite very different, with a not so attractive single woman running a detective agency solving cases that are simple and almost realistic. The African setting without any of the typical 'gods have left Africa' theme makes it even more interesting. I will definitely be reading few more books in this series.-Santhosh."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"Our book club read and all enjoyed.

You get alot of wonderful descriptions of the people, country, traditions and the history. The mystery part I guess is a few small jobs the agency takes on, and they usually solved rather quickly (and often predictably). I have read 2 of these books so far and found this to be true in both cases. So, I gave it the 3 stars because I think many mystery lovers are like me and want a real mystery to solve. However, as a good fictional read about a country and culture far away from us, I would give it the 5 stars."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"I bought the first three books in this series after reading all of the great reviews.

Since she has suffered through a terrible marriage, and is actually quite intelligent, she decides that rather than continue to grow cattle, she will open up the first ever detective agency run by women in Botswana. So, she buys a home, an office, office furniture, a sign, hires a secretary, and waits for clients to arrive.The book tells the stories of her earliest cases. The very first one involves solving the mystery of a christian convert who seems to have run away from his wife. Another mystery involvest the disappearance of an eleven year old boy; then there is the matter of the doctor who appears to be on drugs or schizophrenic; and on and on. Interleaved amongst all the mysteries, are chapters that describe Precious's life and her troubled marriage.The focus here is not on the mysteries. They are not the point. The point and the focus is on how this woman makes her way amongst her people in Botswana. It is about how she manuevers within her culture and how she applies her people-sense or people-wisdom towards solving thevarious problems. Of course, this sometimes is not enough and you wonder if she was not played the patsy in the story of \\"Jack\\" and another missing husband case.Each story is told with gentle humor and involves no violence. Oh, there are people and animals who are killed, but we only find out about them later, for the most part. This is not a hard core mystery, it is more a celebration of the life of this remarkable woman.Her life evolves too. As we hear the stories of the mysteries she solves, we also become aware of her immediate friends and community. It is not a static community. Although Precious vows to remain a single woman, she ends up agreeing to marry one of the characters who appears in the book. One of the final stories told is about how they choose which house to live in and how Previous handles the groom's housekeeper - in a way, by the way, which is different than anything she had done before.This is the first book in a series that tells of Precious's life. While there is nothing particularly wrong with the book, it is simply not my style, so I will probably not read any more of them."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"Deep within Africa, the traditional figure of a proud Botswanan can be found, sitting behind her typewriter, sipping bush tea. Need a detective? She's the one you want. The No.1 Ladies Detective Agency by Alexander McCall Smith is the story of Precious Ramotswe, the daughter of Obed Ramotswe. Although he died when she was still quite young, he left her a fair amount of money in order to start a business. A business of her choice. Without thought, Mma. Ramotswe quickly and successfully opened a detective agency. Despite the criticism she received about her gender, her firm rapidly became No.1.Precious Ramotswe, born and raised in Botswana, was supported by her father's cousin for the first eight years of her life. Being a loving guardian, the cousin brought up Precious as if she was her own, and she turned out to be an honest, intelligent, somewhat perfect young girl. These traits stuck with Mma. Ramotswe and it appeared impossible for her to make a mistake. Solving all of the cases brought to her with ease, she brings criminals to justice and gains the respect of many in the process.This novel had many strong components. One factor that stood out would definitely be characterization. Through out The No. 1 Ladies Detective Agency, many characters are introduced and become an important part of the story. Instead of throwing them out in the open, Alexander McCall Smith does a fantastic job of developing them over time, in a way the reader can follow and understand them. Their feelings are foreshadowed then unfolded and their traits are beautifully described, until the reader feels as if they know them. By the end of the story, it is impossible to dislike the thoughtful Mma. Ramotswe or loving Mr. J.L.B. Matekoni. Another strength found throughout the pages of this book would be imagery. All and everything is explained with great detail. This makes the novel even more enjoyable to read because the sentences flow beautifully together, putting vivid pictures in the mind. The following sentence is an example of how the author goes about this. \\"Then there were the purple bougainvilleas which had been enthusiastically planted by the previous owners, and which had almost taken over by the time Mma Ramotswe had came\\" (McCall Smith 133). The only weakness that was visible to me would be the beginning of the book. It starts of with a series of flashbacks which were hard to follow and were a little slow to read. Also, the arrangement of the first few chapters was confusing because they were not in a chronological order.The No.1 Ladies Detective Agency would most likely be a book that would appeal more to females. However, it was definitely appropriate for any age above ten. Anyone below that age would probably have a hard time grasping the words and find it hard to stick with. Overall, this novel makes a good read and is definitely worth the time."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"Overall the book was a pretty good detective story and I really enjoyed all the many obstacles Mma. Ramotswe had encountered. The main weakness and the one reason why I gave this book only three stars is that there wasn't really a main point to the whole thing. Normally there is always a purpose the author tries to accomplish in the book, but there wasn't. As the book went along, the main charater had been hired for several different jobs, but the book didn't focus on a specific one. There was a couple of times when I thought that one might be important throughout the book, but ended up not being anything. If the author would've made a specific case end up being a huge part of the book, then I thought that the book would be a five star. Overall, I enjoyed it and it was a easy read if looking for something not so complicated."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"Not a typical mystery but a delightful tale set in Botswana. McCall Smith's writing brings Precious Ramotswe, the head of the detective agency, to life on each page. The supporting characters are also well developed and believable. It is a thoroughly enjoyable book."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"What a great book. It was fun to read, adorable, serious, cultural, yummy. All the things I like to have when I just want to cozy up to a good book. I am anxious to read the other books in the series. I have been recommending it to all my friends. I know it has been out for a while, but I guess better late than never."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"Hysterical, heartwarming book. It made me feel good when I was sick. Get it now! Book in excellent condition."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"I've enjoyed every book in this series set in Botswana - but I must say that this book, the first, is not the strongest or in my opinon the best place to start. I would instead recommend \\"Morality for Beautiful Girls\\", number 3 in the series, or \\"The Kalahari Typing School for Men,\\" number 4. But wherever you start, it's hard not to like these wonderful books."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"What a superb book and series! To categorize this book as a mystery or a detective novel is a misguided attempt at characterizing this novel far too narrowly. Sure, there are little stories within the book which are \\"mysteries\\" but these are merely the background, along with Botswana, on which the larger story is told. Indeed, those readers who read The No 1 Ladies Detective Agency series seeking a detective story may be disappointed, but they will at least have had the literary content of their typical reading raised.This book also isn't \\"simple\\" as some have suggested either. The subleties of human strength and human frailty , honesty and duplicity, love and selfishness, generosity and greed are worked out in the lives Mma Ramotswe and Mr. J L B Matekoni and their clients and friends and offer a far more profoundly insightful glimpse of human relationships than any complex plot twisting thriller. The characters are beautifully drawn, warts and all, and they draw the reader into their world and make the reader feel that they too are there with Mma Ramotswe, drinking red bush tea, and remembering to treat each other and everyone they meet with respect, kindness, grace, tact and dignity."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective AgencyBy Alexander McCall SmithIf you're looking for an engaging, well written book with unpredictable plot twists, than The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency is absolutely perfect for you. This mystery follows the ups and downs of the life of Precious Ramotswe, starting in the present and containing flashbacks to childhood and adolescent years in her country of pride and joy, Botswana. Each memory reveals a tad bit more about the independent and smart personality of Precious Ramotswe, the reason for which she eventually settles down and opens the first detective agency run solely by a woman in all of Botswana. Although slow at first, business catches, like a spark held to gasoline. Throughout unimaginable mini mysteries, including a confused crocodile, an unknown double-identity and a dangerous case involving witch doctors, Precious Ramotswe uses sharp intellect to figure out the absurdly impossible.Out of five stars, I rate The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency a four. This is because though the plot drew you in and left you hanging at each chapter, I feel that even more descriptive words could have been selected at times. Something I can relate to in the book is the fact that Precious is constantly having to put up with the doubts from various men that she, a lady, can run a business. Although I have not encountered this in such an extreme form, the \\"Men are better than woman\\" idea is still relevant at times even in more modern countries such as the U.S. One reason I really enjoyed this book is because I encountered a style of writing which is new to me. I found it very interesting that the author conveyed Precious' past through snippets and small chapters interspersed throughout the book, instead of merely starting at the beginning of Precious' life. This way the past is revealed slowly as opposed to all at once. The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency is a flavorful book that should be added to your repertoire of reading today!"},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"This is almost a genre unto itself. Clearly there is a detective agency and a detective who solves cases. But these are unlike others in the usual mystery repertoire. Although the cases at hand are serious both to the clients and to the detective, the telling of them is light and delightful, short and sweet and a little bit quirky. :-) BUT clearly there is ingenuity at work. Try it; you'll like it!"},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"&quot;Mma Ramotswe had a detective agency in Africa, at the foot of Kgale Hill. These were its assets: a tiny white van, two desks, two chairs, a telephone, and an old typewriter.&quot; So begins Alexander McCall Smith's charming novel, The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency.Precious Ramotswe grew up in Botswana, an African country that has known relative peace compared to its more unlucky neighbors. When her father dies after a hard life as a miner, Precious inherits a decent sum of money left her by him. Mma Ramotswe invests it all in a rather unusual business-a detective agency proudly named &quot;The No.1 Ladies' Detective Agency.&quot;Business is brisk for Mma Ramotswe and she gets right down to it with a trusty &quot;detective manual&quot; by her side. In real life, however, it is not simply bookish knowledge that matters. Ramotswe is a special combination of resource, intelligence, and will. She solves her cases with ample common sense and bravery.Smith's novel, set in the Africa of the 90's, is no hard-boiled thriller. Instead most of Ramotswe's cases depict the many foibles of the human character-cheating husbands, insurance scams and even distrustful fathers. The book's language is wonderfully simple and direct. The individual &quot;mysteries&quot; are good stand-alone short stories in their own right.Interspersed amongst them are pictures of a beautiful country, Botswana, and the quiet grace of its people. Mma Ramotswe's everyday interactions with her fellow citizens are captured wonderfully. Ramotswe meets life with smart sensibilities and a wry sense of humor. She is comfortable in her ample frame (a size 22) and proud of her Africa. She &quot;did not want Africa to change. She did not want her people to become like everybody else, soulless, selfish, forgetful of what it means to be an African, or, worse still, ashamed of Africa.&quot;In a crazed rushed world, Mma Ramotswe stands for everything right about a less frenetic pace of life. In her, McCall Smith has created a perfect embodiment of Africa. Mr. Smith, who has enjoyed some schooling in Zimbabwe but is a Scot himself, has done a great job both in portraying Botswana and in creating a beautiful portrait of a strong woman. I enjoyed the trip immensely. The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency is just the right book for a lazy weekend afternoon. I especially recommend it with a side of Mma Ramotswe's favorite drink, a steaming cup of redbush tea!"},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"Removes you from the bustle of American life and transports you to the dust of Botswana. A simple morality play and clever who-dun-it with each chapter. The simplicity of the language makes it shine.The first two books are the best in the series. The rest adopt wholesale passages from the previous editions, and are repetitive."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency tells the story of Mma Precious Ramotswe as she establishes the first (and only) private detective agency in all of Botswana. Mma Ramotswe floats from case to case, finding missing and/or cheating husbands, tracking down stolen property, turning down marriage proposals, and doing all of the things that you'd expect from a Botswanan female private eye.Judging from its high sales figures, the fact that it is first in a series, and the rave reviews at Amazon, this is a well-liked book. However, I have (at best) mixed feelings about it. On the plus side, I enjoy books that give a good feel for what it is like to live at a certain time or place. This book does do a good job of that, giving the reader a real feel for the day-to-day life of a small businesswoman in present-day Botswana.Unfortunately, there is not much plot here. Most of the cases are independent \\"morality plays\\" (if that is the correct term). Mma Ramotswe uses here superior understanding of human motives, or her superior intellect, or her superior bulk to solve the case and show that lying, cheating, stealing, or leaving your wife and going off to join a religious sect(!) doesn't pay. There were tantalizing hints that there might be some main story-line coming together, but it never really came to fruition.This isn't a bad book. If you are looking for something to pick up in an airport to read on a flight or something, you can certainly do worse. Plus, for the non-Botswanan among us, the look at life in a new country is certainly a plus. I feel like I'm being picky, but the lack of a plot is holding back my rating. I'll give it two stars out of five, with the caveat that for a two-star book, it's really quite good."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"I have read the overwhelmingly glowing critiques of this book and wonder if I read the same book. I thought this was an uneven, predictable novel that made me wonder what could have been done with such rich material and such potentially interesting characters in the hands of a better author. I am certain this will show up as some equally inept made for tv movie. The bestseller list is not usually a barometer of good literature, and this book proves it to me once again."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"This novel--to the extent that it is a novel rather than a collection of short stories--certainly is different, due almost entirely to the detective/mystery genre in its third world setting. The change is refreshing, offering mild intellectual stimulation to the reader through an introduction to Botswana's language, culture, geography, and wildlife. These are introduced in such a way as to be memorable, so it's a more pleasant way to develop an interest in the landlocked country than reading an encyclopedia entry.However, I found the novel disappointing. For each little challenge that came to the Lady Detective, Mma Romatsuwe, none was much more than a question-and-answer for her. She only had to think up a solution to the problem. Unfortunately, I realized the solution to her most difficult challenge as soon as I saw the problem.I do not feel inspired to read any further in the series."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"This novel came highly recommended to me by a friend whose book judgement I trust, but I was halfway into it when I realized, &quot;My god. This is African Encyclopedia Brown!&quot;I like the way the author describes Africa, and it did have a sense of place, but it seemed like such a gossamer thin plotline throughout. Silly even. I always knew what would happen next.Liking a book is a very personal experience, but for me, &quot;Poisonwood Bible,&quot; was a more substantive, enjoyable and dimensionalized view of Africa."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"I give the author points for character development - the heroine is so human with all the good and bad that goes along with that but the plot is painfully slow! Precious is clearly a 3 dimensional character as are the people she meets throughout her journey but I found myself thinking &quot;do something - anything to move this story forward!&quot; In all, the book failed to hold my attention and I found it rather boring."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"It surprises me that so many people felt passionately about this book. The book wasn't bad or boring, but far from superb (in my opinion). It was an okay book. The mysteries were easily solved and I was just left feeling a little blah about the whole book. The writing style was nice. The cultural aspects were interesting, but the story was not."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"First a bit of perspective. In terms of purchasing power parity, you might be a bit surprised to know that Botswana's per capita income of $7,400 per year is comparable to South Africa and higher than that of Bolivia, Brazil, India, China, Iran, Lebanon, and Jordan. (the U.S. figure is $34,280; Luxembourg is tops at $48,560). Like Luxembourg, Botswana's democratic government has maintained a budget surplus for more than a decade. Botswana's population is 1.6 million; the median age is only 19.1 years. The country covers an area roughly the size of Afghanistan.This is the land where Precious Ramotswe establishes her detective agency. McCall Smith paints her with simple strokes, in a tinted misty atmosphere, essentially impressionistic, often generating pleasant tensions between the realities of everyday life---it's time to eat the pumpkin---and the thrill of the hunt. A romantic to the core, McCall Smith glories in the beauty and comfort of a land where prosperity is still measured by the number of cattle in your herd, where large corrals mark the center of town, and where tribal dialects note your heritage but not your class.The format----in effect, a children's book-----conveys the author's infectious enthusiasm for an idyllic Botswana, a place that is non-threatening, drowsy, without war, without tyranny, without Madonna or Brittney, without Disney, the sort of comfy place one finds within the pages of a nice summer beach book."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"Sitting on the edge of the Kalahari sipping bush tea or trundling about in a tiny white van was not something I had ever before contemplated. Nor had I considered African witch doctors. Alexander McCall Smith takes the reader into modern day Botswana and introduces us to Precious Ramotswe, owner of the #1 Ladies Detective Agency. A \\"traditionally built\\" woman, with a reverence for her native country and its customs, Mme. Ramotswe is a long way from the lady detectives on television. The language is poetic and charm of this book lies in the simplicity of the writing and well crafted intuitions and observations of Mme. Ramotswe. With gentility and common sense, Precious Ramotswe finds the solutions to an assortment of predicaments .The writing is inspired, the setting is vivid and the characters are elegantly believable. The book was finished long before this reader was ready to leave Botswana behind. Happily this is the first in a series. Let me also highly recommend the recorded version (unabridged, of course), read in musical South African accent by Lissette Lecat. This book (and series) should delight all ages."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"The author in his time has written several children's books, and, well, actually this is a children's book as well. It reminds me most of any Disney story where Mickey Mouse and Goofy set out to catch a mastermind of some kind.On average, you'll have figured out the whole mystery about five pages before the heroine, Mma Ramotswe, has. Unless you're a seven year old, that is. Then you'll probably just about be solving mysteries alongside the lady detective.Unless you're annoyed by details like every second paragraph beginning with \\"She\\", you'll find this book an easy read. And there's no doubt the author knows Botswana/Southern African life and everyday language very well, and he demonstrates it through his writing. If you're a sucker for anything African, including the occasional crocodile and snake thrown into the story for no major reason at all, you'll like this book. If you're a grown-up and looking for something Agatha Christie-like, you will not."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"This \\"mystery\\" was placed in with the adult literature at the bookstore. It really is geared to about 5th or 6th grade with the exception of some discussion of almost explicit sex. I'm not sure of the author's intent, but the story and the writing was not of the complexity for an adult. I might rate it higher if thought intention was to gear for children, with a warning about the sex inferences.The story is set in Botswana. A middle-aged woman starts a detective agency and investigates the regular cases that a detective agency would investigate. No complex crimes, etc. The woman is pretty simple and leads pretty simple life. She solves the cases by using common sense, kind of like you would expect in Tom Sawyer or from Dear Abby."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"This book's success in sales beguiles the fact that it is banal, poorly written, and horribly edited. The interesting plot premise of the adventures a woman detective in a patriarchal society has been developed into a boring story with cliched characters engaged in underwhelming activities. The stilted and choppy writing style could be an attempt to reflect the relative simplicity of life in Botswana, but it is tedious and patronizing. Obvious mistakes were rife in the paperback version (which, by now, should have been corrected from earlier editions). For example, a principal character, described early in the book as a consummate bachelor, has a dead wife mentioned later in the book. Surely better mysteries are out there?"},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"If this was listed as \\"junior reading\\" and eliminated the minor sex references, I'd probably give this book a couple of more stars. The cases do not have much complexity and the stories are not rich in Africa life."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"Main character achieves all her good results from lying, hates dogs, uses one as crocodile bait, has super human intellectual powers and extreme pride in her abilities.

I'm a sophmore in high school. I was THOROUGHLY disappointed. There was not one ounce of humor (although the cover claimed so) and the stories were mishappenly thrown together. There was no central plot. I do NOT recommend this book to anyone, old or young."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"This book was highly recommended to me, but I'm afraid I was extremely disappointed. I realize this point of view is becoming old-fashioned, but the immorality was very offensive to me. Her new fiancee basically rapes her, in plenty of detail, and she marries him anyway. It should come as no surprise to readers that he continues to abuse her until he finally leaves her. There is not a single chapter that doesn't refer to sex in some way.Besides that, the book is quite simple. Every mystery is easily solved in one chapter, with no twists anywhere. The first five chapters are spent telling every detail not only of her life up to that point, but also her father's. But none of it ties in with the rest of the book. Basically nothing \\"ties in\\" at the end of the book. It just rambles on until it finally stops, leaving the reader craving a book with some kind of plot. If you are looking for a good lady detective, try Mrs. Pollifax."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"One of the most boring books i've ever read, if not the most b oring.My own fault, I fell for an article written about the author who spokein this area recently."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"I had to read this book because it was selected by my book club.

It's a pet peeve of mine when an author refers to a character by his full name EVERY SINGLE TIME he mentions the character -- for example, &quot;Mr. J.M.B. Matekoni did this. Then Mr. J.M.B.

I wanted to like it, however...I didn't, not really. Yes, it was charming enough, in a cute way, but nothing about it grabbed a hold of me, and motivated me to keep reading. It was mostly a series of short stories about Mma Ramotswe, a women living in Africa who owns her own detective agency. Most chapters consisted of a different client with a mystery to solve, and ended with Mma Ramotswe cleverly figuring it all out. None of the chapters relate to each other, and I didn't think the individual cases were at all exciting or interesting.

Thank you!"},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"This book is both something more and something less than the Agatha Christie-type novel set in Africa that I was expecting. It is something more in that many relatively minor characters a fully developed. For example, our heroine's father's life story is told and it is both interesting and moving. The book is something less in that there is no Agatha Christie-type mystery here. Certainly there are various mysteries solved as individual client's needs are addressed but there is no primary mystery that makes up the plot. Further, the reader will be able to solve many of the minor mysteries before our heroine does.As a small business owner, I can attest that this book does more-or-less accurately address the basic concerns of small business owners (as, indeed, All Creatures Great and Small does).I would have preferred the addition of a locked room murder that has stymied the police or some such."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"If you like strictly episodic books with no character development, no dramatic arc, and occasionally trite prose, this is the book for you.

I don't generally read mystery books, and maybe that's the problem -- but so many people recommended this thing that I tried to ignore the hype and dove in. What a waste of time when there are so many really good books out there to read..."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"I was extremely disappointed with this book.

It was just ok to me---I have read better."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"This little detective book isn't exactly a novel in the traditional sense, it's more of a collection of stories or cases that Precious, the detective solves.Precious is the main character and her voice and perspective are the best parts of the book. She's funny, has strong opinions and a strong moral code.In comparison to the tradional mystery novel, No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency is much more literary than the usual fare. It's also less mysterious and slower paced."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"I call these books \\"Frog and Toad for Moms\\" - they are gentle, comforting, very redundant, and calm the overactive, stressed mind before sleep (hence, 4 stars). The author uses simplistic dialog, a bit monotonous train of thought intended to develop the characters, a touch of history, and an occasional shower of lovely description, to create his quirky tales. These books won't appeal to most people (why you see lots of 1-star ratings). Don't read them if you're looking for great literature or intricate plots. They are for tired minds that need rest and reassurance. They resound like a familiar lullaby for a grown-up frightened or worried \\"child\\"."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"The nice sense of humor and the fresh pheminist approach compensate a little for the fact that the book lacks credibility."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"If you're like me, you like to read on vacation, and you've had the experience of bringing along for a fun trip some entirely inappropriate book--something relentlessly tragic and depressing and heavy. Completely the wrong mood. Through poor planning on my part, or maybe by my trying to bring along the thickest books possible, this routinely happens to me. (First world problems, I know!) But I'm pleased to report that it did not happen on my most recent vacation, because I brought along The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency.This book is more or less a series of vignettes starring Mma. Precious Ramotswe, Botswana's foremost (and only) female detective. It's not a traditional mystery novel; generally a problem is both introduced and solved in the same chapter, and then there are chapters like \\"Mma. Ramotswe Thinks About the Land While Driving Her Tiny White Van to Francistown,\\" which is exactly what it sounds like (don't worry if that sounds a bit dull though; the chapter's only three pages long). It's a light, feel-good, often humorous, enjoyable little book, and with enough genuine warmth to keep it from feeling irredeemably shallow or stupid.Mma. Ramotswe, as she's called throughout the book (Mma. being a respectful term of address for women in Botswana, pronounced as it's spelled) is a likeable protagonist; she's warm-hearted and doesn't put up with nonsense and I like that she's a size 22, \\"traditionally-built African lady\\" and proud of it. The writing is competent and while we don't see a lot of Botswana's culture, there's a decent amount here. And it's nice to read a book set in Africa that isn't about war or atrocities. I wasn't sure how I'd feel about a white male author writing about a black African woman, but Smith pulls it off well: he clearly loves Botswana, and so does Mma. Ramotswe, and he resists the urge to put any white characters in the book at all (at least I think he does; race isn't much of an issue here).So I very much enjoyed my time with this book; I didn't really mind that it's quite light, that the mysteries are often a bit over-the-top, that there isn't much structure or much of a climax. I'm giving 3 stars, though, because it's the kind of book that I'd only enjoy while on vacation, and now that I'm home I have no desire to read the sequel. Fortunately, the series seems to be a good mix of continuous and episodic--the next book moves on to the next chapter of Mma. Ramotswe's life, but this one still presents a complete story that doesn't demand readers consume the entire lengthy series to get some resolution."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"I had originally written a much less positive review after reading the first book of this series, but something about it stuck with me and kept me reading the next one...and the next...and so on. I'm up to the tenth now! These stories will definitely not be to everyone's taste, but Smith is a highly skilled writer and there really isn't anything else like this series that I've encountered. They are sweet and lovely, as everyone says, without being condescending to characters or reader. They're also just plain fun to read, and I've really enjoyed them a lot."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"This beautifully written story with exquisite characters is not only humorous, but also full of wisdom in it. I particularly loved the style of writing and the amazing feel of Africa that the work generates in the reader.

They are apparently addictive for me.The first thing my friend said to me was, \\"They aren't really detective novels. It's a book about a lady who started a detective agency because she wanted to help people.\\"I would suggest that these books are stories about people. By reading them, the reader is able to get to know about life in small villages far, far away. The personalities are so beautifully created that I couldn't wait to find out what happened to them.I read these over the long, hot, drought-filled, sun-baked Oklahoma summer. It seemed appropriate.If you decide to read them, be sure to read them in order. It's a must!"},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"I stumbled onto this series because of the title and have been richly rewarded.Thoughtful, quirky, gentle, evenly paced -- this is not a Jason Bourne novel. Each novel builds upon the one previous, and as each book is added to the next, the reader immerses him or herself further into Precious Ramotswe's Botswana, where red bush tea is ready any time of the day; where there is much to be learned by standing against the fence and contemplating cows; where Mma Makutsi talks to her shoes.In some ways, this is a 21st century African Jane Austen series -- McCall Smith through his characters muses on life and death and gladness and sorrow, and though the land is foreign to many of us, the thoughts and the experiences are universal.The \\"mysteries\\" are incidental to the story, providing impetus for the rich, rich telling of the lives of a series of funny, kind, intelligent, bizarre, thoroughly human people.Superlative!"},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"I don't know how many times I have walked past the latest in this series and thought to myself 'Perhaps one day I should read his books'. Well I finally got round to doing just that and I'm so glad I did. At times this book was moving and a little sad, but overall it was the literary equivalent to a delicious slice of Apple Pie, warm, homely and comforting. Best enjoyed with a cup of hot Red Bush tea."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"My friend, who has spent time in Botswana, encouraged me to read this little story because he said it was true to the culture he encountered there. Precious Ramotswe is certainly nothing like American black women. Large, stoic and self-effacing, she looks at the world patiently but relentlessly posing questions in her own unique way. The pleasure she takes in her simple life - the backyard vegetable patch, her friend the car repairman, and of course, her quiet self-chosen profession as a lady detective, which is unheard of in her culture, made a satisfying read. Not until the end is there any real danger, but I found I didn't miss all the action of other detective novels because I was visiting Botswana, and the Alexander McCall Smith does possess the ability to evoke this setting subtly and consistently throughout this fine story."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"We've said it at least 2 times before and we'll probably say it again. For now however, we'll be content saying it in the present: we award high points to novels with completely unique narratives. The setting for this novel takes place in Botswana and the proceedings that follow are all related to southern Africa living. The agency's staff is unique, the clients are unique, and the cases are unique. Heck, even the cover art is unique.The woman who actually starts the detective agency, Mma Ramotswe, has a vibrant personality that resonates with the reader (this could be you). The No. 1 Ladies Detective Agency is anxious to take on any case, which often leads to some very interesting events. The cases range from not so simple mistaken identity; to work place dismemberment. Still, Mma Ramotswe's practical problem solving skills are fully put to the test when she is asked to locate a missing eleven year old boy. Step aside Holmes and Spade, there's a new sheriff in town!Throughout The No. 1 Ladies Detective Agency, the reader is given a delightful glimpse into the culture and traditions of Botswana. Still, it is the characters that make this novel special. Mma Ramotswe is larger than life in every sense of the word. And then there's Mr. Matekoni, who is easily the most likeable automobile mechanic in all of literature. As to whether or not you'll enjoy this one; there is no mystery!"},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"Mma Ramostwe captures the hearts of her readers. Some in my reading group who had been to Botwsana commented on the authenticity of the setting, customs, and characters. In fact they're reading the rest of the series. Alexander McCall Smith obviously knows, understands and sympathizes with his subject."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"I found this book in my search for a new mystery series to devour. Although I had some reservations about the book in general (it was clearly not a Lisa Scottoline, Jeffrey Deaver, John Sanford type novel), I decided to give it a try. Wow--it was so much better than I expected. Is it a mystery book? Yes. . . well, sort of. It has some of the elements of a mystery, but is far from a thriller. This book is a window into the human spirit. The book is interesting, and masterfully written. If you are searching for a fast-paced action thriller, this is not the book for you. If you are open to a leisurely stroll into a new world, this book is one of the best I have read."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"This is Alexander McCall Smith's best work - his story revolves around an independent, intelligent, admirable Botswana lady, Precious Ramotswe. This proud African lady solves life's little (and big) mysteries using nothing more than her brains, senses and the instructions of a mail order detective book. Delightful and moving, the characters that inhabit Precious' eventfully uneventful life not only teach us about ourselves, but also give us an appreciation of a lifestyle more about living and less about scheduling/acquiring/gossiping - while the landscape inspires a feeling of peace and longing for something simple and pure.I cannot recommend this book highly enough. Please check it out - along with the rest of the series - all of which are worthy of your time and attention."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"I put off reading this book because I was afraid it was just a chick-lit entry, and being a guy, I wasn't looking forward to that. But how wrong was I. This book is refreshing and charming. Watching this lady grow into her job and solve crimes or offer assistance in a straight-forward, common sense way, all the while maintaining perspective and her humor, is just a lot of fun. The challenges grow from finding out if a stranger is someone's Daddy to undercovering human sacrifice involving high political figures, yet our heroine applies her ever abundant gift of simplicity and ingenuity to tackle every problem. This book is different from almost any other book in the mystery genre, but it's new and refreshing and proves that just because a genre is old and established doesn't mean it can't be expanded into new areas. What an enjoyable book. I'm now going to order the rest of the series."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"My book club was looking for an easy stress free book after a few heavier, intense works when I found this series. It took a couple of chapters to engage but then I fell in love with the main character and Bostwana! I bought all the other books available in the series before finishing. Clever and wholesome -I am encouraging my teenage daughters to read it too."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"When someone who isn't a mystery reader recommends a mystery, I always want to read it, and this one was recommended by my sister-in-law. It's a sweet little book, and while I didn't like it as much as I'd hoped, I did enjoy it. I prefer more traditionally-constructed mysteries. Worth a read, and I definitely plan on picking up some of the author's other series"},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"Personally, I'm not a mystery fan, and I only read this at the urging of a friend. Imagine my surprise when a book I thought was about English ladies meeting in a parlor over tea to solve crimes turned out to be about a African folk hero and role model to women everywhere (who just happens to solve mysteries, in addition to fixing her friends lives, and running her business, and helping her community). To recount the pure joy of reading this book, I would have to cut and paste every line into my review. So what are you waiting for? This is a true gem not to be missed by readers of all ages! My high school sister, my mother, and my grandmother all adored the tales. I also highly recommend this as a book club selection (the Today show never disappoints with their selections)."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"This is a book that just grabs you by the heartstrings and refuses to let go. The wonderful heroine, Precious Ramotswe, decides to set up the first ever detective agency in Botswana, the No 1 Ladies Detective Agency, and sets about solving the various misdemeanours and marital disputes brought to her by her clients. This was my reading group's choice, and what we all said we admired most was the combination of razor sharp insight, and gentleness that Precious Ramotswe shows. Some Amazon reviewers have, I see, compared her to Miss Marple, but to me she's more like a female version of Hercule Poirot. What adds considerable poignancy to her character is the fact that we learn that she has a deal of heartbreak in her background, in that she has endured a brief, but abusive marriage, some years before. The present day love interest in the form of her delightful, and ever patient suitor, adds narrative tension - will she or won't she succumb? I am giving the book four stars, rather than five, because I feel that the portrait of Botswana is somewhat idealised - although, to be fair to McCall Smith he does include the darker subjects of witchcraft and child abduction amongst the more innocent story lines. But overall, a delightful read, which has made me want to go on to the other books in the series."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"This story is full of such good humour and general \\"niceness\\" that it stays with you for days after you've read it. Precious Ramotswe is the survivor of an abusive marriage and was the mother of a baby who lived for only five days after marrying against her fathers' advice. She devoted herself to caring for Daddy, as she called him, for the rest of his life, agreeing with his plans for her to start her own business. Daddy had visions of her running a butcher shop or some other lucrative business, but, instead, Precious decides to follow in the shadow of one of her heroines, Agatha Christie, and sets up the No.1 Ladies' Detective Agency, complete with an office, a secretary and a tiny white van for following and surveillance work. Clients begin to trickle in slowly with Precios being asked mainly to follow errant husbands, but, as her reputation for common sense and reliable work grows, she is soon asked to consult on crimes of theft, suspected witchcraft and unlicensed medical practices. As a size 22, generously built African lady, Precious is an unlikely PI, but this quirky book has such charm that I hope to find the sequel soon."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"This is probably the only series of novels about a female detective in Botswana, or, for that matter, any detective in Botswana. But Alexander McCall Smith draws on the richness of that beautiful, special country whose air, sky and culture permeate every chapter. This is a uniquely African story.Yet, Precious Ramotswe also is a darn good detective, drawing on her unique ability to understand human nature to solve a variety of cases. Although you will not find the depth or convoluted plot of a typical detective novel here, Mma Ramotswe cleverly solves several cases. Perhaps best of all, however, is that Smith draws Mma Ramotswe in detail, so that we know her life, her family, and a bit about her country. Despite pain in her past, Mma Ramotswe leads a fulfilling life -- in size 22 dresses (and thank you for that, Mr. Smith)! I look forward to reading additional books in this series."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"this is a wonderful series! hear this one first -- the voice actor is mezmerizing!"},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"This book is not a typical \\"who murdered him/her\\" mystery. The first few chapters focus mainly on the heroine, how her agency got set up, and a bit about her country. The book then focuses on the local-flavor of crimes she solves by mainly using her wits. If you're a person who likes to learn about different cultures, then this is an entertaining way to do so. If you like straight who-do-its, then this book (or, at least, the first few chapters of the book) may have less appeal for you.Genre Reviewshttp://genrereviews.blogspot.com/"},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"Again, this book was chosen for one of my bookclubs and this one is ok. It's not the world's greatest nor a thought-provoking read. This book fits the bill of snuggling under the blanket on a cold autumn day and read of the hot desert air in Africa. This is not a typical mystery either. It is a pleasant rambling of life in Africa. It is also a very predictable mystery book (I wouldn't even call it a mystery novel).This book is the first in the series (which I probably won't read the rest) and it is about a woman named Precious who opened up a business and she is a detective. She looks for straying husbands, lost kids, and other cases. This book is a jumble of several cases where she finds the answer very easily. It is a cute book but again, very predictable.This is perfect for those cold days when you have time to read a book in its entirety. If you like Agatha Christie novels, you will like this one.10/22/08"},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"This gently humorous book and its five similarly funny companions offer more than an engaging story line. You learn that Botswana is a true success story, one of the few in post-colonial sub-Saharan Africa. You can also learn something about the culture, social behavior, languages, and personal values of the people. Of course you need only go to Wikipedia or to Google \\"Botswana\\" to gain access to a wealth of facts, if facts will suffice. But, if you wish to be touched by the fabric of Botswana life the six books of the No.1 Ladies Detective Agency series, will let it happen and provide much to ponder."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"First book in the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency series.Precious Ramotswe, in the face of many doubts, starts a detective agency after the death of her father. Her response to these skeptics is, \\"Haven't you ever heard of Agatha Christie?\\"However, the true beauty of this book is not the mystery (though her cases are solved in satisfying ways). What I found most engaging is the glimpse into the culture of Botswana. Precious is a delightful character whose wisdom and humor will keep readers entranced throughout this quiet little book."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"I get a little kick out of thinking about Mma Ramotswe (a.k.a. Precious) driving all over Botswana and South Africa in her little white van. Whether in pursuit of straying husband, solving the mystery of a doctor with on and off again abilities, tracking down a kidnapped boy, exposing the farce of an elderly \\"father,\\" or spying on a teenager for her father, Mma Ramotswe is a remarkable lady who knows her stuff. Always a curious child who \\"watched everybody and everything will her wide, solemn eyes,\\" her bent for detective work was nurtured by a cousin who wanted her to be clever.In addition to regaling the reader with Mma Ramotswe's investigative experiences, Smith includes a history of the likeable sleuth's earlier life, including a painful early marriage. He also tells the story of Precious's father Obed who worked in the mines, thus letting us know more about the history, culture, and geography of Botswana. A line preceding this section is particularly stirring: \\"His life was unrecorded; who is there to write down the lives of ordinary people?\\" Indeed, who?Although one doesn't ordinarily think of detective work as amusing, Smith has managed to write a delightful novel about an absolutely charming person who feels that she was called to help her brothers and sisters solve the mysteries of their lives. I felt a little sad when I finished it and have already ordered the next in the series. I must know if she marries J.L.B Matekoni and lives happily ever after."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency (Book 1)Lovely read - no gimmicky stuff - just good old plain stories told from the perspective of Mma Ramotswe the Lady Detective."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"Do not be deceived by the apparent simplicity of this novel upon first turning its pages. Although it initially appears to be such, the underlying insights into people and their reasons for doing what they do, is quite profound. Mma Ramotswe owns the only ladies' detective agency in Botswana, and through this book the reader follows her as she embarks upon solving one case after another. This makes the reading quite neat; yes, there are threads and cases that are resolved through the course of the book, but mostly a case is solved in every few chapters. Hence in some ways it reads like a collection of shorts about the same character, a bit like a serialised novel, I guess.The humour in the novel is infectious, the chapter where Mma Ramotswe solves a case for the powerful Mr Patel, had me grinning widely.Moreover, the book is very balanced in its outlook on people, and I appreciate its honesty there, it recognises how divergent human nature can be, presents the good with pride and the bad as something that can be overcome in many cases by good people everywhere.McCall-Smith's love for Botswana and all things Botswanan is tastefully evident throughout, to the extent that it would not surprise me if many a person upon reading a book in the series were to have a desire instilled to travel to this place themselves for a holiday!I really liked Mmma Ramotswe and her outlook on life. She seems such a positive, straight (in the sense of no alterior motive, what you see is what you get) person (in spite of having faced some life-changing challenges, which the reader is reminded of regularly). Her philosophy: \\"I love all the people God made... It is my duty to help them solve the mysteries in their lives\\".Future reading:I would not hesitate to move on to the other books in the series, or to recommend it to other readers.The BBC has produced this as a film, which I intend to watch next, if I can get my hands on it!"},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"How charming are these books! I have a confession to make - I've never really cared about traveling all that much, and especially not to somewhere as remote and foreign as Africa. But that has very much changed with Mma Romotswe and Alexander McCall Smith's accounting of her. I now harbor a secret dream of visiting Botswana and the Kalahari.This first in a series is delightful; Mr. Smith is a true craftsman. He manages to bring us the world at a much slower pace, one that can be very difficult to understand in this country. But he does it while maintaining the integrity of his characters. While they may have a simple way of viewing the world, the characters in this book (and the others that I've read) are not one-dimensional simpletons. Smith manages to weave the problems of today into a culture that isn't necessarily ruled by time so strictly as in the western world.And while there are many \\"mysteries\\" in this novel, the detective agency is more about human nature and the problems we create for ourselves. Mma Romotswe just manages to ponder and resolve some of these issues, while dealing with the problems that arise from daily living. What a fun book."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"What a surprise: a New York Times bestseller that's actually quite good. I'm normally a little leery of white male authors writing books with main characters who are not also white men (Memoirs of a Geisha is a good example --- it's so clearly a white guy imagining, badly, what a young Japanese woman might think), but this is a happy surprise. Smith, who was born in Zimbabwe and has lived in Botswana, has not only an eye for finding the telling background detail but also an ear for natural dialogue. Granted that I am not an African woman, Precious Ramotswe sounds to me like herself and not like a bad author's ventriloquist trick. The language of the book is charming, direct without being simple, well considered. A lot happens in this book, but it doesn't feel rushed. Instead, by the end I found myself really liking Mme Ramotswe, thoroughly charmed by her adventures both greater and lesser, and looking for more."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"Really enjoyed the audio.

The whole series is great and the lead character is just fantastic. If you get a chance, read the whole series."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"This is less of one cohesive story and more short vignettes that tie into one novel. For a long drive where one is falling asleep and waking up again this was a good thing. I did enjoy this audiobook the narrator was enjoyable to listen to but at times with road noise was hard to hear. Precious Ramotswe, the lady detective, was an interesting character and I enjoyed listening to a story that was set outside of the United States.Botswana where the story was set played a big role in the stories. Some of the vignettes where very specific to Africa and couldn't happen anyplace else. Witch doctor's and corruption cases are solved by Romotswe in often funny and satisfying ways that don't seem to be a stretch of reality in the slightest.I would recommend this novel to those that want something to listen to on a drive."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"I would rave about this book. Not for the mysteries, for Precious Ramotswe always seems to have them well in hand, even when McCall Smith tries to convince us she is worried about them.No, the reason to read this book is like Dickens, McCall Smith has a voice that burrows into the subject and characters and makes the world he shows us larger than the world we see with our own eyes.The author has a clear grasp of what one should as an accomplished writer. A voice. This may be a genre novel, but the use of words is so clear that you can see Africa in a way you had not expected. You can see the people that Botswana is inhabited with, in a way that you did not think words so succinctly could describe.That is the genius of the style McCall Smith has found. Each step builds to the next, and Precious Ramotswe becomes a loved person that is as good to remember as Tiny Tim, or Huck Finn, or anything Chaucer came up with.This is a must read if you like reading. And thankfully portrays Africa, not as a stereotype, but as a strong continent, with much to offer the rest of the world. (Botswana of course is actually an exemplary nation.)"},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"loved the most unusual story line. its so nice to read a book without sex, guns etckiddos to mr smith please keep them coming.The No.1 Ladies' Detective Agency (Movie Tie-in Edition)"},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"Living in Africa, I love the people.

The host invited her friend, Priscilla, one of Africa's \\"Lost Girls\\" to come speak to us. Her story was amazing. Family members murdered. Refugee camps. Horrors. She, her husband, and their three children now live and work here. They love America and say we are \\"God people, you act like God would act.\\" Though, that is obviously a generalization, it is evident that she is grateful to be here.Meeting Priscilla was wonderful. Her strength and dedication to life are inspiring. When she told us of how some people in the US told her that she didn't have to work here, that the government would give her a house and that she could just sit in it all day, and that she said to them, \\"Why wouldn't I want to work?! I am able! I have two arms. Why wouldn't I want to work? Maybe one day if I am sick and old, but not now!\\" She and her family are the only kind of immigrants that made America great, and they are continuing to do so. I think the heroine in our book had similar pluck.It was also very heart-opening to hear Priscilla joke about disciplining her children and how she tells them that if they do not behave that she would not buy them anything good. Upon hearing this, my silent mind immediately thought of \\"candy\\" and \\"toys\\" being the \\"anything good\\". Priscilla finished her story up by saying, \\"Yes, I tell them, I won't buy you anything good, no shoes, no clothes...\\"Wow. We know nothing of want.When I first heard the title of this series I was not interested in reading it. It reminded me of those cheesy crime shows in the 1980s, like \\"Spencer For Hire\\", etc., which my family actually watched.As the choice of the month for my book club, I read it to respect the chooser, if you will. And I am so glad! I really enjoyed the book and it was day-and-night different from my assumption.It really was fun, quick, touching, and interesting. The heroine is very human and it is a delight to have her thoughts narrate most of the story. The author makes political commentary from which our own busy-body government should take a lesson or two, (i.e. 'hands off my life!).The reflections on human relationships made throughout the book are the most poignant of all.I am really glad that I read this book.

Actually, they are BETTER this way than reading the books. I understand that is a strong statement. And having listened to many of them, I can attest to this. Here is why:Narrator--Lisette Lescat is nothing less than superb. In an unabridged format, you get every word the author wrote, delivered in a melodious voice that conveys many shades of meaning that the words have.Format: listening really helps you get the dialogue down better. And dialogue is one of the key strengths of these books. Storytelling verbally is the oldest form of communication. These books will make you smile, laugh, and think, as you listen.I was lucky enough to hear the author at a recent book signing.

What you should know: this book is actually a series of short detective stories told about a smart African woman, Precious Ramotswe. It is humorous and endearing. I have not found much humor in detective novels, but this book has it.It is not a thriller or a CSI type detective novel. She does not use computers, fingerprints or any other scientific methods. She just uses common sense, a great memory and understanding of people.The emphasis of this book is how the woman becomes a detective and how she notices everything and manages her cases. There are delightful, interesting descriptions of the people around her. You learn about African customs of her country and surrounding areas. You learn about the \\"feel\\" of the place. None of this information is ever overwhelming - you get just enough information to get a sense of the circumstances.I found I had to keep reading up one of the mini-cases was solved and then I could put the book down for a while and take it back up.I fell in love with Mme. Ramotswe, I fell in love with the land, even the open dry bleak areas.This is the first novel in what is now a long list of novels with Ramotswe as the detective. I know that I will be ordering more.I found this first novel at a second hand book sale so that if I did not like it, I was not losing much money.

I enjoy complex, detective stories and this collection of vignettes tend to be simplistic and easy reading.The main protagonist is the unusual Ms. Precious Ramotswe, a sized twenty-two, middle-age Botswanan lady, sans any detective experience, who starts her own detective No.1 Ladies' Detective Agency after receiving an inheritance following the death of her beloved father and getting free of a an awful marriage to a wastrel. Precious has a sharp mind and the confidence and tenacity that a good detective needs and to triumph over preconceived notions and male chauvinism.Smith has written a very charming, thought-provoking an African woman, the traditions, culture and citizens of Botswana, a landlocked nation in southern Africa. I loved the main character and the writing was uniquely charming and endearing."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"The reviewers who wrote this off as a series of short stories without much plot missed the point. It was clearly never intended to be \\"Agatha Christie meets southern Africa.\\" It is instead a lovely, thought-provoking story of a woman and her country, told by unpealing the layers (some humorous, some more weighty) of their lives, and revealing how they have both come through darkness to find quiet, justifiable happiness and dignity.I expected this to be a lightweight, mindless summer afternoon read. And true, it was a great choice for an idle summer day. But it was not mindless (or painless). The author, having been born in neighboring Zimbabwe, and taught at the University of Botswana, gives us enough glimpses into the history and culture of this little neighbor of South Africa, that I found myself online for the next week seeking more info on this uniquely stable and successful diamond-rich African democracy, wondering how they have managed to sustain peace and wide-spread prosperity surrounded as they are by countries ravaged by greed-driven violence. My sense is that this reaction on my part was not the least of the author's motives in writing this first of his series."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"There are many detective series featuring women sleuths, ranging from gentle Miss Marple and not so gentle Agatha Raisin in the quiet English countryside, Amelia Peabody in Egypt, various others scattered throughout the United States and Canada but this series takes us to a place few stories have taken mystery readers to before - Botswana. Our sleuth/guide is Precious Ramotswe, a woman built to traditional African proportions, who after an unhappy marriage took the money left to her by her father and opened up a detective agency. Her specialities were mostly the small everyday matters that touched the lives of her neighbors, the wandering husband, the rebellious teenager to name a few. What sets this apart from the usual woman detective cozy is that it is set in Botswana, a landlocked nation in southern Africa. Precious is very much an African woman, and not just in her 'traditional build'. Her outlook on life and her approach to solving her cases are also African - she seeks out the truth in her cases but also considers what is in the best interests of all parties involved.This is very much a cozy series in that the story of Precious' life both past and present is as important as her cases. This is the first book in the series so there was a great amount of time spent on establishing back stories for the main characters. There are quite a few subplots that promise to be dealt with in later books. This has been made into an HBO series, one that diverges slightly in some details from the books.This is a delightful series of charming stories told in a gentle voice. The stories are G, or at most mild PG stories making this a great choice for cozy fans ranging from young teens to senior citizens while still engaging those in between."},{"Title":"CEZANNE","review":"As an art student Paul Cezanne became the paragon upon which I measured all other subsequent painters. The writer that taught me to see him as the North Star in that vast, swirling sky of artists was Meyer Schapiro. Having read the above book literally a dozen or more times I have found that it is an inexhaustible treasure. Mr. Schapiro's insights are both scholarly and poetic. He above all seems to understand that Cezanne, while instrumental as a precursor to cubism, was first and foremost a great individual artist. Going to the Cezanne retrospective in Philadelphia several years ago I remember the first thing that came to my mind was how right Mr. Schapiro had been to avoid all the fussy and downright foolish connections that other critics are constantly making between Cezanne and modern art. What Mr. Schapiro concentrates on rather is C&eacute;zannes paintings and not his influence - this is most refreshing. He above all others I have read seems to have an uncanny understanding of Cezanne as both a man and an artist. He writes that C&eacute;zanne's; &quot;...detached contemplation of his subjects arises from a passionate aspiring nature that seeks to master its own impulses through an objective attitude to things.&quot; I can only think that this must be true of Mr. Schapiro also. Each sentence is laid down with the care that Cezanne put into laying down each stroke of paint and as such his writing possesses a gravity that I have never found in another critic's work with the exception of Roger Fry. The beginning of the book provides a comprehensive overview of C&eacute;zanne's work and a brief outline of his life but the final 3/4 quarters of the book is structured as follows: superb color reproduction on the right hand page and a few paragraphs of commentary on the left page. These enables one to simply open it at any given time, find a desirable painting and read the commentary directly next to it. Structure in this way, the book became for me a source to meditate upon the good in art when I was surrounded by the confusion of trying to find myself among other young artists. Not being a scholar I found this book to be accessible and enriching. Mr. Schapiro writes with such sincere warmth and wisdom that when I heard of his death a few years ago I was saddened as if I had lost a friend and mentor. I hope this wonderful book brings as much joy and inspiration to you as it has for me."},{"Title":"CEZANNE","review":"This is a gem of a book, with an insightful, sometimes poetic, always profound text, which analyses almost every major painting by Paul C&eacute;zanne. The illustrations are numerous and almost all in color. Now then, why 4 stars instead of 5? First because the current owners of the works are no longer the ones indicated in the book, which has not been updated (many paintings listed in private collections are nowadays in museums) and second because the quality of the illustrations leaves a lot to be desired, most of the works appearing flattened out by the rather mediocre printing process (the book was first published in 1952 and the new edition could have done a better job in this respect). Also, the famous painting \\"Madame C&eacute;zanne in a red Armchair\\", marvelously described by Rilke in his letters to his wife, is inexplicably missing from Schapiro's selection.Yet, those few notable drawbacks should not keep C&eacute;zanne's lovers from appreciating this great study of the father of modern art."},{"Title":"CEZANNE","review":"This book, like almost all of Schapiro's writing is a tool in learning how to see.

Marlowe is best known for his Earl \\"The Man With No Face\\" Drake thrillers - a hard-boiled (if formulaic) 1970's series of action/espionage novels. More notably, Strongarm is sandwiched in between two of Marlowe's best - One Endless Hour (1962) and Never Live Twice (1964).Strongarm has all the hallmarks of Marlowe's hard-hitting style. The narrative jumps around freely - beginning smack in the middle of the action, then incorporating reminiscent daydreaming to cover all the background.In this case, we begin with a car crash. Pete Karma, on a mission of revenge, is shadowing a mob courier - only to see the man crash into a second car. A mysterious briefcase (arm still attached) bounces to Karma's feet - he grabs it and runs.From there, it gets messier.Karma is an escaped convict. Serving time for a murder he didn't commit, Karma busts out and, while lying low, schemes of revenge. Just as everything finally clicks into place, he's sidetracked by the enigmatic suitcase - which, in proud MacGuffin fashion, is filled with cash and untranslatable documents. The inference is that they're stolen Russian secrets, but for all the detail we're given, it might as well be De Vermis Mysteriis.Before long, Karma is the target of a national manhunt. He grabs his foxy ladyfriend, Lynn, and hits the road - chased by Eastern European goons, angry mobsters and cops of all sizes, shapes and descriptions. To add some unintentional comedy, Karma and Lynn pick up Lynn's niece - Augusta - who is a fun-loving package of uncontrollable appetites (in contrast to Lynn, who is the sort of 'brave-but-boring' good girl love interest).The whole picture is just too much - culminating in a mob vs mob vs cop vs Commie shootout that's like the final 20 minutes of \\"True Romance\\". Marlowe's better works (mentioned above) are more tightly constructed - a few nasty twists and an atmosphere of violent tension. In Strongarm, the tension is there, but the twists are running in savannah-wide packs. In contrast to the goofiness the best moments are those 'day-to-day' scenes of life on the run - Pete and Lynn trying to get some sleep or buy clean clothes while being chased by half the country. The detail is terrific, it is the plot that leads the book astray."},{"Title":"Strongarm","review":"Strongarm (1963) is a standalone vengeance thriller from author Dan Marlowe.

Why they decide to climb the seven summits, the highest mountain on each of the seven continents! Their attempts to snare their trophy mountains makes for a rip rollicking good read. What is most remarkable is that one of them actually manages to summit each and every one of the seven mountains in question.The account of their adventure runs the gamut of the human experience: humor, pathos, joy, and ultimate success. Their achievement is incredible, considering that they were middle aged, novice climbers. Yet their grit and determination, coupled with a seemingly endless cash flow, allowed them to hob nob with the mountaineering elite and, ultimately, enables one of them to achieve their collective dream.These are two men who, when looking back on their lives, will never find themselves in the position of saying &quot;would've, could've, should've&quot;. They dared to live their dreams. Would that we were all so inclined. In any case, their adventures during their remarkable quest make for some very absorbing reading. Climbing enthusiasts will enjoy this book, as will as those who love a good adventure story."},{"Title":"Seven Summits: Their Challege - To Scale the Highest Peaks on Seven Continents","review":"I came across an interesting description reading while Jon Krakauer's Into Thin Air: It mentioned a certain socialite mountaineer who threw a party before climbing Mt. Everest to which she showed up in her climbing gear. Krakauer also mentioned in passing that she was on a coveted Seven Summits quest to climb the tallest mountain on each continent. Later on I came across a memoir by one of the guides on the 1996 Mt. Everest disaster, titled My Seven Summits. Having seen this quest mentioned on several occasions, my curiosity was piqued when I saw this book about Wells' and Bass' exploits.This book is straightforward and simply written. Positive in tone, it portrays two classic type-A entrepreneurs, in a style with which Donald Trump was once lionized, before he had to let the bankers take over his holdings, before the S&L; crises and the Enron debacle. The two men are portrayed with all of the bravado and the flair of Kipling-toting prep school boys that the two men once might have been, reliving their youth in the adventure. The book does not dwell on the technicalities or insights of the Inner Game of Mountain Conquest, and self-serving though it may be, it is basically honest and it illustrates several truths, perhaps unintentionally. The theme of danger, of climbers dying or coming close to it is prevalent throughout the book, with several fatal accidents taking place during the course of the book. There is no dwelling on why or if the deaths were preventable, but along with the book about sailing called the Proving Ground, this book underscores a point that most money buys the best expertise, best sailboat, and avoids the disaster that befalls other climbing parties, with less technical expertise. The book touches on, but does not address the negative impact a paying expedition member has on the rest of the expedition, which sees the patron as a free loader and is best seen in the hostile reception that Dick Bass received when he tried to hitch his way up the Mt. Everest with other climbing parties that had obtained the coveted permits.This book is also a good account of the genesis of modern adventure travel. The two could honestly claim to have started it, and in the early nineties adventure tourism became a marketable commodity. What one must understand is that in our society Expensive sports like mountaineering usually attract two sorts of people: Those, who seriously get into it, but have no money and people with bucks who want to do it. People, who have no money work whatever labor they can get paid for, climbing as much as they could, much like Krakauer and Marty Hoey, mentioned in this book. If they get lucky, they eventually become professional guides or journalists or something else on the periphery that would allow them to take part in climbing expeditions. The other half are people like Bass and Wells, who can afford the $60,000 climbing fees and other expenses related to mountain climbing. In the old days of exploration, these wealthy patrons were themselves amateur scientists who took active parts in the expeditions they sponsored and received accolades in various geographic societies for their scholarly endeavors. Nowadays, we get a glimpse of another type of explorer - one who has no interest in climbing other than as a thrill and recreation. These outsiders pay a lot of money to spend their vacation skydiving or ocean kayaking or climbing Mt. Everest and whose money, spent on expensive equipment, guides, lessons and other fees, basically support the pros and the scene of whatever extreme sport they engage in. In time, there emerged a whole genre of magazines dedicated to marketing various extreme sports to so-called adventure tourists.This book is a very good glimpse into the genesis of the adventure tourist industry. Amazingly, the seven summits were reached by Bass in 1984-1985 and the worst excesses of this trend started by Bass and Wells ended up in disaster in 1996, when 12 people lost their lives in a blizzard on Mt. Everest. Most of the victims were paying clients; some of them should have never been on the mountain. It took a little over a decade for some of the themes touched in the Seven Summits to reach the disastrous proportions on Everest. In a way, this book written in 1986, was prophetic of things to come."},{"Title":"Seven Summits: Their Challege - To Scale the Highest Peaks on Seven Continents","review":"This book, in the main, is nothing more than hubris in print. Wells and Bass typify the attitude of today's wealthy elitists: the belief that because they have lots of money, they are somehow ennobled and entitled to everything the world has, including the world's highest mountain peaks.Skip this book. If you want to read good mountaineering lore, try \\"Annapurna\\" by Maurice Herzog, or Hillary's account of his climb of Everest."},{"Title":"Seven Summits: Their Challege - To Scale the Highest Peaks on Seven Continents","review":"Having been recommended by my boss I was skeptical, but this book proved to be a great motivating tool.

It makes we want to climb!"},{"Title":"Seven Summits: Their Challege - To Scale the Highest Peaks on Seven Continents","review":"After reading &quot;Into Thin Air&quot; by Jon Krakauer, I was eager to read more about the people who climb the tallest mountains. While I admire Frank and Dick's success, particulary considering their age, I couldn't help get the impression that this book was one long accolade to the men rather than the accomplishment. It felt like two very ego-driven, very successful men had manipulated a two-bit author into writing about how wonderful they were. I never once got the sense of loneliness and fear of being above 26,000 feet (the &quot;Death Zone&quot;) that Krakauer wrote about so well."},{"Title":"Seven Summits: Their Challege - To Scale the Highest Peaks on Seven Continents","review":"I had a different take on the story than many of the previous reviewers. I never felt that Bass and Wells tried to hide their wealth or the fact that they were novice climbers. What I found most inspiring was the fact that they rarely let failure deter them. I'm sure true mountaneers will gain little from the book, but \\"outsiders\\" will gain a great deal of knowledge about the sport without having to interpret technical descriptions."},{"Title":"Seven Summits: Their Challege - To Scale the Highest Peaks on Seven Continents","review":"I really enjoyed this book, and despite it not being as descriptive as other Mountaineering books. If you take this as a story of two men who have little climbing experience achieve a goal of climbing the highest Mountains in each Continent, 7 summits in total. I found it an amazing book of self determination, motivation and true friendship.Yes it is true, they couldn't have otherwise succeeded at this unless they had the money to do so, but the book never denies the reader that insight.This booked had me routing for them from their first Everest adventure, I just wanted them to achieve their goals.For those who are wanting a descriptive mountain climbing book this isn't for you, but those who want to read about a great challenging adventure over coming multiple diffculties this is an excellant read."},{"Title":"Seven Summits: Their Challege - To Scale the Highest Peaks on Seven Continents","review":"The story of Frank Wells and Dick Bass and their dream to climb the highest peak on every continent is an amazing, inspiring and almost unbelievable tale. The sheer enormity of the task, their own inexperience and age, the setbacks of all kinds which plagued the quest, all seem more than enough to send this dream down in flames.Yet somehow, Dick Bass was able to do it (his partner was forced to quit before the end). While it's obviously much easier to make a dream like this come true when you have the kind of cash these two men have; money alone won't get you to the summit of Everest. The trials of these two men and their associates in pursuit of the seven summits dream should stoke the imagination and fire the spirit of anyone who has ever aspired to something grander than finding a way to watch four TV shows which share the same time slot.The writing of the book itself needs some polishing. The recreated dialogue, in particular, comes off as stilted and wooden.Technical problems aside, this book is a monument to the achievement of Bass and Wells. Let it inspire you. If you've had a dream all your life, follow it. Live life vibrantly, make a memory. If you can look back over the past few months without noticing anything you think you'll remember, let the story of these men inspire you to change that.&quot;Most men lead lives of quiet desperation.&quot; Don't be one of them."},{"Title":"Seven Summits: Their Challege - To Scale the Highest Peaks on Seven Continents","review":"Frank Wells, the Walt Disney exec, and Dick Bass, a top entrepreneur set out to climb the continent's seven highest summits in a logistical challenge of peak bagging. The writing doesn't really capture the magic of the mountains and envelop you in the high altitude mystique.The book does have it's moments, like the challenging endurance journey of climbing Aconcagua, and the suspense of if they even climbed the right summit for Mt Vinson in Antarctica. Since it is a book about climbing mountains, it's a worthwhile read, but there are far better mountain climbing books out there...&quot;Into Thin Air&quot; by Krakauer...anything by Heinrich Harrer. Frank Wells died shortly after the book came out from a helicopter accident while heli-skiing. The movie &quot;The Lion King&quot; is a far better and moving tribute to a great man than this book. Skip this book and resist the urge to climb mountains above your head for the sake of peak bagging and go out and get &quot;Into Thin Air&quot; and be caught up in the altitude."},{"Title":"Seven Summits: Their Challege - To Scale the Highest Peaks on Seven Continents","review":"This book reminds me of athlete biographies written for kids.

All of this can get very annoying! The bottom line, as I understand it, is that Bass and Wells did something that they should be very proud of. By treating their adventure as a world-class mountaineering accomplishment (which it clearly was not) the author actually detracts from the story."},{"Title":"Seven Summits: Their Challege - To Scale the Highest Peaks on Seven Continents","review":"I too read &quot;Into Thin Air&quot; and then read this book. &quot;Seven Summits&quot; is more about the personal achievements and personal dreams of Bass and Wells than about the details of the Everest climb of &quot;Into Thin Air&quot;. Even though Bass and Wells were rich guys, they did give up a couple of years of their lives while their personal business futures were far from certain. In other words, I don't think Bass and Wells were a couple of spoiled boys by any means. But they did have the guts (and financial means) to leave their families and risk their lives for a once-in-a-life-time challenge.In my opinion, the writing style is only so-so (no James Michener here), but it is easy reading."},{"Title":"Seven Summits: Their Challege - To Scale the Highest Peaks on Seven Continents","review":"easy reading"},{"Title":"Seven Summits: Their Challege - To Scale the Highest Peaks on Seven Continents","review":"I don't think these guys get enough credit! Yes, they were fifty something and not life-long mountaineers. But, their dedication to an admirable goal, and to themselves really, makes up for it. Their story is an epic adventure that anyone will appreciate. Highly Recommended!"},{"Title":"Seven Summits: Their Challege - To Scale the Highest Peaks on Seven Continents","review":"A very good book detailing the high adventures of two men bonded by a common goal. I hope I'm still climbing mountains when I'm Dick Bass' age (in the book). It took an increbible amount of energy, time and courage to make it all happen. The book is 336 pages long and contains some good photographs from their adventures. If you enjoy reading about the exploits of adventurers, you should also read TJ Burr's &quot;Rocky Mountain Adventure Collection,&quot; which is also available through Amazon.com. Anyway, thumbs up for &quot;Seven Summits.&quot;"},{"Title":"Seven Summits: Their Challege - To Scale the Highest Peaks on Seven Continents","review":"Dick Bass and Frank Wells are truly inspirational whether you climb or not. The descriptions of climbing each mountain are so real as to frighten and move the reader. I think it may be as good if not better than Jon Krakauer's recently published Into Thin Air. A must read!"},{"Title":"Seven Summits: Their Challege - To Scale the Highest Peaks on Seven Continents","review":"A fast paced outdoor adventure novel of two people going to the extreme to climb the highest mountains on each continent. Follow the two new found friends, as they become brothers and overcome cold, altitude, distance, and politics. Leaving very successful businesses behind and almost their families they pursue a quest larger than simply climbing a mountain. A must for anyone who has climbed,dreamed of climbing, or seeking to understand the power of a determined mind"},{"Title":"Seven Summits: Their Challege - To Scale the Highest Peaks on Seven Continents","review":"This book is definitely not one to purchase if you are looking for detailed accounts of climbing these mountains.We read far more about the planning and personal lives of these men; neither of whom is interesting enough to command this attention. The dialogue between the two men is incredibly canned and sappy and Ridgeway tries in vain to capture the true feelings resulting from these ascents. You would probably be better off reading individual guides if you want to get a feel for these climbs. There are definitely better books on the subject."},{"Title":"Seven Summits: Their Challege - To Scale the Highest Peaks on Seven Continents","review":"The book gives you inspiration to climb the seven summits and it says that it doesn't matter how old you are. It is all about how much you really want to get the summits."},{"Title":"Seven Summits: Their Challege - To Scale the Highest Peaks on Seven Continents","review":"&quot;Seven Summits&quot; is for the most part an entertaining read, though anyone who isn't wealthy enough to follow in Dick and Frank's footsteps will probably have difficulty truly rooting for them in their quest. Two points beg to be made here. First, climbing the seven summits (the tallest mountains on each continent) is by the standards of true mountaineers not a terribly impressive feat. Second, Dick and Frank are exactly the types of &quot;amatures&quot; who got caught on Everest and died or were horribly maimed during the events chronicled by &quot;Into Thin Air.&quot; This book, unfortunately, may have served as the inspiration for people who have no business attempting the world's highest peaks. Nevertheless, it is a fun read for those interested in mountaineering. But its no &quot;Into Thin Air.&quot;"},{"Title":"Seven Summits: Their Challege - To Scale the Highest Peaks on Seven Continents","review":"This book was hard to put down when I started reading it. The fact that two established business men with little experience could just decide to climb all seven highest peaks was unbelievable. So many of us dream but do not have the resources to go after that dream. It was fun reading about two men that could pursue their dream. I was really impressed with Frank's willingness to put his family ahead of his dream. I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys true adventure stories."},{"Title":"Seven Summits: Their Challege - To Scale the Highest Peaks on Seven Continents","review":"This is one of the books I read when my interest in mountain climbing adventures was first starting. At the time, I liked it. But since then, I must say that I have read many books more exciting, fast paced, gripping, than this. I did like the humor in the book and the characters were interesting. And I really learned a lot about the 7 Summits.For other books that I found gripping and well worth reading, see my other reviews or my listmania list. I am an avid reader of true adventure and/or survival stories."},{"Title":"Seven Summits: Their Challege - To Scale the Highest Peaks on Seven Continents","review":"Unlike most mountaineering books, I found this book filled with a great sense of humor. It is impossible to read about Frank Wells and not desire to have met him. His relationship with Dick Bass reminded me of \\"The Odd Couple\\", and their humorous adventures propel the reader throughout the book (the best is the 'almost frostbite' on Denali). But these two guys are also inspiring and it is hard to put down the book and not want to tackle those summits!"},{"Title":"Seven Summits: Their Challege - To Scale the Highest Peaks on Seven Continents","review":"What a cool concept, to climb the seven highest peaks on each continent. However, don't try this yourself if you are as inexpereinced as Dick and Frank. I found myself holding my breath for these guys as I read, knowing that at some point their beginners' luck would run out. They seemed to have nine lives though. Pros-An inspiring read for the average Joe or Jane just starting out, it makes you believe you can do it too. Cons-These guys are quite obviously full of themeselves from page one, and the final party on the last peak was ridiculous. Also, pretty long winded."},{"Title":"Seven Summits: Their Challege - To Scale the Highest Peaks on Seven Continents","review":"This is one of the greatest adventure stories I have ever read. I love reading mountain climbing stories, and this is an awesome one because it is not just bald facts, or shifting blame (like the 1996 disaster books), and it is a great story. This is a truly good book that made me want to do something incredible."},{"Title":"Seven Summits: Their Challege - To Scale the Highest Peaks on Seven Continents","review":"Anyone interested in pushing their mental and physical performance should read this book. Ridgeway does a super job in making us feel like we've know Dick and Frank for years. The evolvement of Frank from a clumsy executive to a true mountaineer is incredible. Even more incredible is the spirit and determination of Dick Bass. These are two men who's inspiration will guide me through all of the difficult summits in my life."},{"Title":"Seven Summits: Their Challege - To Scale the Highest Peaks on Seven Continents","review":"As I read this book, I was struck by the thought that perhaps Frank and Dick had no business going to these mountains to try to climb them. But as I read on, I was caught up in Dick's attitude, willpower and energy. It then struck me just how much he DID deserve to be there, if for no other reason than to support the idea that a dedicated amateur with a true climber's spirit (if not skill) should always have a place on an expedition. I'm sure that there are professional climbers who disagree, but some (like Marty Hoey and Rick Ridgeway) seemed to have felt he belonged. What is also entertaining is that in the years following Dick's achievement, &quot;true&quot; climbers have tried some revisionist history by claiming that some other Pacific Rim peak is the true seventh summit, even though it is in Asia, NOT in Australia (which, if my atlas is correct, is still actually a separate continent). I say give Dick the credit he is due. I know that I would love to meet him, if only to high five him and pat him on the back."},{"Title":"Seven Summits: Their Challege - To Scale the Highest Peaks on Seven Continents","review":"I thought when I reached the end of the book, the &quot;heroes&quot; would change their mind that money is everything and their natural arrogance. I was wrong. This is nothing to do with mountaineering, just what money can buy."},{"Title":"Seven Summits: Their Challege - To Scale the Highest Peaks on Seven Continents","review":"I must admit, I approached this book with extreme prejudice. I had read some reviews and listened to the opinions of my friends who had read the book and made a mental note to pass on this one. Then, as a present, I was given the book. As I make a point to read any book given to me as a gift (I may rethink this policy), I threw all caution to the wind and began reading. Right away I was gritting my teeth. The two protagonists, Dick Bass and Frank Wells, I found to be insufferable and left me thanking my stars that I never was stuck with either of them in a tent.Both men were used to getting their way in the business world (although Frank Wells couldn't operate a microwave or buy his own clothes), pushing people about, and letting money do the talking. When the idea occurred to them to climb the highest peak on each of the continents, they naturally thought that their characters and a little physical conditioning would meet with success. Amazingly, they were successful - thanks to skilled climbers who risked their own lives to allow these two men to try to fulfill their Seven Summits dream.Rick Ridgeway, the hired pen for this book, treats his benefactors, Bass and Wells, as if they were modern day heroes: men who constantly fought against adversity and always persevered, as well as men who tackled the continents' highest peaks by spending an obscene amount of money making sure that they had a good chance at the summits. The tone of his prose is almost hagiographic when he describes the mental anguish the two men underwent as they balanced their multi-million dollar careers with the cost and time involved in climbing each of the peaks; and unintentionally comic as in the descriptions of the camaraderie between Bass, Wells, and their new found climbing buddies as Bass recites Robert Service's poem, &quot;The Men Who Don't Fit In&quot; (incongrous since Bass and Wells are the consummate insiders).I must admit, I did gain some begrudging respect for Dick Bass. After all, in his fifties, he did climb each of the seven summits. However, one must consider if the success of this enterprise didn't in a way contribute to the overcrowding of the 8,000 meter peaks and to disasters such as the one described in &quot;Into Thir Air.&quot; And of course there are the mountains, and they save the book from being a total bust. I wish that Ridgeway would have given them center stage rather than Bass and Wells but, then again, mountains don't deal in money."},{"Title":"Seven Summits: Their Challege - To Scale the Highest Peaks on Seven Continents","review":"After reading &quot;Into Thin Air&quot; by Jon Krakauer, I was eager to read more about the experience of climbing the tallest mountains. While I admire Frank and Dick's success, particulary considering their age, I couldn't help get the impression that this book was one long accolade to the men rather than the accomplishment. It felt like two very ego-driven, very successful men had manipulated a two-bit author into writing about how wonderful they were. I never once got the sense of loneliness and fear of being above 26,000 feet (the &quot;Death Zone&quot;) that Krakauer wrote about so well."},{"Title":"Seven Summits: Their Challege - To Scale the Highest Peaks on Seven Continents","review":"This book showcases the friendship between the two main characters.

He has climbed just one mountain in his life - the Matterhorn, twice - and he thinks that a feat worth boasting about. The head of Snowbird's safety patrol scoffs when she hears him. Marty Hoey, a deceptively small woman, tells \\"Large-Mouth Bass\\" (a nickname that Dick embraces proudly) that his hot air won't get him up Alaska's Mt. McKinley - a peak on which she is that rareity, a female guide. As far as her employer is concerned, he's been issued a challenge. One that he would not dream of failing to meet.Frank Wells heads Warner Brothers, and he's no climber, either. But back when this middle-aged executive was a 22-year-old Rhodes scholar, he climbed Mt. Kilimanjaro; and at its summit, he dreamed of one day climbing the highest peak on each of the world's seven continents. When he's introduced to Dick Bass as a potential partner for organizing and financing climbs, as well as for making them, he shares that long ago dream. No one has done it before, so Dick and Frank decide they will be the first. After they both learn how to climb, that is...!Climber/author Rick Ridgeway tells the story of this unlikely duo's pursuit of their goal partly from his own viewpoint, after he becomes part of their project, and partly from their accounts and from interviews with others involved at one time or another. The result is a readable although not polished true adventure that is also an interesting character study. I enjoyed it on both levels - as a climbing tale, and as the story of how their quest changed both men.--Reviewed by Nina M.

Why they decide to climb the seven summits, the highest mountain on each of the seven continents! Their attempts to snare their trophy mountains makes for a rip rollicking good read. What is most remarkable is that one of them actually manages to summit each and every one of the seven mountains in question.The account of their adventure runs the gamut of the human experience: humor, pathos, joy, and ultimate success. Their achievement is incredible, considering that they were middle aged, novice climbers. Yet their grit and determination, coupled with a seemingly endless cash flow, allowed them to hob nob with the mountaineering elite and, ultimately, enables one of them to achieve their collective dream.These are two men who, when looking back on their lives, will never find themselves in the position of saying \\"would've, could've, should've\\". They dared to live their dreams. Would that we were all so inclined. In any case, their adventures during their remarkable quest make for some very absorbing reading.

The good news was they were rich and very determined. The bad news was they were middle-aged and novice climbers.The seven summits vary in difficulty. Australia's Koscuisko is only 7,310 feet and families regularly hike to the top. Mt. Kilimanjaro in Africa is not a dangerous challenge. But there is also Mt. McKinley, known for its vicious storms; Mt. Vinson in Antarctica, mind-numbingly cold and a logistical nightmare, and then the one Dick Bass christened \\"The Big Mother,\\" Mt. Everest.This is their story, and it is inspiring. Before it is over, you feel as if Dick Bass is one of your best friends. He combines high good humor, tenacity and perseverance. The man is a modern miracle. Frank Wells is a more reserved, executive type, an excellent organizer with will power to spare.Rick Ridgeway, a writer and world-class climber, tells the story. The pace is good while they are on the mountains, and the book has excellent descriptive sections on the difficulties of the ascents. Unfortunately, Mr. Ridgeway does not have an ear for dialogue. Direct conversations have all the informality of a voice mail menu. There are unbelievable frustrations and red tape when preparing and mounting an expedition. I could have done with fewer blow-by-blow accountings of each and every hurdle that had to be overcome before the expedition could take place. This was especially true of Everest and Mt. Vinson. The last chapter is the successful summiting of Mt. Everest by only one of the pair.

It was two successful businessmen who had achieved in their careers showing extreme determination to do the seven summits. It was sheer guts and determination that got them up all seven (Bass)and six (Wells). They did not buy there way to the top any more than a climber does when he hires a guide.

He proved this in &quot;Butterfield 8&quot; and &quot;Ten North Frederick,&quot; but never better than in &quot;From the Terrace.&quot; Alfred Eaton, his driving, driven anti-hero, ranks with his earlier Joey Evans in terms of being a rogue with style. You like and envy him while despising everything he stands for. More than anything, though, you pity him. You realise, long before he himself does, that what's driving him is his desire to outshine his domineering father and over-achieving older brother, dead of meningitis at age eleven. Alfred Eaton is a rogue, but one with a conscience, something he doesn't realise ultil it's almost too late. A stunning character study and a stunning book, which, some 41 years after it was written, still packs a wallop."},{"Title":"From the Terrace","review":"I was interested in reading this novel after seeing the Paul Newman-Joanne Woodward movie on American Movie Classics one evening. To my surprise and great pleasure, the book is far better than the movie -- although it doesn't hurt one's appreciation of the characters to imagine those two talented movie stars speaking their dialogue. At nearly 1000 pages in length, the book requires a major commitment on the part of the reader, but O'Hara never disappoints. His story moves along at just the right pace, and the growth -- or lack thereof -- of his characters is a revelation. I particularly recommend this work to anyone who seriously wants to write a historical novel, because its structure and style are very instructive of how to work in the genre to maximum effect. This book introduced me to a writer whose work is no longer very accessible, either in libraries or on web sites such as these -- and more's the pity for it. What appeared to be a dry, overwritten potboiler of no special distinction turned out to be an engrossing story of one man's desperate search for the love that had always eluded him. I recommend this novel enthusiastically to anyone who finds contemporary popular fiction dissatisfying. And for the average reader, the best part of finishing this book is the knowledge that there's more of John O'Hara's work yet to be discovered."},{"Title":"From the Terrace","review":"This was my favorite book for about a decade, so it is difficult to write this review. I read it four times - all between the ages of 18 and 27. What did I love? It's tough, funny, and creates a vast and quite realistic panorama of northeast Pa. society in the early 1900s, Long Island society in the 1920s, NY investment banking, Hollywood in the 1930s and 1940s, Washington during WWII. The writing is sharp, acerbic, extraordinary in its thorough descriptions of people's faces, haircuts, favorite drinks, cars, hats, umbrellas, cufflinks, watches, gloves, and what they signify socially. O'Hara is justly famous for the realism and biting wit of his dialogue, the great and easy flow of his narrative. One feels that there are ALWAYS many characters in his novels and short stories about whom others will say &quot;oh, smart guy, eh?&quot; and &quot;take a poke at him&quot;, which is fun. It was all thrillingly adult when I was that age to read these - &quot;ah, so that's the kind of sophistication I have to look forward to&quot;.Elements I've since noticed: - O'Hara seems to feel that to tack on bleak endings for his most-liked characters is to be smart and naturalistic - yet in this case, the (quite vivid) Alfred Eaton character simply seems stronger than this. O'Hara also has a conventional sense of &quot;normal sex&quot;, outside of which the reader is to know the character is truly evil (i.e., unable to love). O'Hara packs his novels with coincidence - as an adult, I have been truly disappointed that I DON'T run into acquaintances in restaurants, theaters, trains all the time! Finally, O'Hara's virtuous characters do not come across nearly as realistically.In summary, O'Hara is limited - perhaps most by his times and his perception of the permanence of what are really quite transitory measures of quality in people. However, he's still very enjoyable to read. I think Updike wrote once that in the Orient, he'd be known as &quot;Old Man Who Loves Writing&quot; and that is perfectly true - the reader feels it. He's VERY readable, intelligent, but perhaps not truly wise in the more abiding of matters."},{"Title":"From the Terrace","review":"John O'Hara once said that one of his driving instincts in writing was to chronicle the first half of the 20th Century. A great deal of his large body of work does just this. \\"From the Terrace\\" is not only one of his best novels, but is sound history as well. We are introduced to poor Alfred Eaton who overcomes a bad childhood to become a success as an adult to become .... perhaps what he was meant to be all along. It's part Man in a Gray Flannel Suit and part Greek Tragedy. As to what it chronicles: the old boy WASP network of prep school / Harvard or Yale or Princeton / club life. One's early life provides networking forever for the fortunate upper class white male in that upper class. One sees how these same males get tapped during WW2 to fill the better positions opening up in Washington thanks to the war effort. O'Hara excels at the tiny details that expand in your mind to tell an entire story. His dialogue (particularly between men and women) sounds true. Given the time in which he wrote, O'Hara got away with a lot of explicit sex. The lead character commits adultery and is all the more happy for it. If you've seen the movie with Paul Newman and Joanne Woodward, you should know that the book does not end with Paul Newman walking down a Manhattan street happy to be able to marry his mistress. In the book, he marries a second time, his naval career ends, and he finds his life taking a new turn."},{"Title":"From the Terrace","review":"I discovered this book by looking up a clue in a crossword puzzle and felt intrigued to read it. What I found interesting which I haven't picked up in other reviews is the relevancy of emotional themes to our own lives. The complex relationships Alfred Eaton has with his father, mother, wife, mistress, nearly everyone he has a relationship with could be attributed to an emotionally distant father during his childhood however it's his self-centeredness on his career and social standing that contribute to his miserableness and the sheer lack of appreciation of his family and especially his children is akin to our generation of white-collar workers who are obsessed with material success. Alfred Eaton reminds me of at least half a dozen friends who are in loveless relationships with their spouses, leveraged to the hilt in debt, strangers to their children, and in a word, desperate. As depressing as this sounds, this is an enlightening read."},{"Title":"From the Terrace","review":"Where else can one learn of the details of early 20th century America than in O'Hara's novels. Much underrated as a writer particularly his short stories. I enjoy his work like the Lockwood Concern so much. He is the Faulkner of eastern PA.I have seldom read such great dialogue with local characteristics. His conversations between men and women as they explore and fulfill their own sexuality are unequaled.

I've worked in bookstores for many years and have flipped through several copies of this book and have never once seen a copy with the introduction in it.

Everyone in our small town worked at the steel mill until its closing."},{"Title":"From the Terrace","review":"It's a turgid, self-important piece of trash, but I found it impossible to put down. (I also felt vaguely bilious after reading it, rather like I had eaten too much cheap candy at one sitting). It's not nearly as entertaining as the movie, and it isn't even great trash (e.g., &quot;David Copperfield&quot;), but he knows how to spell and can describe things fairly well (unlike Steele and Balducci) and he can tell a story (unlike Harold Robbins) reasonably well. One thing that interests me about these &quot;organization man&quot; novels of the 50's is how alike they are in &quot;texture&quot; (or something), even when they are about very different things. For example, there is something about &quot;Cash McCall&quot;, &quot;The Man in the Gray Flannel Suit&quot;, and this book that seem quite similar, but the plot summaries of these books don't overlap at all. I think that it's a sort of existential nausea that permeates the pretentious popular writing of the time. (It doesn't get into the movies made from these books, though.)Anyway, this book is about a guy who is so damaged by his childhood that he throws away his integrity to be a &quot;success&quot;, and then throws that away, too. But since you don't like the guy, it doesn't bother you to watch him self-destruct. (Paul Newman plays an entirely different person in the movie, as you would guess.)"},{"Title":"Water Wars","review":"The author, Diane Raines Ward, is obviously passionate about this subject--she has traveled the world and seen with her own eyes the good and the bad of water 'management.' She does not make assumptions, she does not make sweeping generalizations--she examines each dam, river, levee and irrigation system individually, thereby proving how complicated the water wars are. Her passion for the subject also makes the book quite readable; it is written more like a novel than a scientific treatise. My only complaint is the complete lack of maps and diagrams, but that does not stop me from giving the book 5 stars."},{"Title":"Water Wars","review":"Water is becoming the hottest topic of discussions about the environment and this book is the first and the best on the subject.Water 101.

Excerpts from that review appear on the back cover and first page of &quot;Snort 2.1,&quot; published only 14 months later. I still think &quot;Snort 2.1&quot; is overall the best Snort book available, but I was disappointed by signs of rushed production and lack of coverage of key Snort features.The table of contents for &quot;Snort 2.1&quot; is deceiving, as it is almost exactly the same as &quot;Snort 2.0.&quot; However, the new book is almost 200 pages larger than its predecessor, with many internal modifications. Chapters 1, 2, 3, 4, 9, 11, 12 and 13 are either completely new or substantially new. Chapters 5, 6, 7, 8, and 10 are either partial rewrites or have some material added or dropped. Despite all of this work, &quot;Snort 2.1&quot; fails to spend time on key subjects, which I will mention during a chapter-by-chapter examination of the book.First, I recommend skipping ch 1. Aside from some general IDS advice, it is haphazard and contributes nothing to the core Snort discussion. Ch 2 is a quick overview of Snort capabilities, and should have been the lead chapter. Ch 3 describes Snort installation, but suffers apparently swapped figures (3.1 and 3.2) and a wrong figure (3.5). Ch 3 is still a nice upgrade from its counterpart in &quot;Snort 2.0,&quot; which gave hints for deploying Snort on Red Hat Linux 8.0. The new ch 3 covers Linux, OpenBSD, and Windows.Ch 4, &quot;Inner Workings,&quot; is one of the reasons &quot;Snort 2.1&quot; has an advantage over the competition. It's tough to go wrong when Snort's developers describe the tool's operation. Still, signs of rough editing appear on p. 170 and 191, and the &quot;-a cmg&quot; switch should be &quot;-A cmg&quot;.Ch 5 covers rules, and is a big disappointment. For most users, rules are the primary means to customize Snort. Like &quot;Snort 2.0,&quot; ch 5 fails to help readers with some of the more important new Snort rule options, like byte_test, byte_jump, distance, and within (available since 2.0.rc1 in Mar 03). Ch 5 implies on p. 145 that running Snort with -v is a good idea, despite every other recommendation in the book that verbose mode is a performance killer. Also, the IP &quot;sec&quot; option mentioned on p. 205 is not &quot;IPSec&quot; -- see RFC 791. Overall, ch 5 spends too much time restating rule information found in Snort's manual, and not enough time on features available even in Snort 2.0.Ch 6's discussion of preprocessors is a solid chapter, with new material on Snort's flow module, http_inspect, and perfmonitor. The telnet preprocessor section is one of the better examples of a &quot;code walkthrough,&quot; where the author shows code while explaining what it does.Ch 7 is really showing its age. &quot;Snort 2.0&quot; was behind the times when it said &quot;Unified logs are the future of Snort reporting,&quot; and &quot;Snort 2.1&quot; makes the same mistake. Barnyard, a means to read unified logs, was available in Sep 01! Ch 7 also misses the boat on XML output, calling it &quot;our favorite and relatively new logging format&quot; on p. 322. The XML plug-in spo_xml wasn't even part of snort-2.0.0, never mind snort-2.1.0. Basic research would have revealed Joe McAlerney's announcement of Silicon Defense's snort-idmef XML plug-in in Jun 01, followed by Sandro Poppi's assumption of the project in Aug 03. A mention of Barnyard's &quot;XML formatting capabilities&quot; appears in ch 7 on p. 322, yet Barnyard does not offer this natively.I was happy to see Sguil addressed in ch 8, but sad to see Sguil's use of session and full content data not appreciated for its true worth. Ch 9 does a good job describing Oinkmaster and gives sound advice on avoiding the &quot;not any&quot; rule negation problem. Ch 10 covers really old testing tools like Sneeze, whose stateless operation cannot fool stream4's stateful inspection.Ch 11, explaining Barnyard, is clearly the book's shining moment. This is the reason I read &quot;Snort 2.1&quot;: Barnyard's author, Andrew Baker, describes Barnyard's history, the format of unified logs, and how best to use his contribution to Snort. Bravo. Ch 12 was also very good, using case studies to compare three different &quot;active response&quot; choices. Ch 13 was new but not exceptionally helpful.I would enjoy seeing three improvements in the third edition. First, thoroughly scrub the book for old information. Watch out for people writing about &quot;Cerebus&quot; or http_decode or offerings from Silicon Defense, whose Web site disappeared in early 2004. Second, tell people to read the excellent Snort manual before reading the book. There's no need to address topics well-covered in the manual, like all of the IP- and TCP-based rule options. Third, ditch the existing rules chapter in favor of two new ones, one explaining principles via existing rules, and one showing advanced rule development.I still recommend buying this book, but you might guide your reading choices by the comments in this review."},{"Title":"Snort 2.1 Intrusion Detection, Second Edition","review":"If you want to know about Snort 2.1, one of the best open source intrusion detections systems available, then &quot;Snort 2.1 Intrusion Detection, Second Edition&quot; is the book you will want to have. This is an extensive examination of the Snort program and includes Snort 2.1 on CD with the Book.The authors start with defining what an intrusion detection system is, what it is not, and how placing it in your network at different points achieves different goals. This is followed by an introduction to Snort and a description of its capabilities and functions before getting into the nuts and bolts of installing and configuring it.One of the more difficult parts of Snort to understand is how to write the rules that determine when an intrusion has occurred. The authors do an excellent job of describing exactly how to write good rules to achieve the results you want. They even include an excellent section on how to deal with all that information you will be collecting.&quot;Snort 2.1 Intrusion Detection, Second Edition&quot; is highly recommended for anyone who wants a good, useful explanation of how an intrusion detection system should work and how to implement Snort to achieve that result."},{"Title":"Snort 2.1 Intrusion Detection, Second Edition","review":"I was concerned this book may fall into the &quot;second edition trap&quot; of search and replace 2.0 with 2.1. Upon thorough reading, this is obviously not the case. The authors have thoroughly documented all new/enhanced features of 2.1, but more importantly they again break new ground by by providing unique, creative, and thoroughly useful information on things like writing rules, the intricacises of preprocessors, etc. They don't just teach you how to USE snort, they teach you how to think about using Snort (and other tools) to better defend your network. The chapter on Barnyard in particular was very interesting, and it's obvious from following following the Snort site/list that a lot of the new features were develped in conjunction with the writing of this book.

If you already have a good understanding of IDS technology you may find the IDS discussion to be a bit general in nature. For someone who only wants to review the basic IDS principals quickly and without a great deal of extra detail the IDS coverage in this book is sufficient. Much of the information on Snort felt like a retelling of Snort Users Manual from the Snort web site. Part of this feeling may be due to the fact that members of the Snort development team who undoubtedly had a hand in the user's manual wrote this book. This book does go into more detail on some subjects than the Snort Users Manual. There is a good step by step set of instructions for installing Snort and associated software on either a Windows or a Linux system.

However, the newest books(about two out there) on Snort, including this one, only covers up to version 2.1. And according to the Product Description, \\"in this community, major upgrades are noted by .x and not by full number upgrades as in 2.0 to 3.0\\". This pretty much means that this book is already out-dated, and it's printed in 2004, less than a year ago. This reminds me of when Linux was starting to get popular. Red Hat Linux went from version 6.2 to version 9.0 in just two years. Not to mention there are tons of books supposely dedicated to all those versions of Linux in the short two year period. Linux saved businesses a lot of money, and provided stability that MS Windows counterpart didn't. Snort will eventually replace or be at the same level as the current commercial Intrusion Detection Systems(IDS).I think this time the publishers are smarter, and recognized the pattern from their Linux frenzy publishing experience, lol. The old Linux books litter the thousands of bookstore shelves with nobody buying, lol.

This fourth biggest island in the world, also known as the \\"Eighth Continent\\", is located 200 miles off Southeast Africa. It's as remote from the United States as you can get.In an absolutely scintillating, evocative photo essay, prominent wildlife and nature photographer Frans Lanting explores the essence of this little-known land. Lanting's four-color photographs, in large format, are almost surrealistic at times, ever exciting, and never repetitive. From the cover onward, the show chameleons, lemurs, bottle-shaped baobab trees, needlepoint karst landscapes, eroded fields, and matchless vistas in an unending procession of the strange, eerie, and beautiful. You will be amazed as each page turns to the next. An excellent written narrative compliments the effort well.The title is double-edged for, as well as being a fascinating anachronism, Madagascar is running out of time in our generation. Human encroachment is rapidly destroying the habitat of numerous creatures found nowhere else. The Elephant Bird, Aepyornis, whose giant egg is being held in a man's arms in the book's cover photo is gone. So is the giant lemur. Others may soon go, as well. This was, and would be, an unspeakable tragedy.So read the book and enjoy. Then see what you can do to save at least some of this fascinating paradise.I rate this book very highly."},{"Title":"Madagascar: A world out of time","review":"This out of print book came to me in a timely fashion and in great condition. I first laid eyes on it at a University library about 10 years ago and it inspired me and my husband to take a 3 month journey to Madagascar. It was an amazing trip and this beautiful photo book captures what we saw in our trip better than our own photos, doing the wonders of Madagascar justice in the glossy large format. I only wish I'd bought it sooner!"},{"Title":"Remote Control","review":"In a situation where Tom Clancy would waste five pages of techno-weenie jargon explaining exactly how a motion detector works, former SAS sergeant Andy McNab writes a few short sentences on how to beat one.McNab's main character, Nick Stone, describes himself as a 38 year old man with a lot on his mind and not much in it. Nothing ever goes quite as Nick plans and the results are thrilling, often quite funny and sometimes more than a little sad.If you are looking for a book to take along on a trip to read at the airport or on plane, this one would be tops. A fast read that makes killing time enjoyable."},{"Title":"Remote Control","review":"I read the abridged version of Remote Control and decided to read the unabridged version to see what I had missed. I discovered that I had missed nothing more than a large amount of swearing and plenty of graphic violence. I recommend this book to anyone, but would promote the abridged version as the better option, as the story is not adversely affected by the 'chopping' of several parts."},{"Title":"Remote Control","review":"Plenty of action/thriller writers can talk the talk, but only Andy McNab can walk the walk. That's why the Colombian drug cartels and the Provisional IRA still have contracts out on him. McNab doesn't have to imagine how these things work - he KNOWS, and he tells his tales in the sure knowledge that his plots and descriptions carry the authenticity that other writers lack.Remote Control follows agent Nick Stone through a storming story of IRA duplicity, murder and drug dealing. Curiously, at the time that I write this review, terrorist funding is hitting the world headlines following the despicable atrocities at the WTC and Pentagon. Andy McNab (with no foreknowledge of these events) points out that many citizens of USA have been funding the IRA for years. It's strangely ironic to be reminded of that now that USA needs the support of the rest of the democratic world. I guess one man's terrorist is another man's hero (?)I notice that other reviewers point to a seeming weakness in the story regarding Nick Stone's relationship with seven year old Kelly, whom he has saved from his parents' murderers. I think that this awkwardness between the two characters is quite intentional, highlighting the emotional difficulties of any special agent who is trained to kill without sentiment.Remote Control is a real page-turner of a book, delivering action that is just this side of out-of-control, and a plot that oozes authenticity. There's no doubt, almost from the outset, who the real villains are, but that doesn't lessen the suspense. How will Nick Stone get himself out of the mess and how will he save the little girl? Particularly since he's on a deniable mission and his British spymasters have disowned him. If you want to read a thriller that tells is as it really is, Remote Control is the book for you.... Five well-earned stars."},{"Title":"Remote Control","review":"Remote Control is an unbelievably exciting story about ex-SAS agent Nick Stone. While in D.C. on what is typically described as spy work, he discovers the vicious murder of an old friend and his family. He grabs seven-year-old Kelly, the only survivor of the massacre, and finds himself being pursued by his friend's killer(s). Now tangled in the &quot;world of IRA deals, drug cartels, and messy TransAtlantic politics,&quot; Nick doesn't know where to turn or who to trust. The best part of McNab's novel, however, is the characters. They are so real that they easily drag you into the story. I found myself gripping the book so tightly whenever they were in immediate danger, that my knuckles were bright white... have fun trying not to fall in love with Nick and Kelly!"},{"Title":"Remote Control","review":"If you liked any of the Rogue Warrior books, this book takes that same kind of wild ride, good time read to a new level. I have never read a book that I actually got an adrenaline rush from reading, but this one did that in spades. If you enjoy fast paced, non-stop edge of your seat reading, you will NOT go wrong here. To all the fans fron this book, I have also read his second book in the Nick Stone series that I picked up in England. It should be released in the US soon.......*GRIN*......so hang on, the fun doesn't stop here."},{"Title":"Remote Control","review":"This is a terrific read. McNabb's obvious knowledge of the subject matter makes this far more enjoyable than other books in the genre. If you're a fan of Tom Clancy (before he descended into political diatribes), you'll love this book. The political intrigue is well done, the intricate explanations of the spy game are incredibly believable, and the story moves along at a great clip. I picked this up at the airport and couldn't put it down until we landed.I can't wait for the next book from McNabb!"},{"Title":"Remote Control","review":"As a highschool student i had to read a fictitious work by a British author.

So when the Firm called him in, Nick expects the worst because any scenario he plays in involves the deniable operations of the British Secret Intelligence Service. Instead, the Firm offers him a fastball assignment that he immediately accepts. He trails two members of the Provisional Irish Republic Army from Shannon to Washington Dc to learn who they meet.Everything goes perfectly for Nick until he calls for assistance to tap the hotel room of his marks. Shockingly, he receives instruction to lift off immediately. Since Nick has time before his flight back to England, he visits an old war buddy. When he arrives at his friend's home, Nick finds Kevin, his spouse, and one of their children brutally murdered. Nick escapes with the other child, seven years old Kelly. He tries to make contact with the Firm, but fails. The American police think he is the killer, but he knows that professionals like himself murdered his friend. He knows he must first prove his innocence before the Firm reels him and Kelly back to safety.REMOTE CONTROL may be the espionage book of the year as the suspense never lets up until the final page. If any literary character in recent years seems like an operative, Nick is that individual. Kelly adds an extra measure of tension. The incredible story line shows that Andy McNab has insider's knowledge that he details within the exciting plot. The tale seems so authentic, readers will be checking every stranger in any public place they visit, courtesy of Mr. McNab's talent.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Remote Control","review":"This book ROCKS!!

McNab gets a couple of the guns wrong and I thought the name Nick Stone, to be a little lame in the start. But, overall, I never got bored and really enjoyed the book.

I WANT MORE!"},{"Title":"Remote Control","review":"After reading Bravo Two Zero and Immiediate Action a Novel was the next obvious step and I was not disappointed. Mcnab's first 2 books gave attention to detail of life in the SAS and in his first Novel this theme is carried over. Once you begin reading you are transported into the story with graphic descriptions making you view exactly what is going on as if you are really there. This book is full of surprises and is a story of an Ex-SAS man who becomes involved in a murder whilst on an undercover security operation. After his former colleagues' family is wiped out in a murder he must protect the only survivor, an 8 year old girl. The story takes many twists and at times can be quite funny with an ' Ex-SAS hard man' having to 'unofficially adopt' the 8 year old girl, protect her from the baddies and learn to live with her 'alien' habits."},{"Title":"Remote Control","review":"I picked this book up in Amsterdam durng the summer of '98. I had read both of McNab's books prior and saw it in a train station and figured WTF. It's not a bad book and McNab has come up with a good story line. I think there are a few lame points in the book (Nick Stone, come'on is this a porn flick ?) and some of the gun and fights are a tad off. But, for someone who wasn't taught to be a writter, it's a darn good read. For those into the SAS, check out Cameron Spence's Sabre Sqd. I don't see it listed on Amazon and I picked it up in greece, but it's also about the Gulf War and he does a good job too."},{"Title":"Remote Control","review":"I am reading this book for the second time and it still retains it's surprises.

Kept me turning the pages when so often non-fiction bio-based books can be stale, so I was intrigued how this entry into fiction might go.For the most part McNab pulled it off as we get sucked into a tale whereby our hero has to protect the life of a seven-year old girl, Kelly. One criticism is that we could have seen a bit more from the girl's POV, and the depth of detail was at points a bit too heavy and so slowed down the action. But overall this was a sterling effort and I'm sure more will be seen of McNab in the fiction arena."},{"Title":"Remote Control","review":"This is the first book in a long series of Andy McNabb's fictional character Nick Stone.

Back in 1999 or 2000, I actually went to the the various Tyson's strip malls described in the book and have no doubts whatsoever that \\"Andy McNab\\" - whoever he may be - might actually have walked those same areas.It's probably also relevant that Tyson's Corner area is quite packed with intelligence agency support companies.Then McNab moves on to hotels in Crystal City, Virginia (only a couple miles away from Tyson's), which are immediately south of the Pentagon and - perforce - packed with yet more military intelligence activities.So for me Remote Control may have had a slightly different effect than on other readers: it begins with a detailed local geography and phenomenon which \\"McNab\\" has portrayed quite accurately even though in fiction."},{"Title":"Remote Control","review":"I have read several Andy McNab books on my Kindle since Christmas and I rate this as by far the best."},{"Title":"Remote Control","review":"From the start of the story, it's obvious McNab is not your typical thriller writer. There's an edge, a brusque matter-of-factness that reflects the the author's military service (much of it with British SAS). The attention to operational detail lends a sense of reality that is rare in other genre writing, yet somehow we don't get bogged down in the minutiae. And the action is brutal and visceral, no movie-style stylized fist-fights, instead there are vicious no-holds-barred fights (realistically, what happens when someone is fighting to stay alive) that frequently leave our hero worse for wear.Even more unusual for this genre, a child features prominently in the plot, and McNab accurately captures the sense of a non-parent adult trying to cope with a young child, except for one plot twist towards the end where the kid is unrealistically competent (you'll know it when you get there).If you have discovered McNab via his gripping true story inBravo Two-zero, his writing has the same quality in fiction. Well worth the read, and you'll probably end up with a bunch of later McNab books on your wishlist, like I did."},{"Title":"Remote Control","review":"Alright, I knew \\"who dunnit\\" pretty early on, but it was still a fun read.

After reading the first few pages I was hooked, it got my interest right away. Andy McNab maintains his successful down to earth writing style, he is descriptive but to the point, its rare you find yourself bored by a flood of inconsequential technical details.The character, Nick Stone, is like McNab an ex SAS soldier. He now lives his life doing deniable operations for the British intelligence agency. The rest you just got to read to find out.It's this book that opens the door to what I hope will be a very interesting and somewhat educating series of books. McNab's down to earth sense of things shows in the way he writes the book, Nick Stone is no super hero, he can't take out a whole regiment of soldiers with a few grenades and an Uzi. This is the kind of book I have been waiting for, a book written by a guy who knows what he is talking about, he knows his characters limits and he doesn't breach these, I only hope this is maintained through the series.I particulary like the obvious advertising placed in the book, it must be nice to be offered such a large sum of money to mention a product in your book, nice one Mr McNab!I give this book 5 Stars."},{"Title":"Remote Control","review":"I heard of Andy McNab through the letters pages of the excellent espionage comic &quot;Queen and Country&quot; by Greg Rucka. McNab came highly recommended from Rucka, a writer I hold in high regard, so I thought I'd give him a chance. To say the least, I was floored. &quot;Remote Control&quot; is as good a spy thriller as you're bound to find these days. It mixes excellent &quot;working field knowledge&quot; with high suspense. Moreso, you get the feeling that, as highly trained as Nick Stone is, he is still as vulnerable as you or me - not some invincible Bond-type figure. It makes the violence in the book all the more riveting when you take this into consideration.About the only flaw I found in the book is some minor points of characterization with the young girl, Kelly. Without giving away the plot, I will say that her reactions to her entire situation were a little too calm and understanding, especially considering her age. I doubt a real child of 8 or 9 would be able to keep a cool emotional head as she does throughout the majority of this book.That said, the end of this book, and how Kelly is involved, is absolutely stunning. A wonderful read! I look forward to reading more of McNab's work."},{"Title":"Remote Control","review":"This is a verry exciting story. I've almost read the book in just one breath!!"},{"Title":"Remote Control","review":"Brilliant! Superb! I could not put it down, and read it in just under six hours. Non stop brilliance and action."},{"Title":"Remote Control","review":"Not a bad book, although one would expect something more at the end. Only question is who is the real hero this time. When bullets fly, McNab is the hero, but when keyboards work overtime, someone else should get the appropriate credit. Come on, mr. McNab, you of all people should know that SigSauer pistols DO NOT HAVE SAFETY LEVERS! It takes just a little detail like this to give away the game... Anyway, not a bad book, not bad at all."},{"Title":"Remote Control","review":"Andy, for Godsakes, write what you know. Just because it's a novel doesn't mean that you have to ensure that it really is.The book started off with a believeable surveil and pop of some the Boyos in Gibraltar. A true action, and characteristic of many of the ops that go on all the time. But then, Andy, you have the main character trying to E&amp;E from the baddies whilst carrying an 8-year old girl as baggage. At that point, your book became a coffee-table ornament suitable for the occasional disciplining of one's pets.The tradecraft was sparse, but credible. Dialog was in character. For those who are offended by obscenities and potty-mouth, please understand that the &quot;F&quot; and &quot;S&quot; words are conversational staples of the Regiment. For a squaddie to not potty-mouth is similar to tying one's hands and not being able to speak or communicate. As for me, I'd have slapped a strip of tape across Kelly's mouth. No words or comments are needed from you, my Miss. In reality, Kelly wasnt' a true form character anyway. Andy, you know Kelly would have been either ditched or become baggage that eats and does things at inopportune times.&quot;Remote Control&quot; was a good show for the first time attempt at a novel. Still, it went on remote and cruise control with a relatively predictable ending. Andy, you know that one's friends are often one's most dangerous enemies, that people are &quot;used up,&quot; that there's always a shiny Ned-the-New-Lad to replace you and any day that you can see the sunrise is a bonus. Write what you know - the truth will scare the public. There are plenty of great stories, with unbelievable twists and turns, triumphs and absolute betrayals whilst on a soggy lay-up in the &quot;Bandit Country&quot; of South Armagh or dealing with the Boyos of Tyrone acting up in Germany or Spain. Stay with what you know and the only thing left is to write the deposit slip."},{"Title":"Remote Control","review":"It is a long time since i read a book that slow and boring.But now i know a lot about the streets and hotel rooms in Washington D.C.I also know how to operate an old VHS tape-recorder.Everything is just so slow and detailed that u will probably go to sleep very fast.I did."},{"Title":"Remote Control","review":"I read a book a day. FINALLY a real &quot;page turner&quot;. The beginning is a little slow and seemingly disjointed. Don't give up. It'll make sense later. The ending could have used one more paragraph. Enjoy the ride."},{"Title":"Remote Control","review":"Experienced SAS operator Andy McNab deserves credit for sparing us the predictable Hollywood-style action novel. He keeps things realistic: long on tradecraft details and short on gratuitous action.Beneath a thin international intrigue veneer, what we really have here is an unromanticized glimpse into the tedious, unexciting day-to-day drudgery of witness-protection work. Spywork, fights and shoot-outs do take place, but the writer shows great discipline and keeps the bang-bang restrained within the context of the mission at hand.If you're expecting spec ops action a' la Rainbow Six, sass like Richard Marcinko, or spy dramas in John Le Carre's style, you'll have to go elsewhere.I vote 5 stars for realism, 3 stars for overall reading enjoyment. In any event, Andy McNab looks to have a very promising future as a writer of special operations novels."},{"Title":"Remote Control","review":"For totally raw, in your face, absorbing, thriller action this book is a must.Most definatly the best book I have read. Although a little formula in plot it doesn't really matter. The only book I have read twice ... the ending is something else! enjoy"},{"Title":"Remote Control","review":"Excellent Book, I simply couldn't put it down. The story is about an SAS Soldier working undercover following two PIRA Soldiers. They are followed to Washington, where it all goes terribly wrong."},{"Title":"Remote Control","review":"First of all this is not a review! So if you want one stop reading. First, for the second review listed: he wouldnt have gotten any of the guns wrong! What do you think he trained with for ten plus years?! I have read both of his non-fiction books (that are excelent and should be bought immediatly)and I wish he wouls write another one carrying on after Bravo Two Zero. I can only assume that this one is as good as his others. Tell me is it?"},{"Title":"Remote Control","review":"Andy McNab's first thriller is a top-notch combination of violent action,pulse-pounding excitement and edge of your seat suspense.In \\"Remote Control\\" McNab introduces a new hero, Nick Stone, who makes mostother famous fictional heroes look like prancing twits (can you say \\"Dirk Pitt\\"?) Anex-SAS operator and current deniable ops specialist for Britain, Stone is somethingof a cross between Hammett's Continental Op and Alistair MacLean's PhillipCalvert: tough as jacketed hollow points, totally on-task, and cunning enough tobeat the bad guys at their own game. Nick Stone has more life in him (and moreblood and soul) than any action hero this side of Pendleton era Mack Bolan.The action in \\"Remote Control\\" never lets up for more than a few pages, and evenwhen Stone isn't facing guns and fists he's deep into the task at hand and planning2 or 3 moves ahead so that the pace just keeps up and the tension builds.Stone has to work against a plot without any help after he finds the family of afriend murdered. On the run and out in the cold with his friend's seven year olddaughter in tow, Stone uses his training, intelligence and toughness to bestadvantage. And just when he's past one challenge, an even greater one confrontshim. The story is told in first person and it really sounds like authentic dialogue.This is like the golden age of Len Deighton's spy writing but with a tougher andmore realistic hero. Hard-boiled stuff!The great relationship between childless Stone and seven year old Kelly is awonderful thing in this book. I think I worried as much for him when he had tofinally tell Kelly her family was dead as when he was in any of the many deadlyencounters in the story. McNab obviously knows something about children andKelly's character is so real it makes the reader very frightened for her safety.The cover quote from author Stephen Coonts claims McNab is \\"the best suspensethriller writer. . . since Alistair MacLean\\" and I can't argue with that. This book waseverything you'll want in a thriller. I can't wait to start the next one!This is a 5 star effort if ever there was one. Read it."},{"Title":"Remote Control","review":"REMOTE CONTROL is an exciting, bullet flying, rib cracking, guts spewing story about an ex-SAS man, Nick Stone, who gets caught up in the vicious murder of an old friend and his family. Rescuing the only surviving member of the massacre a seven-year-old shell shocked little girl called Kelly, Nick goes on the run, and finds out that even friends are potential enemies in a world of IRA deals, drug cartels and messy TransAtlantic politics. This is a knuckle bitingly good book and I spent the whole of an evening reading it from cover to cover. Andy McNab is as good a writer of fiction as he is of fact. I liked his hero because it showed the man to be human and not just a killing machine as SAS soldiers are often portrayed in many novels. I hope that McNab thinks of writing a sequel to REMOTE CONTROL as Nick Stone and Kelly make quite a formidable team. A big thumbs up for this cracker of a first novel."},{"Title":"Remote Control","review":"After reading McNab's &quot;Bravo Two Zero&quot; and &quot;Immediate Action,&quot; I thought I'd give his fiction a try. Overall this book is entertaining, with more action than recent vintage Clancy novels. The action is often quite intense and, in those moments, it is a real page turner. The technical and tradecraft details are what really make this book. McNab, or course, is all the more believable in these areas due to his personal experiences as relayed in his non-fiction work. He buys a credibility there that Clancy, et al. just can't match. Worth reading for that fact alone.While the story is good and the details better, the writing itself is sometimes clumsy. Maybe this is nitpicking, since the reality is that the writing somehow seems to &quot;fit&quot; the story (you wouldn't want Steinbeck or Hemingway telling the story, would you?). However, I suspect that the writing is simply due to first novel syndrome (I had no complaints about his writing in Bravo Two Zero), and would expect this to improve in future works.Although I only gave the book 3 stars, I'll definitely keep McNab on my &quot;read&quot; list."},{"Title":"Remote Control","review":"There are a few books that are so suspenseful and action-packed I have been unable to put them down. Remote Control is one of them. Ex-SAS 'K' Nick Stone is assigned to follow a group of Provisional IRA members on their way to Washington. His mission is cut short, but before leaving, he decides to visit a friend's family. At this point, McNab plunges the reader into a rollercoaster ride of emotions as Stone finds the family savagely murdered. From there on, the action does not stop - Stone finds himself and 7-year-old Kelly, the family's only survivor, pursued by mysterious forces intent on capturing them both. An array of supporting characters add to the drama - 'Slack' Pat the ex-SAS drug addict, Al De Niro the ex-mobster, Euan the best friend, and more. Stone himself is a brilliant creation, a hero with a sizeable share of ruthlessness - you can't help but wonder how much of McNab is in Stone. Remote Control creates a world which is brutal, thrilling and shockingly realistic - quite simply one of the best books you'll find."},{"Title":"Remote Control","review":"I absolutely could not put this book down! McNab has a gift for writing action. The tradecraft sure sounds believable to a civillian like me. The characters are a bit cardboard-like, and I wonder how much time McNab has spent with children, but who cares? I was completely sucked in from the first page. The fight in the PIRA office in DC is a stunner, and it's not even the best part of the book. I'm looking forward to McNab's next effort."},{"Title":"Remote Control","review":"This is the first book I've read from McNab but I'm sure I'll read more. Similar to the Rogue Warrior series, I like McNab a bit better. McNab is not quite as arrogant, but nevertheless, special forces must grow an in-your-face attitude.I particularly enjoyed the detailed observations and the reasoning behind the tradecraft actions. What's Nick Stone, the hero, doing looking inside a fire extinguisher? What's he going to make with the kitchen supplies? One always gets a bit more involved when the writing not only entertains but also educates.The relationship with Kelly also moves the story. Surely a SAS operative would have problems with relating to a seven year old but by the end of the book, it's quite believable how they have grown attached.I had only a couple of minor irritants. McNab's British background is evident as expected. However, some actions would get different reactions in the US. I can't believe a British citizen wouldn't draw more attention with an American child in tow. Particularly with the scratches and cuts gathered along the way during the characters romp through the seedy side of America. Who from England would want to stay in a hotel in the warehouse district?Also, as some of the other reviewers pointed out, the story is somewhat predictable. Even I could tell early in the book who the ultimate villans had to be. Nevertheless, REMOTE CONTROL was an enjoyable way to spend the weekend."},{"Title":"Remote Control","review":"From the first page all the way to the final one, Andy McNab's &quot;Remote Control&quot; was a gripping and fantastic read.Readers will follow the main character of Nick Stone from Gilbraltar to London and then on to the United States. While on what is termed a &quot;deniable assignment&quot;, Nick contacts a former SAS colleague, only to find upon his arrival at their home that Kev and his family have been brutally murdered. All but one.... their seven year old daughter Kelly.This story never loses its pace. Nick and Kelly are on the run from people trying to kill them at every turn. But it's the growing relationship between Nick and Kelly that I find truly memorable.At first Nick tries his best to protect the young girl from the forces closing in on them, only to slowly find himself growing to rely on Kelly with every turn of the page.I totally agree that this is a &quot;can't put down&quot; novel. Your heart will race at the clever twists and turns McNab has crafted. The supporting cast of characters are highly developed. From the dangerous IRA hitmen, to Stone's British employers at The Firm, to fellow SAS members Pat and Euan, all the way to the federally relocated mobster Big Al DeNiro. Each is a living, breathing character adding to the tension and brilliant storyline!This is a novel that begs a sequel so readers can see what further developments take place between Nick and Kelly. They are two unforgettable characters!Very well done, Mr. McNab!"},{"Title":"Remote Control","review":"Andy McNab's &quot; Remote Control &quot; is the greatest compelling story of real-life action in the world of Espionage, Politics, Terrorism, and Corruption. So far, it is &quot;The Best of the Best&quot;."},{"Title":"Remote Control","review":"You know how some people, when they tell a story, have to give you every...single...detail and by the time they get to the point, you are past caring. That's how McNab is -- only to add to the misery,his main character is dragging a little girl around with him. And we have to hear about every street they go down, every hotel room they inhabit. And, on one hand, the author makes you think that capture could come at any minute. Yet, the character has time to buy clothes for the little girl, right in the heat of the chase. Spare me! The book just plods along with little excitement and little plot development. In fact, the plot seems to go nowhere. McNab is better writing non-fiction. I can't understand all the positive reviews here. It must be a British thing."},{"Title":"Remote Control","review":"Recently, I acquired a copy of the Stephen Leather thriller,Hot Blood (A Dan Shepherd Mystery), which had on its front cover a sticker that screamed \\"Better than Andy McNab or your money back\\". Leather's ongoing fictional hero, Dan \\"Spider\\" Shepherd, is a former member of the SAS now working for an ultra-secret undercover unit of London's Metropolitan Police. Nick Stone, the protagonist making his initial appearance here in McNab's first novel, REMOTE CONTROL, is an ex-SAS trooper now working for MI6. What, do Leather and McNab have a mano-a-mano thing going? (I don't ever remember seeing a Dean Koontz release with the claim, \\"King writes dross; read my stuff.\\") When queried by me, Stephen said that his publisher suggested the ploy. But, since I did end up buying REMOTE CONTROL, perhaps the point is to sell more books from both.Here, Stone is tasked by his SIS controller to follow two hard IRA boyos to Washington, DC, to see what mischief they're up to. Once comfortable in his hotel room, Nick is almost immediately recalled home. But, before catching the next plane back across The Pond, Stone decides to visit old SAS pal Kev, now working for the DEA. Arriving at Kev's suburban home, Nick discovers his buddy bludgeoned to death and his wife and one of two daughters with their throats cut. Stone find's the second daughter, 7-year old Kelly, cowering in a hidey-hole. Realizing that Kelly saw the killers and her life is now in peril, and that he himself may become a suspect in the bloodbath, Stone grabs the girl and runs. Over the remainder of the book, our hero must discover the identity of the murderers, protect Kelly, and get both of them to safety in England where his boss, Simmonds, will certainly sort things out.For a first novel, REMOTE CONTROL is better than average. McNab's personal tour of duty with the SAS imparts a patina of realism to the actions of his Stone character. Indeed, Nick is a Tough Guy in somewhat the same vein as author Lee Child's ex-Army MP, Jack Reacher. At one point in a desperate, hand-to-hand struggle with a Bad Guy over control of a pistol, Stone must essentially chew the man's face apart. Somehow, I don't see Leather's hero doing anything so messy.One of the criticism's I've made of the Dan Shepherd series is the fact that Spider's young son Liam is trotted out as a prop in every installment to re-emphasize that widower Shepherd is otherwise a warm, decent, family man whose day job takes him to the world's hard and grotty edges. In REMOTE CONTROL, Kelly also starts out as a prop. But, by the conclusion, she plays an integral, nail-biting, and very satisfying part. I see from plot summaries that Kelly also appears in follow-up volumes of the Nick Stone series, so I've gone ahead and ordered the second out of curiosity to see where McNab takes the character.The drawbacks to REMOTE CONTROL are that we've seen the scenario before in books and films - adult and child flee a deadly conspiracy hand-in-hand - and, well before the end, the coming betrayal twist becomes all to obvious.By profession, Stephen Leather is a journalist who's lived all over the world. McNab - a pseudonym ostensibly to protect his identity from vengeful terrorists left over from his bad old SAS days - continues to work with intelligence organizations on both sides of the Atlantic. I suspect, therefore, that Andy's books will be more realistic in the finer points, while Stephen's will show a wider scope of imagination. In any case, both are excellent British authors creating some very entertaining reads.Hey, Stephen and Andy, why don't you both co-author a thriller in which both Dan and Nick appear? The potential for a friendly, or not so friendly, rivalry between the two heroes is almost too good to pass up."},{"Title":"Remote Control","review":"Remote control, is about a special K soldier called Nick Stone. Nick is on a secret mission in the USA, when his best friend and his family are murdered. The only one left in the family is a seven year old girl called Kelly. Nick and kelly, are being chased around the USA, trying to find safety. But who is friend and who is foe?"},{"Title":"Remote Control","review":"This is one of the best books I've ever read. The author clearly is an expert at spy stuff. There was one part where he disabled a motion detector with a clock and an egg carton, and there was another time when he blew up a house with ordinary kitchen materials. And the plot was really great. The way he depicted all of the espionage stuff was excellent. This is a really great book."},{"Title":"Remote Control","review":"this book had a twist that you would never expect, and all of mcnab's experience really adds on to the quality of the book. There was one incedint where he blows up a house with normal kitchen materials, and another when he nutrelizes a motion sensor with a clock and a milk carton. He also said in an interview that all of the experiences had actually happened to him."},{"Title":"Remote Control","review":"Good book, but in contrary to his book Bravo Two Zero and Chris Ryans books, this one does contain a few unpleasant tones of over-violence. The tone is that in an E&amp;E-situation, be as violent as possible, the main character would not hesitate killing a cop, since &quot;ultimately that is what they are paid for&quot;, etc. Too bad for an otherwise excellent book."},{"Title":"Remote Control","review":"As an amateur reader, this was the first Andy McNab I had ever read. On finishing the first Chapter, I felt intrigued to read on. In some parts of the book I felt the author went into a lot of detail which made me able to follow along with the plot easily. I felt that the end of the book was very gripping. The next book I will be reading will be the ever famous Bravo Two Zero, of which I have seen the film. I hope that this next book will be as good as &quot;Remote Control&quot;."},{"Title":"Remote Control","review":"This book was both exciting and suspenseful. I am really impressed with the quality of writing. It was a good length for a quick read. It was so realistic and I became attached to both Nick Stone and Kelly. Not many books I read have such memorable characters."},{"Title":"Remote Control","review":"It's hard to imagine McNab hasn't written fiction before--he's a natural. He tells the story with an ease that's befitting an accomplished writer, and with a knowledge base that can only come from having &quot;been there.&quot; I wouldn't call this book exciting from start to finish, because there are lulls in the action--but it holds your interest. Like FALSE ACCUSATIONS from another first-time author, Alan Jacobson, REMOTE CONTROL deals with someone on the run, and nowhere to turn. Both FALSE ACCUSATIONS and REMOTE CONTROL keep you guessing as to how it's all going to come out in the end...and both books keep you turning till that last page. I'd highly recommend checking out both. And I'm definitely looking forward to McNab's next book."},{"Title":"Remote Control","review":"This book has an excellent plot and is thoroughly suspenseful. A great &quot;chase&quot; scene. Unfortunately, however, McNab stretches the bounds a little too much when he has the character of eight-year-old Kelly act as the littlest spy, concocting bombs and searching PIRA headquarters. Stretching suspension of disbelief a little much. Also, his writing of the child's dialogue was weak. But, if you can overlook these flaws, it is an interesting read."},{"Title":"Remote Control","review":"Remote Control is really worth reading. Its full of details that makes the reader realize that heres an author who tried the drills himself. A sequel please!"},{"Title":"Remote Control","review":"On the book jacket Stephen Coonts writes that &quot;McNab is the best suspense thriller writer ...since Alistar MacLean&quot;. I did not realize that Mr. Coonts was old enough to know of MacLean, but I am. Andy McNab may not be the best since MacLean, but he is assuredly a fine writer. He has developed a close knit plot, cleverly inserting various possible clues and factions (PIRA, DEA, CIA, SIS, et al) into his storytelling. As a craftsman he has maintained continuity while providing the beginning, middle and end of the story, never leaving the reader in a lurch. &quot;The Guns of Navarone&quot; may have been better, but I read that about 40 years ago. I look forward to &quot;Crisis Four&quot;."},{"Title":"Remote Control","review":"With all due respect to Andy, I think he should stick with writing true crime/non-fiction books as he did before (&quot;Immediate Action&quot; and &quot;Bravo Two Zero&quot;; both great, especially the latter one).There is a good thing, though, that comes out of this book. I learned how to go into hiding, how to evade the enemy, how to conduct survaillance, how to lose people in the crowds, how to lie when checking into hotels, how to ditch cars and never use credit cards while on the run. Not to mention how to make home-made bombs using kitchen cleaners. It's a good guide on what to do while hiding from government agencies or 'other organizations'. &quot;A Fugitive's Manual&quot;.Otherwise, as a fiction novel, it's not all that good. But I still appreciate the tips!"},{"Title":"Remote Control","review":"You can read synopses of the story above - probably already did. I'd like to share my response to this book: I found it so gripping that my jaw was tight throughout the entire read - which, by the way, lasted all night since I couldn't put it down to go to bed. This is a suspenseful drama with characters who grow on you. (Did me, anyway.) An exciting story with what looks like real tradecraft sprinkled throughout the book.If you liked Clancy's Without Remorse, I think you'll love this book. If you like Clancy, look up McNab, and then Dean Ing. Ing used to write SF (which is so good that many non SF'ers enjoy them) but now writes (damfino what to call them. Let's try:) Techno-Thrillers.Can't say too much about Remote Control. If you like adventure, spy type novels, this is one of the best - most gripping and exciting."},{"Title":"Remote Control","review":"I guess it doesn't surprise me that the intellectual level of what one assumes must be an average SAS operator is fairly low. Given the political dirtbags who run such agencies these days, McNab probably quite accurately represents the conformity of thought and uncritical mindset of killers for hire.Tradecraft? Well, I'd love to see a veteran OSS operative run circles around this bozo.It's an interesting read if only for a look into the British soul. It reminds me once again why I feel revulstion towards most Brits; so thank you, McNab.As a purely technical criticism, directed more to the editors than the author, it's always a good idea to have an ending in a book. This one just sort of stops.... Maybe the last couple chapters got lost somewhere?"},{"Title":"Remote Control","review":"Great setting for a crime - everyone snowbound or snowblind perhaps. The psychologist/sleuth is only a husband bringing hiswife's purse to the hospital. A good read if you enjoy lawyers in trouble"},{"Title":"Remote Control","review":"this is the first of his i've read, and i was suitably impressed. Nick Stone strikes me somewhat as a more realist, more modern James Bond, an ex-SAS man, he now works for the &quot;deniable operations&quot; unit of the British secret service.The book is well written, and easy to read. the pace is fast, the plot is exciting and never lets up. the action is constant, and the ending is full of surprises.Stone is a likeable &quot;hero&quot;, and seems very human. His relationship with Kelly, the young girl he is trying to save, is touching and at times very sad. The book has a fierce realism, borne from the fact that McNab has been there, done that.I would reccomend it."},{"Title":"Remote Control","review":"After reading a fair number of thrillers, you can tell when someone is writing from knowledge and experience without even knowing anything about the author. Andy McNab has learned much from being in the SAS, and it shows-- Stone is one of the most cunning and believable characters in thriller fiction. I got the same feeling of excitement reading this book as I did when I first read Alistair McLean's early novels. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Remote Control","review":"This guy seems like the real thing. The special thing about this series is the hero's relationship to the little girl in his care.While much of the action seems fantastic, it never crosses over to unbelievability.Obviously, the author has been there and done it.Escapist reading of the highest order. First of the series."},{"Title":"Remote Control","review":"This exciting book about a man called Nick Stone. He is sent on a mission to follow two irish suspects. Everything was going swimmingly untill he went to his friends house...A great book with ups and downs a plenty. An exciting read with plenty of action yet not so much it ruins the book. A great book to read on journeys."},{"Title":"Remote Control","review":"I liked this book. Very similar to Richard Marcinko's Navy SEAL books. While Richard Marcinko goes into the technicals of warfare, Andy writes a story that is about human side of being SAS...and along the way we get to watch some good fight sequences.The story was good, and it didn't seem like Andy was trying to stuff it full of sensational violence or shoot outs. All round very interesting and entertaining. I look forward to reading some of Andy's other work.I was especially impressed with the orator/story teller (tape version.) He did a great job of putting all the voices together."},{"Title":"Remote Control","review":"Superb beginning - one of the few books I couldn't put down . Extremely realistic and exciting. However during the second part of the book I was put off by the heroes relationship with the little girl. I didn't find this convincing at all and so gave up interest having to skip the bonding nonsense. Stick to the action Andy, this is your strength and few can do it better - you know it makes sense!"},{"Title":"Remote Control","review":"This book makes you feel that you are living Nick and Kelly's adventure. Andy holds no punchs and tells it as it is. Anyone who has read any of his books will enjoy this classic spy thriller!"},{"Title":"Remote Control","review":"This book was great. I could not put it down. He had me in suspense the whole way through, making it seem like he was never going to get out of his situation. He works your emotions, from describing those terrible murders, to finding out his best friend had deceived him. This is a must read."},{"Title":"Remote Control","review":"It is said write about what you know, Andy McNab knows his trade-craft. The story is well plotted and moves quickly. However,the shadow group involving drug cartel,DEA and British Intelligence is poorly defined. The major flaw in a good novel is the ending, just left me hanging!"},{"Title":"Remote Control","review":"Remote Control was one of the best books I ever read. I couldn't put it down. It involves an SAS agent named Nick Stone who flies to the States to find his best friend and family murdered. The only one who survived is Kelly, his friend's daughter. They have to evade the police, which takes them all over the East Coast. As soon as they think everything is finally okay and they're in the clear,.....well, you'll just have to read it!

I used this book for a college level class and now find myself referencing it as I complete more advanced level classes and prepare to move to Germany. The authors do a great job of simplifying the grammatical points of the German language in clear everyday language. They also use many examples throughout the explanations to clearly illustrate the key grammar concept. I also appreciated the mini-review at the end of each chapter, as well as the list of the grammar concepts in the index. Finally, the list of valuable idiomatic expressions and relevant sayings is helpful to the student in many normal everyday situation whether it be in a classroom or in a normal everyday situation.

The only problem I have with this book is that at the beginning of each chapter are a few dialogues using grammar that hasn't yet been learned.

Ancient warriors in battle, horses at a gallop, stand out in colorful relief against a faded map of Arabia. That cover sets the tone for The Sultan, so T.J. Koll's skill as writer came as no surprise. From page one, I was hooked.The ongoing troubles in Israel, Desert Storm, 9/11, and now the war in Iraq -- via TV -- have set our national perspective on the Arab world in stone. T.J. Koll takes us back in time, brings to life a new, enlightened picture of the Muslim people and their struggles. With honesty and compassion, the author shows us both sides of a battle that has raged for centuries and will likely never end. The Sultan may be fiction, but to this reader at least every word rang true.We meet Youssuf Salah al-Din when he is a youth, watching his warrior-father die in battle at the hands of Christian Crusaders. Youssuf is Syrian, a Kurd, who vows revenge on the red haired knight who killed his father. Youssuf is a peaceful man who tries to live by the Qu-ran. He despises butchery and battle but is forced by circumstance to become a warrior. Ferocious in battle and blessed by Allah with a canny intelligence, Youssuf soon earns grudging respect from the Christian Knights occupying his homeland. They call him Saladin.Bloody skirmishes are fought with crossbows, scimitars, swords and spears. From Syria, to Egypt, and finally Jerusalem, Youssuf proves his skill and cunning against superior Christian forces. Jerusalem is the prize coveted by both Muslims and Christians. Youssuf must deal with politics and treacheries as both sides posture, quarrel and grapple for dominance. The Europeans understand that dividing ancient Arab foes will weaken their enemy. They play Egypt and Syria against each other as a means of furthering Vatican interests. Youssuf understands this and labors to maintain unity between the Arab nations.Along with realistic depictions of bloody battles, Koll beautifully describes the quiet of holy places and the sting of desert sand. His characters are richly developed and believable. The best and worst of both sides is honestly detailed. All knights are not blinded by hatred. All Muslims are not bent on killing every Christian. There are men of honor on both sides. Both Youssuf and a sympathetic knight he befriends -- Count Tripoli -- have a clear understanding of the fight between two faiths: Neither God nor Allah have a part in the miseries inflicted on humanity in their names. Man alone must bear that responsibility.T. J. Koll's first book is a winner. His writing style is a joy to read. It has my highest recommendation."},{"Title":"The Sultan","review":"This story was such a wonderful and exciting read. I couldn't put it down after the story started to come together...

What is dissapointing is there are no other books to pick up from this author.The author shows both the views from the Christian and Middle Eastern characters.

Staring with breakfast together and followed by grocery shopping and a visit to the park, a girl and her mother move through their day with true affection. With her illustrations of ruffled lavender nightgown, a protruding belly in the bathtub, a dandelion crown, sunshine yellow dresses and more, artist Ruth Ohi perfectly captures and showcases the familiar little details of childhood. Into My Mother's Arms is highly recommended for family, school, and community library picturebook collections for young readers."},{"Title":"Into My Mother's Arms","review":"&quot;Into My Mother's Arms&quot; is a charming story about a day in the life of a young girl and her mother. The beautiful, warm watercolor illustrations breathe life into the simple, yet sweet narration. My favorite illustration is of the mother brushing her daughter's hair. The scene that really stands out in the book is when they are at the park. The girl decides to go on the &quot;big slide&quot;. However, when she reaches the top she is unsure, but can't go back down because someone is behind her. But then she sees her mother at the bottom, smiling, and she gets the courage to slide down into her waiting arms. This is a wonderful book for mothers and daugthers."},{"Title":"Into My Mother's Arms","review":"I love this book. I have purchased for my mother and for friends who are mothers."},{"Title":"Into My Mother's Arms","review":"I was going to buy this book for a colleague who just had a baby girl, thinking it would be nice for them to read it together when the baby was older. However, I was put off by the illustrations. The mother looks very weary in many of the pictures, like she's not have enjoying her daughter at all. It's in sharp contrast to the text. Especially the scene where the girl is taking a bath. She rattling on about how she smells like her mother because she uses mommy's soap, while the mother is sitting there ignoring her and reading a book. Her hair is falling in her face and she looks very weary, like she just can't wait for the kid to finish her bath and get to bed. All in all, I found the artwork rather dreary and it made me tired to look at the mother. Mothers get tired enough chasing after small children, they don't need to read a picture book and see that as well. I don't recommend it, and am really surprised why the reviewer thinks the art is so wonderful. I'd give it a one star but the text is cute."},{"Title":"Into My Mother's Arms","review":"I agree with the reviewer who says the mother looks weary. In fact, I'll go a step further and say this mom looks very depressed, like she can't even hold herself up straight. The colors and sparseness of the pictures also further accentuate the feeling of depression. Even the mother's clothes--the girl brings her mother a dress because it &quot;makes her look like sunshine&quot; but the dress fits the mother like a sack that hangs to her ankles. The mother rarely smiles, her hair is unkempt and hanging all over her face, and in the scene where the little girl is bathing, mom is humped over while seated on a stool, and reading a book--like she couldn't care less if the kid drowns in the tub. I felt exhausted and dreary after I skimmed through this at a bookstore. My question was--why? The text is sweet, but why would a publisher print a book with such horrible pictures? Why not a cheery mom who is enjoying her daughter? Why this morbid look at a woman who looks like she can't stand the kid and is going to swallow sleeping pills at the end of the day? I don't profess to understand the publishing industry, but I don't understand the purpose of this God-awful book. I gave it a one star because the pictures totally overwhelm the text."},{"Title":"Nasd Series 6 Examination: Annuities and Mutual Funds (Admission Test Series)","review":"This is not a study guide!

His implied theory of religious evolution seemed a bit lacking and I didn't care for his branding of Pauline doctrine as an inferior religion to Christ's teachings.

It is certainly more than a &quot;what if...&quot;"},{"Title":"The Great Pyramid Decoded","review":"For the record, I have spent many years researching the Great Pyramid, and have written several books in my four-volume \\"Language of God\\" book series with substantial portions devoted to deciphering the true meaning behind this impressive stone pillar. In fact, in my book \\"The Language of God in Prophecy,\\" over 250 pages of the 590-page book are devoted to the Great Pyramid, which I call the Pillar of Enoch, and have named my Pillar of Enoch Ministry web site after. While writing my books, I read through Peter Lemesurier's \\"Great Pyramid Decoded\\", and though I found many of the drawings and diagrams helpful, the majority of the book's analytical sections are grossly in error due to the author's incorrect presuppositions concerning many aspects of this ancient monument.My book club version of Lemesurier's book is a very professionally produced hard cover full of colorful photos, and diagrams done with much care. Unfortunately, because Lemesurier totally misses the Zodiac connection of the Great Pyramid, and the fact that the Christian view of the Zodiac, called \\"the Gospel in the Stars\\" is a major key to deciphering it, the book is also filled with every sort of perversion and lie imaginable concerning the truth behind the structure's internal passages and chambers. For example, the author completely ignores the testimony of the 1st Century Historian Josephus, who said with conviction that - prior to the Great Flood - the righteous Sethites (and ancestors to Abraham and Israel) invented the science of Astronomy, and built two great stone structures in Egypt to record their findings, which were still standing intact at Josephus' writing! After doing exhaustive research, I am convinced that these two structures of Sethite origin could be none other than the Great Pyramid and Great Sphinx at Giza in Egypt.Totally contrary to the beliefs of the righteous ancestors of the Israelites, Lemesurier's book promulgates the idea that the Great Pyramid is a New Age type religious monument that says all faiths lead to God, and reincarnation and not Resurrection is the way to eternal life. For this reason, Peter Lemesurier's \\"Great Pyramid Decoded\\" is not listed in the extensive bibliography for my book \\"The Language of God in Prophecy\\" under \\"Pre-Flood Wisdom\\" because it is flagrantly Paganistic and New Age, asserting that all faiths are represented in the Great Pyramid's passages, and not just the Judeo-Christian heritage. For this reason, I have listed his book under \\"Paganism, False Religious Mythology.\\""},{"Title":"The Other Woman","review":"Judy Mamou touched my heart with her personal story of her life.

The recipes are simple, low fat, and most call for only a few ingredients, mostly staples if you do any pan-asian cooking at all. But the flavors are huge and every time I use this book people are amazed at the results. Really one of the very best cookbooks out there- I give it to everyone."},{"Title":"Savour the Pacific: A Discovery of Taste","review":"This is a beautiful book, well written, clear recipe steps and lovely phtotgraphy. I know many pacific islands have been heavily influenced by the Asian culture in various parts, but reading this book you would think they rule the region. The book is full of recipes like vietnamese roast chicken salad, satay chicken salad, chargrilled squid on soba noodles and duck wontons??? The recipes remind me of dishes you may find in a tropical bistro or restaurant, there to please and give the impression of being authentic and exotic but are far removed from the fact. Also if you are talking Pacific why not include Hawaii, at least it has some well known distictive recipes which could have been included rather than these other so called pacific dishes. The recipes are fresh and tasty (I love the tropical fruit bars) but nothing is particularly exciting and new.If you want a good book on pacific cooking you cannot look past the award winning Me'a Kai.

Ms Langbein uses primarily Asian ingredients, and Asian recipes to dress up food found in the Pacific. For example, she uses lots of coriander, sake, white rice vinegar, kaffir lime leaves. Admittedly, she does state in her introduction that \\"The recipes in this book do not represent the traditional cooking of the Pacific\\" but then why put \\"Pacific\\" in the title of your book? Why not call it \\"Savour Asian flavours\\". She condescendingly describes the traditional cooking of the Pacific to be \\"rather bland subsistence fare\\". I take exception to this, having grown up in a Pacific home. If she had spent any time in a real Pacific kitchen, she might have discovered that food from this region is as tasty as anything found in Asia (the area from where she REALLY drew her inspiration. Having said that, if you are after Westernised and Asianised (!) Pacific fare, then buy this book. If you want something more authentic, try Sam Choy's books.Now that I've had my rant and rave, there are good points about this book. Firstly, the stunning photographs by Keiran Scott are so vivid and inspiring, this could easily be a coffeetable book. Secondly, the recipes are laid out in a clear, concise fashion so you can easily see what you need and how to prepare each dish.One star for exploiting the Pacific to sell yet another Asian cookbook."},{"Title":"Savour the Pacific: A Discovery of Taste","review":"Nice book, great photos.

It is a miracle he was not killed on the battle front many times. It also shows the perfidious Albion trying hard to make alliances to out maneuver his plans of making Europe from France to Ural mountains.

But when Carpenter, an inarticulate, unsubtle Navy man, unburdens himself to his friend, he keeps getting off track, talking about his fear of gypsies, and how several times in his life he's literally had a gypsy's warning and disregarded it, only to have disaster strike - as in the case of his breakup, in fact.\\"The Hound of Death\\" - Really a science fiction story. Sister Marie Angelique once saved her convent from the Germans by calling down lightning on them, but not through prayer; she has visions of another life, whether future or past, where such powers were understood and disciplined. Alas, Dr. Rose at the sanitarium where she now lives in England not only takes her seriously, but with an eye to turning such powers to his own use...\\"The Lamp\\" - When Mr. Winburn, his widowed daughter Mrs. Lancaster, and his little grandson Geoff take #19 for a ridiculously low rent, she doesn't believe it's haunted, although a little boy starved there 30 years ago (having been ordered never to go out) after his father's arrest in another city. But her father hears the boy crying, and Geoff can see him and wants to help him. The title comes from Widburn's quotation of a poem, since he's convinced Geoff may indeed be able to help: \\"'What Lamp has Destiny to guide/Her little Children stumbling in the Dark?'/'A blind understanding,' Heaven replied.\\"\\"The Last Seance\\", a.k.a. \\"The Stolen Ghost\\" - Raoul Daubreuil takes it for granted that his fiancee Simone will give up her work as a medium after they're married - for one thing, it's destroying her health. But will the work - and her clients - allow her to retire gracefully? Clients like Madame Exe, who is determined to make contact with her lost little girl at any price...\\"The Mystery of the Blue Jar\\" - Jack Hartington lives to reduce his golf handicap. Unfortunately, he's only 24 and far from retired, so he gets up at six every morning for an hour's practice before work. Then he starts hearing cries for help every morning near a small cottage near the course - cries nobody else seems to hear.\\"The Strange Case of Sir Arthur Carmichael\\" - Sometimes titled 'Andrew' rather than 'Arthur' - one heck of a printer's error. The old baronet had 2 sons, and the pleasant Sir Arthur has been content to allow his middle-aged stepmother and little half-brother to go on living with him. She, for her part, is devoted to her own son, and has an uncanny air about her. Then, a month before young Sir Arthur's marriage, he's stricken with an extraordinary form of amnesia, and the narrator (a distinguished psychologist) is called in. Hmm. His stepmother certainly has a motive to see that he has no heir other than her son, but how could she have arranged *this*?\\"The Witness for the Prosecution\\" - See THE WITNESS FOR THE PROSECUTION AND OTHER STORIES."},{"Title":"The hound of death and other stories,","review":"This short story collection contains 12 stories, most of them having to do with the supernatural in some way. The most famous entry, and one that has no supernatural elements to it, is \\"Witness for the Prosecution,\\" which was later made into a well-received movie starring Charles Laughton. In it a young man is accused of murdering an elderly woman for her money; he has an air-tight alibi with his mistress, but on the witness stand she turns against him. His lawyer has his hands full, but finally finds a way to prove his innocence. Other good stories include \\"The Red Signal,\\" about a death warning revealed in a s&eacute;ance; \\"S.O.S,\\" about a dusty night table and a scrawled message for help; and \\"The Fourth Man,\\" about a girl with four distinct personalities. Many of the stories were later re-published in a collection renamed after its most famous story, \\"Witness for the Prosecution.\\" Fans of Agatha Christie's typical crime stories might be disappointed with this story collection, but there are still some interesting selections in it."},{"Title":"The hound of death and other stories,","review":"Trying her hand at writing into occultism and supernatural subjects, Agatha Christie failed to provoke new insights nor deliver any entertainment value.Several stories were outrightly occultic, such as the Hound of Death. These have got nothing to do with crimes.A couple of other stories such as the Blue Jar have some crime involved, and could be considered readable.What mystery and crime readers would normally expect from Agatha Christie was a thorough investigation of the paranormal, sifting the clues and evidence, and exhaust all possibilities before leaving it as ... unexplainable by known facts. Had Agatha Christie done that, the stories would have been much much more readable."},{"Title":"The hound of death and other stories,","review":"\\"The Hound of Death\\" is a change of pace for Agatha Christie and her fans. Unlike her typical Poirot and Miss Marple novels, \\"The Hound of Death\\" is a collection of twelve short-stories (previously published separately, many of which can be found in other Christie anthologies) that each have the supernatural as their central subject. Despite this unifying theme, the collected stories are still rather disparate, divided roughly into those that contain genuine paranormal phenomena, and those that are simply crime stories in which delinquents use fraudulent methods to make their victims believe the supernatural is at work.Despite supplying the title for the anthology, \\"The Hound of Death\\", along with \\"The Strange Case of Sir Arthur Carmichael\\" and \\"The Last S&eacute;ance\\" are atmospheric but rather ambiguous stories, to be expected considering these are the ones that deal directly with occultism. Touching upon past lives, mysticism and apparitions, they are rather vague and open-ended stories (at least for readers who are used to Christie supplying direct answers to her mysteries).To my mind, \\"The Fourth Sign\\" is the only story with an occult explanation that really works; a chilling story of three men who discuss the strange case of Felicie Bault and her multiple personalities, only to be joined by the testimony of an eyewitness who grew up with the girl in question. His story sheds new light on the case as he shares the tale of his childhood in a state orphanage with Felicie and another girl called Annette Ravel, the toxic friendship between the two girls, and Felicie's ambition and zest for life, even in the face of death.Christie seems on firmer ground when it comes to using her usual techniques of misdirection and red herrings in order to concoct crimes that may or may not be based in the paranormal. In \\"S.O.S\\", a doctor seeks out help in a country house after his car breaks down, only to find a strange family inside and a message drawn in the dust of his bedside table. In \\"Wireless\\" an elderly woman is astonished to find that her dead husband's voice is calling to her over her new radio, promising that he will come for her on the coming Friday. \\"The Mystery of the Blue Jar\\" involves a young golfer who can hear a terrible screaming coming from the vicinity of a nearby cottage - though no one else can.Defying categories are the remaining stories, in which the touches of supernatural are only tangential to the story itself, such as \\"The Red Light\\" and \\"The Gispy\\" which deal with premonitions of the future, and \\"The Call of Wings\\" and \\"The Lamp\\", which draw more on religious matters as Christie explores life after death and material worth.Finally, \\"The Witness for the Prosecution\\" deals with a case that is not only completely devoid of anything supernatural, but which never even pretends to. Mr Mayherne takes on the case of Leonard Vole, a man accused of murdering his elderly patron in order to inherit her fortune. He swears his innocence, and declares that his wife is able to provide an alibi, but Mayherne knows all too well that a devoted wife doesn't make for a reliable witness in the eyes of the jury. However, on visiting her, Mayherne is shocked to find that she is not as loyal to her husband as Mr Vole claims and insists that he is guilty of the crime. What's she really up to? This story feels a little out of place in this particular compilation, and can also be found inThe Witness for the Prosecutionand is of course the inspiration behind the filmWitness For the Prosecution.\\"The Hound of Death\\" won't please everyone, but for Christie fans it serves as an interesting selection of stories which are quite different from her usual fare but still stylistically recognizable as hers."},{"Title":"The hound of death and other stories,","review":"What a wonderful collection of short stories.

It is very similar in style and quality to &quot;The Diamond Hunters&quot;."},{"Title":"The Diamond Hunters (Heinemann Guided Readers)","review":"THE DIAMOND HUNTERS revolves around the mining of beach and offshore deposits for diamonds, and the rivalry and jealousy of two \\"brothers\\" involved in this mining. The detailed and accurately depicted diamond mining methods described will be unfamiliar and informative to most readers. In my opinion, the plot is a bit more complex than it could be, and characters could be filled-in a little more, and more numerous and more detailed descriptive passages would have been appreciated. Even so, THE DIAMOND HUNTERS is a good read.WILBER SMITH NOVELSWilber Smith's novels are characterized by hard edged characters in harsh, unforgiving environments and situations, against implacable foes. When one of Smith's \\"heros\\" succeeds, his victory is usually pyrrhic-as is often the case in the real world. This gritty pioneer mentality is appropriate to South Africa.I imagine that many readers will conclude that many of the characters in Smith's novels lack dimension. But that's a failure of people, not of the author. There ARE nasty, vengeful people in the world who are NOT complex, and Smith describes such people accurately. Smith does not attempt to explain such people-which I appreciate (in contrast with most modern novels filled with dreary shallow pop-psychology). Smith's heros are men who manage to exceed the sum of their heredity and environment-as is often the case in the real world."},{"Title":"The Diamond Hunters (Heinemann Guided Readers)","review":"i have read all of Wilbur's books and found that one learns a lot about Africa (with a few exceptions). you learn african history, economics, social problems, environmental problems, natural history, etc. in this one, you learn about the diamond industry and the history of the Namibian diamond coasts, while Wilbur weaves it into his &quot;unputdownable&quot; story. kind of like the Master of the Game with substance. for an even better look at Namibian history, try the Burning Shore."},{"Title":"The Diamond Hunters (Heinemann Guided Readers)","review":"I have seen Wilbur Smith novels on the bookshelves for years but for one reason or another none of them had ever really piqued my interest, but while browsing in an airport bookstore looking for something to read on a long flight I picked this one up and as I began to read I found that my flight was too short. I didn't want to be interrupted for something as trivial as changing flights. I intend to read more Wilbur Smith in the near future.The way Smith builds the story of Johnny Lance being an outcast and the way that he discovers the truth about his childhood and the animosity that builds between him and his foster brother Benedict Van der Byle makes for a spellbinding read. Smith's descriptions of the African landscape and exotic locations are well written without being over-done. When he describes Thunderbolt and Suicide you can smell the salt air and see the foamy spray shooting skyward and hear the crashing of the huge waves against the unyielding rock formations.Like all fiction stories this one is not for everyone, but if you enjoy action/adventure, emphasis on action you will find this a very enjoyable read."},{"Title":"The Diamond Hunters (Heinemann Guided Readers)","review":"The descriptions of diamond mining and sorting are as good as it gets.

He spent too much time on the relationships and too little time on the meat of the story which should have been the search for the elusive diamonds. I was able to finish it but was very disappointed particularly with the ending. It was as if he ran out of steam or got into a hurry.

I had read it dozens of times way back then, and since I found a copy of it again a few years ago, I have read it many times again. It was just as good as I remembered it, and is still my FAVORITE romance book, next to Gone With the Wind, which is saying a lot, since I have read many romances from Jane Austen to present-day authors.I have not liked any other Anne Hampson books I've read, but I LOVED this one. The chemistry is just right between Jane, an amateur British archeologist, and Nikolas, a Greek archeologist by profession. Set in Greece, with Nikolas believing Jane is married and deceitful while she works for him. In reality, she is pretending to be married so she can join the dig. Her British fiance is there to complicate things."},{"Title":"Loving Women","review":"I found this book in a used book shop, and being a fan of Hamill's, I bought it. Somewhat semi-autobiographical, the book follows a Brooklyn youth into his induction into the Navy and life at its most raw. The story thrusts one suprise twist on top of another, one exciting episode is immediately replaced by one even more thrilling. And this may be the most erotic book I have ever read. Not quite pornographic, the scenes of lust between two lovers are very descriptive and will stick with the reader for some time. I have read thousands of books, and this has to be in my top ten. Look for it, the search will be highly rewarding."},{"Title":"Loving Women","review":"I liked Pete Hamill's \\"Loving Women\\" and found most of his characters real and sympathetic. Michael Devlin, the young sailor growing up after boot camp at his first duty station is a character with whom any of us who served in the military can identify. The characters at the Navy base are familiar and could have been found on any military base in any branch of the service.The love affair with Eden Santana is absorbing. The erotic passages are well done - you can almost taste and smell the sex.However, it is a little jarring when he gets some of the historical details wrong. Though the novel was set in 1953, he went on about the Dodgers moving to Los Angeles which didn't happen until April of 1958; wrote about James Dean and his famous red jacket from \\"Rebel Without a Cause\\" which was released in 1955.These kinds of sloppy writing mistakes jar a reader out of his suspension of disbelief for a moment or two and make what otherwise would be a wonderful historical novel into just a pretty good one.Still a good read - but it could have been a great read."},{"Title":"Loving Women","review":"Never any secret about where he grew up.

Ms. Whatling's ostensible topic is how conteomporary lesbians appropriate modern cinema as subjects of fantasy and desire. Rather than being acted upon, as White's work posits, Ms. Whatling contends that the lesbian viewer acts as much as she is acted upon. This intriguing and potentially powerful argument (which owes much to queer theory), however, is lost amid Ms. Whatling's overeagerness to show that she has the intellectual and academic credentials to make her case. &quot;Screen Dreams&quot; reads like an anxious Ph.d candidate's thesis, full of disavowels (such as her repeated assertion that she is only speaking for herself) and rudimentary summarizations of *other* people's work. In fact, I (not an academic by any means) had actually read most of Ms. Whatling's sources, so much of this already-slender volume offered nothing new. Ms. Whatling makes a powerful supposition (one with which I am inclined to agree), I simply regret that her writing was unable to live up to her subject's promise."},{"Title":"Findings in hypnosis","review":"Previously had this book.

She wanders far afield, and in my opinion, often astray, as she jumps to questionable conclusions about the connections among the disparate systems.The section on actual Ottoman clothing ought to be the best, but there, too, Scarce trips and falls. The illustrations are often insufficiently captioned, lacking important information, so that the reader may not always realize what the true relationship of each is to the text and to other garments. Some items from specific ethnic and cultural groups living within the Ottoman Empire are presented as if they are representative of Ottoman Turkish clothing, and the relevant information, which i have found in other sources, is lacking anywhere in the book.I have this book and use it, but only in conjunction with other books on the clothing of the various groups she draws from which include better historical details and information on the provenance of specific garments."},{"Title":"Women's Costume of the Near and Middle East","review":"This is a amazing book!

If you are a pilot desirous of learning about how to predict weather, learning the tricks of the pros, and how to get there through the 'muck', this is the book to read.

Almost on every page, I found myself saying, \\"Yes, that's how it is.\\" Buck really knows what he is talking about, whether it be ice, thunderstorms, turbulence, or transitioning from instruments to visual on the approach. Taking to heart what Buck has to say will first and foremost help you to survive as a pilot by making good weather decisions. Just as importantly, he imparts a great deal of wisdom on how to get maximum utility from the airplane while keeping risk to a low level. However, as indicated earlier, the book is definitely not for beginners. A solid understanding of basic meteorology and a considerable amount of piloting experience are needed to interpret it correctly--and safely."},{"Title":"Weather flying","review":"It is hard to imagine a pilot with more weather flying experience than Captain Robert Buck. And much of this flying was in the old days: in the early years of the Army Air Corp and a young company called TWA. Much of this flying was accomplished without the assistance of modern instrumentation. Captain Buck travelled the world seeking the most ornery weather he could find, and then flew into it time and time again, compiling the experience and collecting the data that no one else had at the time. Captain Buck shares that experience here. This book is interesting and engaging to the flying enthusiast, essential to the VFR pilot, and absolutely priceless to the aspiring instrument pilot. Every discipline and every pastime has its classics, and WEATHER FLYING is, without a doubt, one of the classics of aviation.The language of WEATHER FLYING is simple and straightforward. The lessons are practical more than theoretical, though Captain Buck keeps his readers briefed on essential weather theory as well. Virtually every weather situation that a pilot can encounter is covered in this book, from the ordinary to the exotic. Then Captain Buck instructs you how to fly it. The concept is simple and direct; the lessons are comprehensive and pragmatic.In short, this is not a book to read once and then shelve. The lessons are too important to be forgotten. This is a manual to be taken down and read over and over again by any sort of pilot who flies any sort of aircraft.Jeremy W.

This book details flying in weather and the mindset required to be a safe and competent instrument pilot.Recommeded to me by my instructor after I received my instrument rating I now recommend it to students and associates whenever the subject of flying in weather (or not flying in weather) comes up.I read Northstar Over My Shoulder prior to buying this book so I had an understanding of Captain Buck's history and experience which added weight to the wisdom obvious in Weather Flying (buy that book too!)"},{"Title":"Weather flying","review":"An indispensable guide to flying in real-world weather. No book can teach good judgement, but this one comes close."},{"Title":"Weather flying","review":"Written by a veteran pilot for pilots. This book is a must for aviators. The latest revised edition is to keep up to some changes in technology (internet and advancement in weather forecasting.Very nice and not dry like technical books on weather. You will learn all about weather on a pilots perspective."},{"Title":"Weather flying","review":"Simply excellent. It's even better than what the title of the book says: the weather concepts and systems are so well explained that they will be useful for sailing as well. A very, very good book, absolutely must have on your shelf if you're into navigation, by air or by sea."},{"Title":"Boy&#39;s Next Door (Shonen Zanzo) (in Japanese)","review":"I'm not sure if there is an edition of this manga liscened in English and if there is, I would love to buy it but I have a feeling it's not. I read this in the form of an online scanlation and though I have to admit that the translation was not great (they rarely are and with a Kaori Yuki story, it can be majorly confusing to have bad translation), it was a VERY powerful story.This is shouen-ai. I'll put that warning out there first. It's not yaoi, very non-graphic, however it is shouen-ai all the same. So if you don't like boys with boys, don't read this.Kaori Yuki is the master of creating emotions in her readers. This is the very, very sad disturbing story of the son of a prostitute, who as an effect of killing his mother when he was little, is a seriel killer of male prostitutes while residing under the calm demenor of a school teacher. (I cannot remember any of the names, here).It's not his fault. He's a bit disturbed. Whenever he sees a prostitute, he just goes temporaryily insane. And he kills them until he meets a young male prostitute, Lawrence who captures his heart. The young prostitute is very strange and also has a sad past. But things refuse to work in their favor. The prostitute is tied to the men who sell him out and cannot get away.Well, I'm not going to give away the ending but it is sufficient to say that it is very profound and I can never read it without crying.This is a very powerful, disturbing story full of bitter sweetness. I beautiful story by the author of Angel Sanctuary."},{"Title":"Boy&#39;s Next Door (Shonen Zanzo) (in Japanese)","review":"This is a tragic story about the assassin of the \\"unclean\\". Our main character, Adrian is an insane killer, who murders male prostitutes, with a tragic past. When he falls in love with one of the prostitutes his life is tainted absolutely. This is a perverse love story that is both disturbing and poignant. If you are looking for a tear jerker or a dark love story, this is the ideal manga. A definite must read! This is the paramount yaoi I have come across. Kaori Yuki's illustrations are stunning and very detailed! Do not pass up this awe-inspiring thought provoking manuscript!"},{"Title":"Spirits in the Dark (Caribbean Writers Series)","review":"Jerome Quashee lives a tormented life on a Caribbean island. He does not fit into the community because he is too light-skinned, too book smart, and not attracted to members of the opposite sex. Spirits in the Dark is part coming-of-age story, part coming-out story, and part a story of going back to one's roots. The main themes of the novel are race, religion, and awareness/acceptance of one's homosexuality. The first two are very common themes in West Indian literature, but, at the time Thomas penned this book, the latter theme was not as common. Spirits in the Dark would be a five-star novel if Thomas's writing were stronger. Action scenes are stiff, and the book seems to be lacking in the sort of lush, sensual descriptions of nature and people that are usually found in West Indian literature. Still, it must be noted that Thomas does a good job in questioning Christianity and asking why Blacks would accept the religion of their oppressors. He also has managed to convey the pain of someone living with a sexual preference that must be kept hidden. Ultimately, Spirits in the Dark is worth reading because - until recently - homosexual themes have been rather rare in West Indian literature and this novel, although not destined to become a gay West Indian classic, is, in its own way, a breakthrough."},{"Title":"The Other Side of the Middle: A Pennsylvania Dutch Story of Family Love","review":"I really enjoyed this book, written by a former, much appreciated, professor of mine. It described a loving family, deeply rooted in Pennsylvania Dutch farmland traditions, yet with modern sensibilities. The descriptions of that homestead with its aged, sturdy buildings, and its very traditional practices, were also vivid and fascinating. I almost hated finishing the book since I could no longer keep company with that family and hear their conversations about life and its circumstances."},{"Title":"The Other Side of the Middle: A Pennsylvania Dutch Story of Family Love","review":"I just completed reading this book in full and must say the authordid a wonderful job. It sure brought back a lot of memories of myyouth in Pennsylvania Dutch country. I never read a book that broughttears to my eyes like this one did. It was sad but warm and uplifting.There's a section describing an underground cave, and I could just seemyself doing that and not being able to turn around. WOW! What a goodbook. It sure made my day reading it. I can't wait till the authorcomes out with another one."},{"Title":"The Other Side of the Middle: A Pennsylvania Dutch Story of Family Love","review":"A hi fidelity picture of a culture few would really know about except by name. Definitely a feel-good story, about gentle looking-for-love-and-finding-it.I loved the nostalgic details of post World War 2 rural Pennsylvania, including the mouth-watering detail of the cooking. An America that alas hardly exists any more, except perhaps in the Amish communities, which this one wasn't. The one jarring detail: so many names beginning with R: Ronald Ray, then Regan, Ricky, Ruby, Rosa and Randy."},{"Title":"Walt Disney's winnie the Pooh and His Friends (4 book set)","review":"This is a nice, simple book for Pooh fans. While it doesn't have any standout characteristics that might earn it five stars, it does offer a story that's easy for kids to follow, has just a bit of mystery, and ends pleasantly. The artwork nicely fits the story. Probably best for the under-five crowd."},{"Title":"Walt Disney's winnie the Pooh and His Friends (4 book set)","review":"When my son was 2, my sister gave me the book.. He loved it!

While each Zen monastery or center is unique and will have its own variations on the theme, he has chosen Zen Mountain Monastery in Mt. Tremper, New York, not because it is typical, but because he knows it well, having been a student there since 1994, and because its training system is broad enough so that all kinds of training might be encountered there that will be met with at other places. The system, the Eight Gates, consists of: Zen sitting, the teacher-student relationship, liturgy, moral and ethical teachings, art practice, physical exercise, academic study, and work. Maguire is a professional story teller and has good descriptive abilities, so that his description of the physical grounds makes one feel present on the property. He sketches briefly the kinds of people who come there and the sort of things that people have personally experienced there. He goes into minute detail about the order of the day and some of the eight elements of training, something that will be appreciated by those who are looking forward to actually going to a center, but a tad too detailed for the general reader. The book includes a directory of Zen places in the US and Canada, recommended further reading, a few commonly used Zen chants, and a glossary of terms. So if you are thinking about some serious practice at a Zen center or are generally curious, it is a very informative volume to look into."},{"Title":"Waking Up: A Week Inside a Zen Monastery (Week Inside1series)","review":"This is a first person account of time spent in a large, active zen monastery in the U.S. It covers every aspect of the week honestly and is an excellent introduction for bringing zen into one's life."},{"Title":"Valentino","review":"Dismal and overwrought bio of silent cinema's first Latin lover. Casts Valentino as the victim of scheming women at every turn. Offers no new information, and rehashes lots of unproven allegations, like Rudy worked as a gigolo in NY before his film career. If anyone can recommend a good biography of Valentino, I would love to hear from them."},{"Title":"Valentino","review":"Shulman's &quot;biography&quot; of Valentino is certainly more fiction than truth. It's an interesting read if you're looking for the flavor of the 1920s, but other than that, forget it. It is equally as florid as his &quot;biography&quot; of Jean Harlow. Does he make this stuff up as he goes along?"},{"Title":"Valentino","review":"Valentino's movies and life are fascinating. By the time I read this book I knew pretty much how his life went. I like medical stuff, and I kept looking for a book that would explain in medical terms his final illness."},{"Title":"Valentino","review":"I found Shulman's \\"Valentino\\" to be a very interesting book. I've already read a number of books about Rudolph Valentino so there wasn't a whole lot of new information, but I do like the way Mr. Shulman dispensed same.There can be no doubt that Valentino's love for Natacha Rambova was such that he was blinded to the reality that she was greatly damaging his career. I rather prefer to think that she didn't fully understand (they were both so very, very young) that her version of how artfully a movie should or could be produced was far too costly (and largely unnecessary) for the studios to consider.I also came away with the opinion that the studios ran the media and they knew just how to push Valentino's buttons.No gay man would be THAT attached to a woman, yet somehow the papers were always releasing \\"articles\\" questioning his preferences, suggesting his marriages were the \\"Lavender\\" kind. Sadly Valentino took these suggestions very seriously. He was warned to ignore it, but could not.The \\"pink power puff\\" article (coupled with Natacha's demand for a divorce) drove Valentino to an early grave. The man died from \\"successful button pushing\\" tag team of studio and wife.There were other matters he explores and insights dispensed.I think Shulman's \\"Valentino\\" was/is very worthy of a look."},{"Title":"Valentino","review":"This outstanding biography of Valentino, which I've read twice, is extremely well-written, entertaining, and insightful. Shulman's thorough and well-organized reporting, keen observations, and critical commentary on the film industry and American culture make this compelling reading. The biography begins with Valentino's dramatic funeral in New York in August 1926, then moves back to Rudolph's birth and life in Castellaneta, Italy. Shulman then narrates the fascinating odyssey of Valentino's struggle to succeed in America, his rise to stardom, his two failed marriages, his (and second wife Natacha Rambova's) occult beliefs and practices, his death, and his posthumous deification as a love god. Shulman appreciates and sympathizes with Valentino, but does so in a manner that is neither lachrymose nor condescending. A terrific read!!!"},{"Title":"Valentino","review":"Extremely well-written biography, so much so I've read it twice. Shulman's lively reportorial style is marked by wry humor, keen observations about Hollywood and American society, and a genuine appreciation for Valentino. Highly recommended!!!"},{"Title":"False to Any Man (Colonel Primrose Mysteries) (Vintage Bantam #80)","review":"As far as I'm concerned, False to Any Man is the most memorable of the Primrose-Latham mysteries, although Siren in the Night and Washington Whispers Murder come close. I hadn't reread it for over 10 years when I picked it up this time, but I knew who would die, who did it, and why. That didn't spoil my enjoyment in rereading it again (although the racism and sexism were detractors).Grace Latham's older son, still unnamed, is almost 17 in this book. It's 1939 and Grace is worried about her boys getting too close to war age, even though the USA hadn't entered World War II yet. She's still seeing Colonel Primrose. Sergeant Buck is still certain that Grace intends to marry his Colonel and is still against it. We get to see more of Lilac, the African-American who works for Grace. Her official domain is the kitchen in the basement, but Lilac has her opinions and doesn't hesitate to give them. I loved the verbal trap she set for Grace in chapter four. Lilac came before Grace's older son was born and Grace admits she couldn't do without her.Once again it's Grace's social connections that bring her into the murder. This time it's the fact that her younger son goes to school with Judge Peyton Candler's younger son. Grace was present when Billy Candler's appendix had to be removed while he was lying on the kitchen table during Thanksgiving, so it's no wonder that his older sister, Jerry (short for 'Jeremy'), comes to Grace with wonderful news about her father.The author doesn't come right out and say what appointment the White House is considering for Judge Peyton Candler, but it's a high one. Any scandal might ruin the Judge's chances, which is going to put Jerry on the spot. I certainly hope that Peyton Candler is a better judge of humanity when he's in the courtroom than he is at home because he can't see that his ward is as spoiled and greedy as she is beautiful.Karen Lunt's father was the Judge's best friend, but he made the mistake of marrying a gold digger who was going to dump him after she ran through his money. Gossip says that's why Mr. & Mrs. Lunts' car went off a cliff during Prohibition. Judge Candler considers friendship a sacred obligation. The Candlers don't have much money. The Judge's own children have had to do without so that Karen could be kept in a fancy school and have the old carriage house done up in expensive style for her to live in. Sandy and Jerry have jobs, but not Karen. Now Karen wants to marry a man who, like the Candlers, comes of good family but is poor. Karen doesn't want to do without, so she's trying to get back some of her father's stock that was worthless when Candler bought it, but is worth a hundred thousand dollars now. The Judge would gladly give it to her, but he'd put it in trust for Jerry and Billy, and Jerry just turned 21.Jerry's thinking of Billy more than herself when she refuses to sign the stock over. The Judge's oldest friend and former law partner, Philander Doyle, won't let Jerry sign when she finally gives in.The Candlers come from Cavalier stock, their family going back to William the Conqueror. That's why their social standing isn't affected by being relatively poor. Philander is the son of a bartender. After years of hard if somewhat sleazy law work, Philander is a rich man. He's so rich that he bought the mansion across the street from the Candlers -- the mansion that the Judge's family lost by being on the losing side in the Civil War. That's why the Candlers live in the much less imposing old Georgian house where Peyton and his children were born. Still, not all the money Philander made can put the Doyles in the same social bracket as the Candlers. In Regency Romances, rich social climbers could solve this sort of problem through a marriage of convenience with a member of an impoverished aristocratic family. Philander doesn't have to stoop to that practice because his son, Roger, is in love with Jerry Candler and vice-versa. So why is Philander opposed to the match? His eccentric sister, Isobel Doyle, knows.It's quite possible that the murderer could have gotten away with the crime if Grace hadn't instinctively called Primrose after she found the body. It might well have been written off as a sucide -- don't want to cause any trouble for a socially prominant family, you know. Now the murderer has a much bigger problem to deal with, a problem that could lead to another murder. As usual, Colonel Primrose wants to make sure that Grace isn't the next victim.The descriptions of Alexandria, Virginia, past and present, are very good. So are the back stories that help the reader to understand why murder was done. For readers who like to keep track of that sort of thing in a series, Jeremy Candler is another Ford heroine to have copper/red-gold hair. Her eyes, though, are the yellowish-brown of a tortise shell instead of some shade of blue.One of my copies is the Scribner hardcover without its dustjacket and the other is the Bantam #80 paperback with an old house and a much larger woman's head on the cover. However, I can assure cat lovers who have seen the paperback with the Siamese cat on the cover that there is such a cat in the book and she's a sweetie."},{"Title":"Clinical Management of Stuttering in Older Children and Adults","review":"I liked this volume very much. Hamm is a retired speech-language pathologist who specialized in the treatment of stuttering. This book tells the therapist exactly WHAT to do with his stuttering clients. Too many books on the subject spend too much time on theory and offer little practical information. Not Hamm. As I am determined to read everything ever written on the subject of stuttering, I was delighted to read a book by someone willing to share their techniques and who also could present his information in a clear and sometimes humourous way. Hamm, by the way, has a killer wit. Example: he wonders if the push for &quot;person-first&quot; terminology (ex: &quot;stutterers&quot; become &quot;persons who sometimes stutter&quot;) should be naturally extended to clinicians, who, perhaps, should no longer be called &quot;speech therapists&quot; but &quot;persons who sometimes practice speech-language pathology as a profession&quot;. There is a lot of common sense in this volume, and more techniques and tips than you ever thought existed. Some of it may be dated (most therapists today opt for a combination of stuttering modification and fluency shaping) but this is a great read for anyone interested in this subject. It will also give you a good deal of insight as to what exactly master clinicans have been doing all of these years. For those wanting to specialize in fluency disorders, this is a keeper."},{"Title":"Three Eighteenth Century Romances: The Castle of Otranto; Vathek; The Romance of the Forest, (The Modern Student's Library)","review":"This volume includes three novellas by 18th century writers -- well known and popular in their day, but somewhat forgotten today -- but they deserve a revival.

So I bought this for my 6 year old. The book is broken up into short stories which is nice for the little ones. The illustrations are cute and so are the stories, but that's about it. Even my son thought it was a bore. It's the kind of kid book that makes you think \\"I could have written a better children's story.\\" After we read it, the book went on the shelf, never to be touched again."},{"Title":"George and Martha Encore","review":"Through this book (and others in the series), James Marshall shows what friendship is all about. I have always found it amazing that he can practically state his message out loud -- as in Martha telling George \\"I would much rather have a friend like you than all the gardens in the world\\" -- and yet the life lesson doesn't sound heavy-handed. The meaning/lesson sounds totally natural coming out of the mouths of George and Martha. Only an exceptional writer can pare a story down to its essentials the way these very short, very sweet stories are pared."},{"Title":"George and Martha Encore","review":"I chose two books from the george and martha series after combing through best loved classics childrens book lists on other sites. It was a gift for my 5 yr. old nephew. It's an endearing little book, I like that he can get involved with the characters through the series."},{"Title":"My Point...And I Do Have One","review":"In an ironic twist, the title is sadly misleading. In a group of essays that seem to exist mostly as filler, Degeneres, who is usually so funny in her stand-up routines, absolutely misses the target on her first humor collection. There isn't a single essay that is good all the way through. There is a running gag about club soda that is amusing, and a chapter on human behavior is likewise entertaining. Degeneres rambles on in a way that is irritating, and many of her observations are strangely dull. Much of what the author has to say is a few beats off from funny, and the chapters containing lists are staggeringly dry and achingly boring. Reading through this was like reading a slightly silly textbook. Eyes passed over words, and while comprehending them, did not find them interesting. What a major disappointment from a talent who has proven herself to be a remarkable addition to the field of comedy, but who must have lost some of her humor in the translation from stage to the written word."},{"Title":"My Point...And I Do Have One","review":"THIS IS A GREAT BOOK! I GOT IT FROM THE LIBRARY HOURS AGO, AND I READ IT NON-STOP! BUY IT NOOOOOOOOOW! (By the way, to all you meat-headed mullets who gave this book a bad review- GET A CLUE!!!)"},{"Title":"My Point...And I Do Have One","review":"I'm pretty easily amused, but maybe I don't appreciate this kind of humor. I was expecting something different, but I found this almost silly at times. Sure I laughed a couple of times, but it was like she was trying too hard to be funny. I almost gave up a few times too. I bought this expecting to like it and to continue on to read all of her books, now I'm not so sure. It's like I want to read another one in case this one was a dud, but I get the feeling I'd be disappointed again."},{"Title":"My Point...And I Do Have One","review":"I didn't find this book very funny at all.

I much prefer watching Ellen's show."},{"Title":"My Point...And I Do Have One","review":"Ellen DeGeneres writes in a relaxing style and entertains her readers with cute experiences and expressions, but I cannot recognize a central point she makes. She simply goes through several experiences she has had in her life and tends to be exhibitionist about herself. She makes the reader \\"tingle\\" when she describes how she happens to be naked when her mother calls her. I would not want her to be naked on her show, but how about a bikini appearance? That would fit her perfectly."},{"Title":"My Point...And I Do Have One","review":"This book was complete and utter fluff. Degeneres does not in fact have a point. I felt dreadfully betrayed after reading this book, because I am a fan of her stand-up, but this book was pathetic. I really feel that Ellen has done her fans a disservice with this book, and I can only assume that some ruthless publicist forced her to write it."},{"Title":"My Point...And I Do Have One","review":"Ellen...she's got talent! she's simply brilliant!.The book is extremely funny, and very easy to read.If English is not your first language, don't be afraid!, that's my case and I didn't laugh any less than others.It's great when people comes to you to see what's going on, why you're laughing that much...I agree with that someone who said this is a book you're wanting so much to share, but you're scared with the idea of it being &quot;kidnapped&quot;!!...so buy it!! the only disappointment you can get from the book, is that it ends!! (but you can always re-read it!)"},{"Title":"My Point...And I Do Have One","review":"I am a huge huge fan of Ellen, I had always admired her talk shows and found her to be exceedingly funny without trying which is why I went to buy this book. I turned to the first few chapters and find them engaging but it didn't knock any laughter out of me. An occasional smile here and there but I get more humour out of internet chatting.I actually stopped reading after 4 - 5 chapters mainly because her stories seemed to be neverending.. this is leading to that and that is leading to further that and that is again leading to something else. Sort of like The Simpsons.. only lacking any real weight.I am still a huge huge fan of Ellen and I would probably buy her second book... and any books after that.. but this turned out to be a disappointment for me."},{"Title":"My Point...And I Do Have One","review":"it must have taken ellen about as long as it takes to read this book to \\"write\\" it. it's idiotic and though I have enjoyed ellen on the telly I lost a lot of respect for her after leafing through this pathetic excuse for writing.a ripoff - pure and simple"},{"Title":"My Point...And I Do Have One","review":"Ellen is a comedian, we all know that. Admit it, you have laughed at her comedy. Her book explains alot, and it makes you laugh. I enjoyed reading it because it has alot of good points. It explains how she made it on her own, she didnt need to be lifted up into stardom by someone else. She did it by herself.

Her sense of humor on the screen is unbeatable. In print, unfortunately, it's unbearable.A waste of your time and money."},{"Title":"My Point...And I Do Have One","review":"A true fan of her TV show, I was incredibly disappointed (an understatement) in this book. There is ONE joke; it's on page 41. This, I remember, after reading the book 3 months ago (which I never finished: something that hasn't happened to me since 'Moby Dick'). No matter how grueling, I always finish. This book is a rambling, definitely NOT funny (try Mark Salzman's Lost in Place or Seinfeld or Reiser -- even Fran Lebowitz) piece that you or I could have written in 6th grade. My Point, and I Do Have One... should have been retitled, &quot;My Pointless Thoughts, and there are many.&quot; I simply couldn't believe I didn't laugh ONCE at this (Fannie Flagg's Daisy Faye and the Miracle Man is hilarious laugh-until-you-cry); I'm NOT that hard to please. Ellen's subtle and dry witticisms on the show are absent here. There is nothing of substance nor wit. I cannot imagine what possessed this woman to write this book; I cannot imagine her publishers' encouraging her. What a little name recognition can do! &quot;Write it and they will come.&quot; The only thing that baffles me more are the reviews here that called this book hilarious. This book is the testimonial equivalent to the 'fart joke' -- minus the joke."},{"Title":"My Point...And I Do Have One","review":"A disappointing read. Ms. DeGeneres' type of humor works brilliantly on TV, but comes off boring, dumb and predictable in print. I would rather see Ellen DeGeneres write a more serious autobiography, especially since she created such a stir when she outed herself and her show's character last year. Until she does that, don't waste your money on this book."},{"Title":"My Point...And I Do Have One","review":"This book, which I have read numerous times, is by no means meant to be an autobiography or collection of thoughts about Ellen's life. In her trademark rambling, Ellen hillariously and completely without seriousness shows us who she is, by showing us her humour. This book, like Seinlanguage by Jerry Seinfeld, is a written version of Ellen's standup routine thoughts. For true Ellen fans, who have laughed at her humour long before she became a household name, this book is a gem, and an achingly funny read."},{"Title":"My Point...And I Do Have One","review":"I, like all the past reviewers, love Ellen; however, this book is a bunch of pointless ramblings that I wish I didn't have to skip over to just get through the book. I haven't read her other books yet, since I'm wanting to read everything in time order when they were written.... so, I'm hoping that her other books are better than this one. I wouldn't even bother purchasing it, rather pointless!"},{"Title":"My Point...And I Do Have One","review":"I kept tissues close at hand for extended laughing at some parts.

Great book."},{"Title":"My Point...And I Do Have One","review":"As I loved to watch the show &quot;Ellen&quot; I was also very interested to read this book. Although it is clear that Ms.DeGeneres is not going to be one of world's best writers this book has quite humoresque passages with sometimes clear statements referring to the right to be oneself, not to be judged by your looks and the right to do what you think is correct. I think that apart from some truly funny stories the reader should not overlook the small hidden messages behind the unmistakable humor of Ms. DeGeneres"},{"Title":"My Point...And I Do Have One","review":"The key to enjoying this book is very simple. If you understand Ellen's sense of humor you will love this book. It's that simple. Many readers just do not seem to understand this. Of course this book rambles, and doesn't have a plot. That's the entire point! Anyone who knows Ellen's sense of humor knows that her wacky, rambling, self-deprecating style is what makes her who she is. This book is splittingly funny, but I can guarantee that someone who isn't a major Ellen fan may have some problems. For fans of Ellen De Generes and her stand-up comedy (I have been a fan of hers for 15 years), this book is a delight. I am still waiting for her next book. This book is so funny, it will make you cry! HOWEVER! If you find yourself complaining about the style or plot, then Ellen's humor just isn't for you!"},{"Title":"My Point...And I Do Have One","review":"Having watched Ellen's standup for the past 15 years or so, this book is so true to her. Her goofy nature, her ramblings, her self-deprecating humor, her screwball imagination, it's all typical Ellen. I don't think readers should expect an autobiography, I think they should expect typical Ellen humor. I don't expect everyone to like this book, but I read this entire book on a long bus ride once and I was laughing so hard, the lady next to me thought I was crying. This book is for true Ellen fans, and anyone who wants a good laugh. For those looking for an in depth analysis of Ellen's life, look elsewhere. This is 100% pure Ellen. This book is mostly fictional. It doesn't pretend to be real. Those people who read this book and find it unfunny or confusing are obviously attuned to a different type of humor. This book should be read if you want a totally goofy good time. Yes, of course it rambles. So does Ellen, she always has. This book is Ellen's humor and her personality in a neat little package. I just wish she would write more!"},{"Title":"My Point...And I Do Have One","review":"For the third time I am reading this book and each time I laugh. Ellen is funny. It is a book that can make you laugh, smile and want to share the stories with others."},{"Title":"My Point...And I Do Have One","review":"This book is light and funny. I recommend it to anyone who wants a good, clean laugh."},{"Title":"My Point...And I Do Have One","review":"I laughed my head off so much while reading this book! ;) I couldn't put it down once I picked it up.

The situations described make you feel like oh yea, that is exactly what I was thinking.

A great laugh out loud book.....but don't try to repeat it to your friends...it's genuine Ellen!"},{"Title":"My Point...And I Do Have One","review":"I don't usually like books by comedians, they seem to be forced jokes.

The intense humor was outrageously funny and she is so witty! I have read this book about 3 times now, and can't wait to read it again. It had me laughing out loud!

All she does is talk in circles and nothing about her life-or her point"},{"Title":"My Point...And I Do Have One","review":"This book is a quick read and that is just about the only good thing that I have to say about this book. I opened it expecting to laugh and learn something interesting about her life. What I have found instead is something not much more coherent than speaking to a three year old. The whole book consists of rambling, nonsense, incoherent stories that seem to make little if any sense. I seriously think that I lost a few brain cells while reading this book. If you start reading this and think oh it has to get better. I warn you it NEVER does! It's mindless drivle"},{"Title":"My Point...And I Do Have One","review":"I found this book extremely hard to get through. I love Ellen, and her brand of humor. Why did I dislike the book so much? Well, I finished reading the book yesterday. Except if you can't see the date, then you might think today is yesterday, which it may have well been depending on when you read this review. But if you read the review a year from now, then me saying I read it yesterday will be irrelevant. But if you read this review today, then it can be accurately concluded that it was really truly yesterday that I finished reading the book. Cover to cover. But if you didn't get a copy of the book with a cover on it, you will have no idea what I am talking about. Like if your dog ate it or you happen to buy a book at a bookstore for cheap because it doesn't have a cover on it. And in that case, I hope the bookstore guy sold it at half price, because it would really stink to buy a book without a cover and not know what it is until you get it home.(get my drift? thats almost the entire book. I love her act in person, but I expected to learn a little bit more about her than I did by reading the book.)"},{"Title":"My Point...And I Do Have One","review":"I am one of the biggest Ellen fans out there, but this book was probably her worst job. I found it to be mostly her early stand-up routine put down on paper. And since Ellen is largely funny because of her comical looks, it left the humor hanging. Seriously, being an Ellen fan from the start, I would sit and tell the jokes before I read them off the page. If she was going to do a book about jokes, she should have at least come up with some new material. And she is blatantly honest about the financial motives of writing the book, and even ends the final page by writing random words so that she can meet her publisher's word quota because she has run out of funny material. All I can say is thank goodness I picked up my copy at a flea market for a buck and didn't pay a much too large price for a repeat of her show."},{"Title":"My Point...And I Do Have One","review":"This book rates right down there among the worst I've ever read. Not funny at all- I cannot think of one piece that made me laugh. Stupid anecdotes that make no sense (the Iditarod thing? Give me a break!). The last chapter was Ellen \\"joking\\" about the number of words required for the book. No joke at all- clearly she had a minimum word requirement and was having trouble making it because there were all kinds of extraneous garbage included in the stories. Horrible book and a huge waste of money. Don't waste your time on this sorry excuse for comedy."},{"Title":"My Point...And I Do Have One","review":"As much as I enjoy Ellen and her show this book was really stupid and I read part of it and just threw it away."},{"Title":"My Point...And I Do Have One","review":"Ellen Degeneres has been surrounded by controversy ever since she came out of the closet as a lesbian--and that's what I was waiting for in her book, My Point...and I Do Have One. Instead, what I found was a bunch of ramblings that had nothing to do with her life. In fact, the only chapter that actually dealt with her life--Chapter One--wasn't serious at all. It was an interview Degeneres had with a neighbor from her childhood year, asking her what she remembered about her. All the neighbor had to say was that she was fat and had no friends. I was expecting to learn about her experiences as a gay woman, her life, her hardships, her influences. This book offered none of that. Ultimately, I was disappointed in the lack of sincerity and intensity of the book. To me, it seemed frou-frou, disorganized, and not at all real. I felt I wasted my time by reading it. I could have watched her show and gotten the same information, at the same time seen some funny acting. Her book was written like her TV show, a rambling discussion about whatever she chooses. It was as if she picked out her subjects from a hat, and then wrote about them. Every time Ellen began a discussion based on the chapter heading, she veered off into something totally different. But at the every end of the chapter, in a weak attempt to regain the thread of her topic, she returns briefly to her main point. Her book was really not based on anything, and each chapter had nothing to do with the others. There's one chapter dedicated to her famous French toast recipe with squid, and another about what people should do to annoy co-workers. Some are lists, poems, journal entries, apology letters, fill-in-the-blanks, and just plain prose, but they are all individual and different. She actually skipped chapter 13 because she felt that if it was bad luck for a building elevator, it would be bad luck for her book. Her writing style was at first intriguing, because I have always found her comedic acts funny and true to life. She included interesting descriptions, like &quot;I was born, bred, and lightly sauteed in and around New Orleans, a city steeped and marinated in history.&quot; But after realizing that her whole book was written in the voice of a person is speed talking and mixing up subjects, I began to get annoyed. Even her chapter titles had subtitles that were off the point, like I went to a psychic, or......baloney is just salami with an inferiority complex. Why couldn't she just stay on one point longer than a few sentences? I finally realized that her title really held true to her book. She said that she had a main point, but left it to discover another point, only to finally return to the original point at the very end. In my humble opinion, this book is 2 thumbs down! I would feel guilty recommending it to my worst enemy. This book started off with my high hopes of a good read, but left me with a harsh disappointment. I had expected to learn more about the author, and to get insight into her life, instead, I learned how to get bogeymen out of my closet. Ellen should stick to stand-up comedy instead of attempting to write a book and wasting the time of her publishers and the readers."},{"Title":"My Point...And I Do Have One","review":"To me she's a great comedian...but to write a book and makes it funny is different. Several lines would have been funny if they were presented as a stand-up. I was going to give it 1 star, but considering throughout the book I got a few good laughs, and just smiling somewhere in between, I gave her 2. The title could have been My Point...And I do NOT Have One or My Point...And I do Have NONE (I know it's supposed to be funny in her original title, but it's not for me). Those chapters in the first half of the book are at least better than those in the second half. As the book moved on, I felt it got more and more dull. She was babbling too much, which was ok and very funny...when she did stand-ups; however, not in the book. Anyway I think she's better off presenting her jokes as an actress or stand-up comedian, but not as a writer."},{"Title":"My Point...And I Do Have One","review":"I love her 30-minute show, love her talk show, and I got a kick out of her second book. This was the reason I went back to the first one. I am not impressed with this book at all. I didn't crack a smile the whole time and this whole book was a bunch of lies. Just lie after lie after lie. It's funny when she picks fun at real situations (like gay marriage, having a cist, etc.), but when she just flat out starts telling fairy tales and tall tales, it's just like \\"Um...you coulda kept that.\\" That's how I felt about this whole book: \\"Um...you coulda kept that.\\""},{"Title":"My Point...And I Do Have One","review":"Ellen's sit-com, which is shown on TV in Singapore, is quite a pleasure to watch. I bought the book on the blind faith that it would be just as funny as the sit-com. What a mistake! I found perhaps a short paragraph that could pass off as being slightly funny every 15 to 20 pages. The rest was a pure torture to read. The title &quot;My Point - And I Do Have One&quot; is very misleading. It will be obvious to the reader that Ellen DOES NOT have a point, and that the entire book itself is pointless. Ellen would start off by narrating an event in her life that the reader tries hard to follow (in order to catch the joke). A couple of pages later, Ellen would admit that whatever she had written earlier was either false, or a gross exaggeration. She will then repudiate what she wrote earlier and proceed to narrate a &quot;true&quot; version of that event. A few paragraphs or a page later, Ellen admits that even her second version was false, and proceed to tell a &quot;true&quot; third version of the story. At the end of the chapter, the reader learns that the event never happened at all, and that the different versions of the (imaginary) event were just ramblings. Is this supposed to be funny? I think the only point Ellen was trying to make is that if you are a famous TV personality, you can write absolute trash and people will still buy your book."},{"Title":"My Point...And I Do Have One","review":"Ellen Degeneres is the funniest comedic performer to evergrace the stage, and now bookshelves. Her book, &quot;My Point...and I do have one&quot; is not your typical book written bycomedians. Ellen has not written this book to tell you howmuch she loves her family, nor has she written it to tellyou all about the hard times she's had in her life, shewrote it to bring you extreme joy, and hours of endlesslaughter. When I first read this book in November of lastyear I had only heard of Ellen from an HBO Comedy Showcase,and I knew then that she was extremely funny. I borrowedthe book from a friend and went into my room and lay down onmy bed. I began to read it and before even finishing thefirst chapter, and began laughing, hard. Laughing so hardin fact that tears began streaming down my eyes. My motherran to my door and began knocking to ask what was wrong.She thought I was crying I was laughing so hard. In herbook Ellen looks at the little things in life, like whatyour teachers and friends thought of you when you weregrowing up. What it is like to have a sister or brotherwho is favoured. She deals with all of the issues, suchas wearing fur, in the funniest manner possible. Shedoes not tell about her life, at least not in an auto-biographical manner. She looks at the little things in lifethat we never take time to notice and she notices them for usand makes us laugh about them. No one will be able to read more than a page of this book withoutbreaking into glorious laughter. It is a very therapeuticbook which could bring even the most dismal of people outof the dumps. READ IT!!!!"},{"Title":"My Point...And I Do Have One","review":"Ellen's first book is SO hilarious! You can hear her voice inside your head with every word you read. Which is actually kind of spooky. But fun at the same time. I know she'll come back to haunt me in the afterlife and she'll just be talking and talking and talking to me non-stop. I'll never be able to take a shower alone again.Anyway...I've read this book twice now, and it never ceases to amaze me with its laugh-out-loud humor and prose. I pick it up when I need a good laugh. In fact, that makes it a great pick-me-up! It never gets old for me.I've also given this book as a gift to friends. Thankfully you can find it really cheap now. :)So what are you waiting for? Order this book and you'll have something to read over and over and over again! You'll never have to buy another book."},{"Title":"My Point...And I Do Have One","review":"Without doubt, this is one of the funniest books I have ever read... and read... and read. And each time I read it, I laugh all over again. I even took it to work and read it out loud to a coworker on our lunch breaks. Each day, we'd read a new chapter. Whether you're a fan of Ellen, never heard of Ellen, or can't stand Ellen, you've got to read this book. She has such an unconventional way of looking at things and relating a story. She'll keep you laughing for hours."},{"Title":"My Point...And I Do Have One","review":"What a funny book, a must for any Ellen fans who understand her ramblings"},{"Title":"My Point...And I Do Have One","review":"I picked this up not really familiar with Ellen's comedy, but I was truly a fan after reading it. It was so amusing by Ellen's querky personality and wonderful offbeat humor. She has a wonderful way of putting things that never failed to crack me up. Like most comedy books though, I must admit that I would probably find all of the material far more humorous and enjoyable if I saw a preformance; Ellen, like other comedians, is great in her field but no writer--her routine loses a bit of humor when transferred to paper. It is still an enjoyable book and laugh-at-able read. Recommended for the fans of Kate Clinton (and Kate Clinton recommended for those who become fans of this book.)"},{"Title":"My Point...And I Do Have One","review":"Ellen is in good form with this book. If you are looking for a life story then you will be dissapointed, but if you want to laugh then there is no better book out there (and I've read a lot).It is a tribute to one of the funniest comedians on the planet."},{"Title":"My Point...And I Do Have One","review":"If you bought this book expecting some life-altering \\"point\\" she had...you were just plain stupid. Since when has Ellen, \\"The Funniest Person In America\\" ever been serious in entertainment venues? Free clue: NEVER.I've seen \\"reviewers\\" blather on and on about, \\"Oh, this book has no point...she should rename it. It was just endless ramblings and oh, me oh my, I wish I could get a refund!\\" These people ought to have their book-buying privileges revoked. Shut up, already.Ellen's books are nothing more than an extension of her stand-up comedy...and if that's not what you like...buy a different book! What is so appealing and lovable about Ellen is her ability to say a whole lot...without saying really anything at all. THAT is what is funny about it. Her RAMBLING! THAT is the point. And if that point flew over your alleged head...tough.It's amazing. EVERYONE'S a literary critic. \\"Oh, dear me, I just read this book and I just don't understand what her point was. She should stick to stand up comedy. Oh, Lordy, Lordy, Ellen should talk to ME before she writes, because, after all, HER life is about ME!\\" Perhaps you should stick to whatever vocation YOU chose...Then, when you get enough credence and success behind you...maybe YOU can write a book...and then WE all can dump all over it and talk about how crappy it is.Ellen is a comedic genius...the type that translates perfectly into whatever venue she chooses...stand up...sitcoms...talks shows...or simply hosting an awards show.I laughed out loud at the fools who foamed on and on about how she talked throughout the book about how her publisher demanded a certain amount of words...like that was something she didn't do intentionally. What maroons. Please...please...put the book down. Before you hurt yourself or somebody else. Yikes."},{"Title":"My Point...And I Do Have One","review":"I have to say this book was laugh-out-loud funny. But hey, its Ellen DeGeneres what do you expect? Well, I suppose it didn't actually meet my expectations. It was rather shallow and not meaty at all to say the least. It was kinda just a collection of jokes and wit. Nothing personal was in it at all. In fact it was the opposite of personal as you could tell that 99% of the stories in it were made up to be funny. She wasn't even out yet so there were some hetero-oriented references in there that seemed wholly out of place. But again it was hilarious because it was Ellen and she's funny. And it only took me one night to read it which was what I was looking for at the time having come off of a binge of actual memoirs with substance. So really if you're looking for something to keep your brain occupied this isn't for you at all. But if you love Ellen DeGeneres you'll like this."},{"Title":"My Point...And I Do Have One","review":"I enjoyed this book as it was almost the same as listening to Ellen on her daily talk show which I Tivo every day. If you're looking for something intellectual or deep, don't get this one. However, if you want to read something light-hearted and funny like Ellen is, it's a good one!"},{"Title":"My Point...And I Do Have One","review":"Sad to say, I have never been a fan of Ellen (mainly because I have not watched any of her shows before-how could I?!)However, after I bought her book out of curiosity at a book store a year back, I began to fall in love with her humour, her personality, and have been looking forward to watching her shows! Her humour is widely sprinkled throughout her book- I read it once on a bus alone and I had to really control my laughter! Take my words for it....read her book with an open heart and you will be in for a good laugh!"},{"Title":"My Point...And I Do Have One","review":"I read Ellen's latest book and loved it, so I thought I'd give this one a try. It reads like a stand-up act, and her humour isn't as polished yet... ok, but not great."},{"Title":"My Point...And I Do Have One","review":"I love Ellen. Funny, funny woman.I HATED this book. B-O-R-I-N-G.I tried, but I just could not slog through it.I bought the e-book based on two POINTS of criteria: 1) I think Ellen is a terrific talent. 2) Ratings given by readers"},{"Title":"My Point...And I Do Have One","review":"This book is a great read, if you love Ellen and most people I know do!! then you will love this book, she writes as she talks and you get a real sense of her in this book.. loved it Thanks Ellen, I look forward to youe next book :-)"},{"Title":"My Point...And I Do Have One","review":"I could not put this book down as I was reading it.

This is a MUST READ!!"},{"Title":"My Point...And I Do Have One","review":"Sorry, I can't really tell you much, I ordered it for a Christmas Gift.I heard it was good and funny. If you like Ellen, you will like this book."},{"Title":"My Point...And I Do Have One","review":"Ellen's stand up was never the most compelling, but she was funny and would occasionally push the edges of safety a bit. This book still has a few remnants of that approach that has been suffocated by her entry into the safety of afternoon TV talk shows. As in many of these \\"books\\" by comics this is just a reflection of stand-up material expanded for the format and it is a nice reminder of when Ellen was funny. Some good set pieces for the book like journal entries and a \\"Fantasy conversation with Ellen\\" take advantage of the format well and there are a number of laughs here as you can easily put this in Ellen's voice. I'm not really sure she has \\"a point\\" per se, but this is an amusing if slight book."},{"Title":"My Point...And I Do Have One","review":"Many people write humorous things that end up in print. whether they be in monthly publications or in hard or paperback books. I have read some really funny things by authors that were not known to be comedians. And also some very funny lines and passages by comedians known to have a way with word that are best seller list ready. Ellen's book is a rarity...because it is FUNNY!!!! It's as good as a stand-up routine of her's, and possibly then some. I remember some of the things she has said and tell others and they think that they are funny. Her brand of comedy is infectious. She is may favorite comedienne ever. She is really that good.I say watch her stand-up routines and read the book to get the fullness of the Ellen I know. The one that I knew from over a decade ago was not yet known for her dancing. This was around the time when she was still with Anne Heche and had at the time recently come out as being homosexual. It's interesting...that never was part of her act. If anything, she talked more about her family and friends than anything else personal. I say get over any prejudices and give her a try. You may even like her. (I'm not saying to email her for a date or anything. Gee!)"},{"Title":"My Point...And I Do Have One","review":"I decided I'd sleep better if I stopped reading murder mysteries before going to bed, so I picked up this book and went to sleep laughing. I didn't sleep any better, but I was happier. She mostly writes about, well, nothing, but it doesn't matter. It's silly and fun. One chapter is on a serious topic, but you can't help laughing out loud. It's a chapter on her experience with a ruptured ovarian cyst (chapter title: the time ellen degeneres had an emergency, starts on page 119). Here's an excerpt.\\"The first thing I had to do, besides proving that I had insurance, was tell them what my symptoms were. Unfortunately, they recognized me as a comic, so they thought I was trying to be funny, that I was trying out a new part of my act.I said, \\"I have this sharp intense pain in my lower abdomen. I started feeling it about two hours ago . . . . \\"And the admitting nurse would interrupt me, barely able to control her giggling, \\"Yeah, yeah . . . Then what happened? Wait! Mary, Stan, come over here, she's really funny. Start from the beginning.\\"\\"I was hurting so much I couldn't move,\\" I continued.\\"The admitting nurse started laughing hysterially. \\"Oh yes. That's great, it's hilarious. Ooooo, I've got an idea. Tell the rest of it like you're on the phone with God. That would make it really funny\\"\\"So after I made it past the admitting nurse, they had me sit on these extremely uncomfortable plastic chairs (they were rejected by Greyhound bus stations for being too painful) in the waiting area again until they could find someone to help me. Everybody else there was watching TV. They finally wheeled me in to see a doctor because my crying and screaming in pain was ruining people's TV-viewing experience. \\"Keep it down, we're trying to watch Jerry Springer!\\""},{"Title":"My Point...And I Do Have One","review":"As always Ellen DeGeneres is a great read. I found myself laughing out loud. If you like Ellen's comedy you'll love her books."},{"Title":"My Point...And I Do Have One","review":"All I can say is that this woman has to be one of the funniest people, if not THE funniest. I read this book while sitting in an empty classroom, by myself, during my lunch break and I was laughing out load. So loud, in fact, that the teacher from the class next door came over to see what was going on. When she saw I was by myself she gave me a look that clearly meant &quot;You are a big big freak.&quot; I would give anything to see Ellen in person and I wish I knew where to write to her."},{"Title":"My Point...And I Do Have One","review":"Ellen has a new and refreshing way of writing books. There wasn't one page that I didn't laugh while reading, but it was the subtle and easy-going manner that really got my attention.If you like a good laugh you simply can't miss this book."},{"Title":"My Point...And I Do Have One","review":"I enjoyed Ellen's sense of humour but I wanted to find out more about her and her life and her partner and coming out and all the stuff she has been through because she is gay.

Overall the book was entertaining and yes very funny but what about the rest"},{"Title":"My Point...And I Do Have One","review":"I would have to agree with one of the previous people who read this book and say, that you just have to imagine Ellen talking while you are reading the book. Imagine her facial expressions and the way she tries to make you feel she is unsure of herself when she is talking but she is really hitting the point home. By the way, great job hosting the Grammies, you stole the show. I hope they let you host it again next year"},{"Title":"My Point...And I Do Have One","review":"This book, written by the highly successful comedian, EllenDegeneres, is not written as a auto-biography, nor is itwritten to show her personal philosophy of the universe,although this does shine through in parts of the book, nothis book is straight out comedy. It is the funniest bookthat I have ever read, and I read books all the time. Ihave been a fan of Ellen's since her sitcom debuted on TV.I have been entertained by her sense of humor, her stand up,and this book is just a logical step in her career. Thebook is a written testament to this woman's creative talent,as well as her phenominal sense of humor. This book willhave you rolling on the floor with laughter. I highlyreccomend it!"},{"Title":"My Point...And I Do Have One","review":"This book is so funny , I couldn't stop laughing. In fact one time I was laughing so hard , my nose started bleeding.All you have to do while you're reading is imagine that it's her talking , and you're on a one way trip to non-stop laughter.This book was a bestseller for a long time , and it deserves that much. It's short , but according to Ellen , she is writing another one."},{"Title":"My Point...And I Do Have One","review":"this is the funniest book i have ever read! not stop laughs - and i laughed literally out loud each page! definately will read again and again, her style of humor is wonderful"},{"Title":"My Point...And I Do Have One","review":"I love Ellen DeGeneres as an actor and a comedienne. When I read this book, whilst I found some parts of it amusing, I have to say it wasn't as funny as I expected. Part of my disappointment was that this book was written before Ellen came out and when I read it, I can see she is holding back. There are a couple of references to relationships with men that just don't ring true. It's worth a read, but I don't think it's the funniest thing I have read."},{"Title":"My Point...And I Do Have One","review":". . . there never was one . . . and never will be . . . the book is totally pointless . . .

I just couldn't help but bust out laughing, Ellen has a completely original brain and is quite a kidder. I had picked the book up in the store and looked at one page, all about how important flossing is, and thought \\"Wow! This is not worth any money at all, I'll have to check this out of the library!\\"So, ten years later, I did. Every time I turned a page, I expected to come across that section on flossing. Guess what. No luck! Did Ellen write another book only for libraries, without the flossing section? I wasn't all that disappointed since, after all, I had read it before. Just puzzled. Where did those pages go? Maybe I'm just not a very careful reader: your call.I learned a lot about Ellen from the book, even though she was just kidding around. For one thing, don't even think about playing against her in tetherball. Be on the SAME team not the OPPOSITE one.I was pretty skeptical about her account of racing in the Iditarod, too. It was funny enough, but if she is really telepathic with animals I would have expected to hear a little bit more of the thoughts of her dogs, what they were thinking about the race. So I think there is a good possibility she exaggerated there, especially with the part about the cats pulling the dogsled. I forget if she mentioned what she said to the cats, but if you say \\"Mush\\" to dogs, it would have to be something different for the cats.I was pretty impressed with Ellen's vocabulary too, and finally learned what \\"Ipso Facto\\" means -- I had to go look it up in the dictionary. Kudos to you, Ellen, for helping me increase my vocab! Actually I haven't looked it up yet, but I plan to as soon as I finish this review.I did have one minor quibble, though, about the spelling. I had always thought the word for some little thing of indeterminate name was spelled \\"thingie\\", but Ellen spells it \\"thingee\\", which to me sounds more like an idiom of the subcontinent. Well, actually, since it isn't really an official word, I guess it could go either way. If I ever meet Ellen, this is what I will ask her about. But I will NOT challenge her to a tetherball game. If you want to find out about flossing, though, this book is not the right thingie for you.One thing I'm sure Ellen and I would agree on. This book was one chapter too long. You can skip the last chapter, and not miss much."},{"Title":"My Point...And I Do Have One","review":"After listening to Helen DeGeneres faked croc tears over her dog, she entered the ranks of the 'best forgotten'."},{"Title":"My Point...And I Do Have One","review":"In a book of 60,000 words, I only found a couple hundred to be VERY funny."},{"Title":"My Point...And I Do Have One","review":"I was hoping for something a little kinkier."},{"Title":"My Point...And I Do Have One","review":"This was the worst book I've ever read.

Whether she's talking about training her two dogs for the Iditarod on the pavements of LA or pondering why airline meats always display incongruous grill-marks, it's easy to see why she is one of America's favorite comics. The zippy way she flits from one topic to the next like a human hummingbird is matched only by the ongoing references to her angst about being able to meet her publishing contract's word-count. Anyone who has ever seen the musical \\"You're a Good Man Charlie Brown\\" will be mirthfully reminded of Lucy writing her book report about Peter Rabbit."},{"Title":"My Point...And I Do Have One","review":"This book was HILARIOUS .......the first chapter or 2.

Please do NOT buy it. It's more of a salafi tafsir that the Salafi government of Saudi Arabia is trying to pass off as a translation of the Qur'an itself. It may have a nice appearance and may even seem authentic at first because of the ahadith they cite to \\"support\\" their interpretation (mind you these ahadith are usually taken out of context). However, I must warn you not to fall for this. All you have to do is compare this horrid translation to any other more reputable translation like Muhammad Asad's or Yusef Ali's and you will begin to see that the Noble Qur'an is nothing more than a Salafi tafsir. It wouldn't be so bad if they just labeled it as a tafsir but they don't. They want you to actually think that the tafsir is the actual translation. That their interpretation is actually what the Qur'an says or means! They take such liberty to give the impression that the Qur'an hates Christians and Jews, thinks of women as filth, thinks that women should only have \\"one eye\\" exposed to see and other horrible things.Get a less controversial and more reputable translation like Muhammad Asad (which is awesome!). Asad actually tries to stays with what the Arabic says and lets you know clearly when he has interjected (which isn't often unlike the Noble Qur'an)."},{"Title":"The Noble Quran: Interpretation of the Meanings of the Noble Qur'an in the English Language (English and Arabic Edition)","review":"The 1993 edition (English&Arabic): Introduction: \\"xxx\\" pages of text; Quran: 930 pages; Glossary: 30 pages; and another 33 pages of commentary regarding: Why Allah sent prophets, Monotheism, Shahada, Polytheism & Disbelief, Shirk, Hypocrisy, the Jews and the Christians (see Quran 3:85), Christianity (\\"is men without a religion\\"[p.980]), Jesus (and the falsehood of his crucifixion), and Mary. (xxx&995 pages), hardback in slipcase."},{"Title":"The Noble Quran: Interpretation of the Meanings of the Noble Qur'an in the English Language (English and Arabic Edition)","review":"The most accurate Quran in English is the much-maligned (by politically correct Christian apologists of Islam) Hilali-Khan Quran (The Noble Quran) - it is most in line with a traditional Islamic understanding of the book, and supports itself with copious footnotes and citations drawn directly and verbatim from Bukhari (of Sahih Bukhari fame, a book that is regarded second only to the Quran by Muslims and forms a good amount of the basis of Shari'a law), Ibn Kathir, Ibn Taymiyya, and other foremost experts of classical Islam from the middle ages, whose interpretations are still hewed to by the vast majority of \\"observant\\" Muslims today. This is the Quran that is distributed in the desks of hotel rooms all across the Middle East and Muslim world, much as Gideon KJVs are in America. The Khan Quran is a Quran by and for full-blooded believers: it doesn't hold any punches, because it was written by Muslims for the internal consumption of Muslims, a captive audience, not written to try to gain converts. In this book, you will see why Mohammedan Jihadists are at constant war with the Civilised World, and indeed, must remain at war until the entirety of humanity is brought under the heel of Shari'a.A less-accurate and very stilted version (it uses pseudo-Jacobean English and grammar) is \\"The Meaning of the Holy Quran\\" by Abdullah Yusuf Ali, although it contains many footnotes (over 6000 long ones) to diffuse and lessen the impact of the most barbaric verses - which, indeed, are a good part of the Quran. However, these footnotes are written with an eye to defending the Quran against Christians, are extremely anti-Semitic, and have the aim of daw'ah, or, missionary work/conversion: they mis-translate, explain away, or gloss over all of the true evil contained in the book/The Muhammad Asad translation, \\"The Message of the Quran\\", is the worst available in English. It mangles every word and phrase that is offensive to Civilised sensibilities, to the point it translates verses about hitting your wife as \\"beating her lightly with a tooth stick\\" (how humiliating!), or as \\"leaving\\" her altogether, and translates \\"the fear of Allah\\" as \\"being conscious of God\\": his gloss of the Verse of the Sword (9:5) requires more intellectual dishonesty than a Jehovah's Witness arguing with a Mormon. He also translates (in my opinion, incorrectly) the heathen deity \\"Allah\\" as \\"God\\" with a capital \\"G\\", to again make it seem less alien to the Civilised, and has copious footnotes (although lacking in as much anti-Semitism, as Asad was a Jew who converted to Islam) that are written for a Christian or Jewish reader with the aim of conversion.Not to mention even Imams Abu Hanifa and Shafi'i believed that over 500 verses and some surat were removed from all physical manuscripts (mushaf) of the Quran - the most famous being the Satanic Verses and Surah of the Camel - proving that even the most illustrious early scholars of Islam believed that the Quran had been altered: they explained this away by saying the \\"true Quran\\" (which exists only in Heaven beside the throne of God) remains unaltered no matter what happens to earthly copies: with this logic, you could replace the Quran with the New Testament and it would still be \\"pure\\".The religion of Islam is spiritually dead, bellicose, fatalistic, and mediaeval: if it is studied, study it critically and with an academic eye. Islam has all of the hallmarks of a cult: it is the world's largest, by far, and it doesn't take but a few months to be indoctrinated enough that some of the disillusioned would be willing to sell their first-born and chomping at the bit to go wage \\"jihad in 'Allah's' cause\\".I tell you this as an ex-Muslim who finally broke the chains of Islamic indoctrination and fear of the graphically-depicted Hell: be warned."},{"Title":"The Noble Quran: Interpretation of the Meanings of the Noble Qur'an in the English Language (English and Arabic Edition)","review":"I am not a linguist or a translator but my impression of this copy of the Quran is that it is more akin to a Christian version of the Living Bible. It does not appear to be a word for word translation but more of a modern day version of what the Quran is trying to express.It is probably translated in a more agressive form than other efforts of the Quran. That does detract from it in my view because it at least warns Christians, Jews and other interested parties of a more radical understanding of what Islam actually embraces and teaches. I own 3 copies of the Quran but this is my go to copy. Despite what the moderate Muslims might say or believe we need to know what translation the radicals are most likely to get their theolgy from, which is the form of Islam we actually have to deal with.I would classify it as the worst case scenario Quran. The above reviewer pointed out the difference between this Quran and another version by siting the passage that is translated either as \\"strike the neck\\" as opposed to \\"cut off the head\\" of infidels. The question is not what does the Quran say or what does it mean, but how do the modern day Muslims understand it, intepret it and apply it.This version of the Quran more accurately reflects what I see going on in our world today.

This is the version that is published in and distributed (usually for free) by the government of Saudi Arabia. If you wish to understand the Wahhabi interpretation of Islam, this is the translation.It is very clear and very succinct and easy to read. It includes many tafsir (explanations from Islamic scholars) and Hadith of the Prophet Muhammad that adds depth to how the various verses have been understood and how they are understood today.There are several appendices (at least in the version I have) which help explain the concept of jihad and the understanding of Jesus/Christianity from an Islamic point of view.All in all, this version is very literal and very 'fundamentalist' (not in a militant sense but in the sense that the Quran is taken very literally and very seriously). One can not help but be moved by it.Again, if you wish to understand Islam better, especially the more 'fundamendalist' (i.e. no nonsense) understanding, this translation is a must have. On an aside, I would balance it out with some other versions (for example, Muhammad Asad and Yusuf Ali) to get a 'feel' for the diversity of how the Quran is understood and presented to non-Arabic speaking people.It's been five years since I originally wrote this review. While I stand by the original review, I have honed my senses a bit more and realize the deficiencies - and dangers - of this translation. It represents a very common translation that is very common throughout the U.S. Those free Qur'ans you see online? This is most likely the one you'll get.What prompted the update was a book I just read by Khaled M. Abou Fadl called Conference of the Books and was so moved I had to include his words in this review.In his chapter called \\"Corrupting God's Book\\" he takes this particular translation to task, calling it a \\"Trojan-horse\\" of a translation that is found in nearly every Islamic store or center in the U.S., noting that it has \\"the appearance of a translation\\" that takes \\"gross liberties\\" in translating the text. Not only are the Qur'anic verses spun to the Wahhabi understanding, so too the hadith-reports contained in the footnotes are \\"grossly corrupted.\\"Here it is in a nutshell:\\"It is clear that the authors of the translation and their supporters do not like women, and that they projected their inadequacies and deformities upon God's text and the whole Islamic intellectual tradition.\\"Wow.Still, a vital translation if you wish to understand how the Qur'an is understood according to this particular ideology."},{"Title":"The Noble Quran: Interpretation of the Meanings of the Noble Qur'an in the English Language (English and Arabic Edition)","review":"This book although the name suggest that it has commentaries from three elite ulema, I think it is mostly English Translation of the Qur'an with some explanations in the paranthesis. There is another version of this book which is published in ten volumes. If you got the time to read that version has more explanations of course due to sheer volume of the book but still you see more comments from Bukhari than Tabari or Kurtubi. You could say that Tabari, Kurtubi, Ibn Keshir also used the Hadits from Bukhari but it would have been nice if referenced were made from which commentator the explanations were taken. Overall the book is good and easy to read explanations are straight in the line without going into notes at the bottom of the pages.

If you want to know what the Qur'an says, the best thing to do is learn Classical Arabic and sit with a scholar as Arabic, like some other languages, cannot really be translated. What you really read is someone's interpretation of what they understand the Arabic to mean. If learning Arabic is not an option, the best interpretation of the Qur'an in English so far is Muhammd Muhsin Khan's translation which is available here The Noble Quran: Interpretation of the Meanings of the Noble Qur'an in the English Language (English and Arabic Edition) and here Noble Qur'an, the-English Translation of the Meanings and Commentary. The problem with most translations/interpretations is usually the translator is weak in their knowledge of one or more of the following Arabic/English/Islam. Muhammad Asad's translation is a bad one because he greatly distorts the beliefs of Islam and one will come away with an unusual and incorrect view of what the beliefs of Islam are. Muhammad Muhsin Khan's translation/interpretation shows a strong command of Arabic, English and Islam. Until one learns Arabic, this book is probably the best option."},{"Title":"The Noble Quran: Interpretation of the Meanings of the Noble Qur'an in the English Language (English and Arabic Edition)","review":"Something I think many have missed who have reviewed this Quran is that it uses accuracy to promote an inaccuracy. The inaccuracy is made invisible by a veneer of hadith. Even the notion of abrogation is problematic, a fact which should not go unnoticed.How and why its accuracy is inaccurate is because about 100 years ago the Ottoman Empire was overthrown by Western powers. What happened in the Middle Eastern countries was a power vacuum that undermined the mainstream ideologies. Because the West has a history (as does Islam towards the West, to be fair) of \\"interfering\\" with the Middle East, an incipient anti-Western ideology swelled to the forefront in what is called the Wahhabi movement.This Wahhabi movement was a largely puritanical and militant reformation and oversimplification of Islam couched in anti-Western sentiments. This is what has become modern Islam, and so the Quran under discussion is \\"accurate\\" in its portrayal of the Quran in this light, but inaccurate in its ability to accurately present the continuous stream of Islamic consciousness from its inception. It has the information, but not the ethos.Islam actually has a much more peaceful side which has been buried under deep resentments. Too many times in history have Christians, Jews, and Muslims gotten along peacefully side by side for someone to believe in a basic social incompatibility. Even the sack of Jerusalem by the Crusading Franks saw the indiscriminate killing of Jews and Orthodox Christians. In other words, the Christians and Jews of Jerusalem lived relatively peacefully together at that time. At times, Christians and Muslims have actually used the same building, though on different days, to worship.This Quran really misrepresents Islam in the most subtle way by using \\"accurateness\\" to paint a distorted picture. The Wahhabi movement has almost totally changed the ethos of the Islamic faith, and of course it tries to quote hadith to support its positions - every group does this, tying themselves to history to appear more legitimate.The idea of abrogation, also, is problematic. There are legitimate schools of interpretation that state that nothing present in the Quran is actually abrogated. Quite literally, if it were abrogated, it would not be there. It would have actually been removed, forgotten, or replaced; not inserted or remaining like some curious sedimentary layer. The presence of \\"contradictions\\" which most claim abrogate other verses, are really places where a more nuanced view is required to contextualize the verses in question. Those who favor these \\"abrogations\\" are usually oversimplifying so as to press an agenda which, admittedly, the Quran can easily be made to seem to say.The destruction of the Ottoman Empire broke the continuity of spiritual leadership which had kept these tendencies in check. People may want to \\"poo poo\\" it, but the destruction of a thousand year empire of the stature and grandeur of the Ottoman Empire does something to profoundly effect a people. This should not be underestimated when trying to understand how modern Islamic \\"authorities\\" exegete their texts.To close, the text of the Noble Quran here, as a result of an incredibly complex history, expresses an oversimplified and incorrect view of the Quran. It is \\"accurate\\" in that it is the same words, and accurate in that it is how the majority of modern Islamic \\"authorities\\" interpret the text, but inaccurate in that it is from an ideology divorced from the actual stream of Islamic transmission broken after World War I. These authentic \\"transmissions\\" still exist, but they do not control the money or the power that backs the Wahhabi who prints these books and controls Medina through an implied force of arms. The Wahhabi are sincere, of course, but are simply in error in that they lack the fullness of their own faith. The power they gain and command through their vast fortunes make accountability to ancient Islamic orthodoxy problematic, to say the least.Ironically, it is many of the \\"moderate\\" Muslims living in the West who are the more authentic Muslim ideologues, and who in many cases escaped the Middle East so as to escape the ideological tyranny of the Wahhabi. This is why they are often able to be more accurate than their Middle Eastern brethren, yet appear to have capitulated to \\"western\\" values.Good sources for sound Muslim doctrine are al-Ghazzali, al-Qushayri, and al-Qadir al-Jilani. These men were able to communicate the fullness of their faith, and in such a way as to communicate the true ethos of authentic Islam. A sincere search of their doctrine will lead one to other sound Islamic teaching. Good luck. Allah Maak!"},{"Title":"The Noble Quran: Interpretation of the Meanings of the Noble Qur'an in the English Language (English and Arabic Edition)","review":"This translation reads more like a supremacist Muslim, anti-Semitic, anti-Christian polemic than a rendition of the Islamic scripture and is exactly the wrong way to show the world that Islam IS a religion of peace and tolerance. The fact that it is the most widely distributed Qur'an in most Islamic bookstores and Sunni mosques in the English-speaking world makes it even more problematic. The fact that it has received a seal of approval from both the University of Medina and the Saudi Dar al-Ifta (and freely distributed by the Saudi government) should tell anyone knowledgeable that it is a very biased politically motivated work.As an example, in the first sura (1:7), verse which are universally accepted by the majority of Islamic scholars as, \\"Guide us to the straight path, the path of those whom You have favored, not of those who have incurred Your wrath, nor of those who have gone astray\\" become, \\"Guide us to the Straight Way, the way of those on whom You have bestowed Your Grace, not (the way) of those who have earned Your anger (such as the Jews), nor of those who went astray (such as the Christians).\\" Particularly egregious is that this is followed by a long footnote to justify its hate based on traditions from medieval texts.Another example of political bias is where other, unbiased translations of the Qur'an report Moses's address to the Israelites (5:21) as \\"O my people! Enter the Holy Land that God has assigned unto you,\\" but this version twists the verse with modern politics, writing, \\"O my people! Enter the holy land (Palestine).\\" This is just one egregious example of political motivation among many that pollute the translation, marring what should be a reflection of timeless religion.These conclusions were reached while recently in a comparitive world religions class at university taught by a Muslim professor with a visiting Jewish professor. They recommended \\"The Koran Interpreted\\" by Arthur Arberry (the title of which reflects orthodox Muslim view that the Qur'an cannot be translated, but only interpreted) and \\"The Message of the Qur'an\\" by Muhammad Asad as the best translations available in English."},{"Title":"The Noble Quran: Interpretation of the Meanings of the Noble Qur'an in the English Language (English and Arabic Edition)","review":"If you want a Salafi version of the Quran, this one is for you.

You cannot help but come away enriched after reading it."},{"Title":"The Noble Quran: Interpretation of the Meanings of the Noble Qur'an in the English Language (English and Arabic Edition)","review":"1.0 out of 5 stars Misleading translations!, October 7, 2012By Jeff Siddiqui (Seattle WA USA) - See all my reviewsThis review is from: Interpretation of the Meanings of the Noble Quran (Hardcover)The Noble Quran\\" is published in Arabia and has extremely misleading, hate-filled translations of the Quran which, in its original Arabic version, has not such messages. The translators and the commentators of \\"THE NOBLE QURAN\\" have injected venom into the word of God. It is as if they have the arrogance to know what God meant when he said certain things through the prophet Mohammed (saw). As if the translators had been contacted directly by God (Vahih) who said, \\"Here is a more complete version of what I meant when I was speaking to Mohammed, now go tell everyone else\\".In important texts, there are always footnotes to help the reader gain a better understanding of what is written. There is however, a huge difference between a footnote comment and parenthetical comment inserted within the text. A footnote is related but not necessarily an actual meaning of a text, it is in part, a clarifying opinion of the author/translator and may be removed without doing any damage to the original text. A parenthetical comment suggests that the words are actually an integral part of the meaning of the original text and cannot be removed without changing the intent of the text.Take the opening chapter of the Quran (\\"Al Fatiha\\" 1:1-7). Consisting of seven verses, it is simple enough and very much like \\"The Lord's Prayer\\". It goes something like this:\\"Oh God, we praise your name, you are the one God, master of the Judgment Day, Lord of all worlds. Help us stay on the path of those who have gained your favor and not on the path of those who have incurred your wrath, or those who have gone astray\\".It takes a conscious effort to turn this simple prayer, often known as the heart of the Quran, into a hate-filled diatribe that the Arabian publishers have done with \\"THE NOBLE QURAN\\". In their version, the last verse of the first chapter (1:7) ends with:\\"...and not on the path of those who have incurred your wrath (such as the Jews), or those who have gone astray (such as the Christians)\\".Uninitiated non-Muslims who may have the misfortune of coming across \\"THE NOBLE QURAN\\" when they were trying to learn about Islam, would be completely convinced that Muslims are instructed to hate (destroy) all Jews and Christians. We do not need such a misleading item representing Islam or Muslims.Take the outlook at the difference in what the Quran really says about women and on adultery in Chapter 24 (\\"The Light\\") and how \\"THE NOBLE QURAN\\" presents the translation:Verse 24:2 deals with punishment for and adulterer or an adultress. All versions I have seen, say that the punishment for either is a hundred lashes, but translators in \\"THE NOBLE QURAN\\" are not satisfied with this, they have added: (\\"this punishment is for unmarried person guilty of the above crime but if married persons commit it, the punishment is to stone them to death, according to Allah's law\\").I have about a dozen different hard-copy translations, NONE of which include this condemnation of Jews and Christians or, the bloody-minded punishments. It matters not whether the translators are Sunni or Shia.There are plenty of excellent, accurate translations of the Quran to choose from, this one must definitely be avoided."},{"Title":"The Noble Quran: Interpretation of the Meanings of the Noble Qur'an in the English Language (English and Arabic Edition)","review":"This translation of the Qur'an is one of the most accurate and fluent up to date. Having said that some people do not like the explanatory brackets because it takes away from the fluidity! Only some people, however, have trouble with this - as a whole it is one of the two best translations available in english. I strongly recommend that no other translations be bought. The most popular translations sold on this site are unfortunately not very good. Abdullah Yusuf Ali's was the standard for a long time - but in light of this one it now falls into the background and should no longer be used. He was not a scholar and his mistakes are numerous. As for the others they are absolutely terrible!The translators of this book are from Medina (the Prophet's city)and have had the work thoroughly checked by people of knowledge.The second of the 2 best translations i mentioned, which in terms of english alone, is better than this one - is the 'Majestic Quran' published by Starlatch press.

Gourmet cooking is left to other cultures. The recipes in this cookbook are authentic. The book was published in England shortly after WWII before we became aware of what a lot of saturated fat will do to your health. I am Dutch and I like this cookbook because it helps me to convert my Dutch recipes to American availability. Dutch butchers cut meat differently than what is available in the U.S., so quite often it is difficult to know what meat to buy. I wish I had been able to get this cookbook when I came to the U.S."},{"Title":"Cut and Assemble Colonial Houses in Full Color: Five Historic Buildings in H-O Scale","review":"As much as we booklovers learn from reading, we know that real knowledge comes from doing. So build a colonial house! On a nearby table. In 1/87 scale. These are straightforward drawings on heavy stock paper, bound with information about each house and instructions on how to cut out pieces and assemble them with glue. Edmund Gillon published a dozen or so such books with Dover and Schiffer in the 1980s and 1990s. This is one of the later ones; while some of his Victorian models got rather complex, these buildings are earlier in history (1677 to 1760), less complex in style, and easier to both cut and glue. Admittedly, I have not finished all five yet, but the book is nice to have around to just think about one day having each on a book shelf or mantle. And they are scaled for HO gauge model train layouts.An older child or adult will take an hour or two on each of these and cannot help but become somewhat aware of architectural styles and lifestyles 300 years ago in the building process. Children below the age of ten should start with something easier since the model-making involves small pieces and patience. But the price is cheap to get Gillon's detail work, a hand-made model that will hold up well (some of my others still look good after 15 years)and attract attention, and lead you into this country's history (East Coast version)."},{"Title":"CliffsTestPrep California High School Exit Exam: Mathematics","review":"Amazon folks,I was buying this book for a friend and I thought it was in Spanish.

Chances are good you will find something that is perfect right here in this book. In the book, WEDDING BLESSINGS by June Cotner, you'll find page after page of unique blessings to add a special touch to your occasion. I've included numerous derivatives of what I've found in this book in many of the weddings I have performed.Cotner has separated the contents into seven chapters here to include Verses and Readings, Wedding Vows, Wedding Prayers, Wedding Blessings, Wedding Toasts, Wedding Anniversaries and Wedding Reflections. I seldom use something verbatim, but often put together some sort of derivative to fit a particular couple or occasion.At a recent ceremony I performed, I read a slightly altered version of the reading titled \\"Abundance and Light\\"(p32). After the ceremony, I had a couple come to me to thank me. Their story was, they almost didn't come to the wedding as their marriage had deteriorated and they were going the following week to file for divorce. The woman told me, as I was reading it, her husband reached over and took her hand. When I finished the reading, he whispered to her that he thought they needed to go home and work this out. Well, to make a long story short, after counseling with them several times, their marriage is now on the road to recovery. It's just one of those things that makes being a minister worth all the hard work. Perhaps you too, will find something valuable in this little book that will have a very positive influence on you, or someone close to you.Even if there isn't a wedding in your future, you will still enjoy reading what Cotner has assembled here. So many books of this type offer the same fare as the next one, but here I found many verses I had never heard before.Monty RaineyWedding Ministry by Design"},{"Title":"We Need to Talk","review":"I appreciated almost all of what was offered, especially from a Christian perspective.

Vol. 2052)","review":"Portfolio analysis, the titular subject of the book, is a well-known strategic technique, but in all probability few academics in the field of management and few practitioners and industry observers would have such detailed knowledge about the managerial technique as that displayed by the author, Mike L. Thomas. Arranged in three parts and seven chapters, the book's Part One, &quot;Theoretical Research,&quot; is made up of an introduction and overview, a literature review and definitions, and a conceptual framework for strategic decisions. The framework is based upon contingency theory views. Part Two, &quot;Empirical Research,&quot; discusses managerial aspects of international air transport services. In addition, it provides a detailed description of the field study results. Part Three, &quot;Applied Research,&quot; explores different models for strategic portfolio analysis as they are applied to airline planning, and offers concluding remarks and suggestions. Its probably best known version in the literature on strategic management is the BCG growth-share matrix. Thomas's discussion of the advantages and problems of this matrix is the best that I have read. Equally commendable is his review of the refinements of the growth-share matrix, as well as other models for strategic portfolio analysis. Overall, the author demonstrates that portfolio management may create the necessary context for stimulating innovation and help solve the industry's most critical problem, namely, its inability to match supply with demand. One of the author's findings was that in most of the airlines he surveyed, executives were preoccupied with pressing operational issues, with tactical management, so that strategic issues were generally ignored. He found that most airlines in his surveys do no strategic planning in any formal sense. They rely on financial planning, based on budgets. In conclusion, this book on portfolio management as it applies to strategic airline planning is admirable. Notably, the book includes both a very extensive reference list and a quite useful glossary of terms."},{"Title":"A Portfolio Management Approach to Strategic Airline Planning: An Exploratory Investigative Study on Services Management (European University Studies: Series 5, Economics and Management. Vol. 2052)","review":"Thomas' book is a particularly timely and valuable contribution to the development of more effective strategic management of air transportation. The objective of his research effort was to improve the implementation of the concept of portfolio management as an instrument of strategic planning in the commercial airline industry. The book proves that this objective has been reached and offers guidelines for an effective (rather than an efficient) management of commercial airlines. The work is well organized in three parts (theoretical, empirical and applied research) and very well written, thus easy to read. Based upon his excellent knowledge of modern management literature, the author developed an &quot;integrative management framework&quot;, which consists of the systems approach as part of contingency theory. This holistic approach secures a solid framework for the empirical research and allows comprehensive conclusions on the management trinity (policy, process, people, i.e. culture). The research method consists of intensive semi-structured interviews with higher level airline executives. The survey is not representative for the entire industry, but it offers extremely interesting patterns of management practices and allows the development of relevant strategic guidelines. The author sees the limits of the portfolio management concept and, therefore, his findings are convincing that, under certain conditions, this instrument is very useful for the management of strategic issues which benefit from visual presentation. The author offers with his book not a solution but a better management of international airlines in turbulent and competitive markets. Overall, he shows a way how to build a strong corporate sector in a service industry and in society in general, without cutting costs and manpower. Today, this is the most important contribution to the theory and practice of business management."},{"Title":"A Portfolio Management Approach to Strategic Airline Planning: An Exploratory Investigative Study on Services Management (European University Studies: Series 5, Economics and Management.

But little do they realise that the inventor is really the Master, and that to defeat his plans they will have to journey back to ancient Atlantis itself...Many aspects of this story are lifted directly from 'The Daemons', but it remains a pale copy.

The strips document the misadventures of Calvin, a small boy, and his stuffed toy tiger, Hobbes (who comes to life in Calvin's vivid imagination). In this volume we see Calvin's alter egos (daring interplanetary adventurer Spaceman Spiff, private eye Tracer Bullet), get a lesson in Calvinball (&quot;No sport is less organized than Calvinball!), witness the rampage of the Calvinosaurus, and attend meetings of the G.R.O.S.S. (Get Rid Of Slimy girlS) club.Many of the storylines in this book have a strong science fiction element: in Calvin's imagination, his &quot;personal gravity polarity&quot; is reversed; he turns into a giant; etc. But the most fun comes when Calvin decides to clone himself. Much of the humor springs from the discontinuity between Calvin's rich fantasy world and the perspective of his often frustrated parents. Through it all, Hobbes remains a witty and philosophical pal to the mischievous Calvin.C&amp;H is a comic strip that is both consistently funny and consistently intelligent. The art is great, especially in the fantasy sequences (check out the noirish milieu of Tracer Bullet, for example). Calvin himself is a nonconformist, a terror to authorities of all types, a dreamer and a schemer -- he's one of the all-time great comic strip characters, and &quot;Scientific Progress&quot; is a great showcase for him and Hobbes."},{"Title":"Scientific Progress Goes 'Boink': A Calvin and Hobbes Collection","review":"The title of this book refers to the classic sequence of strips in which Calvin first uses his (cardboard box) duplicator to make a copy of himself that he hopes will do all the unpleasant things he has to do (like go to school).

Thanks, Bill."},{"Title":"Scientific Progress Goes 'Boink': A Calvin and Hobbes Collection","review":"This wonderful collection of cartoons has provided me many hours of enjoyment. As all fans of Calvin and his companion tiger Hobbes know, Bill Watterson's imagination has created a comic strip whose characters wonderfully capture flights of fantasy that help many of us vividly recall some of our most memorable childhood experiences. Calvin (in his many roles), Hobbes - the wonderful embodiment of every child's most loyal companion , Susie Derkins - the little girl next store who is constantly appalled by Calvin's weirdness,, Moe the bully, and Rosalyn the constantly embattled babysitter all manage to come to life in episodes that are sure to bring smiles to the faces of everyone who get to know them.This is fantasy at its best, at times simply lighthearted everyday experiences observed from Watterson's unique perspective and at other times cartoons being used as the conduit for wonderful philosophical observations. I found equally priceless both Hobbes leering smile as he responds to Calvin's question \\"I wonder why man was put on earth. What's our purpose? Why are we here?\\" with the simple answer \\"Tiger Food\\" and Calvin's sudden frightening bout with cubism when his ability to see both sides in a debate fractured his perspective and led him to see everything from all angles. In fact, the title of my review is adapted from one of my other favorite episodes in the book.Calvin's love of life and Hobbes love of Calvin are contagious; I found myself cheering them on and not wanting the book to end. (Luckily there are many other collections of this comic strip which was sadly terminated after only ten years.) I continually smile, chuckle and on occasion laugh out loud whenever I pick up this book, which I often do in my spare moment. And if you're with someone else when you're reading these, your progress will be slowed but your enjoyment increased by your desire to share the delight which you experience. A wonderful book for kids of all ages (I'm only 63) and most adults will enjoy it as well.Tucker Andersen"},{"Title":"Scientific Progress Goes 'Boink': A Calvin and Hobbes Collection","review":"When you get right down to it, is there anything better than Calvin & Hobbes? In this compilation or any of the others, you get lessons in quantum physics, nostalgic looks at the agony of grade school, observations in human nature, and a bit of the \\"thing under the bed\\" style horror. All this and you'll laugh yourself to the point of wetting your pants.The Calvin & Hobbes strips are hysterical. But beyond that, they are poignant and often bittersweet, reminding us of the children we once were and of the rich fantasies that come with childhood.Behold Calvin, utterly impish and wise-beyond-his years. His snowmen displays, at times morbid at times downright surreal, could fill a collection of its own.Calvin fancies himself the smartest boy in the world. And who can argue with him, other than his long-suffering parents and his faithful friend Hobbes, a tiger who may or may not be real.Hobbes is the pentultimate friend. He is Calvin's confidante and his patient ear, but he is also the first to pounce on the boy or to challenge his sordid views of the world. Together, the pair ponder the meaning of life, question the adult world, or sneak off to explore the fascinating landscapes of childhood found under dead logs or under rocks.If I were banished to a small island with only scant supplies to get me through my days, this book would be among the items in my trunk. I have had this collection for ten years or more and I've gone through it a dozen times. I'll go through it a dozen more before it's battered to the point of unreadable.Watterson is an absolute genius.

They are ages 9, 8, and 6."},{"Title":"Scientific Progress Goes 'Boink': A Calvin and Hobbes Collection","review":"There is one thing about any Calvin and Hobbes book, they are always funny. They are funnier if you have children. This edition has several classic sequences. In one series Calvin duplicates himself, and mayhem ensues, all blamed, of course, on the duplicates. Naturally Calvin has a unique way of getting out of trouble. Calvin also has a rather entertaining time with his babysitter, who seems forever doomed to being outwitted by Calvin, even if she always wins in the end (and Calvin's parents always lose as they have to bribe her to come back).Of course there are always the ever-interesting Spaceman Spiff strips, usually involving either Calvin's teacher or his mother. Calvin also appears in a number of strips as a carnivorous dinosaur, the Calvinosaurus. As with any Calvin and Hobbes book, there are the inevitable interactions with Hobbes that extend from fighting and arguing to tender solitary moments.Because Calvin and Hobbes is a unique series it is difficult to compare to other series or books. All the books I have are all generally of equal quality in terms of the stories. I have a slight preference for the treasury books with their color strips, but Calvin and Hobbes are funny in color or black and white. If you need a good laugh, you'll likely find it here."},{"Title":"Scientific Progress Goes 'Boink': A Calvin and Hobbes Collection","review":"Bill Watterson is an expert scientist who writes authoritatively on the subject. All Calvin and Hobbes books deserve ore than 5 stars.

There are no words that can describe the creativity of Bill Watterson and his ability to make us all relive our Calvin and/or Hobbes days."},{"Title":"Scientific Progress Goes 'Boink': A Calvin and Hobbes Collection","review":"Bill Waterson is argudably one of the best comic writers out there. Even through his retirement, he has made great books of past comics featuring his Calvin and Hobbes characters. I laugh and laugh at these comics he creates and I sometimes wonder how he comes up with such brilliant ideas sometimes with the storylines of some of the strips.Calvin, one of his best known characters, is the trouble-making kid in the school. He is funny and imaginative and likes to make funa and games with his &quot;real&quot; pet friend Hobbes. Through the comics, you can see the relationship between a stuffed animal and a human.In this comic though, Hobbes &quot;comes to life&quot; in Calvins eyes. The things that Calvin can sometimes get involved in is so hilarious and sometimes out of this world.I guarantee that anyone that loves comics will fall in love with this one and should definitely buy this book to start their collection of classic comics.All of Bill Waterson's comic books are very well done and very professional. His work is his life and it shows the time and consideration it took to make these characters come to life. Thank you Mr. Waterson for creating such a great comic and thatnk you people for reading my review!"},{"Title":"Scientific Progress Goes 'Boink': A Calvin and Hobbes Collection","review":"Bill Watterson's Calvin & Hobbes is a rare treat to the American entertainment world. It's a classic comic strip about a six year old mischievous boy and his make believe best friend: the stuffed tiger, Hobbes. I've been rereading all of the books in this series throughout my life, and I never tire of them. Watterson's magnificent blend of simple childhood humor, advanced appropriate grown-up humor, make-believe and childhood realism make this well written and illustrated comic strip a treasure to have in any household. Both adults and children will love it.What's worse than one troublesome six year old boy? Answer, 6 of them! All due to Calvin's new device: the duplicator. Now Calvin is getting a taste of his own medicine as his clones are causing trouble with his parents, and Calvin is getting blamed. This is all part of Calvin's imagination, of course, but the storyline reads just as any good sci-fi novel would. This book also features 2 stories with Calvin and his dreaded baby-sitter: Rosalyn. Both are hilarious as Calvin pushes Rosalyn to her limits with his troublesome ways.This book explores many humorous aspects to the life of a six year old boy. His hatred of school and girls, his wild imagination which at times will cause him to morph into his alter-ego: Spaceman Spiff, and the hindrance of having loving parents who want him to be responsible. I highly recommend!Darien Summers, author ofThe Mischievous Hare, a children's book."},{"Title":"Scientific Progress Goes 'Boink': A Calvin and Hobbes Collection","review":"I highly recommend anything to do with Calvin and Hobbes.

I love when that happens!SPGB relies more on some of Calvin's alter egos (Spaceman Spiff, the brilliantly hilarious Tracer Bullet [who I can't get enough of] and Stupendous Man) and less on some of the strips more salient supporting characters, such as Ms. Wormwood, Susie Derkins, and Rosalyn the dreaded babysitter.I can always count on Calvin and Hobbes to make me laugh, and to tease my brain cells a little.

I also like the part where Calvin and Hobbes make duplicates of Calvin and then transmogrify them into worms and travel to the dinosaurs.

This is why I like this book."},{"Title":"Scientific Progress Goes 'Boink': A Calvin and Hobbes Collection","review":"Calvin and Hobbes is one of my favourite cartoon series, and it is one of the few which can be equally enjoyed by adults and children alike.Bill Watterson has a M.A. in Political Science, which suggests the reason for the names of the main characters. Calvin is of course named after John Calvin, the Reformed theologian who advocated Predestination, and Thomas Hobbes, the English Political Philosopher Thomas Hobbes who argued for 'The War of all against All' in his social contract theory.Calvin is a somewhat dysfunctional six year old who is a constant headache to his parents, babysitters, teachers, and classmates. Calvin seems to embody several classic types of rebellious children in one character. Addicted to TV, hating girls, engaging in games which destroy the family home and engaging in wonderful fantasies make many of the high points of the series, which are darkly funny and often have a deeper satirical message about our world to the adult reader. To the younger reader, they no doubt will be delighted when Calvin makes his own time machine, goes back to the dinosaur age or becomes 'Spaceman Spiff' who fights evil aliens, or the 'Get Rid of Slimy Girls' Club Calvin forms with Hobbes.This is a delightful comic to own and enjoy, for adults and children alike."},{"Title":"Scientific Progress Goes 'Boink': A Calvin and Hobbes Collection","review":"Calvin is an extremely imaginative child and with his stuffed tiger Hobbes, engages in a series of adventures that are amusing, but also contain a serious purpose. Due to his short attention span and vivid imagination, Calvin does poorly in school and creates serious problems for his parents. Which is a description of the childhood of many people who went on to have very successful careers in a creative field. When I was young, I played a game called pretend, where for hours, I would imagine myself living various roles. Almost every night, from the time my mother finished dishes and vacated the kitchen until it was time to go to bed, I let my imagination run wild. It was a very fun time, as there were no limits on what I could do. In their biographies, many creative people refer to the vivid imaginations they had as children and how it led to problems in school.This collection of cartoons from the Calvin and Hobbes collection will amuse everyone. However, for those whose imaginations get in the way of their daily lives, they will have a special meaning. A problem child now, quite likely a successful artist, writer, entertainer or cartoonist in the future."},{"Title":"Scientific Progress Goes 'Boink': A Calvin and Hobbes Collection","review":"I thought Calvin and Hobbes Scientific Progress Goes 'Boink' was one of the best Calvin and hobbes that I have ever read.

I especially like the three-week long sequence in which Calvin walks upside down, and then grows bigger every second!

Bill Watterson writes for an intelligent audience and even though Calvin is six year old boy he often says things that are clearly the work of an adult.Calvin is determinedly and hillariously anti-authoritarian. Bill Waterson got into some trouble once for drawing a cartoon where Calvin fantasized about blowing up his school with an F-16 and heat seeking missles. I agree with Waterson that this just goes to show that some people were never kids."},{"Title":"Scientific Progress Goes 'Boink': A Calvin and Hobbes Collection","review":"truly and surely one of the best comic strips ever! were you to be sick in bed and need something to make you laugh, this is the best medicine!"},{"Title":"Scientific Progress Goes 'Boink': A Calvin and Hobbes Collection","review":"Calvin is sort of insane - he thinks his stuffed tiger is a real tiger, and he takes pictures of plastic dinosaurs and thinks they're real too. Hobbes is his stuffed tiger, who is smarter than Calvin, and likes snacks. Together they do crazy stuff, such as when they take saws and cut snowmen's heads apart, or terrorize a girl named Suzie by sledding into her.Very funny and peculiarly interesting for people who like sci-fi, realistic fiction, and humor. When I was in second grade I ran around screaming, \\"I'm a raving lunatic\\" for no reason whatsoever, and in third grade I spun around on my hands and knees just because I thought it was fun.

Surely, in these twenty eight interviews, questions are asked to which an admirer yearns for an answer. Granted some questions are echoed throughout various interviews - how much of Cheever's fiction is autobiography, for instance - a tendency the book's compiler mentions, still a lot of information about the writer's life, opinions, and working habits is presented. (A similar book and a suitable companion piece to this one is CONVERSATIONS WITH UPDIKE, particularly since the two were friends. Amazon carries it.)What follows is merely a smattering of information from this treasure trove. Cheever liked to select a different room in his house in which to write each story. Many of his short stories were drafted in three days. Usually, at the publication of one of his books, he fled to Europe to avoid interviews, a habit he discarded later in his career. He was fond of Labrador Retrievers and owned several of the breed. Anyone wishing to discover the intimate details about the renowned American's life would do well to own this source.John Cheever kept a journal throughout much of his career. An admirer might hope to find in them (they have been published) a glimpse into the artist's methods as can be found in the notebooks of Henry James. He is apt to be disappointed. Much of Cheever's journals concentrates on his amorous peccadilloes. CONVERSATIONS WITH CHEEVER compensates for what the journals lack. A reader will find on every page a nugget either factual or insightful on this esteemed writer."},{"Title":"Conversations With John Cheever (Literary Conversations Series)","review":"this collection of interviews is great for any fan of Cheever's work. it does get a bit repetitious, but there is so much about the man (and the author) in these interviews"},{"Title":"Keeper of the Keys","review":"We borrowed this book-on-cd for our roadtrip to St. Louis.

I've never been more disappponted than I am with Keeper of the Keys. I was bored from beginning to end. I don't think I will ever buy another O'Shaughnessy book. It was so poorly written that it didn't even seem like it was written by the same author. Boy, have the O'Shaughnessy sisters ever lost their edge. They never should have strayed from O'Reilly. You shouldn't fix what ain't broke. Now it's very broke and there ain't no way to fix it. What a waste of my time and money. UGH!"},{"Title":"Keeper of the Keys","review":"Who's got a secret? According to author Perri O\`Shaughnessy we all have secrets. And, at times, these are not just ordinary secrets such as, a black sheep in the family, credit card debt, or something like that. These secrets can be so dark and hidden so deeply that we are not even aware of them. Such is the case with architect Ray Jackson, protagonist in O'Shaughnessy's latest thriller Keeper of the Keys.Ray's wife, Leigh, has disappeared. He doesn't know where and he doesn't know why. Perhaps most importantly, he doesn't even know whether she is alive or dead. It's strange that he doesn't seem too upset about his missing spouse. Yet, Ray is an odd duck who obsesses about an unhappy childhood and the fact that he and his mother had to move frequently. As an adult and an architect he is now building houses like the ones he lived in as a child.He stays close to his mother, Esme, but she offers very little information about his father or his childhood. She will only say that his father was a difficult man and he deserted them when Ray was two . A dutiful son, Ray goes to her home to have dinner with her once a week, and she frets that he is so persistent about digging into his past.This issue is forced when Leigh disappears and he is confronted by her friend Kathleen, called Kat, who accuses Ray of having something to do with Leigh's disappearance. When the police enter the picture with probing questions he takes a set of keys that he has had since boyhood and revisits the houses he once lived in. What Ray eventually discovers is not at all what he hoped to find.Dick Hill, dubbed a Golden Voice by AudioFile magazine andactress Laural Merlington partner on this narration, which is a twofold treat for listeners.

However, I am happy to report that you will not be disappointed by this haunting new novel by the sister team known as \\"Perri O'Shaughnessy.\\" The writing style, memorable characters, exciting plot twists and delightfully realistic dialogue are right where they should be. Though we would like to have our favorite authors keep writing the series that we enjoy, we really must give them room to stretch and flex when they feel the need.The story opens with a conflict between Leigh and Ray Jackson, an upwardly mobile young couple with a bright future. He is the creative partner in an architectural firm, and she designs unique pieces of furniture. Unfortunately, Leigh's easy, comfortable themes are totally out of place in the ultra-modernistic home Ray built for them. In the same way, Leigh begins to feel out of place in Ray's life as his obsession to learn about his past begins to absorb more and more of his time. On the other hand, Ray suspects that Leigh has been pulling away from him and fears the worst, but has no ability to confront her. The Prologue ends with him thinking about ways to kill her.The next morning, Leigh is gone and Ray shows little interest in trying to find her. Dumdadumdum!The word \\"haunting\\" can be key in deciding whether or not I am in the mood to read a certain book. It often indicates that the work in question contains an obsessed person failing to satisfy his need, often verging on insanity. That can be discomforting at times and not the kind of entertainment I am looking for. At other times, however, it may be exactly what I need. In either case, KEEPER OF THE KEYS is a haunting story that occasionally gets bogged down in Ray's fruitless search for the truth about why his mother moved them 10 times before he entered high school, why he was never allowed to talk about his father, and what all of this has to do with the current problems he's having in his marriage.Nevertheless, by employing a small, distinctive and enjoyable cast of characters, O'Shaughnessy deftly moves the story between past and present, revealing more and more until the puzzle is fully revealed in an astonishing conclusion. Leigh's childhood friend, Kat, provides the inspiration that Ray needs to realize that he loves Leigh and wants her back more than anything else. From Ray's mom, who mysteriously starts drinking again, to Leigh's concerned parents and Kat's happily pregnant sister, Jacki, each one contributes to the story and its ultimate resolution.While we look forward to the next book in the Nina Reilly series, fans will not be disappointed by KEEPER OF THE KEYS.--- Reviewed by Maggie Harding, a substance abuse counselor in Phoenix, AZ who wanted to be Brenda Starr before life intervened. [...]"},{"Title":"Keeper of the Keys","review":"This is my first book by the O'Shaugnessy sisters so I go in with no pre-concieved expectations. And I can understand why there are so many negative reviews. It's because this book doesn't really fit in any pigeonhole. Is it a mystery, is it a thriller?It's kinda a little of both. It's not a hardcore mystery and not a hardcord thriller, in fact, you don't really know what it is until the end of the book. And like I said, because it's my first time reading these authors I wasn't disappointed because I wasn't expecting anything in particular.What I liked about it was it was easy to read and easy to follow. That's a definite plus - I read for pleasure, I'm not looking to unravel some obscure treatise. I liked the diverse characters in it and the plot was mystifying, a lot of which was because you don't know where this book was going(!)So if you're looking for some easy reading, give it a try. If you're looking for a hardcore thriller or mystery, you probably won't like it. If you want to know the premise of the book, it's about a wife who goes missing and how her husband goes about trying to locate her, or her dead body. And I think I will give these authors' other books a try too."},{"Title":"Keeper of the Keys","review":"I've read several books by Perri O'Shaughnessy and found them to be reasonable entertaining but Keeper of the Keys was a very poor effort. I don't just fault the authors, however. Where was the editor or publisher? Didn't anyone read this book before it was printed? I am not at all surprised by the negative comments regarding this book. What does amaze me, however, are the few individuals who thought it was good."},{"Title":"Keeper of the Keys","review":"This was my first time reading O'Shaughnessy and I was very disappointed. I love a good mystery but having a grown man use keys that he's had all his life to enter various houses he lived in as a boy bordered on the absurd for me. I got through the first 150 pages and could not go any further. I've heard really good things about the O'Shaugnessy novels and I couldn't wait to finally read one but I'm not sure I'll ever pick-up another one."},{"Title":"Keeper of the Keys","review":"Keeper of the KeysIn their acknowledgements, the authors suggest that they are starting out on a new path. I hope that they will reconsider. This novel was nowhere near to the writing excellence of the Nina Reilly series. The characters ane for the most part unbelieveable and at the end the plot resolution made no sense. The \\"stalker\\" would have involved the ploice early on. Look again at how the Nina Reilly series develops plots and realistic characters and you will see that there is no comparison in the quality of the works."},{"Title":"Keeper of the Keys","review":"Ray is a big-headed borderline sociopath who's chased off his selfish dull wife. Throughout the entire book, they both engage in an onslaught of reprehensible behavior and demonstrate histories of the same type of behavior.

The distance between them is growing, Leigh is having an affair with Ray's business partner, and Ray has developed an odd obsession with making models of every one of the numerous houses he and his mother lived in throughout his childhood. When Leigh disappears, he becomes even more obsessed, and begins questioning his mother about their nomadic past and visiting those old houses - sometimes even breaking in so he can roam their halls again. He's trying to understand something about his past that he knows is wrong, and his mother's escalating erratic behavior just confirms that he's on to something. What connection this has to his wife's disappearance he doesn't know, but he finds himself on a quest to both find her and unlock the dark secret of his childhood.This book was severely panned by every single review I read, but I actually liked it. It wasn't perfect by any stretch, and the connections between the events of the book are tenuous at best. Still, I enjoyed the pacing and the original concept. I've never read anything by O'Shaughnessy before, and actually the author is/are two people: sisters Pamela and Mary O'Shaughnessy, who are well-known and respected in the mystery genre for their Nina O'Reilly series, which I've not read. I got this book in hardcover format through my membership in the Mystery Guild book club."},{"Title":"Keeper of the Keys","review":"Perhaps I should have read the synopsis a bit closer, but after waiting several weeks to receive a much-anticipated new Perri O'Shaugnessy book, I was disappointed in the story. Being used to the tightly woven and fast-paced plots of the Nina Reilly tales, this story seemed loose-jointed and did not move forward at the same rate that I was turning pages. The author(s) spent more time describing parking problems in the Valley than character development. And the plot twists just did not seem to hold - there was a definite, and uncomfortable, blurring of the lines between antagonists and protagonists. I finished the book just to see if it would get better, and while there is a surprise ending, it just did not justify the rest of the story. Please, give me another Nina Reilly story and I'll once again be in the front row of Perri O'Shaugnessy fans."},{"Title":"Keeper of the Keys","review":"I just forced myself to finish Keeper of the Keys. I kept thinking and hoping that it would eventually get better, more interesting and finally make some real sense. Didn't happen...What a corny, confused, disjointed mess of a story. The entire plot was (thankfully) so unlike the other good novels the O'Shaughnessy gals have written. Rarely do I feel reading a book is totally a waste of time, but this is the exception. There was nothing to be gained or learned or enjoyed or appreciated by the reading of this novel. I don't know why they chose this story line, but it was in my opinion a big mistake. It was not clearly thought out nor written in an intelligent, engaging way. It was boring, dull and unfortunately a waste of time."},{"Title":"Keeper of the Keys","review":"This is not one of the Nina Reilly series of books. I say that because when an author deviates from their stock characters, one never knows what the outcome will be. This is a fine book with a predictable storyline. The characters seem a little too shallow and self-absorbed for my taste, but as a nice comfy read it's ok. There are no great surprises, nor thrilling episodes, just a quick and easy read.The premise that a crime may or may not have been committed falls short with no evidence nor forensics to tell either way. The shifting from locale to locale is confusing at times. I think the book would have been better if more time had been taken to give the characters a three dimensional aspect. They are a bit one sided and plastic.Coming to grips with one's emotions and deciding what one wants to do about forgiveness and their future should have more depth."},{"Title":"Keeper of the Keys","review":"As a big fan of the Nina Reilly series I was really disappointed in the last one.

I liked this story and had a hard time putting it down. I thought the characters were well drawn and the mystery is a good one. Go for it!"},{"Title":"Keeper of the Keys","review":"Ray Jackson has withdrawn into himself, spending his nights in the basement reconstructing the places he lived in as a child. There were many of them and his mother never gave him an exploration why they moved so much or when his father left them. His obsession began when his beautiful beloved wife Leigh asked him about having a child. On the night she disappeared, they had a terrible fight and he doesn't know if she is ever coming back.He has the keys to all the places he lived as a child and he gets into some of them finding cassette recordings of a man threatening his mother who won't discuss the matter with him. As the days go by and Leigh doesn't contact anyone, her parents begin to wonder if he did something to her and they report it to the police. When they question him, he lies to them, not telling them about the affair she had with his partner. Kat; a former friend of Leigh's wants to make peace with her and helps Jackson look for Leigh even if Kat isn't sure her husband is telling her the truth. When Ray finally leans the truth, he has a terrible decision to make one that could either destroy him or be the making of him.This is the first stand alone book apart from the Nina Reilly legal thrillers that this author team wrote and it is a superb work of suspense. Readers don't know if Leigh is alive or dead, whether Ray killed her or caused her disappearance. Ray is an average man, content to coast along until Kat gives him the impetus to find out what happened to Leigh. KEEPER OF THE KEYS is a tour de force with a shocking climax that will take readers by surprise.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Keeper of the Keys","review":"Although my favorite is Nina Reilly of Perri O'Shaugnessy's books, this one is a great read.

It got off to a bad start in the opening chapters because the main character is so unlikeable. From that point forward, I didn't care one way or the other what happened to him. Ray Jackson is a self-absorbed architect, whose wife Leigh leaves him after a fight. There is nothing redeemable about the character, and none of the other characters were well developed. The plot was silly. For some reason, the reader is supposed to believe that Ray kept keys from his childhood houses and is breaking into them to find out the secrets of his past. I suppose the author didn't consider that most people change the locks when they move into a house. And despite Ray's wife cheating on him, everything is fine between them when they reunite.

Instead of looking for her or enlisting the aid of the police, friends, and family, (he has strange priorites) he uses old keys (please people, if you buy a new house, get the locks changed)to break into houses where he use to live--he is looking for clues to his past as his mother won't tell him anything about his deceased father and why they so often moved."},{"Title":"Keeper of the Keys","review":"I am a great fan of these writers. That alone is why I purchased this book, however, I hope this isn't the only new direction they are taking, if it is I am afraid they just lost a big fan.

I know they worked hard at it.I do look forward, as I always do, to the next book by P.O'S..

I like to be given a little credit as a reader, and not have the author repeat the same thing over and over again, as if I couldn't pick up on it the first or second or third time. But I lost track of how many times the book mentioned the traffic in LA, or the burnt, ugly landscape. The characters weren't very interesting or likable, and I found myself not caring what happened to any of them.I had decided not to even finish it because it seemed like a waste of time, but I kept reading thinking it would get better, and I wanted to give the book a chance. I had guessed the ending long before I got to the last pages, and it seemed to be the culmination of a bad story that only got published because the authors had managed some halfway decent books in the past.

It's hard to enjoy a movie or TV program with holes in the plot, but a novel is even worse because you aren't facing a deadline of churning out a new script every week.Here are some of the problems: 1. Couldn't the cops, private eyes, FBI, etc. trace Esme's whereabouts through her social security number? I doubt she could hold the market job and other positions without one. 2. Wouldn't some investigative agency question Esme's mother at the time of Ray's disappearance and keep tabs on her for at least a few years after the abduction? Don't agencies have some way of checking names through public school enrollment. Birth certificates have to be shown at registration. 3. I find it beyond belief that Henry would break into the house through a cellar window. Each time he located Esme and Ray why didn't he contact the police since he had full legal custody.

I admit that I hung on until the end because I wanted to see where this mystery led, but I found myself skipping over chunks of repetitive and self-indulgent angst masquerading as character development so I could get to the next actual piece of action. A wife disappears, her architect husband may have killed her, her former best friend wants to make up, and so joins the search for her, and everybody is keeping secrets. It sounded great on the cover. Unfortunately, the publisher neglected to divulge that this author spends a lot of time writing about what a crummy place Los Angeles is (why?) instead of focusing on the story. Having read the other reviews of this book, the best I can say is that fans of O'Shaunessy's work seem to agree that this just isn't one of her best stories."},{"Title":"Keeper of the Keys","review":"In California's Topanga Canyon, trouble is brewing. A successful, yet moody young architect builds model houses in his basement, trying to recreate and make sense of his mysterious childhood. Moving from place to place, sometimes in the middle of the night, he feels disconnected. Surreal. But one thing Ray Jackson believes to be true--his mother dedicated her life to him. He also carries a ring of old keys. Keys that unlock all the houses they once lived in.But Leigh Jackson, successful in her own right as a maker of creative furniture, has been trying desperately to get his attention.That last night, after struggling to tell him what's on her mind, she abruptly leaves.Ray thinks she's gone to cool off and will be back. But time passes--days and then weeks. Leigh's father calls in the police, who suspect Ray may have done something to his wife. As if to somehow find answers to his past, as if they will help him with the current nightmare, he begins visiting those old houses--and in each one, finds mysterious audio tapes hidden in various secret compartments. Tapes that tell a story.Meanwhile, Kat and Jacki, sisters who grew up in Whittier, are thinking about the old days. Which is why Kat tries to connect with her old friend Leigh. Only to discover, of course, that she's gone missing. Even though she kind of suspects Ray, too, Kat is drawn into helping him.One thing I can count on with an O'Shaughnessy novel. This writing team of two sisters draws the reader in with vivid, true-to-life characters, and then reveals bits and pieces of their hidden selves--just to add to the mysterious ambience going on in the stories.It took me a short time to really get into this story. I was a bit puzzled by the behavior of Ray and Leigh, the first characters introduced. But the more I dug in, the more I could connect with them. And when the final secrets were revealed, I was surprised. Like a treasure unwrapped slowly, these authors unfold the layers of drama until finally, we see the complete picture.I lovedKeeper of the Keysalmost as much as the Nina Reilly tales. I didn't connect with the story quite as quickly, however...which is why I'm giving this one four stars."},{"Title":"Keeper of the Keys","review":"for diffeerent strokes.

Sorry, but I would not recommend."},{"Title":"Keeper of the Keys","review":"OK, I'm truly shocked by the negative reviews. Having read everything the O'Shaughnessy Sisters have written, I found \\"Keeper of the Keys\\" a terrific departure from the Nina Reilly series--spooky, fast-paced, mysterious and dark. Is it the greatest mystery ever written? I guess not, but it had me wondering through most of the book, and quickly turning pages to find out what happens next.A lot of the book was reminiscent of J.D. Robb's (aka Nora Roberts') style in the \\"In Death\\" series--no-nonsense, jumps right in to the story, very fast-paced, not a lot of frill. And I love that.The story begins with a fight between a quite spooky but brilliant architect, Ray, and his unfaithful wife, Leigh--who disappears right after the fight. Did Ray kill her? It's a strong possiblity, as he seems unhinged as it is. Did his equally unhinged mother have a part in the probable murder? And what of Leigh's old friend Kat, who suddenly reappears and wants to help Ray find Leigh even when she believes he probably murdered her?I found this a terrific summer read...I see I'm in the minority, but that's my story and I'm sticking to it!"},{"Title":"Keeper of the Keys","review":"I initially picked up this book mainly for the setting, as I've always been intrigued by Los Angeles.

For an equally thrilling mystery set on the east coast, head down to Miami in Don Bruns' SOUTH BEACH SHAKEDOWN. When a music legend goes missing, an amateur sleuth follows a twisting, turning trail of blackmail and murder, exposing the seedy side of glamorous South Beach.

The text has been summed up well in other reviews. A word about the author seems appropriate. It is worth pointing out that W.Y. Evans-Wentz was an American (one reviewer stated that W.Y. E-W was English).The confusion here stems from the fact that W.Y. E-W went to Oxford, England, as a Rhodes scholar. He was a very articulate and erudite man - well versed in the Western classics, Western mystery tradition etc. - and in his footnotes, he made frequent cross references to such.A few people now fault E-W' work - because of the universal sweep of his intuitions.It has even been suggested that he corrupted the purity of the Tibetan teachings - by his inter-cultural or trans-cultural horizons.Some Tibetan Lamas (i.e. Trungpa) have faulted E-W's work on such grounds.Western afficionadoes of Tibetan Buddhism - people who like to imagine themselves among the elect(Professors and pop followers alike) have chimed in.Such people forget (or prefer to ignore) the fact that W.Y.Evans-Wentz spent many years studying and working with Tibetan Lamas. Be assured, W.Y. Evans-Wentz' projects had the blessing of his Tibetan co-worker - Lama Kazi Dawa Sammdup. There are those who would argue that this blessing did not extend to the commentary material - subsequently added by E-W, after his work with the Lama. But how E-W presented the material to a Western audience - was his business.Death is most certainly a universal experience - and E-W placed it in a truly universal context. Is that so surprising?The Jungian commentary appended to the first ed. of this text has also come in for criticism (some editions now delete it). But Jung had something - when suggesting that we ought to read the TBD 'BACKWARDS' - to understand the difficulties modern minds get into - when trying to approach such territory. Still, as E-W points out, late medieval Western culture had a similar perspective on death. It was part of life, we similarly understood the need to 'live our dying' - and the need to 'die-in-life' to find the greater spiritual life. There are chapels in Europe, constructed entirely of human bones. It looks morbid to modern people - but, in fact, it signified a triumph over death. Death is the greatest adventure. Whatever we may be doing, death is the ultimate destination that awaits us. Many European cathedrals have a 'memento mori' - an image of death, saying: \\"I was as you are;as I am, so shall ye be. \\" Will you be able to pay the ferryman - when the boat comes?"},{"Title":"The Tibetan Book of the Dead or The After-Death Experiences on the Bardo plane, According to Lama Kazi Dawa-Samdup's English Rendering","review":"You've got to be ready to concentrate and wade deep to enjoy the introductions and translation, but the effort will reap great rewards. Using exacting and poetic prose with a disciple and intellectual honesty that is probable too good and un-dumbed-down to get published these days, this remains the best translation for those willing to work."},{"Title":"The Tibetan Book of the Dead or The After-Death Experiences on the Bardo plane, According to Lama Kazi Dawa-Samdup's English Rendering","review":"This is the original \\"Tibetan Book of the Dead\\". All other versions are a toned-down version of this work by different authors who want to accommodate people who do not want to put the work in. You need to put the work in. No one can spoon-feed this kind of wisdom to you.The Tibetan Book of the Dead is an extremely authoritative translation of the original texts of the \\"Bardo Thodol\\" by Lama Kazi Dawa-Samdup who schooled W.Y.Evans-Wentz in Tibetan Buddhism. The book is an extremely important piece of work for both the scholars of psychology and religion, and the lay person who has the time to spend working on it. The book is also the reality behind the \\"Necronomicon\\" which has been popularized by fiction writers, such a H.P.Lovecraft, but has been completely taken out of its true context.To begin with, this book is a beautiful book once you truly understand the message that it is trying to convey to the reader - or more correctly, when the reader correctly understands the message that is being conveyed. It has a primordial air to it and is certainly ancient in its wisdom and understanding. The book was translated in the early 1900s and was first published in 1927. Be warned - this book is exceptionally difficult to read because the standard of grammar used is of the highest acumen humanly possibly. Evans-Wentz was a Doctor of Literature, a Doctor of Science and a Master of Arts. If you don't have a full size Oxford dictionary, then you will have trouble reading it. There is also a difficulty in the translation. There are many Tibetan words that do not exist in English so Evans-Wentz sometimes derives a more descriptive meaning behind the message that is trying to be communicated to the reader. Dr. C.G. Jung has written an introduction at the start of the book which is mostly concerned about explaining the Tibetan meaning of the words \\"Soul\\" and \\"Mind\\". It is for reasons like these that the book requires multiple readings to fully absorb the information that is being presented. So what exactly is The Tibetan Book of the Dead? It is a corpus with several teachings. Tibetan Buddhist monks believe that if you understand the meaning of death then you will understand the meaning the life. It expounds in detail on the illusions of the human mind and gives a context for working out many questions that are philosophical and spiritual in nature.The book is essentially split into three parts. The first part has introductions from various students of theology, psychology and Buddhism. Evans-Wentz then explains the nature of the book and gives a rough breakdown of what we will find in the \\"Bardo Thodol\\" and how it is used to help the dead find their way to Nirvana during the after-death ceremonies (like an Irish wake) but also how the book can be used as a guide for the living, which is its true intended purpose. The middle part of the book is the \\"Bardo Thodol\\" translated directly into English and third part covers the topic of Buddhism in general with references to the different schools of thought and Christianity.The middle part of the book, the actual \\"Bardo Thodol\\", is split into three parts. There is an introduction at the start which explains the entry into the \\"Chikhai Bardo\\", the first of the Bardo regions that one automatically enters at the point of death. Then there is the second phase of the \\"Bardo Thodol\\", the \\"Chonyid Bardo\\" before the final phase of the \\"Bardo Thodol\\" the \\"Sidpa Bardo\\". Essentially these three areas can be explained as - the moment of death and the dawning of the light or nirvana, the karmic illusions of worldly things and finally the rebirth process. However do not think that this means that everybody is reborn or that Tibetans/Buddhists take reincarnation literally. It is all part of a thinking puzzle. You have got to work out things for yourself. There are hidden meanings in there. You must compare the different concepts in this book to find out what it really means! Question the \\"Bardo Thodol\\". Question what it teaches! Question what it says about itself!The Bardo Thodol is a technical and thoroughly scientific examination of consciousness that is still highly regarded as one of the most logical and controlled methods of understanding the mind and its relation to the world of phenomena. At first glance the book may seem horrid, uncanny and evoke a fear by the mere mention of the word \\"death\\", but this is a book about the living, dedicated to life and expounds on some of the most important questions that man can ask himself. It is extremely satisfying and worthy of repetitive readings. There is a pile of footnotes to help guide you through each page.Enormously recommended! ! ! !(As a side note Evans-Wentz wrote several other books to follow up on this one. They should be read in the following order - (1)The Tibetan Book of the Dead, (2) Tibet's Great Yogi Milarepa, (3)Tibetan Yoga and Secret Doctrines and (4)The Tibetan Book of the Great Liberation.)"},{"Title":"The Tibetan Book of the Dead or The After-Death Experiences on the Bardo plane, According to Lama Kazi Dawa-Samdup's English Rendering","review":"Tamuning, Guam February 5, 2000&quot;The Tibetan Book of The Dead&quot;; translated by Lama Kazi Dawa-Samdup, edited by W.Y.

Translated by LAMA KAZI DAWA-SAMDUP. Edited by Dr. W.Y Evans-Wentz, formerly of Jesus College, Oxford who spent the rest of his life dedicating himself to following the teachings of this very translation. This writer is the one who first produced the teachings of 'The Tibetan Book of the Dead' to occident man in the west. It still remains the definitive edition to this day. The book also has many footnotes and an important lengthy introduction by C.G. Jung to introduce the occident mind to the nature of the book. The footnotes are the helping hand in reading and understanding the text.This is a book about the raw mind. It may take you many lifetimes to understand. You may understand it after the first reading. There are no devices, tools, sects, schools or Gods used to get you there. This is a book about your mind. The mind is the only device you should need along with the book to bring you to the understanding of - knowing the nature of reality. Then when you are done with the book pass it on and use the only tool that this book expounds on. The mind.I have not even attempted to read anything else since I found this book. That is because it is definitive. The book only needs your mind. Nothing else. That is why this book is THE definitive book of the mind. Christians should not be afraid of this book in any way shape or form. It is good natured, good willing and does nothing more than help expand your goodness.It is through the book of the dead that you will learn the book of life.As the recently deceased Bhagavan Sri Ramana Maharshi, of Tiruvannamalai, South India, admonished Evans-Wentz when he sojourned in his ashram he said - \\"Each of you should ask yourself, 'who, or what, am I?' Why am I here incarnate? Whither I am destined? Why is there birth and why is there death?'\\"This book has never been equaled by any other book.

This is the work of an English academic in the early 20th Century, as he uncovers an &quot;Oriental&quot; classic for a Western audience. Evans-Wentz even brings Carl Jung into the picture for the Westerners, as Jung's psychology was &quot;New School&quot; at the time and offered a sublime link between Oriental and Occidental thinking. I hold this book in the highest regard, not because it is a mystical Buddhist text, but rather because it offers tips for daily living and and self-actualization. As with most quality philosophical doctrines, this book is a paradox...a book of the dead that is really an abstract book for the living, regardless of religion or nationality.

That said, I still found the book quite readable &amp; thought provoking. However, I would encourage all readers of this book to pursue at least a basic understanding of the philosophy / religion of Buddhism before taking on this puppy.Although much of what the western reader will find in these pages is antithical to western thought, I still found more than a few parallels. Many passages will bring to mind Plato's allegory of the cave, the &quot;Phaedrus,&quot; the philosophy of Hericlitus, the inscription of the Oracle of Delphi and various cantos from Dante's &quot;Inferno.&quot; That said, however, I believe the best approach is to attempt to engage the text on its own terms, at least at first. After one has held communion with this eloquent work on its own merit would be the more appropriate time to indulge in what Hegel would call &quot;synthesis&quot; between the two cultural paradigms.Perhaps what is most shocking in this book is just how much the Buddhist idea of the afterlife resembles solipsism. I have difficulty with the idea that everything I experience in the afterlife is a but a hallucination of my own invention. Perhaps I am the only one who finds that bizarre - I don't know. But it is nevertheless....unsettling.It must also be admitted that Buddhism is a rather dark &amp; pessimistic (if not morbid) philosophy / religion. The idea that it is better to escape the womb at birth with the efficacy of reaching Nirvana is.....somewhat alien to me.

Stripped of culturally conditioned paraphernalia ( various Bodhisattvas, elaborate Mahayanist mythologies etc ), what remains is probably the most descriptive essay on the &quot;great beyond&quot; ( apart from Plato's &quot;Phaedo&quot;, which I find even more aesthetically and cognitively persuasive, but greatly differing in spirit ).Among the greatest merits of the book are, IMO, a clear exposition of the Trikaya doctrine, ie. Mahayanist ontology; subtle psycho-spiritual analysis ( mainly in footnotes ) of 'Knower' ( principle of consciousness, caitanya or shes-pa - permanent reincarnating &quot;I&quot;: an entity in perfect concordance with Tantricism but not very plausible in Buddhist Theravada orthodoxy ) and visionary cartography of the three ( &quot;Divine&quot;( Chikai ), noetic/causal ( Chonyid ), and psychic/imaginal ( Sidpa )) supraphysical Bardo states/worlds.Probably the biggest failure is Jung's introduction, something that makes a man suspicious whether Jung had read &quot;Bardo Thodhol&quot; at all. Avalon's foreword is not bad, but also not very illuminating.

Several different editions and translations exist, but the 1960 edition remains the \\"classical\\" one. Translated by Walter Evans-Wentz, it also contains introductory comments written by Carl Gustav Jung, Lama Govinda, John Woodruffe and Evans-Wentz himself. The editor has also appended extensive footnotes to the main text.\\"The Tibetan Book of the Dead\\" is a translation of a Tibetan mortuary text, known in original as \\"Bar do thos grol\\". Or rather, it's a translation of a portion of a text from a genre known as \\"Bar do thos grol\\". The English title is the translator's. In original, the text is used by the Nyingma sect of Tibetan Buddhism.Those who read this book should also obtain a copy of \\"Prisoners of Shangri-La\\" by Donald Lopez, which contains the true story surrounding this mysterious book. It turns out that Evans-Wentz was a member of a New Religious Movement, the Theosophical Society. For this reason, his interpretations of the Tibetan text should be taken with a very large grain of salt. Thus, Evans-Wentz claims (on the authority of a real lama, no less) that Tibetan Buddhism has a secret message similar to that of Theosophy. Of course, there is no evidence whatsoever for such a claim. Another \\"lama\\" associated with this book, Anagarika Govinda, was actually a German national who couldn't even read Buddhist texts in their original language and claimed to have been initiated into the Kagyu sect. Lopez points out that the initiation ritual described by Hoffman (Govinda's real name) doesn't exist. In other words, \\"Lama\\" Govinda was something of a fraud. I readily admit that he seems to have been quite a character!This is all extremely interesting, even entertaining. But what about the actual Tibetan text? \\"The Tibetan Book of the Dead\\" describes the fate of the soul after death. Or something to that effect - officially, Buddhists don't believe in an actual \\"soul\\". After leaving the dying body, the soul passes through a number of intermediary states known as bardos. In each state, liberation from the cycle of rebirth can be achieved. If for some reason the soul doesn't accomplish this, it is reborn as a god, demigod, human, animal, hungry ghost or denizen of hell.The book describes the various bardos in chilling detail. At various points, the soul comes face to face with wrathful deities or is chased by demons. Small wonder Jung regarded the book as a description of a deliberately induced psychosis. (A later American commentary on the book, co-written by Timothy Leary and Richard Alpert, compares it to a psychedelic experience.) There are also certain similarities to a near-death experience. Depending on your psychological state of mind, \\"The Tibetan Book of the Dead\\" might strike you as boring, incomprehensible, absurd or downright scary! How I reacted the first time I read it, I won't disclose here.Regardless of what you think of this text, \\"The Tibetan Book of the Dead\\" plus all its forewords in the 1960 edition, are required reading for everyone interested in Tibet, Buddhism and above all comparative religion. What the book really tells us about the bardos is anybody's guess, but it does say a lot about how the Western mind wants to look at Tibet.

She uses an electric torch instead of a flashlight and puts chains on her tires when it rains because many of the roads are dirt roads. Was 1930 all that long ago!

In one long-waiting box that had been shipped from the US I found all of my old Nancy Drew books. At a certain age, I received double Nancy Drew book editions in the mail until the series was over. I just had to sit down one afternoon this summer to take a look at one of the books.My edition published the standard 1936 version of this Nancy entry. It was originally written by Mildred Wirt Benson. It's an interesting look at race and class from that period, if nothing else. Nancy comes across an Indian circus boy (Coya) being abused by a man who claims to be his father but who is somehow \\"clearly inferior\\" to the boy. But class will out in the end, and it turns out that both greater danger and a greater destiny awaits the young man. This is actually a pretty coherent Nancy Drew book. The plot makes sense and the characters are engaging. There's a nice mixture of international intrigue and basic human nature."},{"Title":"The Mystery of the Ivory Charm (Nancy Drew, Book 13) (With illustrated frontispiece)","review":"Im a HUGE Nancy fan and have all her books original & Revised...this book is amazing!

She gives great detail. Such as: \\"She wore a white turban, and the wind whipped her flowing robes about wildly.\\" Also in this story, I could relate to Nancy. Some things she did, the actions she made, I would of done too; for instance, telling the police about the mystery she was trying to solve.This book is about a young boy, named Rishi, who was the maharaja of India. He was kidnapped when an infant. The three people that kidnapped him wanted a different person to rule the land. Nancy's job was to find the culprits and arrest them. But it wasn't easy. Rishi's stepfather was after him, trying to kill him, because he knew too much. He kidnapped Rishi twice, almost killing him. Nancy doesn't know where to look for him. Also someone stole her charm with lifesaving fluids in it, which rishi would need to recover from his injuries. Will Nancy find her charm? Will Rishi ever be found?I think anyone can read this book. Particularly people who like mysteries. And anyone who likes adventure and suspense."},{"Title":"The Mystery of the Ivory Charm (Nancy Drew, Book 13) (With illustrated frontispiece)","review":"This review concerns the original 1936 edition and the revised 1974 edition which is slightly different from the original but basically tells the same story. Nancy meets a young Indian boy (named Coya in the original, Rishi in the revised) who lives with a circus. The boy is being mistreated by a man named Rai who claims to be the boy's father, but Nancy doubts this claim. Nancy saves Rai from an elephant and to show his thanks he gives Nancy an ivory, elephant charm which he says can protect the wearer from harm. Coya/Rishi runs away from the circus and Rai and the Drews take him in. Later, Rai changes his mind and wants the charm back and he will do anything to get both the charm and Coya/Rishi. Also figuring into this \\"mystery\\" are a strange woman and a bizarre house out in the middle of the woods. The house, apparently, has no floor, but it does have a secret passage and a bunch of swings and trapezes hanging from the ceiling. This book was just plain awful!! The mystery, what there is of one, is stupid and boring. The house serves absolutely no purpose other than to use up pages and it makes no sense. Who would build a house like that out in the middle of nowhere? The strange woman in the book is more annoying than anything and comes off as too scatterbrained and weak-minded to be the great criminal mastermind that the plot requires her to be. The book has little in the way of action or suspence. This book is just bad, bad, bad! Take my advice and don't read it."},{"Title":"When God Speaks: How to Interpret Dreams, Visions, Signs and Wonders","review":"Collaboratively written by Chuck D. Pierce (President of Glory of Zion International Ministries and vice president of Global Harvest Ministries) and his co-author Rebecca Wagner Sytsema, When God Speaks: How To Interpret Dreams, Visions, Signs And Wonders reveals to Christian readers how it is possible that God has been speaking to them, but they failed to perceive that divine communication for what it was. God's manifold channels of communication can, and often do, include an impression upon the spirit or through a passage of scripture, or in a prophetic dream. Very strongly recommended and thoughtful reading, When God Speaks explains and illustrates how to receive God's word, how to interpret dreams and visions, and in acting on what has been discerned, ultimately fulfill Gods requirements of us."},{"Title":"When God Speaks: How to Interpret Dreams, Visions, Signs and Wonders","review":"Get ready to hear from God.

However, When God Speaks makes a valiant effort towards \\"demystifying\\" this subject.For critical thinkers, the authors' attempt to establish a broad and far-reaching definition of prophecy will give you plenty to mull over as you compare it to those things which are directly spelled out in Scripture.

So I read with interest this recent offering, written by Kim Dae Jung, who was President of South Korea till February 2003.He writes from the viewpoint of a historian and an economist, and above all, as a human rights activist. He describes, with the manifest pride of any Korean, the stunning rise of South Korea from ruins and famine in the 1950s to the world's 8th largest economy.But the book is not a dry recitation of statistics. He devotes much space to analysing the society. Most notably, he points out that Korean capitalism grew up under and was nourished by the military dictatorships. In fact, it uneasily closely parallels the economic systems of Germany and Japan before World War 2, and those of many Latin American dictatorships after the war. He calls it an unholy alliance of &quot;monopoly dictatorship&quot; capitalism, where the state actively promotes favoured companies. In South Korea, as in other places, this was done by getting banks to lead cheap capital, and by the government stifling independent trade unions.Kim describes how he wished to break this by truly promoting fair competition between firms and to give consumers greater choice of products. He warns that otherwise, the continued military-industrial ties may lead South Korea to disaster, as had happened in Germany and Japan.Though he is no longer President, so long as he remains an important influence in Korea, this book is indispensible for understanding his views."},{"Title":"The One Hour Orgasm: How to Have More Fun by Intensifying & Lengthening the Orgasmic State for Yourself and Your Partner","review":"Despite its sensational title, this is a book about clear communications.

It does a very fine job explaining each god, hero, infantry, archer and all of the combinations there of within thereown cultures. That is what makes this game so compelling. The getting along and adjustments that your civ will have to make to your opponents civ to win. However, you have to read the book. I have read it several times and I pick up something new everytime. Certain soldiers play much better against certain others. The wrong match and it is a slaughter. The book gives several examples of how to start each civ at the start of a game and if the instructions are followed fairly closely you will get off to a very good/fast start. I know I did and I feel confident that I have gained a lot from the book to advance my play. I wish there were more books to read on this subject. More strategies to follow. Suffice it to say that there is so much to explore in terms of the variances of the game and the cultures. I believe Ensemble has integrated the nuances of the various cultures into the manner that they fight and they create their individual culture mannerism in the way they act as well. Any piece of writing will help, but since this is the first, by all means read it. The subtlety's of the cultures and the multitude of the god combinations are incredible. Can you imagine through the use of just one of the strategies I followed I whipped out a civ. with just the \\"walking tree power\\".

At that moment I knew I had to make a special trip back to D.C.. The platinum prints were breathtaking. I stood in front of each print for minutes; transported to another world. I felt as I could converse with the subjects; as if their essence had been revealed to me. The book is almost as good as visiting the exhibition. The only difference is the size of the prints. The same text and explanations used in the exhibit are used in the book. The quality of the paper and the color of the prints is exceptional, and accurate. This book is simply a must have!"},{"Title":"Irving Penn: Platinum Prints","review":"Irving Penn's Platinum Prints is amazing book. As you go through the it, every turn of a page is a new experience. Each print tells a story of a person's life or a type of culture. Penn is a master in capturing the right moment at the right time. There are so many types of photos in this one book and you get a variety of views on photographyAnother great feature to this book is the quality of the prints. The whole photographic process of Platinum Prints is done with the camera. There is no post camera editing. The photos also have a bronze look to them, which is only found in Platinum Prints. Overall this book is amazing; Penn is a genius with the camera. This book will change your view of photography and the way you look at the world. You will walk around looking for things to shoot, hoping to capture a photograph as good as Penns."},{"Title":"Irving Penn: Platinum Prints","review":".....photographs I have ever seen, in person, and the reproductions in this book come close to replicating the experience. The value of this book for admirers of Irving Penn is the opportunity to see a good selection of solely Platinum/Palladium prints in one well printed book, and to read about the blood, sweat, tears and joy that went into bringing these gorgeous images into the world. Any number of these images are in the pantheon of greatest 20th century photographs, and if \\"Ballet Society, 1948\\" isn't one of the most exquisite objects in the possession of 15 lucky owners, then I'll give one of them a good home!(Offers, anyone?). Another worthy monograph devoted to the art of a great photographer."},{"Title":"Irving Penn: Platinum Prints","review":"Right after Penn died, I knew I wanted to have something to commemorate him.

Unbelievably beautiful, with unmatched richness and depth compared to all the lackluster images that we are bombarded with on a daily basis, it makes me even more sad that someone of his genius and eye has passed.

Oh to have been photographed by him.. that would have been such an honor."},{"Title":"Irving Penn: Platinum Prints","review":"This book is a collection of some of Irvings most prolific work. What stands out about this particular book is the beautifully printed representations of Irvings master prints.Look at this book and you will see the roots to much that has affected the better photographers from the past 20+ years. Irving is the maestro when it comes to work without gimmick or pretense, his eye is always unfailingly in tune with what he was set to photograph and how he wished to represent it. This is classical photography like there is classical oil painting.

Each picture conveys a story while establishing a sense of truth and reality. The \\"platinum\\" technique is rich and bold with a bronze like color, that actually brings life to the photographs. This book allows for any person to step inside the artistic vision of Irving Penn, and take a closer look into the world behind the lense.

I am simply an average adoptee who searched for and found my birth family. Many of my questions were finally answered, but many more were created. I became intensely curious about what part of me was from my genetic make-up, and what part I learned from my adoptive parents. This book has been extremely helpful in answering those questions and making sense out of the many coincidences I am discovering. There are others who have done studies and have their own opinions on the genetic connection, but unless you are an adoptee or a birth parent, you can never fully understand the impact or significance of this connection. Stiffler is a birth mother who has provided facts gleaned from both others' studies, and more importantly, her own personal life situation. Because of this, I highly recommend this book to all adoptees and birth parents."},{"Title":"Synchronicity and Reunion: The Genetic Connection of Adoptees and Birthparents","review":"The incredible coincidences in the case studies presented in this book are handled with great objectivity by Stiffler. I have just reunited with my birthmother and sent her a copy of the book as well. After reading the book, which I gladly stayed up half the night to finish, I was able to write over one page of synchronicities in the adoption triad of which I'm a vertex. While Stiffler's dissertation, as she readily admits in the book's introduction, was hastily placed in book form and needs further assistance with writing and editing (she asks readers for assistance with suggestions for the next edition), I found the book fascinating. I'm thankful that Stiffler has tackled such intriguing subject matter and I look forward to further research into synchronicity and the adoption triangle."},{"Title":"Synchronicity and Reunion: The Genetic Connection of Adoptees and Birthparents","review":"I am a birthfather, in reunion for 14 years now.

The psychological research is also helpful."},{"Title":"Synchronicity and Reunion: The Genetic Connection of Adoptees and Birthparents","review":"This is one of the most awesome books I have ever read.Its all completely true.

For all others who are open to natural human bonds? A High Five to LaVonne Stiffler."},{"Title":"Synchronicity and Reunion: The Genetic Connection of Adoptees and Birthparents","review":"I was sorely disappointed with this book. The premise is really interesting and in fact, the case studies are worth reading. However, Stiffler has basically quoted the works of others without giving any real insights to these studies. This book is not really meant for the average lay person, it uses very specific language of psychology which I imagine most people have not trained in. Being an academic myself, I do not have issue with this, but as an adoptee trying to find a concise analysis of coincidences in reunion, this book was sincerely disappointing. I do hope that Stiffler will reassemble the book for future readers."},{"Title":"Synchronicity and Reunion: The Genetic Connection of Adoptees and Birthparents","review":"LaVonne Harper Stiffler has written one of the best books on synchronicity that I have ever seen. Synchronicities are coincidences that are often so improbable as to make them deeply meaningful to the participants in these highly unlikely interlinkings of experiences.This book details numerous amazing reports - from people who were adopted early in life and from their birth parents - relating how they were helped through highly unusual synchronicities to locate each other.Stiffler's narration is supplemented by the most extensive referencesI have ever seen on synchronicity. In addition to the literature on synchronicities, she brings many relevant facts, insights and references to help explore in greater depth the meaningfulness of the birth bond and its influence on the lives of all of the family members who are related through that bond. As an example:... adoptive parents have often lost the ability to have a biological child of their own; adoptees have lost identity and genealogy; and birth parents have lost not only an infant, but a preschooler, a teenager, an adult, and their grandchildren. It may not be until reunion that one is able to fully comprehend the deeper meaning of loss of self, finally recovering a new individuation and true self... and a wholeheartedness without pretense... (p. 17)There are somewhere between five and eight million adoptees in the US. In 1984, a survey revealed that about half a million of these people were looking for or had located their birth families. This search is made extremely difficult by laws that lock all adoption records in all but three of the fifty states. The search from either side of the birth bond requires extreme persistence. In many of the instances documented, there were intuitive or psychic awarenesses that facilitated the ultimate reconnections. In addition, there were numerous instances of apparent chance meetings with people or other unlikely events that facilitated the reunions.A female adoptee was... surprised to learn that both she and her mother were living less than a two-hour drive apart, having moved to Arizona from Hawaii and New England before finding each other. \\"Why were we both in Arizona? Neither of us especially enjoyed the climate. We both feel that in the span of Hawaii to New England, Arizona must be a mid-point. Very strange!\\" (p. 9).Various chapters focus on a variety of synchronistic links, such as names that were common to the birth family and the adopting family (where the two families had no contact whatsoever); genetic links of twins that seemed to produce even more highly unusual synchronicities; and links of timing in participants' lives.Stiffler points out that unusual synchronistic experiences often lead the participants to open into spiritual awarenesses. She gives numerous and varied examples of the wonderment of traveling life's pathways and meeting people who teach us deep lessons through these synchronistic encounters.Stiffler's discussion of possible higher levels of causalities is innovative and erudite, demonstrating a broad knowledge of philosophy and science surrounding this subject. For instance,Teleology, an aspect of metaphysics, is the doctrine or study of ends or final causes, especially as related to the evidences of design or purpose in nature. As part of the philosophy of vitalism (as opposed to mechanism), natural phenomena are thought to be determined not only by mechanical causes but by an overall purpose, directed toward a definite end. Synchronicity was described by Combs and Holland (1990) as a riddle to be lightheartedly enjoyed as the playful purpose of a trickster, rather than the rational Logos of classical Greece and Rome, but they concluded:The inescapable insinuation of synchronicity, however, is that the cosmos is undergirded by teleology. Synchronicity reminds us of this order and beckons us to enter into it. Purpose in the form of synchronistic coincidences finds us even in the banalities of our daily routines...its purpose cannot in the end be grasped with the rational mind. It must be lived with one's whole being. (Combs and Holland, p. 144; Stiffler, p. 79)Psychic and intuitive experiences are noted, but their full significance is not delved to any depth. This is my only criticism of Stiffler's book: a serious understatement and lack of in-depth discussion of psychic experiences and their meaning - in the context of the vast literature on psychic, healing and spiritual research (Benor, 2001; 2006).Reference:Combs, A., & Holland, M.

I could not wait to receive it. When it arrived, I opened the package and immediately started to read it, or should I say TRY to read it. The book does not flow easily, it was a real challenge NOT to put it down. Aside from the &quot;true stories of synchronicity&quot; in the book, all there is to read is a jumble of information mostly from other sources and not the author. It was not put together in a manner that is either interesting or easy to read. I am truly sorry that I wasted my money on this book, since I am not even going to finish reading it."},{"Title":"Synchronicity and Reunion: The Genetic Connection of Adoptees and Birthparents","review":"I was very disappointed with this book.

However I don't think the book would stand on its own merits without the photos. Though the photos are sort of unrelated to the storyline, they do provide readers who are perhaps inexperience with the pimp lifestyle real world visuals. The book is only about 174 or so pages, subtract pages with photos on them and you have a short essay, not really a novel. Without the photos the book would be half its size and about 50 pages of story. I don't recommend buying it at full price if you are just a causal reader (like myself), but if you want something cool to have on your coffee table to keep your girl (or whoever) busy then purchasing it might seem more desirable.This book together with the photography could had been more. Other authors like Robert Beck (Ice Berg Slim) and Donald Goines paved the way for so-called pimp books to be written seriously and Pimpnosis misses the mark.Two stars for the photography, one star for the story."},{"Title":"Pimpnosis","review":"very enlightening and in depth and take you into a journey you probably will never understand great read and full of that old skool game that is now lost unfortunately"},{"Title":"Pimpnosis","review":"this book makes no apologys for what it represents&that is a breath of fresh air.

It packs a lot of info on a multitude of subjects which don't usually come together in a single book. The mathematical preliminaries and the sections on dynamics and control of flexible structures are particularly well done. (This is perhaps the first time a textbook covers the interlacing property of poles &amp; zeros of certain transfer functions, particularly those associated with flexible structures.) In addition, the inclusion of the &quot;H-infinity&quot; topic the way the author did it is very good since, in general, books do not feature the subject in such a concise, objective, useful way. The same is true of the section on halo orbits, as well. Best of all, Wie's having included Kharitonov's theorem comes as a blessing, since the issue is rarely seen in non-European texts.Unfortunately, in its present form (first edition), the book is not without its flaws. The alphabetical index should indicate explicitly where one can find subjects like the aforementioned interlacing property, as well as bang-bang-type controls. Also, a couple of topics have been omitted altogether: yo-yo devices (possibly deemed too simple) and the more advanced issues pertaining to the extremely important time-varying nonlinear systems (e.g.: time-varying eigenvalues). This is arguably OK, as this last subject, requiring a lot of preliminary material on operator theory, might be considered too advanced for a non-systems book, especially one in the Education Series.In closing, one must acknowledge Bong Wie for bringing this more-than-welcome addition to the controls literature."},{"Title":"Space Vehicle Dynamics and Control (Aiaa Education Series)","review":"This is a rather complete presentation of the knowledge of controls and dynamics needed to design, specify, and analyze spacecraft control sytems. No navigation or guidance is covered. Of course no reference to same is made in the title. The book is primarily a composition of basic control background including modern topics like H-infinity. The H-infinity control discussion is the most understandable out there and its limitations are spelled out clearly, perhaps for the first time. The structural dynamics and controls sections are outstanding with some novelty. Interleaving is not unique to this book, however. Bryson covers it in Control of Spacecraft and Aircraft. Quite frankly, at this point in time most of the spacecraft controller design methodologies are handbook in nature and what is most needed is a good background in the basics that extends into the actual design domain enough to be useful. Bong Wie has provided that in this book for controller design to a greater extend than any other written thus far."},{"Title":"Space Vehicle Dynamics and Control (Aiaa Education Series)","review":"This book can be used as a reference if you are already know most of the material.

The book also lack real examples and problems are a bunch of derivations that can be easily found in other text. I have good background in aerospace dynamics and have worked in aircraft area.

Tichelaar for Reader Views (3/07)\\"Cracked Crystals,\\" by Larry Rochelle, is the third in a series of eight mystery novels with Palmer Morel as the main character; however, the book can be read without having read the previous two novels. Oddly, nowhere on the book does it mention it is part of a series--I only learned that from the publisher's website. Several references are made early in the book to events in Palmer's past which are never fully explained, and which the author must assume the reader already knows from the earlier books; it is sufficient for the reader to know Palmer is divorced and he is trying to escape his past.The story begins with Palmer Morel moving to Kansas City because his old friend, Ronnie, tells him about a job teaching tennis at a local club. Palmer is an old tennis pro and jumps at the chance for the job. He immediately flies to Kansas City; then gets hired at the club by Myra. Just as quickly, he realizes Ronnie is a drug user, and not wanting to be involved in the drug scene, he instead takes Myra up on her invitation to stay with her and share her bed. Palmer's inability to resist his sexual impulses has only just begun to get him in trouble.The next day, Palmer learns his friend, Ronnie, has been murdered. He gives a statement to the police, hoping he will be able to help them solve the murder. Only then does Palmer learn Ronnie and Myra's pasts were intertwined, and since Palmer is now sleeping with Myra, his own life becomes mixed up in the murder mystery. As he learns about many more things Myra has been keeping from him, he finds his own life threatened by a religious cult mixed up with astrology, numerology, crystal meth, and prostitution. And he finds himself caught in several sexually compromising situations.The reader may find Palmer's sexual behavior a bit much--Palmer admits himself that his sexual appetite tends to get him in a lot of trouble. When Myra ends up in the hospital, her own life a target for murder, Palmer barely thinks twice about sleeping with another woman, which only puts his life in more danger. Later, Palmer finds he must escape from his enemies, which results in his running naked through a hospital looking for a hiding place. He makes his escape, but not without having to give out a few favors first. This sexual escapade is over the top and the reader will probably find it laughable. The plot twists require some willing suspension of disbelief, but this scene in particular was difficult to swallow.The book is fun to read and filled with plot twists the reader won't see coming, even though the reader will probably figure out before Palmer, that something isn't quite right when Myra is sexually knowledgeable, yet friends with a priest who knows some surprisingly colorful language. I have to admit I am curious what kind of sexual situations Palmer will get mixed up in while solving mysteries in future books. Summaries of the other novels in the series can be found at the publisher's website. I recommend \\"Cracked Crystals\\" to anyone not easily offended by sexual content who likes a light yet fast-paced mystery.Received book free of charge."},{"Title":"Behold your God","review":"I would wish that someone would see about picking up the rights to put this book into print once again. No other message is so needed to a dying world then to know God the Father and His son Jesus Christ in a clear and truthful way.Our misaligned views of God place him as the one who brings about destruction at his whim (thus the term -act of God) whenever there is an earthquake or some other natural disaster. People have a view of God as distant, unconcerned with the lives of men, as well as being vengeful whenever the whim strikes Him. Our view of God is likened to our views of our fellow men and what they do.This book brings you a refreshing look at who God the Father is by seeing His Son Jesus Christ. Jesus came to show us the Father, He and the Father are one, thus who Jesus is and the way Jesus deals with men then and now is also how the Father is.If you are someone who has this book, dust if off and reread it, pass it on to family and friends or put it up for sale so others can read it."},{"Title":"Behold your God","review":"This is the best book I've read on the character of God. Exellent! Recommend it to anyone seeking to understand the character of God and the seemingly contradictions of the God of the Old Testament vs. the God of the New Testament.

Although it didn't come in hardback as advertised, it still was well worth the dollars spent for it."},{"Title":"Oscar Wilde","review":"Richard Ellman's fascinating biography follows Wilde from his beginnings as a brilliant student to his tragic end, when he haunted European locales that had delighted him in better times like a living ghost. The early part of the book is the least interesting. Wilde was one of the first useless celebrities-figures who gain notoriety simply because something odd or appealing about them keeps them in the public eye apart from any actual talent (although Wilde was, by all accounts, an excellent speaker). Ellman's analysis of Wilde's aestheticism is, I suppose, essential to a complete understanding of the man, but since the matters that Wilde devoted so much of his energy to were so frivolous and trivial, it doesn't make for a very good read. Later, though, Wilde demonstrates his talent with the publication of \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" and his successful plays, and the biography picks up as well. Wilde becomes a truly tragic figure by the end, ruined by his love for Lord Alfred Douglas, hounded by Douglas's father the Marquis of Queensberry, imprisoned, and finally betrayed and forgotten by most of his former friends. For all his wit and insight, Wilde emerges as a curiously nave character and basically a good man, kind and trusting to a fault."},{"Title":"Oscar Wilde","review":"an eloquent and exhaustive work that is a pleasure to read.

However, when I opened the book, after passing a few blank sheets I found the final page of the book upside down! This cannot be the standard for Green Lion, although it is very amusing. I almost think, I may not make a written complaint because there must only be a batch or so of this edition crafted in this obviously novice manner (and so I feel special).

Despite being reasonably compact, there is ample space on every page for notes, and the diagrams are large and clear. It's really good.To the second;THIS IS THE BEST BOOK EVER WRITTEN BY A HUMAN. I'm not kidding and I'm not exaggerating; there is no way to express the joy of reading Euclid without sounding like a lunatic. There are very few books which reach their umpteenth thousandth edition without promising a posthumous infinity of bliss. The bliss of 'The Elements' is admittedly finite, but it delivers right away. This is an electrifying piece of work which has produced a chorus of rapture and inspiration lasting two millennia. Poets have penned homage to its beauty. Philosophers and mathematicians have wept. Theologians saw God in its perfection. As war, pestilence and plague tortured humanity, as the empires of despots rose and crumbled, the devout risked death rather than surrender this book. Why?

The font size, text layout, figures adjacent to propositions, and wide margins make this book very convenient to follow the logic behind each proposition. I used to own the three volume edition put out by Dover but this one beats it by leaps and bounds.Of course Euclid's Elements, to my mind, ranks as one of the majesterial achievements of the human mind. I follow the format of one proposition a week till I complete the cycle. Then take a respite for a year or two and repeat the exercise.In 1963 during a train journey from Bangalore to Bombay (via.Poona), India, I was reading Dr. Radhakrishnan's Indian Philosophy. Upon noticing this an elderly gentleman admonished me to stop wasting time and go with something he called \\"the great Eee-u-clid's ideas\\". He then gave me one of the best lectures in Western Philosophy that I can remember. Euclid, he said, is far more than geometry. This was my introduction to Euclid other than High School geometry. This gentleman told me that he had written down each propositon and proof from volumes available at the goverment Public Library in Cubbon Park, Bangalore.

Rather than the sort of pseudo-book we have grown accustomed to - books on paper of mediocre quality in imitation cloth-covered boards; books with those wretched thermoplastic spines that either won't open flat or if opened will immediately crack; books designed to self-destruct after only minimal use - Green Lion Press has given us something very different.Their hardcover edition is cased in sturdy real cloth-covered boards.

As everyting has been said about The Elements, I would review this particular edition rather than The Elements itself.First of all, this is a one single volume (be aware of Dover's 10$ book, it is only one thrid of the whole). This is usefull, of course, but to me it adquires an extra relevance in this particular item. The Elements may be the best math book ever (including Newton's Principia), so I just didn't want a book, but a beautifull book. This is the only time I chose the hardcover edition, and I think I did right. The book is printed in high quality paper, and the typeface is also beautifull.As someone has already said, when you are reading through a proposition, and you turn the page, you find the diagram repeated, so that you don't have to be continually back and forth. In this book, where every propositions includes a diagram, this is not a minor advantage.The final pro is that it is not interspersed with Heath's notes. \\"Euclid Alone has looked on beauty bare\\", so you better take this edition rather than the Dover's one. The book can be followed from the first proposition til the very last one, so no coments should be interspersed. Any critical notes about the propositions should be either at the end of each of Euclid's books, or if they are very extense, as Heath's ones, in a separated volume. To understanding The Elements, this edition prefaces suffice (and I even think that some parts are unnecesary, sometimes becoming redundant).Green Lion Press has done a good job in providing us this beautifull one-volume edition."},{"Title":"Euclid's Elements (Everyman's library)","review":"This edition of Euclid's Elements is a very commonly used one at Thomas Aquinas College in California, a school where the Elements is a required course. Students begin study of the Elements in the freshman year and continue to explore its meaning in later Mathematics and Philosophy.This ancient work is a masterpiece of the human mind and a marvelous example of how a science may be built off of proper beginning principles. This edition presents an excellent translation of that work in a quality binding.One of the most important features of this edition of Euclid is the fact that the diagrams are reprinted on additional pages so that one may see them as he studies the texts of the various propositions. There is no need to constantly flip back and forth to look at diagrams (an important part of following the flow of the argument in the proposition for most students). Most other printings of the Elements (at least the ones that I have seen), lack this very helpful feature. The pages are also large enough to add some notes while working through the props.Quite simply, this is a nice edition of one of the greatest masterpieces of the human mind. No lover of Geometry, of Mathematics, or of truth in general, should be without this or some other faithful translation of this foundational text."},{"Title":"Euclid's Elements (Everyman's library)","review":"No doubt this is a precious edition, but the recent one by Richard Fitzpatrick in Greek and English is really astounding (and affordable), especially the version in 4 volumes, where a full page (and more than one if needed) is generously given to each proposition.OTH I find the classical Heath/Dover edition an essential reference, precisely for the illuminating Heath's interspersed commentary. In fact Heath's \\"A History of Greek Mathematics\\" and the shorter \\"A Manual of Greek Mathematics\\" are just as essential to a better understanding of Euclid, and of course Greek Mathematics.As a complementary/companion reading I would heartily recommend Benno Artmann's excellent \\"Euclid - The Creation of Mathematics\\", priceless, if only, for its bibliography.An indispensable and brilliant mathematical \\"guided reading\\" based on the development of Greek Mathematics, fundamental for an overall understanding of the Elements, is B. L. van der Waerden's \\"Science Awakening\\" (1954, out of print, but still possible to find).A philological approach, incredibly rich in its revelations about the Elements and early Greek Mathematics in general is Arpad Szabo's \\"The Beginnings of Greek Mathematics\\" (very expensive!, but worth every penny).An then there's David Fowler's \\"The Mathematics of Plato's Academy\\", an up-to-date comprehensive account on Greek Mathematics of the time, and Euclid of course.Just a final, more general comment. Through its many layers Euclid's Elements is a key to the better understanding of our deepest roots. I myself discovered it late in my life and cannot believe what I missed. I now understand that the fundamentals of Ancient Greece - and consequently ours - cannot be fully grasped without this book. It would be no exaggeration to affirm that Plato and Aristotle are not fully intelligible without Euclid and that, in general, without knowledge of the Elements Ancient Greece would be just a \\"shadow of the past\\", devoid of the sparkling light cast by its mathematics and science."},{"Title":"Euclid's Elements (Everyman's library)","review":"This is a nice edition of Thomas L. Heath's translation of Euclid's ELEMENTS. Those who rely on this edition alone will miss the considerable insights that they could get from looking at the Dover reprint of Heath's Euclid, available in three volumes.If you think you have no need for Heath's exposition, ask yourself what Postulate Four, \\"All right angles are equal,\\" means. Perhaps it says that all 90 degree angles are equal, but that would seem to be true by definition. The nub of this assertion is the invariance of figures, as Heath points out in his notes on Euclid and in his MANUAL OF GREEK MATHEMATICS. The invariance of figures is perhaps the deepest and most important idea underlying Euclidean (and nonEuclidean) geometry. It would be a pity for you to miss it.The Dover books are intimidating, but you are looking at a subject that has developed over thousands of years. This Green Lion edition is a step backward, not forward. There is no royal road to geometry. Wonderful as Euclid is, you will have to work to understand him.

In comparisons to these and several other classics I have found Euclids \\"Elements\\" and Newtons \\"Principia\\" the two most influential for the the last two milleniums. Why? Both for different reasons. But Euclids work is divine for its utter simplicity and development from the simple fundamentals carefully building and choosing the geometric topics to the more accomplished and advanced geometric Scholiums. With due dilligence and perserverance the three dimensionality of the world will become readily apparent to the student in its true grace. I cannot believe that I indulged myself in four semesters of calculus without reading the \\"Elements\\". I recommend reading this edition in conjunction with another unrelated work. Give yourself time to understand and slowly digest its presentation. Abraham Lincoln in \\"Team of Rivals\\" is quoted as having spent many days studying Euclids Elements and working out the numerous proofs.

Rather, it's a repackaging of Euclid so that all the books are in a single volume (unlike the Dover edition) and with some marked improvements in typesetting and binding. Unlike most repackaging efforts, which provide little to no value added to the work, the folks at Green Lion Press have made simple changes that provide great improvement.First, the front matter of the book is extremely helpful for first-time readers. There are detailed descriptions of the idioms used by Euclid in his proofs, especially some of the more esoteric terms such as \\"same ratio\\" (which Euclid uses but never really clarifies). The explanations draw upon classical and contemporary scholarship in Greek mathematics, and they elucidate the text greatly.Second, the binding is outstanding and sure to stand up to robust reading and annotating (which is what books are for, right?). The paper is not glued to the binding, so you can open it flat without tearing the pages from the spine. I found it a little hard to open the book flat due to the sheer size of it, especially in the first few pages. But that's why God made paperweights.Third, the figures in the text -- which are obviously crucial to any text on geometry -- are reproduced whenever they are referred to, to minimize having to flip back and forth to view the same diagram and thus saving wear and tear on the book. Again, this is not high-tech here, just a simple change that makes the book a lot more usable.I am reading through this book right now and it's like being a kid in a toy shop. I'm looking forward greatly to sharing the book with my geometry students next year. I think any person studying geometry or just interested in digesting some of the greatest intellectual works of all time, as this book is, would do well to reinvest and purchase this volume."},{"Title":"Euclid's Elements (Everyman's library)","review":"Euclid's Elements is a beautiful classic, and anyone with a serious interest in mathematics should look at it at some point.This is a nice edition: the paper and binding are high quality, and diagrams are repeated if necessary so that you never have to flip pages between a diagram and the argument that is referring to it.There is no commentary except for a brief introduction (some of which consists of quotes from older commentaries). Many readers may find this preferable to the Heath edition, where Euclid is almost drowned out by overwhelming amounts of commentary.If you haven't read Euclid before, you might be surprised to find that the proofs are full of gaps. Many proofs use arguments which are not justified by the axioms (for example the proof of the first proposition takes it for granted that a certain pair of circles intersect), and there are many examples of \\"proof by special case\\". These issues don't really detract from the beauty of the work (and one can argue that putting everything on an absolutely rigorous foundation wasn't the original goal anyway), but are probably part of the reason why this book has been so heavily commented over the millennia. For a modern discussion of the mathematical issues in Euclid, and some related subsequent developments, I recommend \\"Geometry: Euclid and Beyond\\" by Hartshorne."},{"Title":"Euclid's Elements (Everyman's library)","review":"Newton read Euclid's Elementals to learn geometry in one year and had developed his own mathematics called calculus. Both are essential mathematics for understanding Newton's The Principia : Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy by Isaac Newton which is a complete mathematical description of the observable universe for his time.Three steps to the mind of Newton... Euclid's Elemental, Calculus and then the Principia. Euclid gives the best course in geometry by supplying the reader with approx. 500 mathematical tutorials. Just get some geometry software and you are set to go at doing the tutorials one or two every day for a year or so. Then you are ready for the Principia.Thanks Euclid."},{"Title":"Euclid's Elements (Everyman's library)","review":"I feel like I cannot adequately praise such an obviously beautiful and enduring classic of mathematics. The gravity of the book makes insignificant any praise I may have for it. One does not need to praise it, it is geometry; it stands true whether we praise it or not. No math is more elegant.So, with that said, this is a great edition of Elements. It is high quality construction: thick paper, heavy binding, thick cover. You will certainly get a lot of use out of it."},{"Title":"Euclid's Elements (Everyman's library)","review":"Well obviously geometry does fall under mathematics as an academic subject, but Euclid's Elements doesn't have to be approached as a math course. I say it is a key liberal arts course.The Elements teaches logical thinking. It begins with definitions, axioms, and common notions; every proposition given is then proved by referring to these definitions, axioms, and common notions.The Elements teaches development and systematic construction. Propositions are proven not only with axioms, etc. but also by referring to earlier propositions. And since these earlier propositions are proven with the original axioms (or with still earlier propositions) everything reduces to the original axioms, etc.Therefore, the Elements thus also teaches exposition. By starting with definitions, axioms, and common notions Euclid first lays the foundations over which he builds later propositions and constructions. Readers won't find gratuitous or unsubstantiated statements--everything refers to something already accepted as true.(*)For over two thousand years, every educated westerner had to study geometry using the Elements. As such it pervades all our visual art and architecture which cannot be properly understood without familiarity with Euclid's geometry. Euclid's geometry is a subject that belongs in every educated person's intellectual baggage. It requires no calculus and no algebra, and with only a little effort anyone can read and understand the first book at least.This edition is particularly good. It contains all 13 books of Euclid's Elements in a single volume. If a proof or a construction takes more than one page, the key diagram appears on all the relevant pages so that readers don't to have flip pages back and forth. My only regret is that I got the paperback rather than the hardback edition.Vincent Poirier, Montreal(*) Yes, yes I know: we don't have to accept the axioms. This discovery led to the development of non-Euclidean geometry in the 19th century and to a deeper understanding of axiomatics and logic. But that IS mathematics!"},{"Title":"Euclid's Elements (Everyman's library)","review":"This work of Euclid, made highly accessible in this edition is indeed incredible. How many people know that Euclid had a thorough grasp of the concept of a tangent line to a circle comparable to that of Newton? Certainly not me. I am currently teaching from this book and reading it in detail, to my great pleasure. In Proposition III.16, Euclid essentially shows the following 4 properties are equivalent for a line L meeting a circle C at a point P:1) L meets C nowhere else, 2) L does not \\"cut\\" C, i.e. L contains no points interior to the circle, 3) L is perpendicular to the radius of C through P, 4) L makes angle zero with the circle C at P, i.e. the greatest lower bound of the angles between L and all secants of C through P is zero,and his proof also shows: 5) the line L is the limit of secants of C through P as the second point of intersection approaches P, i.e. for every angle containing L as a side, there is a neighborhood of P such that all secants of C through P make with L a smaller angle than the given one.The first property, that a tangent line should meet a circle only once, is the one I was taught in high school, and it is inadequate for discussing tangents to curves more complicated than globally convex ones. The property of not cutting the curve, or of not crossing it, is adequate for describing tangents to all locally convex curves, and the property of making an angle of zero, or of being a limit of secants is of course Newton's most sophisticated definition suited for describing tangents to all curves. I am now not surprised to learn that Newton read Euclid before producing his own work. I had no idea this was in Euclid, and I have had the same eye opening experience in several other places as I read this amazing book.Thanks to Green Lion for this lovely edition, and to Robin Hartshorne for writing his book in such a way as to force me to read Euclid. And thanks to the commenter who pointed out I could delete an earlier erroneous review of mine."},{"Title":"Euclid's Elements (Everyman's library)","review":"As a college professor, I have been teaching Fundamentals of Math for future school teachers for several years now.

Maybe, but seemingly endless minutia comparing every conceivable argument and complaint made in over two thousand years of criticism, which necessitates tiny print spread over three volumes, does not make for a very user-friendly experience. The folks at Green Lion Press have removed all that extraneous and somewhat tedious material and have retained the essence of Heath and the Elements in a single, splendid, utilitarian volume. This is a book that is meant for serious daily use with heavy paper, sewn bindings and plenty of white space for notes. The layout is just right, with attention taken to make sure that all figures are exactly where needed so that there is no page flipping to find any figure that is referred to in the text. This publisher clearly has taken a great deal of pride in producing a volume that feels good to hold and use. Euclid is better because of the craftsmanship that went into this edition.

Of course, there are some flaws, perhaps in her reading her lover's letters a bit too much rather than recalling some more vivid scenes in a flashback. And her husband is a stereotype, her children cardboard. But I liked it that she was trying to find out more about her own family's past. The fact that her father had two families was so interesting - I wish it had been explored more. But the novel sets itself in a few days' timespan where she is in a hotel. The political turbulence is also a bit remote as a backdrop for a U.S. reader who would like to know more, esp. about her husband's activities and politics. Also, the ending was very disappointing. Still, it was an absorbing read for me and something I would recommend to others. It could be a good reading group book. I wish the author would go back to this subject and maybe extend the time period beyond just staying in the hotel and the few memories she has while there. The book is about 150 pages and could have been 250 easily. I would definitely read more by this author sometime.

In Silvia Molina's novel, The Love You Promised Me, the story revealed during the two-day trip taken by the main character, concentrates on the disappointing moments of life. The main character, Marcela, takes this trip to uncover her past by learning of her family genealogy. She also uses this time to reflect on an affair that has turned sour, during which the reader learns of her sadness and disappointment in life. Marcela, the wife of an incredibly successful, hard-working lawyer, Phillip, finds herself caught in an unsatisfying marriage. As often the case with the spouses of those holding a demanding position, Marcela feels neglected and often complains about the absence of her husband. Despite this fact, he remains a good husband and father to their children. As Marcela unfolds her life, the reader learns of an intimate affair with Eduardo, a well-known doctor. The two meet as Marcela's mother undergoes treatment for her terminal illness. Marcela notes Eduardo's compassion and concern for his patient and begins to care a great deal about him. Shortly after this, he reveals his love for her and the two begin intimate communications, first through a series of letters and later in person. However, the promising affair is short lived as Eduardo confesses he no longer feels for her, causing incredible heartache for Marcela. Amidst the telling of the lovers' tale, Marcela does research into her ancestors' lives. She finds that her past uncovers some unsettling family issues. Marcela is disgusted with her grandparents' choice to abandon their son after his marriage with a person of another class. Anger at the hands of Marcela's family, both in and out of the immediate, roams throughout the novel. The author deliberately puts a large focus on different angles of her family life that has upset her. The relationships with her family, and her opinion of the members of it, display Marcela's inability to accept her past and present position in life. In fact, this causes her to take the trip in the first place, to resolve questions of her unknown relatives. The first and most immediate cause of unhappiness brought by family members, comes from her husband Rafael. Although an excellent provider and good father, Marcela is disappointed with the way that the marriage has turned out. She often feels alone, and wishes to have the companionship that marriage brings. Emotionally, her relationship with Rafael feels not existent because of his need to ensure the financial stability of the family and maintain the respect he has earned as a prominent lawyer of the area. Even though Marcela realizes the need for her husband to work so hard, she complains to herself and gives her an excuse to begin an affair with Eduardo. Another portion of family life that Marcela struggles to deal with comes directly from her father. After his death, she learns of another family he kept hidden from her. Marcela is angered, not only by her father's unfaithfulness, but also by her mother's decision to stay with him. The struggle is evident as she asks her dying mother whether she knew of her father's affair. Aside from the actions of her father, treatment he received from his family disturbs Marcela as well. On her trip she learns of her father's rejection by his own family after marrying a housemaid, a member of a lower class. Marcela views this family with disgust, eventually adding another factor to her depression. As the novel moves towards a conclusion, Marcela begins to realize the true causes of her unhappiness. Although she experiences a great deal of pain from the termination of her affair with Eduardo, Marcela learns that she must learn to accept her place in life and her family. This does not mean that she agrees with all the actions of her family, but she is willing to not let it affect her anymore. Therefore she can begin to put her life back in order and recover from the past that so strongly influences her while dealing with her marriage in a more positive manner"},{"Title":"The Love You Promised Me","review":"THE LOVE YOU PROMISED ME is the 6th recipient of the Sor Juana In&eacute;s de la Cruz Prize and was a finalist in the Dublin Literary Awards.&quot;This lovely work, astonishing in its quietude, was deservedly winner of the Sor Juana In&eacute;s de la Cruz Prize and belongs in all literary collections&quot; --Library Journal&quot;The novel's biggest strength is Ms. Molina's unsentimentality in her treatment of Marcela's emotional journey&quot; --Beatriz Terrazas, Dallas Morning News&quot;For aficionados of Latino literature, this entertaining book reveals how lovers in modern-day Mexico-as do their US counterparts-face (and fight) familial and societal odds to realize a dream&quot; --Saldudos Hispanos&quot;Molina weaves the past and present together into a seamless tapestry of hopes and passions, fears and failings, love and longing&quot; --Booklist"},{"Title":"Complete Henry Bech","review":"Henry Bech is John Updike's playfully irreverent alter ego and has charmed readers with aesthetic dithering and a seemingly inexhaustible libido. Now all of Updike's Henry Bech stories have been compiled in one volume, including the final, series-capping story &quot;His Oeuvre&quot;. This outstanding Everyman's Library edition of The Complete Henry Bech is &quot;must&quot; reading for all John Updike fans and a very highly recommended addition to school and community library literary collections."},{"Title":"Complete Henry Bech","review":"Updike's Jewish alter ego is an extension of his imagination and identity. He recognizes and absorbs the ' identity ' of his major rivals of the time Bellow and Roth and shows he also can be them and be that. But a projection however clever does not in this case have the power of what is closer to him, with him. And there is greater authenticity and strength in the 'Rabbit Books'.I have I think also an objection which only a minority of readers will share. Bech is a pasteboard Jew who has no real deep Jewish knowledge or identity. This does not mean characters like him do not exist, or Updike had no right to create him. It does mean that those of us looking for some depth when they meet a Jewish intellectual or cultural figure are quite disappointed.In any case it is clear that for Updike Bech is just a sideshow, one of the many that constitute parts of the complex identity of this very remarkable American writer."},{"Title":"Complete Henry Bech","review":"Henry Bech, a Jewish writer who has been unproductive for well over a decade, finds himself continually offered free trips to obscure Eastern European countries. Academics from minor American universities call to offer him accommodation in return for a trip around the lecture circuit. Magazines and newspapers publish, every now and again, short articles entitled 'Whatever happened to Henry Bech?'. Once an up and coming novelist and now just an author who doesn't write, Bech lives the meaningless jet-set life of the author who has attained distinguished writer status simply by virtue of not having written a word in years. For John Updike, protestant where Bech is Jewish, productive where Bech is silent, this 'alter-ego' allows him to explore, with satire, wit and often, tedium, the celebrity life an author sometimes finds himself living, without ever really knowing how it all happened.'The Complete Henry Bech' published by Penguin - and more on that later - contains two novellas and a short story. Bech: A Book is primarily concerned with Bech's adventures around the world, which essentially gives Updike an excuse to mention that countries major writers and to make allusions to them throughout the text. Bech is Back is the most entertaining of the trio and deals, in part, with Bech finally publishing after fifteen years silence, his often-referred to but never really worked out novel, Think Big. In between, he is married, divorces, and has plenty of literary discussions with young female editors, typists, fans, reviewers - all of whom seem remarkably enamoured with the author. Finally, there is Bech in Czech, a very short story which returns to the main conceit of Bech: A Book which, by now, has become somewhat unnecessary to the needs of the character. Rather than continuing to reveal the comic adventures of the novelist, Updike trots Bech around Czech, then ends the story. Certainly the weakest of the three.What this collection does have going for it is the character of Bech. Like Harry Angstrom from Updike's remarkable Rabbit series, Bech has an active internal life, and is capable of describing the world around him in a way that, when it works, speaks of poetry, and when it does not, devolves into yet another comparison to sex, or sex organs - female, usually. Bech is much more literary than Harry, and refers either by name and title to other author's works - Roth, Mailer, Bellow, Salinger, Lewis, Dreiser, Vidal. These references work because Bech is an author, because he is supposed to know about writers, but a lot of the drug and women scenes ring with a hollow tone, because we have seen them elsewhere by Updike, and they were better. Bech, when he sticks to his strengths - parodying awards ceremonies, the reputation of an author, declining literary stardom, rising literary stardom, reviewers, editors, star-struck fans, greedy fans, nonchalant socialites, publishing conglomerates - works remarkably well, because the reader can't help but be aware that Updike, who himself has won many awards and has been a writer for his entire adult life, knows enough about the process and the fakery to be able to satirise with the honesty of information and sharpness of intent to really take a bite.Some scenes are very funny indeed. For his entire career, Bech has had an admirer, Federbusch, who has tirelessly stayed by his author, collecting every edition that comes out in every language, and posting, with reply paid envelopes, to Henry Bech to sign. Bech is touched by this, so touched that when he is in the neighborhood - Cedar Meadow, Pennsylvania - he decides to pay his fan a visit. To his horror, he finds that his books are not in fact proudly displayed on Federbusch's bookshelf but instead, 'The books were not erect in rows but stacked on their sides like lumber, like dubious ingots, in this lightless closet along with - oh, the treachery! - similarly exhaustive, tightly packed, and beautifully unread collections of Roth, Mailer, Barth, Capote...' Poor Bech learns the hard way that fans cannot always be trusted, that the right reader may never be found. Later Bech is informed that a new edition of his books are to be printed by 'Superbooks', which is owned by a vast conglomerate. He is to be paid $1.50 for every piece of paper he signs for the company, for a total of twenty-eight thousand five hundred pieces of high-rag-content paper. He is flown to the Caribbean along with his wife - the company recommends a puller for maximum efficiency signing - and they spend two weeks signing and signing and signing. Bech's obsession with his own signature provides a lot of laughs, and shows again the strength of a writer parodying writers.But a lot of the work comes tumbling down. When Updike sticks to writers, he is untouchable with Bech's touchy, arrogant, sensitive, misunderstood, concerned, literary, anxious, aged character packing all the punches and pulling none. But that other great theme of Updike's oeuvre: adultery, sex, the female body, is used far too often in a series that really doesn't need it, and can only be harmed by its addition. This creates a spotty effect for the novel, because the character of Bech can't quite succeed in the sometimes fragile, sometimes blunt ruminations on carnality for which Harry was so admired.The Penguin edition of The Complete Henry Bech is, unfortunately, not complete. It is missing a few other Bech titles, which leaves the appreciation and criticism of the entirety of Bech an impossible feat. For all the misgivings I felt while reading about Bech, I also felt much affection for his wry speech, his witty thoughts, his complete disregard for his fans and friends. There was a lot to love, but also a lot to dismay the Updike faithful among us. I shall leave with one last question - Why make Bech a Jew? It seems to add nothing except a perfunctory trip to Israel and a few fairly standard Jewish jokes at Bellow and Roth's expense. And, given that most of Bech was written in the '70s and '80s, and set in Europe, it would be assumed that the Jewish situation there would be handled with more delicacy than it is. A confusing aspect to Bech's character, but it adds to the overall unevenness of the work - why couldn't Updike stick to his strengths for the whole work? This collection works in patches."},{"Title":"Complete Henry Bech","review":"I've always considered Updike much more valuable for his superlative book reviews than for his, to my mind, more-sizzle-than-steak fiction. (If you dig past the nostalgic plethora of period detail in the Rabbit books, there really isn't a great deal there.) But 20 years after accidentally discovering Henry Bech on the shelves of the public library (just as Updike has said he likes to imagine people encountering his books), his hapless exploits with women and the Muse continue to provide me with unfailing pleasure. It's a fine service to American literature to have them all - including the previously uncollected story \\"His Oeuvre\\", one of the best - gathered together between one set of hardcovers.There is however, I'm sad to say, a big ugly boil on the butt of this otherwise handsome volume: the semi-infamous \\"Bech Noir\\", in which Updike, seemingly grown disgusted with the continuing durability of his character, jerks him through a sour ludicrous pantomime - the sheer awfulness of which makes it almost impossible to look at him the same way again. .... It's as if Frank L. Baum, around the fourth or fifth Oz book, had Dorothy move to Los Angeles where she became a crack whore. After that, the valedictory tale in which Bech most implausibly receives the Nobel Prize comes across as simply another gesture of contempt - whether towards the Swedish Academy, for honoring the even-less-qualified Toni Morrison rather than himself, or towards the reader, I can't say. All I can tell you - strange advice, I know - is to skip those two stories if you haven't been contaminated by them already."},{"Title":"Complete Henry Bech","review":"Plenty of much better writers than me have written about the literary merits of John Updike's fiction, so I'm not going to even attempt that here, nor do I think it necessary to offer a synopsis. Many years ago I read \\"Bech: A Book,\\" and \\"Bech is Back\\" and found them quite amusing , and I wanted to read the last couple of works in this series. I find with all anthologies that the type is a bit small, but it quite crisp, and seems to pretty newly composited, (unlike say their version of \\"Bleak House\\" which is clearly old,) and the pages, although thin, are not of parchment-like thinness of the valuable yet punishing \\"American Library.\\""},{"Title":"Running Scared: The Life and Treacherous Times of Las Vegas Casino King Steve Wynn","review":"I read this book with an open mind - my only prior knowledge of Steve Wynn was that he was the guy that built the Mirage, Treasure Island and Bellagio - the Mirage having ushered in the new era of modern luxury casino hotels in Vegas, and the $1.6 billion dollar Bellagio having upped the ante.That said, I can see why Steve Wynn fought so hard to prevent this book from being released. Wynn sued the the original publisher and apparently helped force it into bankruptcy.Any reader of this book will likely come away believing that:1) Wynn rubbed elbows with mob figures, and may have served as a front man in some of his early dealings, before he accrued enough juice on his own,2) Wynn leveraged his money-making capacity into a large measure of control over the local and state government and judiciary,3) Wynn is an egomaniac,4) Wynn kicks puppies....You get the idea. Although the book makes a fair attempt at biography, its real purpose is to be an expose'. After 350 pages, it has the effect of beating a dead horse.Wynn may indeed be all of those things, and certainly some of the things he's accused of could result in the loss of his Gaming License - although it seems Nevada is far too invested in him to ever let that happen. I wish there was a more balanced, well-rounded account of Steve Wynn's story out there."},{"Title":"Running Scared: The Life and Treacherous Times of Las Vegas Casino King Steve Wynn","review":"This book reads like what it is -- a quick 300 pages cranked out by a Vegas journalist familiar with the subject, commissioned by a publisher with a rich history of wallowing in libel. The preface admits as much. The publisher proudly proclaims on the book jacket, &quot;Steve Wynn has already sued the author of this book and its publisher twice....&quot; Indeed, the book leaves you wondering if getting sued by Steve Wynn was the whole point of this book, and is the only notoriety this tabloid volume would ever have received.The author does himself and the reader a great disservice with his vague source citations. The book lists a great many books, interviews, and court records, but unfortunately these sources are listed as a group at the end of the book and aren't footnoted throughout the text. This makes it impossible to discern the specific source for any of the claims in the book.Most disappointingly, the book fails to give a satisfying biography of its subject. Most of the more fascinating business maneuvers in Wynn's career are sadly glossed over, leaving you with more questions than answers. How exactly did Wynn make so much money buying and selling a small lot on the corner of Caesar's? Exactly how did Wynn leverage control of the Golden Nugget? This book won't really tell you. All too often you'll have to be happy with the answer than Wynn &quot;knew somebody&quot;.I kept up hope for this book (having already read other damning customer reviews), but ultimately I found this book disappointing. It seemed unnecessarily condemning of Wynn -- if he's a crook, the facts should speak for themselves, and the author needn't pursue it so doggedly. This book seems only to prove that Wynn works in a business with a lot of shady peers, and that Wynn doesn't seem to mind it. What a surprise."},{"Title":"Running Scared: The Life and Treacherous Times of Las Vegas Casino King Steve Wynn","review":"Be warned. If you're looking for the exciting true story about how one man revitalized a city in decline and truly modernized Las Vegas through vision and guts (as I was), you won't find it here.This is not a book about Steve Wynn transforming Las Vegas. This is a tabloid hit job written by a hostile author who has only one objective: link Steve Wynn to the mob.As a Vegas history buff and as someone who's interested in Wynn, let me concede the author's objective up front: okay sure. Of course Wynn knows mafia wiseguys. How could he not? How could Wynn arrive as a young man in Vegas in the 60s and climb the ladder of influence without making mob contacts? The mob ran the town! The only real surprise as far as I'm concerned is how little Wynn seems to be involved with the mafia.It's not that I'm a huge fan of Wynn, and all of Smith's secondhand accounts of Wynn behaving like a spoiled brat in private seem plausable, but since it's so obvious that the author is laser-focused on smearing Wynn, who's to say I'm getting a balanced account?Whole chapters are devoted to little more than proving that Wynn is friends with this particular mob middleman, and on this particular day in 1982, they were SEEN HAVING LUNCH at this particular bistro. Though Wynn would always deny that the lunch took place, that's not the recollection of this busboy, who we've tracked down, who was ACTUALLY THERE. etc. etc. This is the book.I was most looking forward to a retelling of the story of how Wynn built the Mirage. Where did he get the inspiration? How was it financed? How did he pitch it to investors? How did it get built? What were the expectations? How was it received when it opened? How did it change the texture of the strip? We get none of that. Instead, around two-thirds of the way through the book, I turn the page, and the Mirage is suddenly there, no discussion, and we're hearing about how one of the casino hosts may have had mob ties. Weak sauce.Look, maybe what Smith needed was an opening chapter stating what he was trying to achieve. He could have made a case that although Wynn has transformed the city and done some great things, he's not completely squeaky-clean and has gone to great lengths to hide his association to organized crime. He could have made the moral case about taking money from the mob, and then said explicitly that the purpose of the book was to air out Wynn's dirty laundry and to take the man down a notch. What we get instead is an account of Wynn that purports to be evenhanded and journalistic but is truly only interested in smearing the man.If the popular positive image of Wynn as humanitarian and brilliant entrepeneur who saved Vegas isn't wholly correct, then Smith's problem is that he goes directly to the opposite extreme, painting Wynn as a greedy, slimy criminal. Maybe the truth is somewhere in the middle? Maybe that's a book I would want to read."},{"Title":"Running Scared: The Life and Treacherous Times of Las Vegas Casino King Steve Wynn","review":"A recent pleasure trip to Las Vegas turned into a business adventure. A walk down the strip suddenly became a research project to analyze the 'Vegas Experience'. In the midst of gathering artifacts, casual conversations with long-time locals (a construction traffic director and a security guard -- both over 15 year residents) revealed a theme central to their blue collar perspective of the city: a great respect for a man by the name of Steve Wynn.Even his employees were faultlessly loyal to him. The curator of his art collection, a retired professor of art history, willingly suggested that Steve knew far more about art than even he.These things I discovered all in less than 6 hours. I bought this book in the hopes of learning more about the man. Rare instances of Wynn-specific information could be found (only by skipping large chunks of irrelevant stories). This book smacks of irresponsible journalism.It seems as if Mr. Smith became a journalist in Las Vegas because of a penchant for sensational stories. Akin to the phenomena of the 6 degrees of Kevin Bacon, this was the 2 degrees of Steve Wynn. John Smith took a number of sensational stories about events in Las Vegas and 'used' (also to be taken in a pejorative context) Steve Wynn as the thread to tie them together: guilt by association.This was a thinly veiled attempt to write 'yet another' collection of mob stories (and other notable local mysterious events) while extorting Steve Wynn's name to secure new interest and sales.I picture Mr. Smith being able to pull off a story portraying Mother Teresa as a devious opportunist. Mr. Smith's preposterous suppositions, called a book, might have been more appropriately titled: Running Scarred.To find the story about Steve Wynn that I was looking for I may have to research and write it myself."},{"Title":"Running Scared: The Life and Treacherous Times of Las Vegas Casino King Steve Wynn","review":"I have always had a fascination with Steve Wynn's hotels and was looking to learn more about him when I came across this book. However, after reading Mr. Smith's depictions of Steve Wynn, the only thing I know for sure is that Smith REALLY doesn't like Steve Wynn. He criticized his every move, looking only at the negative &quot;hidden agendas&quot; associated with things such as the Mirage Dolphins and the Bellagio Art Gallery that the rest of the world is grateful that Steve Wynn brought to us. He repeatedly tries to link Wynn to the mob, but can never make a convincing arguement. He only briefly touches on the building of the hotels, their success, and fails to mention how the Mirage, Treasure Island, and the Bellagio were innovators in three different generations of Vegas theme hotels. Despite the books 2001 copyright date, is now about 9 years out of date. It pre-dates the MGM-Mirage merger, and even cites the Fremont Street Experience as being &quot;set to open in late 1995.&quot; A postscript to the paperback edition attempts to bring it up to date, but it feels rushed, with misspelled words and inaccurate details.Smith seems to have about 100 pages of relevant information, and 254 pages of stories that are so loosely linked to Wynn that at times I forgot who I was reading about. Smith goes so far as to imply that the deterioration of the UNLV basketball program is due to Steve Wynn deciding that Jerry Tarkanian projected the wrong image for the university and that he had to go.In addition to the anti-Wynn take on every story, Smith illustrates some stories with details that aren't even accurate. He implies that opening the Bellagio was a huge risk because of the increased competition for the &quot;well-heeled gambler market&quot; with the opening of the Venetian, Paris and Mandalay Bay in the ensuing years since the Mirage opening, implying that the market Wynn was seeking was already captured by these hotels. This seems to be a viable argument, until you realize that those three hotels opened AFTER the Bellagio's October 1998 opening.Smith's writing is often biased. He frequently quotes his employer, the Las Vegas Review-Journal positively, and their rival newspaper, the Las Vegas Sun, negatively. Smith apparantly is not interested in providing an accurate portrayal of Wynn. Rather, he seems content try to pull every skeleton out of his closet, no matter how big of a stretch it is, to bring down Wynn's image. No wonder Wynn didn't want this book published.If you are a Las Vegas history buff like me, there are a couple of interesting tidbits, but if you are looking for an accurate biography of Steve Wynn, this is not it."},{"Title":"Running Scared: The Life and Treacherous Times of Las Vegas Casino King Steve Wynn","review":"Having stayed at the Bellagio, I was intrigued to learn more about Steve Wynn and bought this book. Unfortunately, it is very poorly written, lacking organization, and even more lacking in factual citations.Granted Steve Wynn is not an angel. But I thought that the allegations in this book should be backed up by adequate citations.Finally, the book is so poorly written in terms of sentence structure that I just groaned every time I turned the page."},{"Title":"Running Scared: The Life and Treacherous Times of Las Vegas Casino King Steve Wynn","review":"I was hoping to learn a lot about the evolution of the Golden Nugget, the creation of the first megaresort in Vegas (the Mirage), as well as Wynn's super-gimmicky Treasure Island and how Bellagio took glitz to the highest level yet in Vegas. I instead read a mixed bunch of stories that seemed to have very little order. The book fails to follow any kind of progression, and is mostly about Wynn's associates' ties to organized crime. The Vegas casinos he built are only mentioned in passing, or when a controversy was involved.John L. Smith seems more intent on criticizing Wynn's associations than actually telling the story of how he rebuilt Las Vegas. I came out of the book still wondering what he was thinking when Mirage opened, and how the public took to it.If you want a REAL biography by John L. Smith, I highly recommend &quot;No Limit&quot;, Smith's story of Bob Stupak. I read this one after &quot;Running Scared&quot; and was left wondering why Smith didn't write a similar book on Wynn.

Using public water to build his exclusive Shadow Creek golf course, buying art, jets and NY condos with stockholders money as the stock sank into takeover waters, untimately being shown the door by casino magnate Kirk Kerkorian. Once owned by MGM, things changed. The golf course was opened, the art, NY condo and jet all sold.How does one man undermine Federal law to build a dolphin attraction? he is on film meeting with a known mobster who used his Atlantic City casino (Golden Nugget) to launder money, but can't seem to remember anything about it.Fact: the son of a Bino Hall operator rises up to be one of the worlds leading casino developers and owners through some very shady associations.

Smith provides an interesting perspective of the antics of Casino King, Steve Winn; a man who certainly has a shady past as well as some profound character flaws. Big deal; who doesn't have a few skeletons in their closet?Wynn also has a charismatically savvy approach to running his empire and had to be very tough minded and pragmatic to even get the ball rolling; lost behind the negative bias the author has against this complex power broker, is the fact the guy had to have something going for him to build an empire like Wynn was able to construct. Were his ethics lacking? No doubt. Did he have vision and courage that very few could even dream about possessing? Certainly.Smith does a remarkable job of researching the life and times of Steve Winn, but I think a more balanced approach to presenting the facts would've made the book even more compelling. The reader doesn't need to hear the author's personal spin on the guy he clearly despises. Perhaps he felt the need to sensationalize the reporting in order to sell more books. It's still a very good book; it would've been a great book if Smith could've presented the facts without offering his overly pious opinion about the subject.

While some of the detail is interesting, the author's blatant dislike of his subject is so obvious that it casts doubt on whether much of the writing is even factual. Perhaps this reader is jaded, after years of analyzing the gaming business as an investor, but Steve Wynn seems squeaky clean compared to the usual gangsters, skimmers, and scammers in Vegas.Steve Wynn is the \\"Casino King of Las Vegas.\\" Common sense tells us that he didn't rise in the gambling business by being a saint. Nowhere in the book, however, does the author make a strong case that Steve Wynn was either financed by, or in cahoots with gangsters. A money launderer for the mob attempted to launder some money through the Golden Nugget Atlantic City. Known gangsters have even gambled at Wynn-owned casinos. Is this a surprise? Wynn has a lot of political pull in Vegas, lives an opulent lifestyle, and has a temper. Doesn't this describe almost every CEO today?Steve Wynn got help from bankers in Las Vegas, and Michael Milken, junk bond king, to finance his casinos. The author makes this sound nefarious, while at the same time admitting that 80% of new casino development in the 90s was done by junk bonds. The author does admit that Steve Wynn pays his employees lavishly and has the lowest turnover on the Strip.Despite the slanted approach to his subject, this book is still interesting to anyone interested in knowing more about the casino business and one of its most colorful characters, Steve Wynn.Is Steve Wynn really controlled by the mob? The author tries to make the case - and fails. My favorite passage in the book is Wynn's response to charges that the Golden Nugget allowed a gangster to launder money through their casino. In the process of trying to exchange small bills to big bills, Castelbuono lost $400,000 of the $1.2 million he was supposed to \\"launder\\" at the Baccarat tables.Wynn said: \\" Castelbuono's alleged intention was to violate the law in a conspiracy to hide and send out of the country the proceeds of illegal narcotics trade. The Golden Nugget's intention was to win his money and it did.\\"Perhaps Steve Wynn sums up his own life the best when he said:\\"Casinos are not churches or towers of theological construction.

I'll keep it short so you can make a decision.I think the book is really full of great Mob stories/conections with Steve Wynn. It is not as detailed as i hoped, but as a S. Calif. person who is intreged with vegas, it is a real eye opener.The main thing i dont like is that its not like a true biography. I have been reading a Disney biography at the same time and in comparison, its not as good, but then again, I dont believe Steve Wynn really contributed to it or allowed it.Bottom line, if you want to know about Steve Wynn and his amazing ride to the top of a billion dollar corp., read this book. If you like great vegas stories, give this a read. If you have personal feelings about Steve Wynn, you will either love it or hate it.Easy read, buy it used, and don't ever give a dime to a Wynn company (my opinion after reading the book)."},{"Title":"Running Scared: The Life and Treacherous Times of Las Vegas Casino King Steve Wynn","review":"If you're looking for a biography-style book about S.Wynn's road to being King of Las Vegas this really isn't it. I'm about 120 pages into it now, and I'm already flipping through to see if it is going to get any better. Here's a little on the book:VERY detailed! Assuming all is true in the book, you can tell there has been much research and hours of connecting people together in the stories in the book. Unfortunately, the book seems to be just that, many many small stories or bits of stories that rarely link together at once. The book really doesn't have a good time line -- it's all kinda scattered, and doesn't read very well. The worst part about the book is for me it seems the author has an agenda to destroy the reputation of S.Wynn. Every opportunity is taken to say how Wynn was asscoiated with crooked and shady characters. So many of these characters one would never recognize, so there is much wrote about why these characters are shady people, so we all will know just how bad the company of Wynn was. There just seems to be nothing good written about Wynn in the book (so far) and that doesn't seem to be changing. Maybe that's just how it really is, I don't know. There's no wonder Steve Wynn sued these people for putting this book out. If you really want a copy, you can look for mine on ebay.

He may have bitten off more than he could chew, but he has left a wonderful legacy of beautiful hotels with excellent service, not to mention providing jobs for hundreds of people. And he made money for himself...God Forbid. And please...don't start waving around the First Amendment in defense of baloney like this. Are the author and publisher free to print malarkey like this?

And he has the facts to back this up. But our culture, politicians, special interests, and (often) our own psyches constantly try and convince us otherwise. This is not to say Easterbrook does not feel humanity could -- and should -- do a better job looking after ourselves and the planet. But he puts things in proper perspective and makes you realize how often we are manipulated to feel things are worse than they are. My only complaint is the last bit trying to put September 11 and fundamentalism in perspective feels a bit last minute (although undoubtedly someone else would have been critical if he had not addressed these points)."},{"Title":"The Progress Paradox: How Life Gets Better While People Feel Worse","review":"Mr. Easterbrook has yet again--see A Moment On Earth--marshaled FACTS to illustrate reality in modern day America--and the world. Mr. Easterbrook's thesis refutes the barrage of negativism with which we are assaulted every day. We are literally pummeled by media every day with a message that the world and our quality of life is deteriorating; but in the noise we miss the substantial, incremental progress that our lives are imbued with every day. This substantial, incremental progress is a direct result of us attending to our lives: family, work &amp; country.It worries me that Mr. Easterbrook's factually based examination of the human condition in the world today is such a rare occurence. Pundits posit fluff and it is news. The Progress Paradox is not fluff. From my perch, we are dangerously close as a society to accepting what media displays as reality without thoughtfully comparing it with what is truly valuable &amp; meaningful in our lives. Brittany's marriage (?) is not more important than having a cardiologist insert a microscopic balloon into your artery to clear it and save your life.I can not articulate as clearly as Mr. Easterbrook, but trust me, The Progress Paradox will cheerfully disabuse you of the notion that what the media spews is representative of our condition today.Mr. Easterbrook displays, as in all his writings, a genius for distilling chaos into rational exposition.

In fact he claims that we are more stressed, anxious, slightly less happy than we were fifty years ago. Too many choices, and too many things have made us fatter and sadder.One remedy according to Easterbook, and this is the third part of the book is through solving the worlds and our own problems. The health -care problem at home, the minimum wage- and poverty problems, providing more foreign aid abroad.Psychologically and this is his major point, the way to greater happiness is through greater goodness, giving to others, communal involvement in helping, greater application of virtues, in being more charitable.It is hard to argue with a call for people to be more moral human beings.On the 'Happiness question' however critics point out that Easterbrook neglects to tell us the overall happiness figures, which are that eighty- percent in the U.S. claim to by and large be happy with their lives. And that there has been no significant drop in this. Market- economy societies which have been successful in providing economic opportunity for their citizens are taken to be the happiest of all socieities.The point may be that Easterbrook is making the ' unhappiness situation' and the 'paradox' much more acute than they really happen to be.I myself am a bit suspicious of the whole business of happiness studies. If I take a look at a typical day of my own in which my moods change hundreds of times in one way or another- if I take a look at the way I evaluate my own life in which I not simply consider whether I am 'happy' or not, but consider much else in evaluating my overall well- being I find the whole business of speaking about ' happiness' for the masses as simplistic.In any case I may be wrong. And this work has the great virtue of raising a very interesting question in a very interesting way.I suspect a good share of its readers will be made somewhat happier by reading it."},{"Title":"The Progress Paradox: How Life Gets Better While People Feel Worse","review":"\\"The Progress Paradox\\" is what could be categorized as pseudo-academia. Typically I despise books in this category, but \\"Progress Paradox\\" has some overall value and is not a necessarily bad read.The first part of the book is a sufficient statistical analysis of how almost every aspect of American life has improved in the last 50 or 100 years. The lists are exhaustive and the point is irrefutable. Despite this Easterbrook provides a poll (of unknown origin) that cites American's as perceiving the present as worse than the past. We are not provided any information as to the context of the question, the sample, or the any other polls pertaining to the thesis. Easterbrook relies too heavily on such insufficient data to erect a thesis that has arguable necessity. Despite this, the first part of the book elicits the doctrine of materialism and how its excesses permeate our lives.The second part of the book is somewhat tangential: it is a sales-pitch for \\"Positive Psychology.\\" The author gives some fairly logical reasons, and a basic overview of the new paradigm of psychological study, and uses the school of thought as a vessel to express his convoluted hypothesis to what leads to happiness. From what I deduced (I may be projecting my own beliefs), the author feels that happiness relies in progress rather than particular goals, means rather than ends, etc. This makes sense and is congruent with the Buddhist axiom that enlightenment is the journey itself. Despite the esoteric and lofty assertions of this section, there is a kernel of truth here, and worth contemplating.The final portion of the book turns away from how things have gotten better, and turns to how things can get better. This is where Easterbrook steps onto the soapbox. Everything from universal health care, to corporate crime, and other liberal ideology spreads itself over the final 50 pages. The reasoning is sufficient, the evidence is scant, and the condescension will be insulting to anyone who disagrees with the author.The book has issues with focusing its purpose. If the author had the discipline, I believe he could of made three strongly-supported books on three different subjects simply by spending the time to evaluate the arguments pertinent in each section. Instead, we're left with a convoluted wannabe-treatise for anti-materialism. The intentions are admirable, the assessment is fair, but as a book of sociological study, Easterbrook fails. The book does not justify more than a quick skim.

The question is intriguing, so I read this book hoping for insight.The book can be divided into 3 sections:1) Life is great. Lot of \\"feel-good\\" statistics prove this ad nauseum. In fact, we have too much stuff!2) Yet we are not happy - This is the most interesting section as he outlines several theories on why this is so.3) We would be happier if we liberals ruled and punished evil CEOs, banned the big ugly SUV's, empowered Arabs, and brought to the rest of the world the same material things that fail to make us happy.He asserts that rich people are unhappy, but concludes that the everyone would be happier if they were rich.The writing at times is over-the-top, especially when he gets on some of his favorite rants. Here's an example:\\"Yet the realization that not just a few, but many of those at the top of Western society were cackling as they counted their gold and the poor wept tells us that we have come nowhere as far as we thought\\"Ultimately his conclusion is that were will all be happier if we forsake our worldly possessions.

His asssertions are well researched, with hundreds of footnotes to support his claims. Half of his message comes across loud and clear: that living standards have improved by leaps and bounds for much of the world throughout the 20th and 21st centuries. We learn all sorts of feel-good facts about improvements in crime, pollution, poverty, freedom, conflict, health and income, among others, enjoyed by those in the West. The other half of the argument isn't so well supported, namely, that \\"most men and women feel less happy\\" today. Admittedly, this is a more difficult assertion to prove. The case is made early in the book, and then we move on.\\"The Progress Paradox\\" has some compelling points to make. The whiny westerner, at whom this book is targeted, could certainly be well served by a splash or two of perspective with his morning latte. Point being, that which we gripe about today pales in comparison to the problems faced by our predecessors in the West, and by our contemporaries in the developing world. Fair enough.Speaking of gripes, I took issue with the author's preachiness in delivering his message. It was like watching a nature show, where you're made to feel guilty because of the plight of some soon-to-be extinct creature. In Easterbrook's case, he chides his readers for not feeling good enough about the good stuff, and not doing enough to fix the bad stuff. Wow, that's a lot to be held accountable for. It's no wonder that I'm feeling kind of down ...."},{"Title":"The Progress Paradox: How Life Gets Better While People Feel Worse","review":"There have been some excellent environmental science books written in recent years. Gregg Easterbrook has now stood on the shoulders of these authors with his brilliantly informative work, The Progress Paradox.While I have found Easterbrook's past writings to be aligned more with the pro-government left than with free minds and markets, this book is definitely fair and balanced, with philosophic inputs that are wonderfully thought-provoking. Were it to be required reading around the world, billions of dollars would no longer be spent on foolish regulatory programs. Perhaps as much could be saved on psychologists trying to lift people from depression, and millions of lives could be saved as we redirect our time, energy, and funds to concerns that have real, rather than hypothetical, effects on people worldwide.I have often disagreed with Easterbrook on many issues and believe he continues to exhibit unwarranted concern over greenhouse gases and global warming, but nothing is perfect. The Progress Paradox, however, comes close.As many readers of Environment & Climate News will recall, I review many more books that make travesties of science than those that contribute significantly to it. This is clearly among the latter. The Progress Paradox ranks among the 10 most important books I have read in the past 20 years.Easterbrook recounts, in smooth journalistic fashion, nearly all that is right with the world with respect to air, water, soil health, life expectancy, crime, education, and economic growth, while cogently explaining why good news rarely attracts attention and precisely who is to blame. I quote from his work below.Health\\"Most of the rise in health care spending stems not from the prices of medical goods and services, most of which have been declining in real dollar terms, but from increased utilization. The population is aging, and the aging require more care than the young.\\"\\"Public health is improving by nearly every measure, including rising longevity and falling rates of most diseases; even many forms of cancer are in decline.\\"\\"At the beginning of the twentieth century, the average American life expectancy at birth was forty-one years. ... [B]y the beginning of the twenty-first century, the typical American life expectancy at birth had risen to seventy-seven years.\\"\\"By the year 2000, U.S. incidence of heart disease was 60 percent lower, adjusted for population increase, than in 1950; Incidence of stroke deaths fell 70 percent in the same period.\\"Environment\\"Doomsday claims to the contrary, environmental trends are nearly all positive, with all forms of pollution except greenhouse gases in steady decline in the United States and the European Union.\\"\\"Twenty-five years ago, only one-third of America's lakes and rivers were safe for fishing and swimming; today two-thirds are, and the proportion continues to rise.\\"\\"Boston Harbor, whose filth was ridiculed in a political commercial that was pivotal to the 1988 presidential election, now has water so clear that revelers do ceremonial New Year's Day dips.\\"\\"Since 1970 smog has declined by a third, even as the number of cars has nearly doubled and vehicle-miles traveled have increased by 43 percent.\\"\\"Acid rain has declined by 67 percent, even though the United States now burns almost twice as much coal annually to produce electric power.\\"\\"During the 2000 presidential election much was made of the fact that Houston had taken over Los Angeles as the nation's \`smog capitol.' Hardly anyone added that this happened during a period when Houston smog diminished.\\"\\"Rocky Mountain Arsenal, outside Denver, where nerve gas was once made and a location regularly described ... as \`the most toxic place on earth' has been a National Wildlife Preserve for ten years: eagles and other biologically delicate species now thrive there.\\"Agriculture\\"Modern high-yield farming is a marvel, filling the granaries of the Western nations with an annual abundance of fruits, vegetables, and cereals at prices generally lower, in inflation-adjusted terms, than in the 1950s.\\"\\"Modern ranching provides equally impressive quantities of excellent high-protein beef, pork, and poultry, at affordable prices, plus affordable aqua-farmed salmon and other fish.\\"\\"Genetic engineering of crop plants promises foods grown with fewer chemicals, containing less fat and more protein, the elimination of allergens--that is, peanuts to which no one is allergic.\\"\\"Crop failures have become unheard-of, while erosion and soil loss to wind have declined--the Dust Bowl, it is important to recall, occurred before the widespread adoption of high yield farming, which has since prevented any dust-bowl effects, even during drought years.\\"\\"Genetic engineering of crops appears safe, with many studies including by the National Research Council, an affiliate of the National Academy of Sciences, having found no dangers in genetically modified plants.\\"Why We Don't Hear the Good NewsThe foregoing litany of feel-good data, presented by Easterbrook with solid supporting references, is but the tip of the informative iceberg you will find between the covers of this book.But what is far more important is that Easterbrook understands why the public is not generally told these things, and he explains it with amazing clarity. His most telling examples deal with distorted fundraising rants from environmental advocacy groups and political parties as well as the media's inviolable rule that says, \\"if it bleeds it leads.\\" Good news, if printed at all, can be found at the bottom of page 18.\\"[M]ost contemporary fund-raising turns on high-decibel assertions that everything's going to hell,\\" writes Easterbrook. \\"It is not, but because fund-raisers have grown so adept at targeted marketing, their contaminated messages surround us nonetheless.\\"\\"Environmental fund-raising is telling as an example of the money being at the extremes. The steady environmental improvement in the United States should be a subject of national pride--there ought to be crowing about how activists, government officials, business managers, and average citizens worked together to overcome an \`insoluble' problem without penalty to national prosperity. ... But there is no money to be made in harmony. Environmentalists and Democratic candidates can raise funds by crying environmental doomsday, so it is doomsday they cry.\\"If you also have wondered why so many prominent people in entertainment and of wealth appear always to be wringing their hands over one desperate crisis or another, Easterbrook says there appears to be a conditioned desire felt by the privileged to look with disdain at the societies that permit the favored lives they lead.Among fundraisers, politicians, environmentalists, and the elite classes, concerns always constitute a \\"crisis.\\" There would appear to be no modest problems. All thrive on bad news, regardless how exaggerated or fraudulent it may be. As a result, we get a constant distortion of the country's faults and little if any discussion of what's right with the world. Sadly, few of us are able to differentiate fact from fiction in this sea of gloom and doom.The news media is a most willing collaborator in all of this. They adore the word \\"crisis\\" and use it as often as they can.\\"[I]t's one thing to highlight when the bad happens--as they should,\\" Easterbrook points out, \\"and another to pretend that the good does not happen, as they also do.\\"Lately, with most actual events being mainly positive, the media has become obsessed with the bad things that \\"might\\" happen. Easterbrook documents these situations in a manner that cannot help but make the reader finally understand the \\"big picture.\\"An excellent example is his explanation of the minor panic the media caused when the President delayed a decision to reduce the 50-year-old arsenic standard for drinking water. We were led to believe by the media, egged on by the anti-Bush crowd, that each day the standard was not lowered to 10 parts per billion would mean countless Americans could perish. In fact, however, not a single death attributable to arsenic poisoning occurred during the half-century the 50 parts per billion standard was in effect.Similarly, Easterbrook's telling of how the media and environmental activists have distorted the totally positive impact of biotechnology on agriculture will take your breath away.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Jay H.

K. ChestertonGregg Easterbrook is a really smart guy and he wants you to know it. As a result, \\"The Progress Paradox\\" is crammed with information. Each main point is backed by a deluge of statistics, but on top of that there are diversions, and each diversion in turn gets its own statistics. Hence you'll be reading about the banking system and suddenly you'll get a lecture on high fructose corn syrup. Or perhaps you'll be exploring trends in pesticide usage and suddenly he'll take a side turn into Enlightenment philosophy. That's not to say this book lacks organization. If anything, it has too much organization. Easterbrook wants to include every single trends that's happening in America or the world this decade, and make them all fit together. The point (or points) get lost in the shuffle.The point, or at least one of them, is that in material terms, life is remarkably good for us right now. We are the first civilization in history that never suffers from shortages. We have enough food, water, clothing, fuel, and almost everything else. Even compared to fifty years ago, our circumstances have gone up quite a bit. We have bigger houses, safer cars, more decadent food, more entertainment options, and just more and bigger everything. On this topic, Easterbrook is right on the money.He's on slightly shakier ground when claiming that all aspects of life are improving, including health, education, and morality. For instance, his claims about rising intelligence rest solely on IQ scores. Experts have known for decades that IQ scores are not the end-all of intelligence. Looking to other areas, such as scientific and cultural literacy, there are reasons to be concerned. (See Mark Bauerlein'sThe Dumbest Generationfor further discussion.) Likewise on morality, Easterbrook focuses mainly on drugs and alcohol. He makes an arbitrary declaration that less drinking means improved morality; some would beg to differ.The other definite point, though, is that whatever improvement have occurred have not made us happier. While acknowledging that the measurement of happiness is somewhat shaky, he amasses evidence that Americans are no happier now than in the 50's. Moreover, mental illnesses such as unipolar depression and autism are on the rise. Why?In explanations and solution, Easterbrook fairs much more poorly. Again, one problem is that he wants to talk about every possible cause for unhappiness: obesity, crass materialism, low minimum wage, high divorce rate, corporate greed, and a dozen others. Undoubtedly all play some role in the phenomenon, but there's no attempt to separate out the truly important ones. He does acknowledge some remarkable evidence that old-fashioned virtues such as forgiveness and gratitude may be vital for mental health. But for all that, the only solutions that he offers are all materialistic: higher minimum wage, universal health care, and more free trade.Missing from the book is any hint that if more material things haven't made us happy, less material things might be the way to go. Perhaps the answer can't be found in government policy, but only in change at the personal level. Perhaps only when people voluntarily choose to make due with less than what they might have can they truly stop wanting more. Of course, that sort of solution would pose obvious problems for anyone who edits The New Republic and The Atlantic Monthly. Those magazines are built around the assumption that only big government and big business can solve problems. But look at the bright side: there are two material things that many Americans have given up on in the past couple years: subscriptions to The New Republic and The Atlantic Monthly."},{"Title":"The Progress Paradox: How Life Gets Better While People Feel Worse","review":"I thought the book started off quite well explaining how things are much better off than people thing.

Easterbrook's thesis just seems very apropos to contemporary American life today where the seemingly exponential societal progress is being questioned (even if just in those rare quiet moments) against the stress and work that so much stuff and accomplishment require.It's packed with information: remarkable stuff that highlights how much development and change has happened in recent decades and that shows that we live in the best of times; sobering stuff about the pain and sadness that remain, and the horrible issues that remain to be addressed (or that have arisen because of societal change and development); insightful stuff that digs into why such things are happening and where the lack of happiness - for we're collectively feeling worse - are coming from.In the end, gratitude, forgiveness, and remembering the greater good rise to the surface as corrective attitudes and behaviors. Easterbrook, a Christian, maintains that religion isn't necessary for these traits. Whether that's accurate or not, our society would be wise to listen to him."},{"Title":"The Progress Paradox: How Life Gets Better While People Feel Worse","review":"The author does a great job at making his point, showing statistically how things have changed over many generations, but yet life has not necessarily improved. My big nit with this book though is that the author couldn't possible write like he talks; if he did, few would understand him. I find too often that non-fiction writers go for the gusto when trying to flower up their work with words requiring a dictionary to understand; this author did just that. I felt the author could have used a lighter and more humorous prose to get his points across, but instead made the book a klunky read. In all though, this book serves as a great wake-up call to those caught on life's treadmill, wondering what in the heck they're running toward."},{"Title":"The Progress Paradox: How Life Gets Better While People Feel Worse","review":"During these times of divisive politics it is important to remember that men of good faith will differ. Many of us want the same things for the world, but disagree on the best way to acheive them.Those who believe that the good things of this world should be enjoyed by all people must read this book. It presents strong evidence that the gloom and doom picture painted by much of the popular press is not consistent with the facts. Things are not only getting better, they are getting much better for much of the world. The environment is getting much cleaner, and poverty is diminishing. Contiued progress is not acheivable through government regulation, but through the creative energies of productive individuals.Read this book, see the evidence, decide for yourself."},{"Title":"The Progress Paradox: How Life Gets Better While People Feel Worse","review":"This book is an antidote to daily headlines.I would never have guessed that there werepositive trends happening,underneath all the strife."},{"Title":"The Progress Paradox: How Life Gets Better While People Feel Worse","review":"I know there are a lot of naysayers out there, but I found this book very interesting and would recommend it to anyone. Some people just don't want to hear the positive news about life (a media conspiracy?), but for those who want a more positive perspective, I think Easterbrook has done a very good job of making the case that we have much to appreciate and be grateful for. Especially in these days when the news from Iraq is so discouraging, I believe this is a very worthwhile and well-reasoned book."},{"Title":"The Progress Paradox: How Life Gets Better While People Feel Worse","review":"I want to focus on the phrase &quot;even-handed&quot; ..... using a well-researched array of facts, Easterbrook comments on how well American society is doing (1st half of the book), while also pointing out what he feels are shortcomings of our wealthy nation (2nd half). Today's societial debates are often made in shades of black (Gloom and Doom) and white (All is Well). Easterbrook provides a fact-based look at why he thinks things are a shade of gray ... society's made tremendous progress, but we shouldn't feel satisfied. His arguments for a national health-care system (historically a progressive idea, although a view held by some conservatives) are well-thought out, don't use the usual rhetoric, and overall, IMO, comprise the most interesting chapter in the book.Seconding other opinions ... the book is not difficult reading, and occasionally rather humerous. Overall, a unique perspective on things and worth a read from the open-minded."},{"Title":"The Progress Paradox: How Life Gets Better While People Feel Worse","review":"This is an excellent book that dismisses many cultural myths that are increasingly embedded in the minds of the masses. It is a well known fact that bad news sell better than good ones. The media and the press have exploited this fact excessively for many decades.According to what one reads in the paper, magazines, and books the American middle class is loosing ground. The U.S. is falling behind foreign competitors on many counts. Globalization is bad as it costs US jobs. There is a rapidly growing poverty stricken underclass.Gregg Easterbrook actually studied the demographic and economic data and concludes that the statements mentioned in the second paragraph are plain wrong. The truth is that the U.S. economy is growing, and its labor productivity is the envy of the World. With faster labor productivity we have a faster rising living standard in the U.S. than in Japan and Europe. The U.S. has benefited tremendously from globalization and free trade, as it has been able to replace any low-income jobs by much higher income ones. In summary, the U.S. economy is the envy of the World and so is our living standard.Greg Easterbrook further makes his case that our current generation in our current time has it better than any of our American predecessors. Our middle class is not shrinking, it is growing. Similarly, the poverty stricken underclass is shrinking. Our living standard on all counts has risen tremendously over the past century. Homeownership has risen, so as car ownership, and the ownership of increasingly more practical home appliances. The level of innovation in our society is unprecedented, and makes it for a much more exciting, yet comfortable, and convenient society to live in.Greg Easterbrook's style makes it for a very pleasant and easy reading experience. If you are interested about building a portfolio of sound arguments for political, and intellectual debates buy this book. You will be that much more informed and smarter than your friends who have not read it."},{"Title":"The Progress Paradox: How Life Gets Better While People Feel Worse","review":"When asked which time period in America's history was the best, most people would respond with &quot;the 50's and 60's were the best, the good old days.&quot; That era does seem pretty perfect today, because the majority of Americans today feel unhappy and unsettled. The 50's would seem ideal, because their standards of living, and goals were totally different.Gregg Easterbrook has written an excellent book that shows how almost all aspects of life have improved drastically, yet most people are unhappy. This book was definetly worth reading, and it opened my eyes to things about our country that I had never even considered. One of the most fascinating parts of the book was when Easterbrook talks about how the media has impacted our state of happiness. Since the beginning of America, the media has influeced our perceptions of current affairs. After watching a couple hours of TV, a person most likely has an overwhelming sense of dread from all of the crime, violence, terrorism, and economic doom that seems to be waiting just around the corner. Every other medication commerical is designed to show us how depressed we really are, and how we need the anxiety medication to calm our worries and fears.Easterbrook devotes entire chapters to prove how life for the majority of Americans has improved, yet they're unhappy. He provides multiple theories as to why this occurs, including the &quot;paradox of choice,&quot; which means that all of the choices and opportunities we have today create additional stress. Another theory was &quot;the revolution of satisfied expectations,&quot; which means that most people pretty much have what they need. But they will never have everything that they want. To be happy in the 50's would mean you had a house in the suburbs and a car to drive to and from there- the expectations have greatly increased.Easterbrook combines facts, humor, and a nicely flowing style of writing that made this book very enjoyable to read. I'd highly recommend this book as it was one of the few non-fiction books I've read that truly made me think and evaluate my life."},{"Title":"The Progress Paradox: How Life Gets Better While People Feel Worse","review":"I thought the book does a great job of pointing out the ways in which things have been getting better for the average American/European. It is simply astonishing that people try to deny what is obvious. In the last chapters, Easterbrook delves into a prescription for the future of the US. Higher minimum wages and controls on &quot;perposterous CEO paydays, along with universal health care coverage. This seemed a little strident at times especially with regard to the CEOs but his ideas are reasonable and caused me to reconsider my positions."},{"Title":"The Progress Paradox: How Life Gets Better While People Feel Worse","review":"Liberals are dour and gloomy by nature. You know the routine: the earth is heating up like a Toast-R-Oven; a hundred million children don't have health insurance; the fundies are taking over the school system; we're bombing every third-world country except Darfur; no one likes us.Then Easterbrook comes out with this book, and for a moment you think: \\"Wow! A liberal can be an optimist!\\" But then you read a little further, and discover that's not the case.First the optimism. This first part of this book is a welcome antidote for the Paul Erlich-esque hand-wringing, doom-and-gloomism constantly being showered on us. Some of the book's better points include:* \\"Many figures in philosophy, religion, politics, and other fields have recommended that others pay no heed to material concerns, while being obsessed with the same things themselves\\" (p 145). Excellent point, and for a very engaging expansion of that point, read Paul Johnson's \\"Intellectuals.\\"* \\"On its face, existential despair appears self-canceling: If life really is pointless, why bother to get upset about that? Wouldn't getting upset be pointless?\\" (p 253).* By and large, things are getting better, not worse. We live longer, are richer, healthier and have more comfortable lifestyles than our ancestors.However, the liberal's trademark pessimism, distortions, fear-mongering, political correctness, nanny-state policy preferences and plain old errors of fact then return -- with a vengeance.* At its core, the book is contradictory, and exposes the problem liberals have with optimism. Easterbrook appropriately harps on the fact in the first 150 pages that astounding progress has been made in an absolute sense. For example, a car made today emits only 2% of the pollutants of a car made in 1970. But particularly at the end of the book, Easterbrook throws this all away and begins berating us for problems that exist in a relative sense, something he spends the first part of the quite correctly scoffing at. Easterbrook then reverts to type, producing a glaring series of unchecked, unabashed, big government, we-know-what's-best-for-you liberalism: mandated universal health insurance (pp 255-257); elimination of SUVs (pp 92-93); increase in the minimum wage to a \\"living wage\\" whatever that is (pp 260-263); Bush-favors-the-rich bashing (p 247); CEO bashing (pp 266-277); subsidized housing for drug addicts (p 259); more foreign aid (p 309). And when he says that in the U.S. \\"millions of people not only have more than they need, but have, in many ways, more than is good for them\\" (p 258), then you should, as Robert J. Ringer would say, \\"Hold on to your chips,\\" because he's coming after them with a vengeance.* \\"Until the day when everyone is released from basic want, a sword will hang over Western abundance\\" (p 68). This from the guy that complains about \\"amplified anxiety\\" (p 111). Who will wield this sword anyway? And exactly who is going to \\"release\\" the whole world from basic want, how are they going to get the money to do it, and how are they going to force the leaders of other countries who may not be too concerned about releasing their citizens from want? This sounds like the basis for Rudyard Kipling's most famous poem. Also: is freedom from want all that's causing a sword to be held of Western civilization's head? Was Mohammed Atta poor?* \\"A reason Western economies keep performing better may be that capitalism has been supplanted by market economies\\" (p 67). In response to that non sequitur, I would only ask, What kind of economy existed during capitalism then?* SUVs are unsafe because an SUV is \\"more likely to harm the passengers in a car it collides with\\" (p 93). To *that* non sequitur, I'll only ask: What vehicle do *you* want to be in when you get into an accident?* \\"But the mid-1990s rise of road rage coincided with the onset of SUV mania\\" (p 94). No. Having lived in L.A. in the late 1980s, I can definitively refute that asinine comment.* In the 1990s culture wars, \\"the right claimed the left was...opposed to reading of the classics\\" (p 103). Yes, that's absolutely correct. The Right *was* saying that and it *was* happening. For instance, anyone remember the $20 million Bass Grant controversy with Yale? Hmm?* \\"Each of the three Die Hard movies...depicted dozens of police officers being gunned down\\" (p 115). Now this is a supposed fact that we can easily verify for accuracy. Let's see: counting the two special agent Johnsons, the helicopter pilot and two cops in the armored vehicle (\\"What do we have here...it seems the police have themselves an RV\\"), and three SWAT team members, that comes to a grand total of eight police officers killed. Add in the two rent-a-cops in the beginning of the movie just to be generous, and you're talking ten. Not exactly \\"dozens\\" is it? How can Easterbrook expect to have us take him seriously on the big facts when he can't get the small ones right?* \\"...luck is simply part of life, but [we] should acknowledge this means that those who experience good luck acquire significant obligations to those who do not\\" (p 154). Uh-oh. That sounds too much like a Dick Gephardt \\"lucky in life's lottery\\" line, which is a set-up for a soak-the-rich line. Easterbrook casually tosses this out without a discussion of premises (how exactly does one \\"acquire\\" an obligation to another person whom you have never met and who lives thousands of miles away?) as well as its practice (who is to distinguish luck from unequal effort?).* \\"When free-market conservatives begin to suppose that something beyond the free market is necessary for human happiness, a threshold has come into view\\" (p 250). First off, is there such a thing as a free-market liberal? I can't think of one. Second off, I know a straw man when I see one. Conservatives, by definition, constitute the group that understands the importance of religion and culture, and not just free trade.* When the U.S. based troops in Saudi Arabia, we were \\"asserting suzerainty over much of Islam's oil wealth\\" (p 297). Does a religion have oil? Doesn't it belong to the state, or the people living in that country? If we were asserting suzerainty (power, authority) over Saudi Arabia's oil, how come we were buying it instead of expropriating it? How do a bunch of troops stationed far out in the desert, away from everyone, assert power over a country bigger than the size of Alaska? Is oil cheap now? If not, then why not, if we control Saudi Arabia? Didn't we station troops in Saudi Arabia because one Mohammedan country attacked two others, including Saudi Arabia?* American agents picked the current Saudi ruling family \\"with oil interests in mind\\" (p 297). As for who got picked and why, I encourage Easterbrook to brush up on his pre- and post-WW I history. America didn't pick them (the House of Saud has been prominent for over 250 years) and hadn't been discovered when Abd al-Aziz ibn Saud finally consolidated his power in 1932. Easterbrook literally couldn't be more wrong.* Mohammedan terrorists are compared to Timothy McVeigh: \\"the Christian ethos spawned its share of hideous killers, among them the terrorist Timothy McVeigh\\" (p 299). Unlike Easterbrook, apparently, I was alive and awake after 9/11, and the silence of the imams in America was deafening. Does Easterbrook think we don't know the difference between a nutjob like McVeigh and a current of religious thinking with tens of millions, perhaps hundreds of millions, of adherents? Besides, when exactly did McVeigh say that Jesus told him kill all those people? Superficial, glib and sophomoric comparisons just make you look like a hack, an apologist or an fool.Overall, I have to give the book three stars because it gores so many of the left's sacred cows. You just don't find that in mainstream books, and it has to be recognized. But this achievement is marred by careless, counterfactual and inconsistent writing, and by a steady stream of liberal clich&eacute;s. Easterbrook's no happy liberal warrior."},{"Title":"The Progress Paradox: How Life Gets Better While People Feel Worse","review":"This book is eloquently written, with a subject that is both inspiring and troubling. Mr. Easterbrook writes about how today's population is gaining in many indicators of quality of life, yet seems to be declining in our ability to gain happiness. It's a book that will appeal to many different audiences, not just the Washington policy wonk crowd. It really makes you think about the meaning of our lives, and what we can do to make ourselves happier and America a better place for all. Plus, there's even some humor in it, which is always a plus."},{"Title":"The Progress Paradox: How Life Gets Better While People Feel Worse","review":"Mr. Easterbrook makes a very convincing argument that those of us who live in the developed nations are part of a world that would be considered the utopian ideal by persons from past generations--even very recent ones. But after laying out all the facts the book just kind of stalled. Assuming that the author was preparing to argue an hypothesis about the effects of progress on individuals and civilization I kept waiting for the book to draw some inferences about the future or to make a more detailed argument about how to deal with the advance of civilization. What efforts by individuals and societal initiatives are the most rewarded by individual satisfaction and positive overall results?Perhaps the book's flaw was that the first part of the work cited to specific research showing how civilization has resolved many of its problems but then shifts into a much more general argument that the remaining problems can be solved if everyone decides to cooperate and play nice. I was hoping to see many more specific recommendations.I still give the book 4 stars based upon the great first half and would not hestitate to recommend the book as a counterargument to the typical doom-and-gloom philosophy that is a staple of the op-ed page."},{"Title":"The Progress Paradox: How Life Gets Better While People Feel Worse","review":"This book does a masterful job of describing how most people in the West have enjoyed dramatically improved living standards in almost any category (for example: longevity, health, possessions, education, freedom, safety from violent crime) -- but are no happier to show for all this progress. It is well written, convincing, and definitely struck a chord with me.I chunked this book into two parts. The first part makes the case for this inverse relationship between rising living standards and self-reported happiness (roughly the first 6 chapters). The second part makes a few recommendations for what we should do about it.For me, the first part of the book succeeds better than the second. The author does a great job making his case with anecdotes, illustration, and the perfectly chosen set of economic and social science studies. If you ever want to dramatically compare-and-contrast your lifestyle today with that of your grandparents' or their parents', this book is a must read.The second part of the book is less compelling. Mr. Easterbrook recommends concrete steps we should take in response to this \\"progress paradox.\\" Although his ideas are thought provoking, I found this part of the book less convincing than the first part.Having said that, I recommend this book enthusiastically. It's the best articulation of how \\"good\\" life has gotten but how that \\"goodness\\" is not translating into anything like real joy or contentment. I've recommended this book in my Sunday school classes as well as to co-workers, and they've found it thought-provoking as well."},{"Title":"The Progress Paradox: How Life Gets Better While People Feel Worse","review":"At one point the author mentions that the only things that modern people have had to give up in oreder to have better health, education, etc. are \\"quiet and natural beauty\\" It occurs to me that these two things may be essential to human happiness - maybe more important than good dental care or the Internet. I would like to see a book written on that topic."},{"Title":"The Progress Paradox: How Life Gets Better While People Feel Worse","review":"Easterbrook's compelling argument is that the more goodies we amass in the age of progress and technology, the more we become disgruntled, anxious, and discontent, to the degree that the world has come down with a universal epidemic of clinical depression. His book is an attempt to explain this paradox as it occurs in affluent societies. I think he succeeds though I doubt many will want to hear his prescription: Curb our appetites and stop hinging our happiness on materialistic acquisition.He does a good job of showing how our desires are insatiable because of something called \\"reference anxiety,\\" the need to always compare what we have to things that are constantly getting better than what we can acquire.His solution to our soul's greed and avarice is pretty much common sense: We should learn to forgive others; we should find a sense of community and purpose in our lives to fill the void; we should be grateful for what we have; we should find ways to reduce stress. While this may sound trite and full of platitudes, Easterbrook does an excellent job at the end of his book for refuting nihilism, the belief that there is no purpose in life, no right and wrong. He argues effectively that the very philosophers who claim that the world is a \\"cosmic accident\\" are the same people who push for human rights, improving the environment, and so on and as such their activism contradicts their claim that \\"nothing matters.\\" Finishing his book with a lecture on the importance of finding meaning and purpose, while being a bit predictable, is well articulated and said in a new and different way so that the book is still a valuable diagnosis and prescription of our modern woes and the manner in which we can find a way out."},{"Title":"The Progress Paradox: How Life Gets Better While People Feel Worse","review":"What is progress? Gregg Easterbrook looks at that question, showing that while we have \\"progressed\\" a great deal in a very short time; most of us are feeling worse about our lives.

It is such an easy read while providing not only amazing data but presented in a mezmerizing manner. A very provocative premise that flies in the face of what we are spoon fed every day about how the world is on the brink of destruction. It convinced me and was so refreshing. The only complaint I have is that I wish he would of sourced his book better and let us know where he is getting more of his information. He does start to moralize at times but it is not over the top and is to be expected. I found that he attempts to present the ideas from an objective political framework which is hard to find these days."},{"Title":"The Progress Paradox: How Life Gets Better While People Feel Worse","review":"This audio is entertaining and informative even though many of the conclusions are negative. The author looks at three decades of research that shows almost all aspects of Western life have vastly improved, but most men and women feel less happy than in the past. The Progress Paradox explores the reasons why ever-higher living standards don't seem to make us any happier. He also looks at humanistic &quot;positive psychology,&quot; which seeks to understand what causes a person's sense of well-being. Easterbrook makes a compelling case that optimism, gratitude, and acts of forgiveness not only make modern life more fulfilling but are definitely in our self-interest."},{"Title":"The Progress Paradox: How Life Gets Better While People Feel Worse","review":"easterbrook engagingly writes that, while everything may seem like it's getting worse every year, in the big historical sweep we are really living better than ever. paradoxically, happiness seems to have stalled out, and unhappiness seems to be increasing. he tosses out a number of theories about why this is, and how we might fix it. i have many criticisms of this book, including the \`fast and loose' use of hundreds of interesting statistics, the failure to assemble his data into a rhetorically tight and compelling argument, an occasional tendency to slip off topic into somewhat personal rants, and the final third of the book seems a bit scattered and off-topic. yet despite all that i have to say i found nearly every paragraph interesting reading, and still really enjoyed it for taking up a challenging and provocative topic in a lively way."},{"Title":"The Progress Paradox: How Life Gets Better While People Feel Worse","review":"This is an excellent, well-researched and uplifting book.

This so-called \\"writer\\" and \\"columnist\\" is about as capable of informing the public as politicians are capable of telling the truth. Very little research , if any at all, is done on Mr. Easterbrook's part in any facet of his work. To mask his apparent lack of credentials and knowledge in his subject areas, he'll heap upon the reader inside jokes and pop culture references in order to make himself seem witty and urbane, but frequently falls on his face due to the transparency in his writing. Mr. Easterbrook, if you're reading, let me put this in language you can easily understand. To quote Comic Book Guy: \\"Worst. Writer. Ever.\\""},{"Title":"The Progress Paradox: How Life Gets Better While People Feel Worse","review":"If I hadn't bought this book on line I might have read the blurbs on the back and noticed one of them was from George Will. He doesn't care for analysis and questioning. In that case I'd have been more wary of buying it.After reading the first chapter I can see that the book is a Neo-con's dream. Easterbrook packs the first chapter with endless anecdotes bolstered by vague, and thus misleading, statistics. He then has the audcity to mention how easily statistics are twisted.His point, with which he bludgeons the reader, is that life is getting better and better for everyone. His examples are entirely US centered. At one point he takes a few shots at Europe as a means of glorifying America, and he mentions that Europeans are far better off today than were their parents. He neglects to mention that their parents had to rebuild from the rubble of WWII.The anecdotes he uses to show how much better off \\"average\\" Americans are include such things as private aircraft and vacation home ownership. Discussing the latter Easterbrook shows his true bias by suggesting that it is \\"working class\\" people creating havoc on the lakeside with their noisy motorized equipment to the chagrin of older (that is, wealthy) residents.Finally he lets loose a few pot shots at that old favorite bugaboo, the dreaded liberal, in the midst of blaming the vast discrepancy in wealth in the US on immigration.It's extremely clear that Easterbrook is not out to explore a timely idea (the one implied by his title) with an open mind, but simply to preach and marshal support for the conclusions he's already made. This is a classic Neo-con method. This is also the secret to their ability to make common cause with the religious right. Neither actually seeks to discover the truth, but only to bolster and fortify the conclusions they've already decided upon."},{"Title":"The Progress Paradox: How Life Gets Better While People Feel Worse","review":"2500 years ago, Siddhartha enunciated the law of Dukkha,having realized how unsatisfactoriness is inherent in allsensory experience.

I still have no idea why I borrowed it. I have read Easterbrook's \\"column\\" online at ESPN and he continually fails to impress - hack theories that he presents with no evidence and writing skills comparable to a 6 year old writing ransom notes. He often follows up his story (I hesitate to call it journalism though I think he thinks that what it is.) with a rating of his favorite cheerleader for that week. Am I expected to take him seriously with an attitude like that? Well, thankfully I did not spend any money on this doorstop and, hopefully, I have prevented you from committing that sin as well.Oh, I had to give this a 1 star rating because the good folks at Amazon won't let me assign 0 stars or, even more correct, negative stars."},{"Title":"The Progress Paradox: How Life Gets Better While People Feel Worse","review":"Despite all of it's problems I enjoyed this book. Is the author arrogant at times? Yes. Is the author clearly a conservative christian (who makes an attempt at nonpartisanship)? Yes. For example, he singles out Hillary Clinton as a politician who acts contrary to her own words (she derided consumerism but purchased a $1.7 million dollar home apparently)...but couldn't this be said of many if not most politicians these days? Maybe I'm just cynical.The author makes the reader feel good by saying things are getting better all over the world by every standard basically. He uses statistics to back up many of his assertions although not all of them. I'm leery of statistics because I don't understand them very well and it seems authors often use them to back up their claims - even if two different authors have completely opposite claims - they will come up with statistics to back up their assertions.The author clearly is a fan of the philosopher Hegel (who was a celebrity in his own time) and not of Shopenhauer or Sartre. In fact he derides those who find Sartre's analysis of meaninglessness relevant, useful, or true. Ok, yes, the author is arrogant (hey, just like Hegel).There are some funny moments in the book - arrogant authors are often funny to me - such as when he discusses the work of a social scientist who worked for 20 years to figure out why more people weren't happy..and he never came up with any definitive conclusions. It turns out that when asked where they would rather live people from California and Kansas both said California even though both were equally as unhappy. Both groups thought that Californians SHOULD be more happy though :)This is a self-help book at times, which, since I purchased it in the Current Affairs section of Barnes and Noble was a bit of a disappointment. But, after I got over that I found the book to be surprisingly fun to read. The book actually reminded me a lot of Neil Postman's 'Amusing ourselves to death'."},{"Title":"The Progress Paradox: How Life Gets Better While People Feel Worse","review":"I found an interesting mix of both good and bad ideas in this book. Easterbrook is generally on track where he documents how far people in developed democratic countries have come from the historical lot of the rest of humanity. But he overstates how \\"affluent\\" we really are, because most of us have to depend on wage slavery and easy credit to try to buy the sort of lifestyle held up to us as normative by advertising and Hollywood. The U.S. per capita GDP of $30,000 a year simply cannot sustain that level of material consumption. In reality, the truly affluent people have plentiful incomes from sources that pay automatically regardless of one's health, race, behavior or other circumstances. Your annuity, trust fund or other wealth-holding instrument, unlike your boss, can't fire you. The rest of us, if we were financially responsible, would live extremely frugally on whatever wage income we earned because of the predatory nature of American life beyond the patronage of the wealthy.Easterbrook also identifies the ultimate futility of wealth once you have met your basic needs. Income correlates strongly with happiness when you're starving, sick, naked and exposed to the elements. But once you get a full belly, some healthcare, decent clothes and a comfortable place to sleep at night, the correlation breaks down. Happiness comes from sources like relationships, certain cognitive habits and a sense of \\"meaning,\\" which cannot readily be turned into commodities, though that hasn\`t stopped the self-help industry from trying. Finally wealth can't buy you freedom from aging and death, though Easterbrook puts in the disclaimer that science could provide even that some day.As for \\"meaning,\\" Easterbrook laments that many Western Europeans, especially, but also to a lesser extent educated Americans, have decided that they can't find it from religious beliefs any more. Easterbrook acknowledges that secular sources of meaning exist, without stating explicitly that a belief in god is unnecessary. Postulating a god doesn't solve the \\"meaning\\" problem any way, because many people find the conjectured \\"meanings\\" of life proffered by religion traditions absurd or offensive. Whole nations have changed religions in a generation or two with no apparent practical effect on net happiness, suggesting that religion isn't nearly as important as many people believe.In general I would like to see Easterbrook's book start a debate about the nature and uses of wealth in our society. Our economy has demonstrated spectacularly that it can produce literal mountains of junk food, unlistenable pop music CD's and novels about the antichrist. How about turning some of that productive potential towards things the world really needs, especially for the billions of have-nots who live little better than animals?"},{"Title":"The Progress Paradox: How Life Gets Better While People Feel Worse","review":"Easterbrook knows as much about having a better life as he does about football.

Please save your money and do not purchase this book"},{"Title":"The Progress Paradox: How Life Gets Better While People Feel Worse","review":"Two chapters into this book, I thought, &quot;wow, everyone should read this!&quot; Two chapters further, I wondered if the publisher had accidentally mixed pages from another book into my copy.The premise of &quot;The Progress Paradox&quot; is that all the gloom and doom forecasters are not only currently wrong, but have been wrong for generations. By every measurable standard, things are getting better, not just for Americans in general, but for the world at large. There is more prosperity, less hunger, a better environment, etc.The introduction, chapter one, and chapter two are true to this theme. They outline in remarkable detail exactly how our lives are better than those of our forebearers and what kind of work our ancestors had to do to make oure lives better. In chapter 3, Easterbrook outlines reasons why Americans fail to believe the proof before their eyes.But in chapter 4, he starts a high handed moral lecture. After telling the reader things are better, we should be more grateful for what we have, and we should learn to appriciate life, more, he then attacks the reader for not doing anything about poverty in America, for not insuring all American citizens, and for allowing hunger to exist in the world. Now, if Easterbrook had any suggestions, even ridiculous ones, this would not be so bad, but he goes from telling the reader &quot;everything is better than you think it is&quot; to telling the reader, &quot;no! I lied! Everything IS going to hell in a handbasket and it's ALL YOUR FAULT!&quot;This does not sell his initial message.He continues to lecture his middle class American readers (who can afford to spend $25 on a hardback book) about buying SUVs, talking on cell phones, and other technological advances he sees as nothing more than displays of immorality. After telling us that not only our lives are better, but the lives of the poor worldwide are better, he lecures us for not making massive governmental and sociatal sweeping changes - but never once suggests HOW we are supposed to do so.Somewhere towards the middle of the book, he starts referncing his belief in Christianity, then instructing &quot;good Christians&quot; on their moral duties. Towards the end of the book, he says people will be unhappy until &quot;the Lord returns to Earth.&quot; A book which started as a scientific analysis of progress and perception ends as a very unscientific sermon.Easterbrook insists the reader should personally cure AIDS in Africa, insure the American poor, eliminate world hunger, and all while working with international agencies. Other than sending a check to the charity of your choice, he never suggests HOW to enact these sweeping changes. Easterbrook insists to not do so is immoral, but average Americans who can not get more than a form letter in response from their senators are left with no suggestions as to how they can enact these changes.The end result is, instead of empowering the reader to feel good about our place in world history and offering reasonable suggestions for how we can help elliviate the suffering of others, this book turns into a moralistic lecture on hedonism. In the last chapter, he tries to sweep all the lecturing under the rug with a short happy ending. This defeats the book's alleged purpose.I would highly recommend the introduction and first two chapters, and would guardedly recommend chapters 11 and 12, but can not in good concience recommend this book as a whole."},{"Title":"The Progress Paradox: How Life Gets Better While People Feel Worse","review":"Progress has become the Pandora's Box of today; we live longer, eat better, have more things but are essentially unhappy. Our perception is that just as these great advances creep out of the box, so do their equally nasty counterparts. Easterbrook's new book confronts the disconnect between prosperity and happiness with many statistics, observations and conclusions. The major flaw in Easterbrook's book is the reach for the easy answer or starry eyed optimism about our ability to completely solve problems. Pessimism exists for a reason just as optimism does; they balance each other out like some bizarre ying and yang helping to provide meaning in our brief lives.On the whole, though Easterbrook's observations and comments are powerful and on the mark; we live in an age of enlightenment only to deny our ability to enjoy the outcome of progress. Easterbrook is most successful when taking a deep look at our inability to enjoy what we've worked so hard for but also his arguments for examining the pessisism and darkness that we've allowed to cloud our lives. While we live in a cynical world dotted with irony and sarcasm, we've allowed these very qualities which are useful in measured degrees to infect every aspect of our lives. While it may be fashionable to be all of these things to a large degree, it's also eroded our perception on the quality of our life. We no longer believe that good things happen to us without a price. We no longer believe that there's actually goodness in the world that can keep our darker nature at bay. These beliefs are essential for providing some sense of balance. If we believe the sky is always falling, then the vitality of our everyday lives is stolen from us.In effect, we've allowed the darkness to suck all the fun out of our lives. While some of us feel worse about the quality of life for many valid reasons (for example, mutlitasking hasn't improved the quality of work just the load that we can do), we've also dismissed the improvements we have compared to our ancestors. To give Easterbrook credit he doesn't shy away from the fact that we've yet to solve poverty, malnutrition or unemployement. He also acknowledges that disease continues to slip through our fingers just as we think we've got a solid grip on it.Easterbrook's book isn't always convincing--he sometimes goes for the easy answer when there may be no answer at all--but it does make compelling and thought provoking reading. Perhaps next time he can examine the state of humanity without getting lost in the statistics that rule and help undermine our sense of the quality of life. It would also be useful if he looked at what's causing the nihilistic hypochondria that's sweeping this nation. In many ways, we face challenges that are equally as daunting as those our great-grandparent's faced. While we may have antibiotics, science and nutrition on our side, we also have media that allows instant communication (like this forum)that can decimenate as readily as any virus or bacteria that killed our ancestors. We're overwhelmed with information which can be just as emotionally daunting as some of the issues that faced those before us. If Easterbrook wants to come to the table with solutions or suggestions to make us feel better, he needs to think them out a bit more and understand the consequences of the oversatured world we live in today."},{"Title":"The Progress Paradox: How Life Gets Better While People Feel Worse","review":"The Progress Paradox is not a perfect book. It can be repetitive at times, and Easterbrook can sound a bit preachy when discussing certain topics. Despite these small flaws the book is highly readable, often very enjoyable, and serves an important purpose. Easterbrook is an excellent writer and stays reliably non-partisan despite the politically charged nature of some of the topics he covers, making The Progress Paradox far more credible than the many left- or right-wing tomes currently clogging bookstore shelves.There are essentially three parts to The Progress Paradox. In the first part Easterbrook makes the case that life is indeed getting better. Through countless examples, some of which are truly stunning, Easterbrook methodically shows that in virtually every measurable way our lives are not just better, but significantly better, than they were a generation or two ago. This applies not only to personal indicators such as health, wealth, and leisure time, but also to larger geopolitical trends such as the spread of democracy.In the book's second act Easterbrook explains why, despite the overwhelming number of positive indicators, people tend to feel like things are getting worse. Easterbrook examines a multitude of causes ranging from simple biology to the media's obsession with bad news. Politicians, in particular, are demonstrated to have a vested interest in making sure that Americans think things are not going well.In the final portion of the book Easterbrook attempts to strike an upbeat note, giving the reader a host of reasons to believe the future is going to be even better than the present. While this is where Easterbrook most tends towards preachy, it is undeniably refreshing to read something positive about the direction in which we are all headed.Overall I found The Progress Paradox highly illuminating. In addition to being extremely educational, I think any reader will come away feeling better about their life and about the world in general. I can honestly say that I think the world would be a better place if everyone read this book."},{"Title":"The Progress Paradox: How Life Gets Better While People Feel Worse","review":"I began this book with high hopes, having enjoyed similar books (such as Malcolm Gladwell's \\"The Tipping Point\\") tremendously. But after the first two chapters, it became increasingly apparent that what I'd thought would be an objective consideration of middle-class discontent was simply an opportunity for Easterbrook to scold readers (and society at large) for their collective ability to stay on the sunny side.For an example of the logic you'll encounter in the book, consider this gem: at one point, Easterbrook argues that elderly Americans have no right to complain about the high cost of prescription drugs; after all, if those drugs didn't exist, seniors wouldn't be alive to complain.If you find this a compelling argument, you'll probably enjoy the book. If not, save your time for a more worthwhile read."},{"Title":"The Progress Paradox: How Life Gets Better While People Feel Worse","review":"Some revealing points documented with statistics. I find it interesting how seldom the proven points Easterbrook makes have been reported in our principle news sources. From ABC, CBS or NBC news and talk programs, we take away the distinct impression everything is \\"going to the dogs\\". Easterbrook offers solid arguments against this mindset.Newscasters can easily report from a biased view by omitting facts like Gregg reveals in the Progress Paradox. So, their stories often degenerate into propaganda. Such conduct was forbidden to news writers in previous years. That's no longer the case. One must now be on guard & question virtually every story lest we be misled.Having been a professional newscaster, I am struck and aghast at the mode of news delivery in 2006 versus our accepted code up through the 1970's. At that time, we reported all the pertinent facts and let listeners make up their own minds.I highly recommend the first half of Progress Paradox. However, the cures Easterbrook proposes in the last half sound a bit unrealistic. A big 5 stars for the first half - interesting reading. Maybe 2 for the last half."},{"Title":"The Progress Paradox: How Life Gets Better While People Feel Worse","review":"If you've ever felt discontent, read this book. If, like many people, you aspire to a higher standard of living, you may think that when you achieve that promotion, the big house, the money or even improved health - you'll finally be happy. Yet happiness rarely comes. That's because real happiness is never contingent - or even directly related to - possessions or achievements. Happiness is a choice. Despite all the choices people make daily, this is the one choice many do not make - or quite possibly do not know how to make. Ultimately, happiness is about feeling grateful for what you have and sharing your abundance with others. Author Gregg Easterbrook explains how and why this incredible paradox - that progress does not necessarily improve human happiness - is a problem for so many people today and why your best chance of achieving happiness resides in helping others. We are happy to recommend this book."},{"Title":"The Progress Paradox: How Life Gets Better While People Feel Worse","review":"Gregg Easterbrook sets a record within the first 40 or 50 pages by smashing virtually every urban legend of the &quot;everything is getting worse&quot; crowd that saturates our culture. His unbridaled sense of optimism is contagious, and the sheer magnitiude of our current health, peace and prosperity that he chronicles is stunning. His work is a lifeboat for anyone drowning in the sea of doom-and-gloom ink that radiates from every so called expert in our society. Just the first 50 pages alone are worth four stars!Yet Easterbrook goes farther to examine why after all our successes, we still cling to fears of any and everything. He offers a handful of theories that probably combine in one way or another to explain our constant anxiety and inability to see the good in our lives, and how on some level this may be a good thing (what an optimist!)This book doesn't have any political bent to it, but I imagine it really irritates anyone with that typical knee-jerk hatred of the United States, especially to see the incredible successes of this country in the last generation."},{"Title":"The Progress Paradox: How Life Gets Better While People Feel Worse","review":"This is the perfect book for that Scrooge or Pollyanna on your holiday present list! Mr. Easterbrook presents a thoughtful, reasoned assessment of the current quality-of-life in the United States and Europe and sets it in a global context. He details improved purchasing power, declining crime rates, increasing longevity and cleaning of the environment. Poverty, murder, pollution all seemingly unsolvable have begun to yield to pragmatic approaches. The message I found most useful and hopeful was that our current set of seemingly intractable problems, i.e. the greenhouse effect, terrorism, should not defeat us but rational efforts with honest reassessments may bring results. We can rejoice that our glass is half-full!!"},{"Title":"The Progress Paradox: How Life Gets Better While People Feel Worse","review":"Mr. Easterbrook makes a very convincing case that almost everyone is better off than their ancestors from even a generation ago. Incomes are up, most people own homes, we eat out lost, and education is available almost universally. From his evidence, you'd think that everyone would be turning cartwheels on the front lawns of their mansions, but the opposite is true. More and more people complain of stress, overwork and depression. Part of that may come from the fact that we are constantly striving to keep up with our friends and neighbors as they buy more toys and bigger houses to hold them. After presenting the evidence of better societal standards, Mr. Easterbrook switches gears and proposes ways for society to cure its remaining ills, including redistribution of wealth from the wealthiest and an agenda for raising the prospects of second and third world countries. As much as I agree with Mr. Easterbrook's ideals, he couldn't propose an agenda that would realistically accomplish them. At the end of the book, I concluded that I was fortunate to have the abundance of wealth and health that I do, but did not walk away with any idea how to reach the societal goals that Mr. Easterbrook values."},{"Title":"The Progress Paradox: How Life Gets Better While People Feel Worse","review":"I really enjoyed this book, and recommend it highly.

Easterbrook takes aim at this myth and picks away at it with incredible detail, painting a compelling argument that American life, and that of the world in general, has vastly improved in nearly every aspect over the past century. Personal wealth, the quality of education and medicine are up, while pollution, crime, race and gender inequality are all down. Interestingly, one of the only areas not to improve has been personal happiness, showing a disconnect between material prosperity and contentment.The reason for this disconnect is at the heart of \\"The Progress Paradox\\" with Easterbrook exploring several different theories from the media's bias for bad news, to choice anxiety that comes from people actually having too many choices then experiencing the stress of constantly wondering if they made the right one. Large portions of the book are spent understanding \\"positivie psychology,\\" or the reasons why some people seem to have a much easier time being happy, gracious and forgiving. While the book can at some times be a bit repetitive it is full of incredibly compelling statistics and studies that will change your current view of the world and how you relate to it."},{"Title":"The Progress Paradox: How Life Gets Better While People Feel Worse","review":"I thought this book showed what we already know, that the western world and technology has made our lives better and more convenient, yet we are more stressed and unhappy in the process.

It's filled with them throughout. That being said, the book was published in 2004, and many of the assumptions made in the beginning of the book are not as valid today. Additionally, I personally don't believe all of the statistical analysis presented in the book. However, I cannot refute it, because I don't have the time to research all of it.Mr. Easterbrook is big on Universal Health Care and wealth redistribution. He's also an advocate, in this book, for increased spending on US foreign aid. I'm not sure any of these three answers are really problem fixers. Furthermore, I don't think the US can afford at least 2 of these three ideas. Maybe we can after we fix the US economy and the falling value of the dollar.The point of the book is that we are all better off than those before us, and I believe that this point is valid and true. However, the book, for me, ended up becoming more of a \\"self-help\\" reading as the pages went on. This book became less enjoyable the more pages I read."},{"Title":"The Progress Paradox: How Life Gets Better While People Feel Worse","review":"In this work, author Gregg Easterbrook shares with us the many advances in living that America has experienced.

I loved all the little facts he told as he compared the past to the present concerning our living condictions, our health care and even the cars we drive. I felt it was very interesting, and very well constructed.It is true that the author does go off into how we should be helping the rest of the world, and surely that is true. However, I feel much is being done to help and still more will be done in the future, nothing can be accomplished overnight. Many open their hearts and their pocketbooks to the best of their ability every single day.In my opinion, with most people, if they have they are more willing to give. I know there are always those who are greedy no matter what, but basically I feel if one is comfortable in their life-style they are more open to help others.I felt this book was extremely interesting and I didn't feel any guilt trip concerning the 'haves' and the 'have-nots.'

He expands on all quality of life factors: health, product quality, choices, risks and finances. He documents the progress in Europe, Eastern Europe, the Asian tigers and China. He reaffirms the 1990's view that liberal democracy and mixed market capitalism have proven to be the best solution and will be embraced by all societies out of self-interest. The author reminds me of center-right Ben Wattenberg's statistical summaries in the 1970's.The author shares the various cross-time, cross-country and cross-income studies which show that increased well-being, above some moderate level, does not lead to improved happiness. If anything, median happiness is declining in the advanced economies. Easterbrook offers a dozen reasons, ranging from individual psychology to materialist cultures to institutional defects to self-interest. Most convincing is the idea that individuals compare their situations to others and to their own history, which leads to short-term happiness but long-term negative views. The author has a few improvement suggestions, including promoting the techniques of positive psychology to help individuals see progress.By focusing on the 50-100 year view, Easterbrook sidesteps the current debates about the role of increased income and wealth equality in the last 30 years on removing hope of progress for the middle class.Although he avoids this debate and chooses to not consider the farther left critiques of capitalism, materialism and powerful elites, Easterbrook does deliver a classic liberal conclusion, arguing that the reader and governments should invest more money and attention on the domestic poor and global economic development. The argument is based on equal parts of morality, opportunities and self-interest. It is not persuasive. It echoes the arguments of John Kenneth Galbraith 50 years ago in The Affluent Society.I do give the author credit for posing the big question, \\"given the progress of mankind and the limited improvement in happiness, what should society do?\\""},{"Title":"The Progress Paradox: How Life Gets Better While People Feel Worse","review":"Check out a podcasts on the book on EconTalk.No matter how optimistic you think you are, you will more than likely find yourself feeling a little defensive and suspicious at some of the statistics that he sites.

The Progress Paradox makes excellent observations about why \\"we live in a favored age yet do not feel favored, [and] what ... this paradox tell[s] us about ourselves and our future\\" (p. xx). It turns out material conditions are important but they are not deciding factors in human happiness. Everything is getting better, but even \\"the good news scares people\\" such that \\"more of everything\\" is either constant happiness level or even less happiness. \\"'Unipolar' depression ... is today ten times as prevalent as it was a century ago\\" (p. xvi). The average person is materially better-off today than a century ago; in the 1880s a work week was no less than 72 hours, leaving less than ten hours a week of leisure time. Today the work week is 35 hours on average in the USA and shorter than that in industrialized Europe. Yet measures of happiness remain invariant with respect to high levels of material possessions.The fact that high agricultural productivity has averted the ecological calamity that would surely have resulted from increasing demand to feed an exploding human population worldwide is scary good news. The fact that nearly all people, whether rich or poor, can afford a life of \`luxury' for themselves and their pets compared to their ancestors, the fact that even IQ indicators are rising, all this progress does not seem to matter for happiness. Hence, the author concludes that \\"stress ...is nature's plan\\" that prevents material wellbeing from translating into happiness automatically. The solution requires us to gain control of our minds, to look \\"beyond credit cards and SUVs,\\" and to \\"change our [own small] world\\" and then change \\"their [the large] world.\\" The author reminds us that \\"it's never too late\\" to do it all.Some of the questions that ran in my head as I read include whether too much material stuff is the trouble. What is the optimal level of material condition that would maximize happiness? Did increased leisure time mean more free time for trifles? Is unhappiness the real opportunity cost of having too much stuff? Would we be happier if we were just a bit poor?

The author bombards us with data and statistics, but some of them do not really support his arguments, especially his arguments that life is \\"better.\\" In fact, sometimes he revisits the same arguments to argue the opposite point that we should help make the world a better place (implying that it's not so \\"better\\" after all). Some examples:* Some examples struck me as not necessarily being better: people having larger houses and more cars and living out in the suburbs and having way too much to eat...* Some examples seemed not to illustrate the point at all:-- Test scores go up, so our kids must be better-educated. What if the tests are getting easier, as many believe?-- Deer populations are way up, with deer in suburban backyards being quite common; therefore, forests are healthier. Um, couldn't this be from lack of predators and erosion of habitat?-- We have plenty of resources, except for maybe fresh water in certain parts of the world (oh, just that). One figure he cites in support of this is that we have at least 40 years of oil left, at current consumption, with maybe twice that if we develop better extraction technologies. Not exactly comforting.Also, I have to disagree with his notion that the developed world needn't conserve resources, but that the developing world should be encouraged to use more. Even if you believe that we are not resource-poor, the suggestion that we do not need to cut down on our awful waste seems foolish.But I agree fundamentally with most of the rest of Mr Easterbrook's arguments. I kept rooting for him to support them more convincingly, but he let me down. Besides that, his writing is repetitive and circular, and his punctuation style would give Lynne Truss (Eats, Shoots & Leaves) fits.Nonetheless, I slugged my way through the book. It was a good exercise in recognizing lapses in logic, even in the face of lots of fancy and well-cited data. And it reaffirmed my desire to live a meaningful life.

I agree, for example, that cosmetic belly-button surgery (p. 121) is not appropriate, especially not at $5000 (and considering the other possible uses of such money in this world) but it seems as if Easterbrook's main goal is not to convince us to be reasonable in our needs and wants, but to enjoy making fun of people who, according to him, fail at this. He paints consumers of much more reasonable objects in the worst possible light, and seems to have fun doing it. For example, the title of the chapter in which he talks about the \\"blurring of needs and wants\\" (136) is called \\"Portable Carpeted Dog Steps,\\" not \\"Cosmetic Belly Button Surgery.\\" Portable carpeted dog steps are apparently the epitomic example of a ridiculously unnecessary excess of created need. \\"Another catalog offered me, for $99.95, a set of portable dog steps-small risers to be put next to the couch so that Fido can walk up onto the cushions, rather than exert himself by jumping\\" (135). I felt very upset when I read this. I don't think that Easterbrook was even trying to be charitable, must less creative. Just because some people could buy it for the reasons he describes doesn't mean that the product itself and the people buying it should be treated with such derision. There are little old dogs that are so weak and arthritic that they can't jump on the couch. They hobble over to the couch and look up at the cushions pathetically, thinking, \\"that's where I used to sit, but now I'm down here all alone.\\" The steps aren't about saving the lazy dog the effort of jumping, but rather are for dogs who can't jump and/or people who are too weak to pick them up. Deriding portable dog steps and (as a class) the people who use them is like saying, \\"Gee, those wheel-chair lifts are a really stupid product. People don't want to bother to exert themselves to go up the steps. Some busses that have lifts also have a special contraption to lower the steps at the front so the person getting on doesn't have to bother to lift their feet a foot and a half from the pavement.\\" No, actually, some people aren't that strong. Some people can't step a foot and a half in one step safely, and could fall under the bus.Easterbrook also vilifies all manner of \\"storage gimmicks,\\" which he thinks can be used only for making sure every available crevice of your house is \\"crammed with stuff\\" (142). In response to an advertisement for a storage rack that is designed to sit on top of a TV he says, \\"Presumably that way you could simultaneously look at television commercials and the available rack space atop the television and think how nice it would be to buy whatever was being promoted in the add and place the item onto the rack\\" (143). Very clever, Easterbrook. You are so clever that if you ever visit the home of anyone who doesn't have their TV remote, DVDs, and DVD player (yes, we get to have a DVD player, according to Easterbrook) on the floor next to their TV instead of in some sort of storage gimmick, then you will know that you are better than them!Easterbrook's rhetoric is primarily one of distain and scorn. \\"Then there are products that represent answers to questions no one asked. One catalog that landed at my doorstep this year offered, for $89.99, a gizmo that lets you know if you have an incoming voice call on a line being used to browse the Web. \\"How many important calls do you miss while you're surfing the Internet?\\" the blurb asked. None, probably, but since the device exists and can be acquired, some people will want it (135).\\" Actually, there are many circumstances where this would be an invaluable device. One child is researching a paper, and another child is out on a date with a person Dad isn't too sure about (or has really bad asthma, or is driving in the snow). Do we want to prevent child #2 from calling if there is an emergency, or forbid the date? No. Do we want to prevent child #1 from doing homework? No. Not to mention the needs of businesses, or of someone who just plain loves her friends so much that she wants to be available to them. There are any number of possibilities. Just because Easterbrook wouldn't have any important calls doesn't mean nobody does, and it certainly doesn't mean that as a class people who buy this thing are so stupid as to get it just because somebody says they need it.This mean attitude permeates every chapter of the book, and destroys a few good points and a lot of already bad ones, like when he says that there isn't really anything wrong with the environment."},{"Title":"The Progress Paradox: How Life Gets Better While People Feel Worse","review":"Greg Easterbrook informs readers that our perceptions of life today are wrong. By every objective measure such as life span, overall health, income levels, housing, luxuries, leisure time, etc., life is better today than it ever has been. So why aren't we happier than ever?The first few chapters explain how life is better than ever, which left me feeling quite inspired and grateful to have been born now vs. in the past. No matter how much we romanticize the past, life is just better today!Small personal note here, I think that I may disagree with him a little bit. I believe my parent's generation did do a little better than us. Almost everyone my age were kids when their parents were my age, and we remember our houses when we were kids being bigger, and generally having better vacations, cars, etc., then we can afford now that we are that age. But that may be peculiar to just my social circle.The following chapters discusses new problems brought about by improved living conditions, such as traffic, noise, feeling rushed, too many choices to make, etc. All are better to deal with than the old problems that had existed before. They also deal with why people, who are living better than 99% of the people who have ever existed, aren't happier than they are. Lack of spirituality, lots of spare time to be depressed, and a constant barrage of negative news seem to be the answer. This is one of the reasons I find it difficult to watch the news any more. It's 24 hours a day of terrorism, war, crime, death, global warming, and predictions of bad things that will come.The last couple of chapters is where Mr. Easterbrook misses the mark. He points out we still have serious problems like lack of universal health care and poverty. He is alluding that government should step in and solve these problems, not realizing he is contradicting almost everything prior in the book. Our lives have improved largely due to freedom and the marketplace allowing us to create and grow richer. Why does he believe gov't is the solution to these other problems? Why not turn the marketplace loose on these problems instead so people can find ways to enrich themselves by helping others?I also believe he doesn't explain what poverty is in the US today. If your family of four lives in a two bedroom apartment, with power, heat, tv and no one starving, does that sound like being poor? Well, that's how many poor families in the US live today. That lifestyle would be considered well off in much of the rest undeveloped world, and living very well considering the lives of people of generations past.Overall, I enjoyed the book and have become more appreciative of just how lucky we are today."},{"Title":"The Progress Paradox: How Life Gets Better While People Feel Worse","review":"The optimist says the glass is half full. The pessimist says it's half empty. Engineers think the glass is twice as big as it needs to be.This book comes very close to describing my outlook on human progress. In general, things are going pretty well. Ideologues on both sides of the spectrum have an interest in overstating our problems.The first half of the book is an interesting survey of how things have improved. Then Easterbrook goes into ideas on why people still report feeling bad despite all of this progress. Finally, he offers suggestions to solving what he sees as real problems -- poverty and spiritual emptiness.While this is the best book I've read on the subject, I will point out a few things I disagree with.1. Collapse anxiety -- Easterbrook says one reason people feel unhappy despite progress and affluence is fear that Western society as we know it will collapse and the prosperity will end. I don't think people are afraid society will collapse but rather that their lives will collapse. Easterbrook mentions how it's common to have one late-model luxury car per family member, plenty of gadgets, extra living space, and so on. To buy all of these things that are described as common, some people sacrifice planning for retirement, their children's education, or possible unforeseen illness or job loss. As a result, IMHO, they live in fear not of some cataclysm in society but rather of a minor bump in their life becoming a catastrophe due to personal debt and poor planning.2. &quot;Considering taxes, a person working full-time at the federal minimum would have to spend an *entire day's wages* to buy a $7 Au Bon Pain sandwich combo for lunch each business week. This simply is not right.&quot; - This is part of an anecdote Easterbrook tells about a woman who could afford to eat at McDonald's but not a more expensive place. He talks about access to high-end sandwiches as if he were talking about access to basic housing. Society will survive if people cannot buy a certain kind of sandwich. Many people spend years working at low-wage jobs and take classes in the evenings, bringing budget lunches and diners from home. Many of them eventually earn enough money to eat wherever they want. I'm all for society sacrificing to help these people succeed and get better jobs. But the fact that the worst jobs available don't provide enough money for luxuries is not a problem.3. Easterbrook believes that the solution to poverty is to find a way for the poor to consume as much as the rich. I think that in US the problem is that society is not built around the poor. Society expects everyone to have a certain level of affluence. This level of affluence is not sustainable for everyone in the US, and certainly not for everyone in the world. Therefore, I think people should strive to live simpler lives rather than produce more. I'm not suggesting a radical change. For example, if society weren't designed around personal cars, middle-class families with multiple cars could give up one car and save several thousand dollars a year. That's not trivial for a family earning the median income. If conservation and helping people in the community in need became key values, say as key as our value of maintaining corporate earnings growth each quarter, it would feel like our society is richer even if our GDP stayed the same.Apart from these points, I agree with Easterbrook completely. I highly recommend the book. It does a good job of showing how we have overcome problems once thought insurmountable and how our problems will be solved more easily than we think. The glass is not half empty, it's just bigger than it needs to be."},{"Title":"The Progress Paradox: How Life Gets Better While People Feel Worse","review":"This is a book I will be giving to a number of my &quot;favorite&quot; curmudgeons.

It's an interesting topic and the book raises some good points and observations.Having built a solid foundation demonstrating how well market economies have provided a higher standard of living and discussing the unexpected angst that has resulted, the book then veers off into a socialist agenda advocating class warfare against the rich, government control of markets, and massive government programs. All of this is hidden under a false flag of &quot;fairness&quot; improvements to the market system. While the early material in the book is well supported with studies and facts, the veiled political views are hyped with false analogies, hysterical language, hidden assumptions, and outright ignorance of basic economic principles.You could get the book and just throw it away after you've read the first half, but picking up a copy of P J O'Rourkes &quot;Holidays in Hell&quot; will provide a better read and a lot more insight into how the world really works."},{"Title":"The Progress Paradox: How Life Gets Better While People Feel Worse","review":"Finally someone isn't telling us the sky is falling!

I applaud Gregg and all of the big thinkers at The Brookings Institution for posing such a lucrative question. I BORROWED and enjoyed the book. I even felt somewhat optimistic by the end....I cannot argue that this book is scientific, moralistic, or any other perspective. The study of happiness is not now nor will it ever be a hard science. One thing I do know is that many of the leading \\"investigators\\" in this hot, new field come from an elite sector of our society: the Thinktank.WHY IS THAT?I DO NOT recommend buying this book, as by now you have already been bombarded by variations of its message through the mainstream media. However, I believe most readers will find this book interesting, and it will also help generate some important discussion.One reason more people are unhappy in the world today can be found in John Perkin's Confessions of an Economic Hitman: \\"The inside story of how America turned from a respected republic into a feared empire.\\" Why is the mainstream media not discussing this NY Times best-selling book?"},{"Title":"The Progress Paradox: How Life Gets Better While People Feel Worse","review":"As one who is growing to question our consumer culture more and more with each passing year, I was genuinely intrigued when I cam across &quot;The Progress Paradox.&quot; I think Easterbrook makes a valid case that, when looking at things with historical hindsight, we are in many ways better off than our ancestors. It is difficult to argue with his litany of improvements in health care, education, conveniences, access to information, etc. Given this, Eaterbrook then explores the issue of why so many of us appear to be more unhappy than our ancestors. He offers that our cultural experience of gratitude has eroded, and we simply have come to expect more, and appreciate less.This is well and good, but &quot;Progress Paradox&quot; fails in one glaring way. It paints a picture of the &quot;good life&quot; of the average U.S. citizen, but then sidesteps an important and idisputable trend -- over the last several decades, the U.S. has experienced unprecedented consolidation of wealth in the hands of the elite few. If the life of the &quot;average&quot; U.S. citizen is so good, then why shouldn't the wealthiest Americans be happy to embrace this lifestyle (with gratitude!) and joyfully pay taxes to help support the public good? I may be wrong, but my suspicion is that Easterbrook may be either intentionally or unwittingly helping the elite classes maintain their priveleged status. Focusing on how average Americans are better off than previous genertions may, in the end, be an effective way to deflect public consciousness away from issues of growing inequality.I am all for an &quot;attitude of gratitude&quot; -- provided that it is practiced by all, including the elite. If the average American lifestyle has so vastly improved over the years, then why should there be such a push towards hoarding more and wealth at the top, and doggedly defending tax cuts for the wealthy? In the year 1973, real (inflation adjusted) wages of American workers began to fall for the first time, and they have not kept pace with economic growth since. In the meantime, we now see a nation where the wealthiest one-percent own a whopping 40 percent of the available wealth. Globally, the top 200 corporations (out of 45,000 or so) pull in 25% of the profit from the world economy. So again I say, if &quot;average&quot; Americans never had it so good, then why the obsessive pursuit of more and more wealth at the top? I'll practice my &quot;attitude of gratitude&quot; when I see the wealthiest Americans saying, &quot;You know, we really CAN live comfortably and well with far less than we have -- By God, we have a key role to play in maintaining the public good, and we'll pay our taxes with a profound happiness in knowing that our legacy has been to improve the lot of others, and not dwell on our selffish interests.&quot; Now THERE'S a real &quot;attitude of gratitude!&quot;"},{"Title":"The Progress Paradox: How Life Gets Better While People Feel Worse","review":"Ayn Rand's followers and similar ideologues base their world view on an unscientific economic model which assumes that more wealth = more happiness. That assumption was plausible when economics began as a separate discipline in the 18th Century, when most people in Europe and the early United States were just unimaginably poor by today\`s standards, much like the inhabitants of today\`s dysfunctional lumpen-countries. And I can see how Rand would have found this idea personally appealing, early in the 20th Century, given her experiences as an adolescent girl and young woman during the horrible privations of the Russian Revolution and the early years of the Soviet regime.But 250 years of economic progress in Western Europe, the U.S. and offshoot societies have changed the look of things. Easterbrook provides overwhelming empirical evidence that this equation doesn't work once a nation's per capita GDP reaches about $10,000. After that level of income, wealth and happiness decouple so that we have, on the one hand, depressed rentiers who never have to work for the money they lavish on psychotherapy for their imaginary miseries; and on the other hand cheerful blue collar people who are grateful that they earn enough in wages week-by-week to provide for their families. (Easterbrook promotes gratitude as one of the pro-happiness virtues that short-circuits the wrong-headed equation of wealth with happiness.)So much for Rand's economic theory. Moreover, on pages 182-85 Easterbrook cites psychologist Martin Seligman's conclusion that four common American beliefs, which happen to be promoted by Rand's philosophy though Easterbrook and Seligman don't link them specifically to her, contribute to poor emotional coping strategies that often lead to unhappiness and depression. They are: individualism, self-esteem, victimology and excessive consumerism. Rand's advocacy of individualism and self-esteem are obvious, but she also presented a view of businessmen as a \\"persecuted minority,\\" and she and her followers uncritically celebrated the value of ever-increasing consumption despite all the problems that lifestyle causes. Several biographical accounts of Rand and her movement provide evidence that her philosophy in practice doesn't produce the beneficial results that her novels seem to promise. Easterbrook inadvertently strengthens the case against her, but from the field of the empirical social sciences, not to mention common sense."},{"Title":"The Progress Paradox: How Life Gets Better While People Feel Worse","review":"Great book full of interesting and thought-provoking analysis. Easty to read. I can see why this book might be controversial to gloom and doom types. I won't go into all the details, but Easterbrook outlines many major social and economic trends that are positive, contrasts them with declines in Americans' happiness, and then offers prescriptions for improving our contentedness as a nation. I found this to be a very positive read and would recommend it to those looking for a change in perspective from the talking head conventional wisdom."},{"Title":"The Progress Paradox: How Life Gets Better While People Feel Worse","review":"There is no paradox. Yes, modern Ameriacns are awash in material things, can't get enough of them, and are on a constant quest for more. Life is better, if by better we mean there are more things around. And, as we push aside all considerations in order to get more things, we necessarily give up the life of the spirit. You cannot devote every hour you are awake to getting more and better things without paying some cost. So, where is the paradox? I suggest that far from being a paradox, the unhappiness and the disgust with modern life is the corrolary of a life spend exclusively seeking material things. Ask the material girls and material guys.So, is life better? Or, do we simply have more things and better medicine? I do not propose that we give up these things that have made life easier and allowed us to live longer. And, I certainly do not agree with the Marxist-Leninist comment in the review \\"Illusory Affluance\\", which review suggests that if only we had the gulags and the inspired leadership of Stalin we would all have an equal amount of things and no one would ever be a \\"wage slave\\". I guess we could all just give up work under his theory, once we spread the abundance around evenly. We all know how well that worked in the Soviet Union.Here is where we confront the complete and total absence of a spititual dimension in modern life. As we have acquired more and more goods, we have moved farther and farther away from the life of the spirit. Today, it is safe to say that only material things count. In the midst of all this wealth, we have witnessed the growth of amoriality. Take your pick: do we live in a pornocracy, a tortocracy, a cultocracy, or a junkocracy? More people probably attend the church of Ebay and pray at the alter of a Porno twit than lead a life in which spiritual values weight equally with material ones.Thus the author has been kind enough to point out that material things abound around us, but that all this stuff and all this glamour has failed to make us anything but distressed and unhappy. It is no paradox."},{"Title":"The Progress Paradox: How Life Gets Better While People Feel Worse","review":"Quite repetitive. After the first dozen pages or so I get the point.

I am disappointed that the best reviewers got as far into the book as they did without noticing that the author spun many of the statistics to prove his point. He downplays the reality of poverty with false statistics. Recalling from memory, very close to the beginning of the book, Easterbrook states that the elderly no longer have to worry about being cared for. Perhaps he should have read Susan Sheehan's article in The New Yorker, \\"Not Poor Enough\\" which tells the true story about how the elderly are doing in this country. Has the author been to a state subsidized nursing home? He also strolled right over the problem of poverty with a completely false statistic about the number of children in the U.S. living under the poverty line. The list goes on and on. I was so impressed with the number of fallacies used to make his argument I started highlighting. My copy looks like Key West Christmas tree. How did the manuscript ever make it past the editor?I think this book is written to help the 1% at the top of the pyramid feel better about themselves. Let them eat cake? Coincidently, the book was given to us by the wealthiest people we know who also happen to live in one of the premier independent living centers in the NE.This book should be read as an example of fallacy in argument, and nothing more."},{"Title":"The Progress Paradox: How Life Gets Better While People Feel Worse","review":"The author is a senior editor of 'The New Republic' and a contributing editor of 'The Atlantic Monthly.\\" Yet, it was the review in January, 2005, 'The Saturday Evening Post' which let me know of its existence. It's another book about happiness (or lack thereof), only he stresses the paradox of how unhappiness and the rise of unipolar depression (condition in which someone always feels 'blue') are ten times as prevalent as fifty years ago.Paul Fain wrote in the local paper that this new branch of economics is called 'Happiness ecomonics.' His information shows that time with family and good health are the 'stuff of happiness.' The sad truth is that we're twice as rich as we were in 1957, but only half as happy. So, what else is new? He goes on: \\"of the family-related factors, marital status is the most critical. He claims that having sex once a week as opposed to once a month is equivalent to the amount of happiness generated by getting an additional $50,000 in income for the average American.\\" His research shows that sex is better for your happiness than money. That's not to say that being financially poor but sexually active is the secret to a happy life. Nowhere did he mention religion and faith in God.The percentage of Americans who describe themselves as 'happy' has not changed since the 1950s. I was happy and satisfied with my life during the last half of that decade. And I was not sexually active!At a meeting of disgruntled residents in the high-rise apartment building where I presently live, the vice president of the Atlanta management company listened to the diverse complaints, skipping a few, from the crowded room. After an hour, touching on a miniscule of the unsavory happenings (most of which won't be addressed), she asked \\"Is anybody here happy?\\" and only one person raised a hand.This is typical, according to this researcher, who stated that widespread incidence of melancholy and pessimism amidst better living conditions and freedoms hold significance beyond the 'proclivity to complain.' Stress, he feels, is a big factor for our unhappiness. Perhaps the breakdown of the family and long distances between parents and grown children make the sadness factor more prevalent, as the kids are busy leading their own sad lives, trying to make a living and procreate.Because a large percentage of Americans are overweight and sleep fewer hours, their bodies become programmed to produce more cortisol, elevating stress. In the latest 'Scholastic Instructor,' the facts are that 17% of children and adolescents are seriously overweight. Less sugar, more exercise, and less t.v. viewing might cure what ails the majority instead of so much pill popping. Changing lifestyle using some type of vigorous walking half an hour each day, bike riding, or pumping iron in a gym can lessen the surplus of the stress hormone.Anyone who does anything to excess can harm his body; now, even athletes are being denied too many water breaks as too much water is harmful (news to me!) and causes health problems. Some water systems (10%) have arsenic in drinking water.He advises reading a book (not by Stephen King) before bedtime instead of t.v. as beneficial for a good nights sleep. Some paradoxes such as prosperity does not produce happiness. In the 1999 'Forbes' 400 list of American richest persons, 72% had been divorced at least once. We often make the mistake of assuming that money will solve all of our problems. Money will only solve money problems.Our thriving society tends to escalate violence. In the pre-historic groups still in existence today in the Amazon River tribes, Somoa, Australian outback, some parts of South America, 60% of males die by violence. After the tsunami disaster, a similar group was discovered in SE Asia; one primitive was shown on ABC News shooting at a helicopter with a bow and arrow! He places blame on youthful violence on the contents of today's films which are produced.In the past, 'insolvable' problems included pollution and crime; today global warming (which Al Gore wrote about) is escalating, as advocated by the author of 6 NIGHTMARES, Anthony Lake. The earth has sixteen million square miles of forest. A log can burn into ash, but ashes cannot reassemble themselves....unless, of course, they're from a phoenix, a mythological bird who reincarnates itself.His personal opinion: \\"England's May 1940 decision to continue fighting Germany (WWII) was the single greatest event in world political history.\\" Citing 'positive psychology' as a means of creating a utopia on earth leads one to wonder.Americans speak of the 1950s as a Golden Age when things were simpler. Nostalgia plays a role in this glorification of the past, as does the progression from childhood to adulthood. The British speak of prewar London as a Golden Age of quieter life and higher cultures.The fallacy is that a Golden Age could only have happened in the past. He ponders the proposed utopias all the way back to the Middle Ages, discussing Thomas Moore's 1516 book, UTOPIA, Greek philosopher Plato's platitudes, Roman poet Virgil's ARCADIA, Rousseau's Eden, and Huxley's BRAVE NEW WORLD.If the Western World has known a Golden Age, it is right here, right now. It is ours to decide what the future will hold. If we decide well, the future may hold an even-better life, about which our descendants will complain. Happiness must come from within; money cannot buy it. Robert Frost wrote, \\"Happiness makes up in height what it lacks in length.\\"The magazine reviewer writes that \\"perhaps Americans need a lesson in the fundamentals of gratitude.\\" He goes on, \\"Our forebears worked hard and sacrificed so that we could have the freedom and prosperity we know. It is past time Americans showed some appreciation for this.\\" We seem to think that our parents and grandparents had it better than we do at present, but the writer feels otherwise. According to him, these ancestors would say that the contemporary U.S. is the realization of utopia. Why then do the majority of us are far from feeling better about our lives, and many feeling much worse. Let's appreciate what life offers and do with it the best we can."},{"Title":"The Progress Paradox: How Life Gets Better While People Feel Worse","review":"The first few chapters describes how average people are better off from average people generations ago. He uses numerous statistics to back up his case from health care to higher wages to bigger homes and more cars. He describes how things are continually improving from generation to generation in the \\"developed world\\" from better education to the end of the cold war to higher life expectancy. He points out all these obvious trends but shows through polls that happiness for americans has declined.The rest of the book he somehow explains how unhappiness and material wants, negative news, and collapse anxiety are interconnected. Also, that our lives lack a sense of fulfillment and we are unhappy because our lives lack meaning. He goes on to say americans are spiritually deficeint whether or not we believe in God. He then chastizes christian Americans for not living morally and not helping the under-privledged and living up to christian philosophy. He basically says that we live in a greedy society and that the weathly at the top keep amassing money through fraud and lies, not hard work, and don't fulfill responsibilities that comes from having large amounts of money (i.e. charity). He concludes by saying that if Americans only help the rest of the world in becoming developed and living like middle class americans, then the world would become a utopic place and happiness among americans would be better cause we would feel good about ourselves.This book doesn't have any thought provoking or ground breaking ideas. It basically summarizes statisitics, defends his position, and presents them in a orderly fashion. Questions of why people are unhappy always arise from previous studies or ideas. Not once is the possibility that civilization itself is causing unhappiness questioned. Comparisons are always made to previous generations of americans and he implies that this is the human condition. Comparisons should have been made to indigenous cultures of the past and present. I think it would have been found those cultures are a lot happier than civilized people.Its idealistic to think that everybody in this world can attain the same living as middle class Americans as he believes. Natural resources are not infinite and oil will soon run out but Easterbrook belives that since things keep getting better, this trend will stay that way. And it is up to all people of developed nations to make the world a better place for all humanity. But at what cost to the natural world? He assumes making the world a better place for everybody will achieve utopia yet he can only speculate that this will bring about happiness to people. I think if most people in the world achieve the American standard of living then most people will be unhappy because the environment will suffer greatly to meet the needs of all these people.This book is good if you like facts and statistics about our generation compared to previous generations but I feel it misses the point when it discusses reasons for unhappiness and how to go about making people happier."},{"Title":"The Progress Paradox: How Life Gets Better While People Feel Worse","review":"The book was in good physical condition.

He claims that even though most Americans are now better off than they ever have been, they are really miserable. Easterbrook claims that what's needed is a big tax increase to fund the programs necessary to &quot;defeat global despair.&quot;What Easterbrook has done, in essence, is to bend the facts to fit his predetermined agenda of advocating a big tax increase to fuel a big spending program.

The narrative tension is enhanced by the setting--the teeming unpredictability and varied social environments of the boroughs of New York, with Long Island to anchor the upscale end of the spectrum. The characters are mostly workaday human beings wrestling with survival and love, not always in that order. As they pair off, in conflict or love, or come to greater self-awareness--situations resolve as people are brought to inner resolve--the shadowy matrix of a sequel can be detected. Or maybe a TV pilot, as the coauthors have lined up the required assortment of types for a prime-time series.Don't expect the rich prose or intricately woven research of a Dan Brown thriller or the philosophical intrigue of Iris Murdoch when you open the pages of THE FLYING CORPSE.

James' sense of humor, his psychological awareness, social consciousness, and knowledge of both the human and geological history of New York City lend this book freshness and immediacy. Though it lacks high polish, The Flying Corpse shines as a quick, exhilarating reading experience. I look forward to reading more of this author's work."},{"Title":"Flying Corpse","review":"For a first novel by this author, this is a superb attempt in entertaining the public! My only difficulty was in predicting the outcome, due to the multi-layed plot that continually swerved around unpredictably. This book kept my attention, not only because of the plot, but also because the characters were ordinary people I would meet on the street. The setting aroused my interest because it gave me a sense of being in a geographical area with which I am totally unfamiliar. Because it is a first novel attempt it is not polished with the experience of writing for others. I do feel the next book will be right on target!

It is the Northern Europeans of modern times (i.e. British and Americans) who have made exaggerated claims to \\"pure white Greeks\\" and the \\"Virgin Birth of Greek philosophy\\".This book confronts what we are told about so-called Greek philosophy and examines the purported chronology of the Pre-Socratic \\"Greek\\" Philosophers:** Thales of Miletus (\\"father of Greek philosophy\\") was of Phoenician descent.** Almost all of the Pre-Socratic \\"Greek\\" philosophers were born in Asia Minor.** All of the Pre-Socratic \\"Greek\\" philosophers were persecuted by the Athenian State. They were either exiled, convicted, or killed for teaching FOREIGN IDEAS.** Nearly all the \\"Greek\\" philosophers studied in Egypt or traveled to Egypt to glean knowledge from the Egyptian masters. (Verified by the classical historian Herodotus).** Socrates himself was put to death for \\"introducing foreign divinities and corrupting the youth.\\"** The entire chronology of \\"Greek\\" philosophers was compiled by...the Greeks themselves(!)** Alexander The Great of Macedon's conquest of Egypt provided Aristotle with a massive library of knowledge. Aristotle's school then credited him with over 400 books (and later on 1,000 books).This book made me research more about the Ancient Greeks. The more I looked into it, the more I saw that Greek knowledge was highly derivative from Egypt. The Greeks admired Egypt.The modern West needs to be able to claim the Ancient Greeks as being *white* because this allows GERMANS and ANGLOS (Americans, included) to construct a Fantasy Heritage where they falsely claim to have something to do with the Ancient Greeks.Northern Europeans had absolutely NOTHING to do at all with the Ancient Greeks. But they are the ones making exaggerated claims to Greek exclusivity. Modern Greeks still do not identify with Anglos or Germans or Northern Europeans (and they never did).This book may have an agenda. And it has several errors. But the book's tone of inquiry is dangerous to the FRAUD that is called \\"Western Civilization\\". The Ancient Greeks were a Mediterranean Civilization.

He used a Greek word that in that context meant &quot;dark&quot; not &quot;black&quot; as propagated by racist black Afrocentrists who feel their history gives them nothing to be proud of and thus feel the need to steal the history of the Egyptian and Greek and Hebrew peoples. That is the real &quot;stolen legacy&quot;.

I have finished reading \\"Stolen Legacy,\\" I think the author had some screws loose to advance the cockamamy theory explained in this book.The thesis of Gregory James' book is that the religious and philosophical legacy of the ancient Egyptians were actually stolen by the great Greek philosophers who took all the credit for themselves. James argues that all of the Greek philosophers traveled to, and were trained and schooled by the ancient Egyptian priests, and once returning to Greece they formulated their theories without crediting Egypt for their theories. James argues the Greeks could not have possibly originated the ideas for their philosophies themselves because the Greeks were either warring among themselves or fighting outside invaders and would not have time to formulate their philosophies.What hogwash!First, the Greek philosophers gave credit for the origins of their philosophy. Plato makes several references to the mysteries taught by the Egyptian priests, and in every instance opening acknowledged that he owed his debt to that country. He did so in Tamaeus, which James acknowledges.Second, internal or external strife does not prevent the propagation of philosophical thought. human beings are perfectly well adapted to do two things at once. The cultural and literary life of a country does not grind to a halt simply because it is at war or there is civil unrest. Prime example, the Stoics arose and flourished when the known world was going through great upheavals following the death of Alexander. So even though the Greeks were fighting the Persians and fighting amongst themselves, Plato had enough time to open his school and philosophize.Third, his argument is impossible to verify. He argues these philosophers were trained in the Egyptian mysteries. Students in these teachings were forbidden to reveal the content of those mysteries and the exact content of those teachings remain, well, .... a mystery. James has nothing with which to compare what was \\"stolen\\" by the Greek philosophers on the one hand, and what were those teachings actually were; it is impossible for use to determine how much was \\"stolen.\\" In other words, we cannot tell what precisely the Greeks used and what was not used. According to James, all of the secrets of the mysteries were used by the Greeks. James does not have any inside information about the specific teachings of the ancient Egyptian priests. Another drawback of this book is that he is forever citing secondary and tertiary source about what the mysteries taught. Look, no one knows for sure because they were mysteries! I suspect that some aspects of the philosophy were indeed used. Whenever there has been a cultural exchange of ideas, the fact remains that some aspects are used and others are not. This is completely natural.It is not that we have no idea the general features of the Egyptian mysteries. The Neoplatonist Iamblicus wrote a book concerning the Egyptian mysteries. It contains the only glimpse of what the teachings were like. What is revealed in h is book on the Egyptian mysteries bear very little resemblance to what actually exists of the writings of Plato, etc. Also there is the hermetic traditions from Alexandria, summarized so brilliantly by the Emerald Tablet. The first thought was that these teachings were very ancient, revealing the actual Egyptian mysteries. A more accurate dating of this tradition is around 300 C.E. It is generally accepted that the actual Egyptian teaching make a part of these writings. Still, accepting all this Plato's philosophy bears little resemblance to a wholesale plagiarism of the Egyptian mysteries.Was there a wholesale stealing of the heritage, as James argues? I think not. If that were the case, the philosophy of every Greek philosopher would be identical or substantially the same, and they were definitely not the same. There were marked differences between Plato and Aristotle, and among the pre-Socratics. If they all stole from the Egyptians they would all be saying the same thing.In order to make his theory convincing, James argues that all the major Greek philosophers traveled to Egypt, including Socrates and Aristotle. He readily admits that there is no historical proof that Socrates, Aristotle, and a majority of the pre-Socratics ever set foot in Egypt. Then James argues, in a conspiratorial-like manner, that they \\"must\\" have traveled to Egypt but that there was some reason why a historical record does not exist. ... Maybe because they never traveled to Egypt, you think?The topping on the cake is that James asserts that the world has not acknowledged the contribution Egypt because of race prejudice. This is really a cheap shot on James' part, the only argument that can be made if there are no other arguments that work. Here, however, he against speaks with a hazy historical perspective. The ancient Egyptians were not black-skinned --- all the proof you need is to look at the pictographs from ancient Egypt itself. The only race which would come the closest to resembling African peoples would be the ancient Nubians. This is really a petty distinction and a stupid argument because I believe that the world gives as much recognition to the ancient Egyptians as they deserve; they do not receive more recognition because much of their literature does not exist because of destruction due to wars and whatever. Well, there is no literature because it is all a conspiracy.All said this is not a serious book. He reads like a conspiracy writer, his history is weak and he jumps to too many conclusions ---- the wrong conclusions, I'm afraid. This book of fiction and not serious academic scholarship. It should be read for its entertainment value -- which is not much -- and not for any serious argument."},{"Title":"Stolen Legacy","review":"who ruled the ancient black land that we once"},{"Title":"Stolen Legacy","review":"If you are looking for a book that is a complete fairy tale and is NOT history, this is one of the best books on the market. In this book the author tries to prove that the entire civilization of ancient greece was really stolen from egypt by the greeks. He claims that egypt is the real birthplace of western civilization, and was falsely given to greece due to a worldwide conspiracy involving all of the world's historians and archeologists over the centuries. Throughout the book he makes comments that are simply out of this world without any facts to back up his statements. He makes such wild claims as to saying that philosophy is not even a greek word. I hate to break the bad news to the author but I am fluent in greek, and philosophy is most definitely a greek word! He even goes as far as saying that the entire greek language was stolen from egypt when in fact the two languages have absolutely nothing in common. Some of the wild claims concerning the greek temples such as the parthenon in athens and the oracle of delphi on being cheap egyptian copies leaves the reader wondering if the author is completely insane due to the fact that these type of monuments were never found in egypt. His statements concerning some greek literature achievements such as how could Aristotle have written over one thousand books, and really got them from Egypt after Alexander the Great's invasion, is really quite silly. First, it is well known that his books were written by his thousands of students that he taught over his entire teaching career. Second, no similar documents were ever found by archeologists in the egyptian hieroglyphic language. Third, the author failed to provide an explanation for the famous literary works such as those of the trojan war, which were written many centuries before the time period involved. If the author really believes that the greeks were so ignorant as portrayed in his book, I would like him to explain to me why the greeks did not get conquered by the persians who were the world superpower at that time that succeeded in conquering every other civilization including his super advanced egypt! I will not even go into details on the dozens of inconsistencies that can be found thoughout this book. What is really sad is the fact that this book can be somewhat convincing to anyone who knows little about ancient history and may consider it authentic. Anyone else who is well versed in the history of greece and egypt would agree with me that this book does not belong at the top a book shelf in a bookstore, but rather at the bottom of a trash can.

James been able to write this book in a manner which was not polemic, not enervating, not preachy, not tiring to read, it would have 50 times the effect it anyway has plus he'd have way more allies than he actually does.His argument is that Greek philosophy and sciences were not original at all, and that for the most part they were directly influenced (\\"stolen\\" as he puts it) by the Egyptians. Being that this is a very provocative and controversial point, he needs some seriously solid sources to support him. He does provide this support of his argument but not in a very convincing manner. He cites both ancient historians (mostly of Greek origin)as well as modern specialised historians (egyptologists) to achieve this.Exactly there arises the first problem. For an issue of massive significance such as the one he raises this is a remarkably thin book barely spanning over 150 pages. Because of this, everytime he dismisses a greek philosopher or mathematician ,etc., he does this in a mere 5-10 pages simply by bombarding the reader by quotes from ancient and modern texts or accounts. This is the stly of the book for its entirety and in the end you have the feeling that you might be reading the most important telephone catalogue ever written.This not only tires the reader incredibly but it also undermines the author himself. The concept is, of course, to motivate the reader to research this further himself by checking up on the sources the author provides. I very much doubt he achieves this goal. Only the extremely unbiased and those with loads of time in their hands might do that. The majority of the readers would rather prefer a much more expanded book with a lot more detail. The way George James' book is written anybody who wishes to remain with the \\"orthodox\\" version of history will do so thinking that this book is simply equal to tabloid polemics.The truth of the matter is that James does have an argument. To what extend this argument can carry its weight is still under debate, but it is a fact that the influence of the Egyptians upon the Greeks was immense. Being that the Egyptian system of philosophy and sciences was one that worked through levels of initiation and much less through documentation the picture that has prevailed is the one most people know about the Greek civilisation being the first that incorporated such an advanced level in those areas.But advanced students of history know all too well that not only the Egyptians but the Chinese too (to name just two cultures) had achieved similar if not far superior levels in those fields. The reasons why the Greeks have been chosen as pioneers or forerunners of western civilisations are complex, intriguing, and in any case far more complicated than James argues.Still, i consider this a horribly written book with a very important issue underneath the mess.But there arises the second problem. In reality, it matters very little, or it should matter very little who first thought what, or who first invented what. James makes the same mistake as those he thinks he opposes. He has the same agenda as those he opposes because his argument is one of a racial backround. It's really irrelevant whether philosophy or sciences were first founded or solidified by white cultures, black cultures, or asian cultures. Human history has far less borders than some would want people to think.As it is, this is yes an important book, a very faulty one simoultaneously, and one that fails to effectively raise the issue it advocates. Only people with a deep understanding over knowledge of history will see whichever value James's book has.

This small book delivers a ton of information without boredom. James (the author) reveals a lot of historical facts based on his research (which he cites the sources). For example, the actual birth dates and time lived of Aristotle, Plato, and Socrates is still unsettled and argued. Shortly after the conquest of Alexandria, Alexander the Great invited Aristotle to spend some time there. Aristotle is credited with writing 113 books on 33 different subjects during that year. Hmm? There are many other books, including Western European, that support the information found in this book. Moses was educated in Egypt. So was Socrates and Plato, who later in life was sold into slavery. Alexander the Great's father (Phil) was educated in Egypt too. Egypt seems to have been \\"the place\\" for getting the best education - but they were very selective. It's ironic that the author died a mysterious death too.Originally written in 1954, some of the references cited in this book are too rare to find today. But overall, it provides a great list for additional reading. The author says the Greeks stole their knowledge (legacy) from the Egyptians. He is not the first to say this and there are plenty of others from all cultures dating as far back as the 4th century who have said the same thing. Whether one agrees or not, we certainly know the Greeks have not produced anything equivalent since then. Nor has anyone else been able to reproduce the few remaining Egyptian artifacts or engineering feats. At the very least, this book is thought-provoking and worthy of discussion, because progress stops when we stop thinking about other possibilities."},{"Title":"Stolen Legacy","review":"This phrase, although attributed to Socrates, was found on many of the temples of learning throughout Egypt long before Socrates existed. This is a very important mantra for people of African descent.I personally was in a state of shame of being from African ancestry during the 70's as a young teenager. but upon spending 3 months in Africa at age 19, all that changed. Books such as this are critically important for US in order to debunk the distortions promulgated during this millennium against people of color, and in particular people of African descent. Regardless of what popular (white) culture's response is to this type of discovery, the important thing for US is to study for ourselves who we are and what we have contributed to the development of the human race. Who cares what THEY think!!!! WE should be well aware of the extent to which THEY will go to remain the superior force on this planet (slavery, world war, historical distortions, genocide, cultural genocide, economic sanctions, etc..).Books such as this and those written by Jochannen, Diop, Van Sertima, Bernal, Al-Mansour, and others, prompt US to re-evaluate everything WE were taught (programmed) to be true. The revelations exposed through the works of these writers, should be the foundation of learning for all of OUR subsequent generations.What I find to be most interesting is the fact that since the works here prompt so much debate, why is it that we do not see not only some of the debate itself, but also some of the factual discoveries borne by the works of these authors on channels such as TLC, A&amp;E, or Discovery. Since WE now have OUR own voice in the national broadcasting world, I think BET should pursue this area further so that more of our younger generation can gain knowledge in these areas. Black History should not be limited to one month, and should not be limited to the civil rights era especially when it spans thousands of years.It is important that WE lift the veil of ignorance OURSELVES and really take a look at everything WE feel WE know to be true. One of my favorite misconceptions is that of certain aspects of the Bible. How many of you know that the 10 Commandments can be found within the 42 Negative Confessions of the Metu Neter, a holy book written long before Moses or the Bible.WHAT HAVE WE BEEN TAUGHT, AND WHY?Stolen Legacy is an excellent book to start questioning the current world order."},{"Title":"Stolen Legacy","review":"George James presents his case of how Greek philosophy, and much of Grecian history, is actually Egyptian in origin, without bias or condemnation. His approach is logical and balanced, totally void of unnecessary anger toward previous historians and their erroneous/racist conclusions. Although the writing lacks depth in some areas, and is repetitive in others, there is enough viable, documented information to make it a very enjoyable and enlightening read. Not surprisingly, James' revelations will make some readers uncomfortable. Discovering that the Greeks were not the pillars of inventiveness, master of higher sciences and originators of many of our modern-day knowledge can be a major jolt to one's concept of history. To additionally discover that instead it was Africans, residing in the nation of Egypt, who educated the Greeks, may persuade some to dismiss James' findings and like the proverbial ostrich, put their heads in the ground to avoid the facts. However, if read with an open mind and a sincere quest for the truth, this writing is highly informative.

The detailed arguments aside (for this is a case in which arguments, however extensive they may be, may only be convincing to those making them), two points are worth our consideration. first, there is a lack of critical reflection on our present cultue--are science and democracy accepted as faith, taken for granted? second, there is a lack of critical reflection on the self--how much of us is defined by our culture, and how much of that culture, in turn, is defined by its origin? what is the source of power? in order to give appropriate consideration to the arguments themselves, it is above all necessary to consider the nature of knowledge and of scientific inquiry, so that we can shift the debate away from narcissism and towards critical inquiry. as to the arguments at hand here, i would suggest a few practical points. for instance, the author of this book claims that aristotle &quot;stole&quot; his ideas from the thinkers of an older culture, namely the egyptians. so all this time the man who is, in dante's phrase, the master of those who know, is merely a dishonest student who concealed his debt to his teachers. now it is clear that these so-called teachers of aristotle did not leave their writings to us; thus our greek man is our only link to great &quot;black&quot; philosophy. it then follows that we should study aristotle with more eagerness. why afrocentrists do not advocate the study of the greek philosophers is a fact beyond my comprehension. in all cases, it is not necessary to prove them wrong, for history is often an impossible dispute; when the consequences of their arguments are pointed out, however, i am not sure that they would stick with their original contentions."},{"Title":"Stolen Legacy","review":"Many will not accept what James has presented in his book. Even if one scoffs at the notion that Greek history (as we know it) was fabricated (or that much of it has been falsely attributed to them) since it was &quot;stolen&quot; from an already existing and thriving culture in Africa, simply look up the references that James provides. It was eye-opening to read about how the Greeks themselves praised the Africans!!As it was said in the movie, &quot;A Few Good Men&quot;, if you want the truth, ask yourself, &quot;Can I handle the truth?&quot;This book goes a long way toward restoring the greatness of Africa that has been attacked for centuries.

His thesis is that Egyptians were the sole propertiors of all the Hellenic culture as we know it. Needeless to mention that for so long, the audience has done this poor black guy a favour and have actually took him seriously and made comments and wrote books that try to contradict his claims claims. Unfortrunately i will not do the same. This book is not literature. It is a cacophony from an aggrovated, confused and disillusionate bitter man. Believe it or not, we Greeks know our history. It is this history that has kept us a nation for thousands of years; we don't need a black man from georgia to teach us our heritage. Meanwhile, I am sad for all the black men of this earth who will seek refuge for their pride and heritage in the writtings of this bitter individual. Sorry guys, Egyptians were not solely a black people. Try somewhere else. For the sake of the review though I will bring you a small example of the writtings: Alexander and Aristoteles looted (Zeus help us!!) the library of Alexandria and brought back to Greece all the knowledge of the Egyptians which later claimed it as their own.

This is where I would think that Egyptologist,even if they are Eurocentric,would still be familiar. So far I don't know of any Egyptologist who have supported James' claims. Also, I would assume that there are other Egyptian experts out there who aren't white or Eurocentric who could easily demonstrate these Egyptian and Greek paralles in philosophy and mathematics.

Ptolemy I, perhaps with advice from Demetrius of Phalerum, founded the Museum and Library of Alexandria The Museum was a research centre supported by the king.

During this time I was really not that educated with the culture and history of the ancient egyptains.Most Americans really have no ideal what ancient egypt truly was except for a few specials on the discovery channel and some books written on the subject by biased egyptologist.I read the book with an open mind,because believe it or notmuch of history has been rather distored by 19th century egoism of europeans seeking to prove the dynamic race and try their hardest to not admit the ancient egyptains were africans,and if they were africans they were not black in their views. Pusedo anthropology has for eons held these beliefs about ancient egypt and many people still honestly believe this to be the case.White supremist have web sites dedicated to proving egyptains were white people,and while mainstream archeology and egyptology does not even use modern day egyptains to play the role of egyptain people,which is a disgrace.The greeks however were influenced by the ancient kemetians,and I would not go so far as to say aristotle stole his wroks fromthe library of alexzandria,but there was definatley a type of intellectual sharing in ancient kmt between the greeks and kemetians.Greeks even admitted in many of their books that ancient egyptains taught them much. Pythagoras,thales,anaxgoras,and many others went to egypt and learned from the egyptains. The solid concrete evidence is that many yers before the so called pythgoras theroem the ancient egyptains knew it on the rhind papyrus. Thales the person who was half phonecian came up wioth the first scienitifc princicples came to egypt and learned from the egyptains.Leftowitz who has attacked this book might be right onb many accounts,but she does not explain how european scholars have worked around many ways to rewrite history themselves. Socrates probally never went to egypt,nor did plato untill it was alexzandria,but you can cleary see that plato had a great admiration for egypt,and their customs. In laws plato calls greeks pigs and talks about how egyptain children learn their alphabet through a game.What many people don't realize is it is true the ancient egyptains were amung the first philsophers,and did leave with them a philsophical tradition.

Located in today's southern Egypt and northern Sudan was most probably the oldest cultural complex in Africa. Known as Nubia, &quot;The Land of Gold,&quot; to Egypt, the people of this land first called their civilization Ta-Seti, &quot;Land of the Bow.&quot; Named so for its famous archers, Ta-Seti was a land of natural wealth, of gold mines, ebony, ivory and incense which she traded heavily with her neighbors.CHRONOLOGY OF NUBIA 3800-3100BC Ta-Seti 2300-1550BC Wawat 2000-1550BC Kerma 1950-1100BC Under Egyptian Rule 747-200BC Naptan Kush (Nubian rule of Egypt) 200BC-300AD Meroitic Nubia 350-300AD The Noubadian Kingdom550-1400AD Christian NubiaI. REEVALUTATING KUSH Nubia is probably one of the most underreported cultural complexes of antiquity. In the ongoing attempt to minimize the African involvement in such regions, even the inhabitants of Nubia sometimes fall prey to the Mediterranen Race Myth. (See Egypt page for more on Hamitic Hypothesis). When this is not the case, Nubia is minimized within the Nile Valley as a purely Egyptian cultural invention. This has been the case so much so that some researchers have come to call Nubia, &quot;the other Nile Valley kingdom.&quot; Often the myth portrays Egyptians as &quot;superior whites&quot; ruling over the more &quot;primitive Blacks&quot; to the south. In reality however, while Nubia and Egypt did war with each other, there were more years of peace than battle. These conflicts were usually territorial or economic and never racially motivated as certain Egyptians and Nubians obviously shared similar physical features. The victors were more often the larger kingdom of the Egyptians but sometimes the Nubians as well. A closer look at Nubia reveals startling information. Below are some revelations which have come from reevaluating Kush.Egypt's Dynastic rulership may have originated in Ta-Seti, thus signaling the first such form of government known to mankind. The idea of a pharaoh (king) may have come down the Nile from Nubia to Egypt (and) that would make Nubian civilization the ancestor of Egypt's... Dr. Bruce Williams, ArchaeologistEgypt referred to its southern regions as Upper Egypt denoting its affinity with Kush. The Southern Kingdom, Upper Egypt, was clearly conceived as the dominant of the two regions. It was from the south that the most enduring influences in Egyptian society came and without doubt most of its greatest leaders were southerners too. Through her long history Egypt constantly needed to return to the south to refresh herself and to restore her institutions, even perhaps her soul, when the weight of years or of external pressures laid too heavily upon her. Micheal Rice, HistorianEgypt was believed to have been a colony of Kush in antiquity. They (the Ethiopians) say also that the Egyptians are colonists sent out by the Ethiopians, Osiris having been the leader of the colony...

In today's culture of complaint, people hide bad art and cheap sensational ideas behind political/ideological fads and the automatic public reactions to their support or refutation all the time. Yet even with a healthy skepticism firmly in place, one must look at the thought provoking questions that this book demands are asked--and the near automatic visceral emotions that seem to go with them.I read this book several years ago in college. Though I didn't particularly like the preachy style, or much of the rhetoric seemingly impossible to prove scientifically, it successfully started me on an intellectual journey through a plethora of Egyptological authors of the past two centuries and a spiritual awakening. This book, I am reminded, has such power, because it raises more uncomfortable questions than it answers.Before or even after an opinion of this work has become set in stone in one's mind (usually inspired by an emotional knee-jerk reaction, as if the book is little more than a political metaphor and not an attempt to rediscover the actual ancient world) one must ask themselves, as I was again forced to upon re-reading it:Have you actually READ the book?Have you read inki_snkm@yahoo.com's review of this yet (June 29, 1998)?

George James is such a blatant ignoramus as to assert that Philosophy is not a Greek word! In fact, he goes as far as to suggest that correct Indoeuropean usage would be the English -lov- prefix, which in fact, has, quite simply, never been used in the Greek language's history! And he even presumes to say that this word --philo-- was rarely ever found (! ) in the Greek language, when in fact, it has been used for thousands of years with the exact meaning of love! The truth is that -philo- used as the DEFINITIVE verb meaning &quot;to love&quot;, and also having many derivatories like philos (=friend) has been one of the most widely used words in the Greek language, and has remained so for over 3000 years of linguistic evolution. Philo is the first synthetic to tens of hundreds of Greek words, used, for example in philokalia (love for beauty which is kallos in Greek), philokerdeia (love for profit, which is kerdos in Greek), philomatheia (love for learning, which is matheisis/gnosis in Greek), philoxenia (love for strangers, who are xeni in Greek, aka hospitality), philopatria (love for patris, which is Greek for homeland, aka patriotism), philalitheia (love for the truth-alitheia in Greek, aka veraciousness), philanthropia (love for fellow humans-- anthropoi in Greek-, aka humanitarianism), philargyria (lust for money--argyria in Greek, which btw is the authentic characterism for Judas in the New Testament --originally written in Greek)... And these words are only a minor fraction of the ancient Greek words made with the *Greek* prefix of --philo-- (to love), which is a word not used in any other ancient language, except in isolated words the other languages later borrowed from Greek, like philosophy, globally being acknowledged as the universally assigned word for pondering. Literally thousands of widely used ancient Greek words are made with the prefix of philo, meaning to love, and yet this racist claims that it is not a Greek word! Not only is --philo-- a Greek word meaning --to love--, but philo is THE DEFINITIVE Greek word meaning to love (with the only one exception of romantic love, where &quot;eros&quot; is used instead). The same applies to the word of --sophia-- (=wisdom), which, again, has been erroneously (yet on purpose) reported by the writer as not being Greek, because it allegedly &quot;has no indoeuropean roots&quot; (sic). But what does the writer mean when he says &quot;Indoeuropean roots&quot;? Does he mean the archetypal common Indoeuropean language, which was never to be found in the areas it evolved? But, since it was never found, how can he make the comparison? Does he, at least, make any (still meaningless) comparisons with *all* other indoeuropean languages? No. He reaches this biased conclusion (if conclusion it be considered) simply by comparing with ONE of the indoeuropean languages, English, and its definition for --sophia-- which is wisdom. Not-so-brilliant thinking. Should we, in the same logic, consider every Greek, or Indian, or Persian, or Italian and generally Indoeuropean word not coinciding with its English counterpart, as being something else than Greek/Indian/Persian/Italian and, generally, Indoeuropean? The stupidity of such a thought, is, in my humble opinion, self evident. Not to mention the fact that --sophia--, like --philo-- is found in hundreds of thousands of texts in the long history of the Greek language, along with many other Greek words deriving from it. Names like that of the Byzantine temple of Agia Sophia (God's wisdom), and words like dokisisophia (coming from dokisi=to believe, and sophia=wisdom, and meaning to believe that you are a sophos=wise man), or philosophia (love for wisdom), sophisteia (=sophistry, no explanation needed here, I think), or dousins of other words ending in --sophia--, which I cannot include in this review since my space on the page is running out.

This is just but one example of a book filled with grave flaws and basic errors. I am surprised by the passion that it has evidently raised on these pages, as the book is looked upon as an amusing joke in academia - certainly nothing to get excited about and most definitely nothing to take seriously as a historical work!"},{"Title":"Stolen Legacy","review":"Words cannot describe how disgusted I am by this book. It takes everything we know to be fact and spits and tramples all over it.This book is the exact equivalent of the same kind of garbage that was spewed by 19th century racist \\"scholars\\" like Houston Stewart Chamberlain, Oswald Mosley, and John Burgess. Just as they argued for white supremacy, so too does George James argue for the opposite. Nothing ever changes it seems; millions of people have to suffer and die because of racist ideologies, and yet people never truly learn the dangers of such a sickening worldview.First of all, I'm not against people re-analyzing history. All historians will often look back at their work, or the work of someone else which may have become antiquated over the years. New ancient works may be discovered which challenge the viewpoints which we may have held as fact for decades. This is good. It allows us to get a more accurate view of the ancient world so as to learn from it. This is different from revisionist history, where the thesis is largely debated among historians. Unfortunately, and it's sad to say, this book doesn't even qualify under revisionist history; it's full of malignant lies. For those who haven't read it, here's a summary:James argues that Egyptian civilization was black. Fair enough; if that's his argument, he must have proof, right? Well, not quite. DNA testing which has recently been done on mummified corpses (by scientists from ALL races, mind you) shows that they contained traces of Nordic, Semitic, and Persian, among many others. This was seen for both the Pharaohs and the lower class corpses. By my calculation, this means two things; either A) There is a worldwide conspiracy among all scientists involved to hide their true findings and simply make stuff up in order to fill their own agenda, or, more likely, B) James hasn't a clue what he's talking about. According to James, everyone in Egypt was black...except for the hundreds of people whose DNA indicates they were not. But hey, I guess it's possible for two entirely black people to have a Semitic/Persian/Nordic child.It gets worse. Did you know that the Greeks were simply crooks who stole all of their ideas from the Egyptians? That's right, the Greeks didn't invent anything, it was all stolen! James has proof too: Aristotle travelled to Egypt, where he visited the Library of Alexandria and stole all of the knowledge from the Egyptians. Ouch, that's pretty rough isn't it? That's enough proof to put the nail in the coffin of Greek learning. There's just one problem; it's not true. Aristotle died in 322 BC. The Library of Alexandria was built by Ptolemy II Philadelphos, who ruled from 281 BC to 246 BC. Now, correct me if I'm wrong, but it would be pretty difficult for Aristotle to steal ideas from a Library which was built over 40 years after his death. But hey, in Mr. James' book the dead not only rise again, but also steal ideas and formulate complex thought patterns in only a short matter of time.\\"The term Greek philosophy, to begin with, is a misnomer, for there is no such philosophy in existence.\\" This is what he writes early in the book. I don't even know how to refute this argument, if one could call it such. James believes that Greeks stole their ideas from Egypt. Philosophy, science, all of it. To be fair, this belief could be possible. The Greeks were definitely influenced by the Egyptians; only a liar would deny that. But here's what I don't understand. How is it that after the Egyptians had their ideas stolen from them, they don't make a single mention of these philosophical ideas? The Egyptians were notorious for how well they recorded their achievements, yet not a single papyrus scroll, engraving, or work of art mentions anything about philosophy. This leads me to believe that either, A) The Greeks stole the Egyptian's ideas, and then Egypt suffered an epidemic of amnesia whereby everyone forgot that they ever had these ideas, or B) James is full of it. Imagine, if you will, that you and a friend are writing an essay on the same topic. Your friend comes over and, while you're unaware, steals your paper and hands it in before you. Now, instead of reporting him for what he's done, you completely forget that you ever wrote a paper, and cheerfully go about your life as if nothing happened. Sounds ridiculous, right? Yet this is the exact type of logic James uses in his book, where it is just as laughable.I just don't understand what the point of this book is. That blacks are better than whites? Even if that were true, what does the author propose? That we discard all of Greek and Roman history because it's stolen? That schools should only teach history about black people? James never actually discusses why he wrote this book.However, what sickens me most about this book is that it completely ignores the fact that Africa actually extends BELOW just Egypt and Nubia, and that marvellous civilizations have existed there since long before these two. African civilization is largely unknown because the tribes in sub-Saharan Africa to a large extent relied on oral tradition. There tribes did not have a Livy, Polybius, Thucydides, or Tacitus to record their achievements with a fair degree of accuracy. It is sad to say, but what is today known as sub-Saharan Africa has for a long time garnered an atrocious press. Racist ideologues called them savages and barbarians, simply because their civilization differed from theirs, and sadly, this view has stuck in many places around the world. Indeed, the truth is that Africans have a lot to be proud of, just as Europeans and Asians do. Men like George James do nothing but cause even more hatred when it is not needed."},{"Title":"Stolen Legacy","review":"It is clear from the first page of this book that the author is out to prove something that didn't exist. Mr. James is not a classicist or a philosopher (he doesn't even know the origin of the word Philosophia, which he says is Egyptian instead of Greek!)and he can't bring something new to the discipline, so he set down to write a fictional account about the Greeks stealing Egyptian philosophy. It would be dumb for anyone not to think that the Greeks were somehow influenced by the Egyptians (and the Egyptians, of course, were influenced by the Sumerians) in the archaic art and architecture, but the Egyptians offered nothing to the Greeks in the field of philosophy. The Egyptians were emersed in mysticism and religion, not in scientific inquiery. If the Egyptians were supposedly so smart and philosophic, why didn't they write down their ideas? Answer: Because they didn't have philosophy in the sense we know it. Philosophy means &quot;love of wisdom&quot; and it was a Greek creation. I suggest to the readers of this book to read the Cambridge History of Greek Philosophy and Bruce Thornton's The Greek Ways: How the Greeks created Western Civilization. Read them and find out for yourself!"},{"Title":"Stolen Legacy","review":"Hotep, I first read this book when I was 11 or 12 and I really liked it then. Unfortunately, this book is hideously flawed with regard to accuracy. As I grew older and increased my personal knowledge of Kemet/Egypt the inadequacy of this work became ridiculously obvious. James' representations of Kemetic thought are completely erroneous. That being said, I do not side with James' other critics on this page. I appreciate what he attempted to do for African people and I understand the brutality of the environment in which he operated. I honor him as an Ancestor. At the same time I am not pleased when I see people (particularly Black people) using this inaccurate work in their attempts to combat the well armed and well entrenched Eurocentrists and Neo-Eurocentrists. Neo-Eurocentrists and Eurocentrists find this book incredibly useful to their cause. Stolen Legacy is used to dismiss a diverse Afrocentric movement as a bunch of dreamers, demagouges, and ill prepared romantics. Another note: I found it very amusing how certain contributors to this page confidently stated or implied that &quot;the Egyptians are not Black&quot; or that &quot;Egypt had no connection to Sub-Saharan Africa.&quot; (smile) Very cute, however one might actually want to study Kemetic religion, history, language, and culture before opening their mouths to make such inane statements. This is particularly the case with regard to Egyptian history, language, religion, and culture. The &quot;Blackness&quot; of this African people is not really an issue for me (I'm sure Kemet was not absolutely homogeneous)but it annoys me when silly people confidently assert that these AFRICANS were not Black. Another note: Kemet/Egypt is not the only great African civilization. Those who truly want to study Africa, live as Africans, and or assist in her ressurection cannot allow themselves to be confined to to a single branch of the African family. One more VERY IMPORTANT thing. Black/African people, particularly those who call themselves &quot;Afrocentrists&quot; need to stop focusing so much upon our relationship to Greece and other European civilizations. 1. We need to study Africa and our people in our own right and through our own eyes. &quot;Proof&quot; of our contribution or relationship with a European Civilization should not be viewed as a way of legitimizing or increasing the status of a given African Civilization. 2. Greece and European Civilizations can stand in their own right. Eurocentrists and Neo-Eurocentrists do not usually view themselves as such. They view themselves as &quot;orthodox&quot;, &quot;careful&quot;, &quot;OBJECTIVE&quot;, and &quot;SCHOLARLY&quot; (whether they are or not). The fact is they are the established camp and they hold a greater following upon the masses. We must put works such as &quot;Stolen Legacy&quot; to rest and make sure that in our pursuits we are commited to accuracy and truth. This is the only path towards victory. The multitude of African Civilizations are interesting, wonderful, and legitimate without any fantasy and romanticism added to them.

Even in today's polemical culture of complaint, where people hide bad art and cheap sensational ideas behind political/ideological fads or automatic public reactions to their support or refutation, one must look at the thought provoking questions that this book arises- and the near automatic emotions that go with them. I read this book several years ago in college. Though I didn't particularly like the preachy style, it successfully started me on an intellectual journey through a plethora of authors of the past two centuries and a spiritual awakening. This book, I am reminded, has such power, because it raises more uncomfortable questions than it answers. In the spirit of such work, the raison detre of all scholarship, I'd like to ask all others past, present and future who have or plan to review this book: have you read inki_snkm@yahoo.com's review of this yet? Were you aware of the facts he brings to light and refers to- more importantly, the intellectual paradigms he used to formulate his opinions, as those are (linguistics specifically)part and parcel of the methods, principles and practices of all Western scholars? Why do you think all architecture schools across all of Western civilization through the centuries to today begin their students' studies with the Pyramids? Have you seen the pyramids of the Sudan and Nubia, some predating those of Giza, recently unearthed by German archaeological teams? And what do you think our Founding Fathers (Washington, Jefferson, et al) would have thought of such a work (and think of the back of the dollar bill before you answer)?"},{"Title":"Stolen Legacy","review":"This book is utter nonsense. Its writer doesn't know the slightest thing about Greece or Egypt. For example he says that the existence of a god-sun called Aten (and sometimes Atum) in Egyptian mythology is proof that Egyptians established the theory of atoms!!! In fact, the Egyptian Aten sun-god was replaced by the sun-god Amon-Re long, very long before Democritus presented the atom theory, which has no relation whatsoever to Egyptian mythology. Atom is a Greek word, coming from the Greek &quot;a&quot; prefix (=non/no) and the Greek word &quot;tomo&quot; (=incision) (which the neutral for &quot;tomi&quot;, btw). Thus, atom= the (smallest existing) particle that cannot be further intersected, exactly what the atom theory maintained. Of course, this book is a flood of inconsistencies, fabrications, lies and hatred propaganda. It has been mentioned a thousand times before, but I feel obligated to mention myself that Alexandria's library was built many years *after* Aristoteles' death, and yet the writer proclaims Aristotelean philosophy is the result of Aristoteles going to Alexandria's library and copying its books!!! In fact Alexandria's library was itself Greek, founded by the Greek Macedonian leader of Egypt, Ptolemy the 1st, as any historian scientist/researcher will verify. Here is what the Grolier Encyclopedia mentions about it: &quot;The greatest large Greek library was established (3d century BC) by Ptolemy I in the museum at Alexandria, Egypt. Scholars there copied, revised, collated and edited works of the classical Greek writers. Their copies of ancient works became the standard editions on which other ancient copyists and libraries depended and, ultimately, the basis of most of the manuscripts in European libraries. The library flourished for several centuries and held about 500,000 papyrus scrolls.&quot; Also, don't be misinformed by any illiterate parrot trying to convince people that any library comparable to Alexandria has ever existed in Egypt before said achievement. It is a lie. The fact is that no other libraries senior to that of Alexandria have been found in Egypt and neither have there been speculations about any. Also, keep in mind that the first people to develop Western philosophy and philosophical thinking were Greek (at about the same time with the Asiatic Indian tradition and earlier than the Chinese). There is no Egyptian philosophy at this timeframe (neither, of course, earlier than this timeframe) we are speaking of, and this is not said with any intention to belittle the Egyptians' important advances in other sectors of human activity. It is simply a fact, that we have manuscripts of Egyptian religious beliefs, for example, or manuscripts reporting the restoration works on pyramids, or the pharaohs' succession, but there are absoutely *no* Egyptian manuscripts on philosophy, and there is no mention of such texts by anyone, contemporary or ancient. Of course these scientifically proven facts mean nothing for this writer, because this work clearly serves political agenda more than everything else. Its sole purpose is to maintain (and pertain to) the afrocentrist political/racial bigotry. What else could be the purpose of someone who goes so far as to say that the Athenean Acropolis, the Parthenon, is &lt;snigger&gt; a copy of Egyptian architecture(!). Anyone who knows the slightest thing about Egyptian architecture, Egyptology, or general archaeology is aware that there is no connection between Greek and Egyptian architecture. Ask yourselves: do Egyptians have anything similar to the Parthenon? Since they don't, how can this writer accuse Greeks of copying the Parthenon (!!!) from Egyptians? It's simple: he is based on pure malice, as well as racial prejudices and bigotry. Which is also the reason moronic (not to mention paranoid) afrocentrists say that Egyptians helped Greeks win the Persian wars. So say the bigots. But how could Egyptians help Greeks win the Persian wars? Not a single Egyptian archer fought on the Persian wars on a side other than that of the Persians. Why is it so, the ignoramus illiterate will ask. EGYPTIANS WERE UNDER PERSIAN RULE when Leonida's Spartans heroically defended Thermopylae, or when the Greeks defeated Persians for the first time at the Marathon battle, and later, at Plateus battle, or when the Greeks burned the Persian fleet at the sea fight in Salamis!!! And they remained under Persian rule through the whole period of the Greeks' prevalence over the world's superpower (the Persians, that is, ruling Egyptians from 525Bc to 404 bc, and from 341 to 331 bc, when Alexander the Great, the Macedonian leader of Greece entered Egypt and was accepted as equal to Gods, and then pronounced pharaoh by the Egyptians). Read the book, if you must, and decide for yourselves. I, for once, am reluctant to believe that the unprecedented bigotry in this book represents any more than a insignificantly small fraction of non-thinking, feeble minded illiterates. And if you should decide to learn the scientific community's view on this subject, read any of professor Lefkowitz's work, or any other historian's views, for that matter of fact.As for those reviewers that criticize all others as being &quot;ignorant or racist&quot; because they disagree with neo-nazist pseudo-history, I would suggest them get some facts and evidence on their beliefs next time they post, here or anywhere. Saying rage is proof of racism is both ignorant and mala fide, but however illogical the argument may be, it could serve as proof to James' racism, since there is nothing more than hatred and rage on this book. But, exactly like Holocaust deniers, rabid nationalists, and George James, these reviewers do nothing else than to insult anyone disagreeing with this book and its author, even though all these people have given Evidence and Facts to Prove the historical truth."},{"Title":"Stolen Legacy","review":"I think there is little doubt among Egyptologists and students of Ancient Greek thought that Egypt heavily influenced the Ancient Greek paradigm and may have influenced the conception of certain Greek deities, particularly Athena. The Immortal Principle, for example, very well may have originated in Akhenaten's attempt at monotheism before the Greek dark ages. However, the argument is very poorly constructed and largely unsubstantiated. There are very clear divergences in Egyptian and Greek thought, as well as many progressions in Greek Philosophy which can not possibly be attributed to Egypt except by the most dillusional and tenuous thinkers.People who are interested in truly scholarly work on the afro-asiatic roots of Greek thought should check out The Black Athena and Isis in the Ancient World. Although both have been questioned, especially The Black Athena, they are certainly more substantiated than this book, in which the authors prance around like elephants in a china closet trying to interpret history to suit their own liking. Cool for the lightweights, but if you want the real I suggest you turn to the aforementioned titles."},{"Title":"Stolen Legacy","review":"Amazing work by a wise brotha.

JamesNile Valley Contributions To Civilization, by AnthonyBrowder"},{"Title":"Stolen Legacy","review":"The main idea of this book is that the ancient Greeks were thieves: they invented nothing--not science, not philosophy, not anything--but stole all of it from the Africans, that is, the Egyptians, thus beginning the anti-black racism that kept black people down for thousands of years. There is just one problem: it isn't true, as anybody with any knowledge of the ancient world knows.To start with, the book is full of factual mistakes. First of all, the ancient Egyptians weren't blacks. (Ancient Egypt was racially mixed, and in any case skin color meant about as much as eye color.) The \\"Egyptian mystery system\\" James describes in the book was actually invented in the 18th century by French mystics; it is related to Plato not because Plato stole it from the Egyptians, but because the 18th-century French relied on Plato. Aristotle and Plato never visited Egypt, let alone the library of Alexandria, which didn't actually exist until they were both long dead.Quite apart from all these factual mistakes, the main thesis of the book is ludicrous: it is one thing to say the greeks were influenced by the egyptians (obviously true, and as any scholar of history knows, this was never deined), or even that the greeks never invented anything and merely plagarized the egyptians (not true, but at least logically possible.) But James says that the egpytian legacy was literally STOLEN. That is, not only did the greek plagiarize them, but that miracolously, this plagiarism caused the egyptians to instantly forget all of the plagiarized material and not make any new records of it!How on earth was this supposed to happen? If you teach someboy something, or even if he copies an idea you've got, or even if he steals the book where the idea is written, as James claims Aristotle did, do you instantly forget it yourself and can no longer recreated it? Even if the Greeks copied everything from the Egyptians, would that make the egyptians somehow forget their own original teachings? Of course not! The very idea is silly.This book is, in sum, simply fiction: a ludicrous thesis \\"supported\\" by numerous historically inaccurate claims."},{"Title":"Stolen Legacy","review":"\\"The wisdom of the Egyptians was a proverb with the Greeks, who felt themselves children beside this ancient race.\\" Plato, Timaeus, 22B, Quoted from Will Durant, the Story of civilization: IEgyptian Civilization:\\"Historians of philosophy have been wont to begin their story with the Greeks. It may be that we are all mistaken; for among the most ancient fragments left to us by the Egyptians are writings that belong under the rubric of moral philosophy. The Egyptians were the light of the ancient world. They produced many early medical instruments, designed the world's first step pyramid, and laid the empirical groundwork for scientific reasoning. Akhenaton, ..., is cited as \\"the Father of Monotheism.\\" Eugene Holley Jr.Gerald Massey's work; 'Book of the Beginnings,' is an essential reading for seekers of a balanced understanding of human origins, religious thought and belief, and the role of Egyptian civilization in world history. Massey, born in England in 1828, was a radical Egyptologist, who maintained that Africa was the source for \\"the greatest civilization in the world.\\" According to Massey, all evidence cries aloud its proclamation that Africa was the birthplace of the non-articulate and Egypt the mouthpiece of articulate man.Egyptian Moral Heritage:Herodotus, has demonstrated that Greece borrowed from Egypt all the elements of her civilization, and that Egypt was the cradle of civilization. \\"Egypt is the mother of all (the civilized) world,\\" says the popular proverb, to which responded the Late Nobel laureate, Naguib Mahfouz, \\"Egyptian civilization was beyond any doubt a great culture that encompassed the entire ancient world. The fact that we may have come to know it once more through the mediation of Western explorers and scientists does not make it any less ours. How could it be? It is the heritage of all humanity.\\"Morally, Ancient Egypt was far ahead of 18th century Europe, as testified by Diodoros (Hellene historian, 1st cent. BC) who specified that Solon had adopted an Egyptian law according to which everybody had to declare the source of their income. In I.79.3 Diodoros specified yet another Solonic law supposed to derive from Egypt, his famous 'Seisachtheia,' \\"shaking off of debts\\" according to which a man could not be imprisoned or enslaved for debt. Whether or not Diodoros' claims are correct, has been treated seriously in the 20th century.Egypt: Greece Alma Matter?'But now that we have examined these matters, we must enumerate what Greeks, who have won fame for their wisdom and learning, visited in ancient times, in order to become acquainted with its customs and learning. For the priests of Egypt recount from the records of their sacred books that they were visited in early times by Orpheus, Musaeus, Melampus, and Daedalus, also by the poet Homer and Lycurgus of Sparta, later by Solon of Athens and the philosopher Plato, and that there also came Pythagoras of Samos and the mathematician Eudoxus, {note 1} as well as Democritus of Abdera and Oenopides {note 2} of Chios. As evidence for the visits of all these men they point in some cases to their statues and in others to places or buildings {note 3} which bear their names, and they offer proofs from the branch of learning which each one of these men pursued, arguing that all the things for which they were admired among the Greeks were transferred from Egypt. (DIODORUS OF SICILY, C.H. Oldfather, translator, Harvard University Press (Loeb), Cambridge Ma. 1968.)M. Bernal wrote, \\"Her (Lefkowitz) general truth is that Greece did not derive any significant part of its civilization from Egypt. In this, she not only flies in the face of Greek and Roman tradition but even goes further than most of her classicist colleagues. For instance, she is extremely doubtful that Plato ever went to Egypt because, she maintains, references to the visit only appear in the late Hellenistic period (1st century BC). However, according to recent scholarship on the issue, the tradition of the journey goes back to Speusippos, Plato's nephew and his successor as head of the Academy.\\" Bernal Review; Not Out of AfricaStolen Legacy:\\"The term Greek philosophy, to begin with, is a misnomer, for there is no such philosophy in existence.\\" is such a harsh statement for Dr. James to start his introduction, and very bold for a book written in 1954 Arkansas. The compatibility of Greek philosophy with Egyptian Wisdom is in intense debate for the last two decades. If Lefkowitz rogues' gallery targeted above all George James (as Bernal stated), it is because they are both polarizing figures, was the reason I acquired the book recently, and attempted to review it.Over on athena-discuss, Scott A. Simmons wrote, \\"I would readily grant \\"tribute\\" as opposed to \\"theft\\", if the \\"wholesale appropriation\\" were acknowledged by those whose names now attract credit that is not theirs. If they (Archimedes, Aristotle, Thales, etc.) took from the Egyptians without acknowledging it, then by definition, plagiarism is committed.\\"Professor William Hansberry reviewed Stolen Legacy in the Journal of Negro Education in 1955, and noted that: \\"In Stolen Legacy an author with a passion for justice and truth champions a startling thesis with which most of the little volume's readers, Helleno-philes in particular, will no doubt strongly disagree.

Those Egyptians who are not black are the product of Roman and Arab invasions centuries ago that resulted in intermarriages. The modern Islamic Egyptian culture was imported by light-skinned Arabs.

With the exception of latin which was only spoken in the catholic church and spoken only by the priest. this is why the church had so much influence over western europe. however i will acknowledge that it was somewhat preserved in the eastern byzantine empire but history will tell you that neither the eastern or western roman empire had nothing to do with each other since the excomunication in 1096 between the pope of rome and the patriarch of constantinople.history will also tell you that the roman emperor constantine moved the roman empire east to what is called modern day turkey.In spite of all that i have written greek philosophy was restored to western europe when the african moors and arabs of spain began to translate greek works into arabic and finally into the english language.it was this exposure that allowed europe to reclaim their lost heritage. stolen legacy tells you where the greeks received their knowledge from. to add the greeks could not have invented the arts and sciences without learning from the egyptians. egypt was in its twenty fifth dynasty when the greeks began to create this philosophy.i leave with a quote from author george well parker\\" Historians may 'distort truth and rob the African race of its historical position, but facts are everywhere throwing open the secret closets of nations and exposing ethnic skeletons that laugh and jest at our racial vanities.

First Professor James puts fourth some very important facts which he supports with cross-references to historical text. There are some who call this a flawed work yet they fail to point out just where and with what they have taken exception to. If it is doctrinal in relation to Kemet then I would have to disagree, I would also ask as to whom they are referencing when making these claims. Is it Rosalie David? Howard Carter? Or some other self-confessed Egytologist? Or is it simply much easier to criticize a work they don't understand? The importance of this work is to let Black \\"men and women,\\" know that you have been called to a higher standard of living than we currently recognize. Whereas it is considered honorable and righteous to worship and ascribe all that we achieve to a deified version of ourselves. I would ask how can we save our selves and \\"if God is no respector of persons,\\" then how can one man earn the distinction of saviour of the world?Well he couldn't, but what if we all ascribed to a higher standard of living under a system which requires a long period of self-examination, disciplined study and self-sacrafice? Then could we advance not only our culture but civilization as a whole? It doesn't take long to view the current state of the world to see that the accepted doctrines be it Judaism, Christianity, Islam or any other you may deem relevant, lack the power and insight to inspire man to a higher standard of living. It just might be that the reason for this lack of power, insight and influence lies in the fact that they are all copies of something much more profound. Something born of a devotion to a communal way of living. A way of life where the development and advancement of universal ideals are much more important than individual achievement and promotion.So would you qualify as a candidate for admission into the mystery system? Did you recognize the character of Jesus was proving his worthiness as a student of the mysteries when he rebuked his disciple \\"Peter\\" and accepted his fate not as a human sacrifice but as a demonstration that he had become \\"Godlike,\\" through self-denial of external needs and cultivation of his mind. So in essence if Jesus were to return he would have failed in his quest to escape the ten bodily fetters and the curse of transmigration. There is more evidence supporting the theory that Jesus was indeed a student in the mystery system than any notion that he was god in the flesh delivered up as a sacrifice for the sins of the world."},{"Title":"Stolen Legacy","review":"This book is actual and factual.

After reading this book, I-n-I may adjust to embracing Greek philosophy - as of Black African origin. What a challenge! What a potential twist! As the Oregonians say (and whoever before them): \\"Never assume someone to be wrong, it may turn out later, they were right, too.\\"Personally, I would say, for a book written in 1954, only minor adjustments, such as corrections, would have to be made. (Compared to much newer books, yet in need of much more updating.) As controversial as this book is, white-conditioned folks cry \\"Lies!\\" I find the challenge of it alone very rewarding. A zillion lies have been told by white downpressors about black skinned people. A zillion more false scientific fantasies have been uttered in the same vein. Nobody got upset, not really. But when the racist-conditioned can't deal with the possibility of a reversed truth, they hit the ceiling, when the proof might be a bit lacking. Instead of appreciating that work and enhancing it further to find out even more of the truth. (The complete truth of anything we will never learn of course.)A challenge very necessary. As I write this, a movie will soon open in my country of living, in which black sororities and fraternities at an African American college uses exclusively Greek alphabet letters for their names (\\"Stomp the Yard\\"). Exactly, what George G.M. James advised against 53 years ago, in order to emancipate. One of the reviewers of this book suggests now, to let comparisons with Greece go and rather concentrate on the black African achievements. Sure! All the centuries of colonialism, black skinned people GOT compared to Greece, driven into an inferiority complex, and now, that the tides have turned, Blacks are paternalised to let go of Greece. Ok, I can do that. I will concentrate on ancient Black Egypt then and totally forget about Greece...The \\"philosophy\\" controversy: Linguistically relevant isn't so much, wether there are other words in ancient Greek containing word-parts of that, but wether the previous language did and wether ancient Egyptian did instead. Which I am told respectively no and yes, but personally I cannot confirm.The Alexandria library controversy: I have read other sources referencing a library in existence before the Greek invasion (which would make much sense, I may add). But again, personally, I cannot confirm.In any case, even if one or the other statement is not 100% correct or even false, the book has many more to offer. And is not describing Aristotle's plagiarism alone, but of basically all the other Greek philosophers as well. This smells like specific criticism intended to discredit the entire book. Which actually confirms the overall message of the book: For if the racist-conditioned COULD disprove ALL the allegations of the book, we could be sure they WOULD.It is hilarious to claim, the Egyptians wouldn't have known any philosophy. Because supposedly no records would have been found. Like what: All the tons of books available (on this website) about religion and wisdom of the ancient Egyptians are what - I figure of the imagination? This book is describing very religious philosophy and nobody upfull/honest would dare to suggest, the Egyptians didn't have any. How far do people go? Unbelievable.Maybe this hilarious claim is to be overstood as more specific philosophy according to the later Greek version. Nobody serious in the science community doubts the religious influence of Egypt over ancient Greece. E.g. \\"Black Isis and Child\\" is the image, from which \\"Black Mary and Child\\" was derived (later to be turned white-skinned). There's not enough space to list all of the religious path of development. Maybe it's not so much about plagiarism, but rather missionising, converting, influencing, adjusting, going the path of religious evolution.The art controversy: Maybe the Greeks didn't build any pyramids, as it is claimed there is no architectural similarity between the two countries. Well, probably, they couldn't. I've read somewhere, the Japanese attempted to rebuild a pyramid in the 20th century and failed. Which is exactly a point: Even today, we can only GUESS, how the Egyptians build the pyramids. We simply do not know. There are no records left, whatsoever. Yet, nobody would claim, because those records aren't there, the pyramids aren't there. (Also being as precise geometrically and astronomically as with today's sophisticated gadgetry.) Also: The ancient Egyptians were able to diagnose certain bone fractions, today's doctors can't without x-ray. We only know, they could do it, but not how!After Alexander the Great, the Greeks DID absorb any art they encountered. Paintings of Egyptian and Indian styles became Hellenised and vice versa. Of course, how else?!For this purpose I advise readingAfrican Origins Of Freemasonry: Treatise Of The Ancient Grand Lodge Of Khamet. Written in 2005, it references this book and updates a bit on the controversy, mentioning that discreditors of the book have been disproven in turn in the meanwhile. It also says, Freemasonry derives from the Ancient Egyptian Philosophy/Religion. Yet, this book doesn't say anything about Freemasonry. Why? Because of an oath of secrecy. Which of course was the same back then. Why? Priests are more powerfull, when only they can perform and have the knowledge. Please compare that to the Vatican which in the Dark Ages closed all institutes of education, destroyed all Greco-Roman texts it could, made its priest the only literate and did not translate the Bible into the local languages. They could interpret whatever they wanted! By the way: The Egyptians DID reveal the plagiarism : As soon, as they were able to - after all the successive occupations making that impossible before. Today, as in this book does. And experience the resistance of the establishment! (Also, some knowledge is dangerous, that's why e.g. certain Buddhist monks today do not reveal their fighting technics, whith which they wouldn't only win any Olympics, but could do considerable harm.)The Black Egyptian controversy: Gee, I thought, we were past that \\"controversy\\". Currently, human knowledge doubles every 5 years. Part of that is, that the ancient Egyptians were black skinned. Not some, but most, even all in the early times. Read some of the older Ivan Van Sertima books or the 2006When We Ruled: The Ancient and Medieval History of Black Civilisationsproving that. For the DNA-resemblances to the Sumerians etc., guess what: They and the so called Hittites and other early peoples in the vicinity were black also. As were some ancestor-peoples of peoples called Semitic today. So that argument was a boomerang.Also read one or the other recent book on genetics. Then you will find out, that EVERY single human, who lived at the times of the ancients, who left a surviving line of descendents, is one of the ancestors of EVERY human living today. Not a single exception. Which is true in turn for the time of the ancient Greeks in reference again to the times of the early Egyptian dynasties. There simply isn't such a thing as race, but a constant and complete mixing of anything. There is only appearances. Get over that! Both sides of the argument. That will enlighten your philosophy and spirituality. As everything from ancient times is OUR history, from ALL THE SIDES. Or \\"I-and-I\\" history, as Rastas would say. I.e. no matter, who invented that certain philosophy, they were the ancestors of ALL of I and I."},{"Title":"Stolen Legacy","review":"...if not, do that.

Is bigotry and racism just a White Thing? By Thomas Jackson. Shows the hypocrisy of the 'anti-racism' movement.In the beginningThe subjugation of Africa and its peoples began in earnest with the control of our minds which to date has reaped surplus dividend to outsiders, especially the European colonisers.The basis of African emancipation or the much-talked about renaissance (including the call for a continental African union), must of necessity, begin with the decolonisation of our minds through the restoration of our history.The truth is we have been educated, and still being educated, by the very people who have reasons to write Africa and its peoples out of the history of humanity.The re-writing of African history would at least empower the future generation with a clear and true perception of their forebears, hence of themselves. Such restoration is by itself service to humanity, for the historical consciousness of humanity has suffered for nearly 600 years of deliberate distortion by Western scholars and writers.This was achieved through falsifying, primarily, the history of the great African civilisation of Kemet (also known as Ancient Egypt). For years, Western historians have tried to divorce Negro Africans from Kemetic civilisation, while attributing those accomplishments to a race of people whom they called Hamites (Indo-Europeans who came from Asia). But, in fact, there is no such race in Asia.The \`Hamitic myth' was invented in the 1920s by Charles G. Seligman, an English anthropologist and author of Races of Africa. According to him: \`Negroes were too primitive to be capable of any advanced thought'. He claimed that Kemet was created by Hamites whom he regarded as \`Caucasians [belonging] to the same branch of mankind as almost all Europeans.'Seligman was in fact continuing from where Johann Friedrich Blumenbach, professor at Gottingen University in Germany, had left. In 1795, Blumenbach had put forward the \`superiority of Caucasians', a term he coined for Europeans in his classification of human races. Incidentally, he included Egyptians among his \`Caucasians.' This myth has held sway in academia for over 200 years.But the Ancient Egyptians called themselves Kemmui, which meant black, written in their language Medu-Neter (or hieroglyphics as a block of wood charred at the ends).For early Greek historians, the idea of distorting the history of Kemet was impractical, for they were well aware that the birth of science, mathematics, philosophy, etc, was too ancient in Kemet to contest, and would have been absurd to advance a contrary opinion.This is evident in the entire Greek account of Ancient Egypt, which glorify the civilisation of Kemet. It was, after all, in Kemet that the Greeks got their education in practically every conceivable field of knowledge.In effect, there was never a \`Greek miracle'. What is now known as \`the Greek miracle' was prepared by millennia of work in the arts and sciences in the very bosom of what was later misnamed the \`Dark Continent', work done by Negro Africans.Inherent in this distortion is a flawed principle that implicitly admits the truth of the Negro-Egyptian civilisation, hence the very need for concealment.\`We can't beat them since we weren't there at the beginning, so let's deny it.' This is what I call Diop-mbra (the Diopian principle named after the great Senegalese historian and writer, Cheik Anta Diop).This principle saturated 18th century European consciousness. For Europe is aware that almost half of the recorded history of humanity had passed before anyone in \`Europe' could read or write.Greek civilisation and its entire intellectual output, which are accepted today as the source of European civilisation, are directly located in Kemet, the great African civilisation which occurred along the River Hapi (European name, Nile).As Sir E.A. Wallis Budge attests in his book, Egypt: \`The prehistoric native of Egypt, both in the old and new Stone Ages, was African, and there is every reason for saying that the earliest settlers came from the South. There are many things in the manners and customs and religions of historic Egyptians that suggest that the original home of their ancestors was in a country in the neighbourhood of Uganda and Punt.'Europe's awareness of this fact was to fabricate the history of Africa and erect a false edifice, which has to be maintained at all cost.Today, based on this edifice, there is a school of thought that says since Africans have no history of any real significance to the rest of the world, we are a non-essential factor for the advancement of the human race. In other words, we are expendable and disposable commodities in the context of human advancement.Whether it is an IMF loan, UN programme, nuclear testing in the Sahara Desert, Aids, dislocation of Africans in Brazil, USA, Papua New Guinea, Diego Garcia or East Timor; or genetically modified crops, the principle of Africa's expendability is adhered to with religious zeal.Remember America's current treasury secretary, Lawrence Summers, when chief economist at the World Bank, felt no guilt in proposing that toxic waste should be dumped on the \`poorest' countries because their populations were not as valuable, in dollar terms, as the inhabitants of the rich countries (see NA, Sept p28-29). When this was leaked to The Economist (London) and Summers was challenged, his answer was that it had been an \`intellectual exercise' with which he wanted to engage his colleagues to whom he had sent the memo.In recent days, the CNN (the American cable channel) has been advertising one of its programmes in these words: \`You are what you know'. Stretching this to the African condition, it means we are breeding an inferiority complex in ourselves through believing the manufactured history of insignificance.It is therefore no surprise that Africa and its peoples have moved from the \`dark continent' in the last century to a \`hopeless continent' at the beginning of this new century.The \`dark continent' was a necessary pretext to civilise (which really meant, to loot, maim, enslave and plunder); and the \`hopeless continent' an acknowledgement of success of the latter. In effect, self-absolvement and a licence for future \`noble and compassionate deeds' as usual.Kemet (aka Ancient Egypt)This is the civilisation that rose, for over 3,000 years, along the River Hapi (Nile to foreigners), a river whose sources rise from the deep valleys of the East African Moon Mountains.In fact, Ancient Egypt was preceded by an earlier Negro civilisation called Ta-Seti, which meant \`Land of the Bow'.In his brilliant, new book, Classical Splendour: Roots of Black History (published recently in London), Robin Walker confirms:\`Ancient Egypt is the first major civilisation in Africa for which records are abundant. It was not, however, Africa's first civilisation. That honour goes to the ancient Nubian kingdom of Ta-Seti, which encompassed the territory of the northern Sudan and the southern portion of Egypt.\`This region,' Walker continues, \`is also called \`Ethiopia' in some of the literature, and \`Kush/Cush' in others. In 1980, Prof Bruce Williams, the director of the University of Chicago's Oriental Institute, published the results of excavations that his team started in the Nubian city of Qustul in 1962. The New York Times broke the story on 1 March 1979, carrying an article on its front page [headlined] Nubian Monarchy Called Oldest.\`The evidence recovered suggested that a dynasty of 12 pharaohs ruled over Ta-Seti, about 300 years before the First Dynasty of Ancient Egypt was established. From the royal tombs, five styles of pottery were found, showing different designs... Dr Williams also found examples of early hieroglyphic writing on some of the pottery, the oldest known evidence of a writing system anywhere in the world.'Ta-SetiAvailable records show that this Nubian civilisation began from 3800 to 3100 BC. Its seat was at Napata, its temples and pyramids can still be found in modern day Sudan and Egypt. It was Ta-Seti which gave birth to the first dynastic period of Kemet, providing all the necessary civilising elements, including the first 20 alphabets (Meroe hieroglyphics).As Robin Walker, again, confirms in his book: \`Ideas for civilisation and culture spread from Nubia to its northern neighbour, Egypt (or Kemet). Pharoah Narmer (called Aha Mena or Menes) unified the two lands of Upper and Lower Egypt and founded the First Dynasty. The records credit him with the building of Memphis, its ancient capital and administrative centre. It was built near the boundary that originally divided the two lands.'Records show that the progenitors of Ancient Egypt (Kemet) were of indigenous African Negroid stock. They called their kings Nesu-biti or Hem.of (meaning His Majesty). This was during the native period which some historians now call the Archaic and Old Kingdoms (3100-2100BC). But in the New Kingdom (1500-1087BC) the kings were called Per ?? (meaning Great House) which was later corrupted into Pharoah by foreigners, mainly Asians and Assyrians, to refer to the Ancient Egyptian kings on account of the great buildings in which they lived.North AfricaIn their attempt to whiten Egyptian civilisation, Western historians have found it necessary to blatantly ignore the \`many stupendous primeval monuments in Sudan and Ethiopia that so clearly proclaim a civilisation earlier than that of Ancient Egypt.'These historians have misled the world into believing that Ancient Egyptian civilisation emerged from the shores of Europe through Greece. This is in spite of the fact that all the accounts by ancient Greeks themselves confirm that black Africans had lived throughout the length and breadth of Africa (including north of the Sahara) for as long as the continent had been known to the world.These facts have been well documented and attested by Persian and Byzantine historians of the 5th century, who wrote that the people of North Africa were black, until North Africa fell to the Roman Empire, leading to an influx into North Africa of Roman and other European tribes.In fact, Hannibal (247-183 BC) who extended his rule from Carthage (Tunisia) to Rome and Spain, and who has been so \`whitened' by Europeans, issued a coin after he defeated the Romans at Trasmere which showed a Negro African on one side and an elephant on the other (Polybius, Book 3).Ernest Babelon, a numismatist, (a person who studies or collects coins) attested: \`The Negro [on Hannibal's] coin has a definite characteristic that leaves no doubt of the ethnographic intention of the engraver. He has rings in his ears, flat nose, thick lips, hair arranged in rows of knots. I think the effigy on the coin was Hannibal himself.'EuropeIt is in fact easier to prove that Ancient Egypt was a Negroid civilisation than Europe's claim to Greek civilisation. For, there was no recorded history of Europe in ancient times.The Europe we know today was divided by the frontier formed by the two rivers, Rhine and Danube. South and west of the frontier lay the civilised world, and north and east the barbarians of whom the then civilised world (principally Africa) knew almost nothing about.At best, at the twilight of the Neolithic Age, Europeans were dwelling in caves. When pastoral existence began in Europe, Africans had, for centuries, harvested corn, made wine, wrote philosophical treatises, studied the stars, built complex buildings, produced mystics and divine incarnations (sages, gurus, prophets), and laid down the first creed of the salvation of the soul.The French writer, Count Constantin de Volney in his important book, The Ruins of Empires, clearly states that the black people of Kemet were the first to \`attain the physical and moral sciences necessary to civilised life'.Wrote Volney: \`It was, then, on the borders of the Upper Nile, among a Black race of men, that was organised the complicated system of worship of the stars, considered in relation to the productions of the earth and the labours of agriculture; and this first worship, characterised by their adoration under their own forms and national attributes, was simple proceeding of the human mind.'When a few nomadic communities banded to settle in Rome around 1000 BC, the African civilisation was more than 2,000 years old ? its religion, philosophers, scientists, etc, were already ancient.When the Greek pantheon was in rudimentary stage ? the Olympiad yet to be held; Hinduism yet to appear, Gautama Buddha yet to be born around 560 BC, Prophet Mohammed yet to be born; when Abraham journeyed to Kemet for refuge entering with 70 shepherds and 12 patriarchal families who left after 400 years as a 600,000 strong Jewish community, acquiring all the elements of its future tradition (including monotheism and circumcision), the pyramids of Kemet were already a collector's item.Land of the BlacksThe Greeks, credited with European civilisation, themselves confirmed ? right from Herodotus, Isocrates to Plutarch ? that the Egyptians \`were very black' and had \`woolly hair'.These eyewitness accounts were made when Egyptian civilisation had already been in existence for, at least, 2,000 years. The Egyptians themselves stated in various texts, notably the Edfu text ? an inscription still found in the Temple at Edfu ? that: \`Several thousand years ago, we were led by our king from the South to settle up the Nile valleys.'Another account, the Papyrus of Hunefer (the philosopher and high priest), which is now exhibited in the British Museum in London, states: \`We came from the beginning of the Nile where God Hapi dwells at the foothills of the Mountains of the Moon'. The furthest point of \`the beginning' of the River Hapi (Nile) is in Uganda.Queen Maatkare Hatshepsut (1778-1458 BC, 18th Dynasty), the daughter of King Tutmoses II, wrote in her tomb:\`I have restored what was cast down. I have built up what was uncompleted. Since the Asiatics arrived in this land, and the barbarians were among them, destroying buildings, while they governed, not knowing Ra.'Hatshepsut sent a fleet of ships to visit Punt (which covered the entire region called East Africa today, comprising Uganda, Somalia, Kenya and Tanzania), the land which the Egyptians themselves referred to as \`the sacred land'.Queen Hatshepsut was, in effect, honouring the long-held African tradition of paying homage to the ancestral homestead. Nowhere in this greatly detailed account found in her Temple, was it said that it was a military expedition. The delegation was jointly headed by Prince Nehusi, Senmut (the chief architect) and Tuuti (the treasurer).This time-honoured journeys were in practice as far back as the 5th Dynasty (2510-2460 BC), from the days of King Asakaf to King Pepi II, when the journeys were made inland, affirming an earlier African civilisation that preceded Ancient Egypt.The Nubians of Sudan are today accepted as the ancestors of black Africans to the point where Negro and Nubian is synonymous both in antiquity and modern times.Ethiopians and Copts are two Negroid groups subsequently mixed with different Mediterranean strains ? this fact is well established and undisputed by historians.The Negro of the Nile Delta inbred gradually with Mediterraneans who continually infiltrated Egypt at a time when all the major Kemetic civilisations had been in place, from the First Dynasty to the 12th Dynasty.The Rosetta StoneDuring the 18th century, there was a renewed interest by Europe in Egyptian gold and artefacts. This made possible the decipherment of the Rosetta Stone (currently in the British Museum) which was found in 1799 at the mouth of the Nile by members of Napoleon's expedition.On the Stone was a decree issued by Ptolemy Ephihanes V in Greek and Medu-Neter which was deciphered by the Frenchman Jean-Francois Champollion who, in turn, while still in Egypt, wrote about what he saw in the temples to his brother Jaques Joseph Champollion-Figeac. Jean-Francois died in 1832. His brother, Figeac, who later became the icon of European Egyptology, published the full text of Jean-Francois' letter in 1883.Europeans were baffled to discover a first hand account by the Ancient Egyptians themselves, pointing to Negro Egypt. It was at the same time that Europe was enslaving Negro Africans and sending them to the Americas. As a result, Europe could not admit to a Negro Egypt, the source of ancient Greek civilisation, even if the Ancient Egyptians themselves had affirmed this.Figeac's publication of Jean-Francois' correspondence established a major piece of evidence from an European which should render all suppositions unnecessary regarding Negro Egypt.As early as 233 BC (18th Dynasty), the Egyptians continuously represented the two groups of their own race in a manner that could not possibly be confused by anybody. Significantly the order in which the four races then known to the Egyptians (Kemmui, Nahasi, Namou, Tahmou) are consistently arranged in relation to the god, Horus, also bestowed on them their social hierarchy.Jean-Francois Champollion affirmed this in his letter to his brother, Champollion-Figeac:\`Right in the valley of Biban-el Moluk, we admired like all previous visitors the astonishing freshness of the painting and the fine sculpture of tombs. I had a copy of the peoples represented on the bas-relief.\`According to legend, they wished to represent the inhabitants of Egypt and those of foreign lands. Thus we have before our eyes the images of various races of man known to the Egyptians, established during that early epoch. Men led by Horus, belong to four races; the first, the one closest to the god, has a dark red colour, a well proportioned body, kind face, long braided hair, slightly aquiline nose, designated men par excellence.\`There can be no uncertainty about the racial identity of the man who comes next: he belongs to the black race designated Nahasi.\`The third man present a very different aspect; his skin colour borders on yellow or tan; he has a strong aquiline nose, thick, black pointed beard and wears a short garment of varied colours; these called Namou.\`Finally, the last one, what we call the flesh-coloured, a white skin of the most delicate shade, a nose straight or slightly arched, blue eyes, blond or red bearded, tall stature, very slender and clad in hairy ox-skin, a veritable savage tattooed on various parts of his body, he is called Tahmou.\`I hasten to seek the tableau corresponding to this one in the other royal tombs and, as a matter of fact I found several, convincing me of that fact that the Egyptians were representing namely: (1) Egyptian, (2) Black Africans, (3) Asians, (4) finally (and I am ashamed to say so, since our race is the last and most savage in the series) Europeans, who in those remote epoch, frankly did not cut too fine a figure in the world.\`This manner of viewing the tableau is accurate, because on the other tombs, the same generic names reappear always in the same order. We find there, Egyptians and Africans represented in the same way, which could not be otherwise; but Namou [the Asian] and Tahmou [Indo-Europeans] present significant and curious variants.\`I certainly did not expect, on arriving here to find sculptures that could serve as vignettes for history of primitive Europeans, if ever one has the courage to attempt it. Nevertheless there is something flattering and consoling in seeing them, since they make us appreciate the progress we have subsequently achieved.'Even the gods were painted blackThe Ancient Egyptians went as far as painting the images of their gods in coal-tar black. There are records showing that early Christendom worshipped and converted the Kemetic \`devine mother' Aset (Isis) and Horus, her son, as blacks until the era of the European Renaissance.Jocely Rhys, an English scholar affirms: \`In catacombs of Rome, Black statutes of this Egyptian devine mother and infant still survive from early Christendom, which they converted to the Virgin Mary.'Will Duran (Story of Civilisation IV) also wrote: \`Statutes of Isis and Horus were renamed Mary and Jesus; the Roman Lupercalia and the Feast of Isis became the Nativity; the Saturnalia became Christmas celebration.'For artistic and ceremonial purposes, the Ancient Egyptians painted themselves in dark red for men and yellow for women. There are numerous existing paintings in the Temple of Ramese III, and the famous Abu Simbel paintings where the Ancient Egyptians and Nubians are painted solid black.Scientifically speaking, there is no dark-red race. The colour of the two Negroes closest to Horus are at best an expression of two Negro shades. In modern-day Sudan, wrestlers paint their skin red and yellow for ceremonial purposes.The Ancient Egyptians did not differentiate themselves from the Nubians as a separate race. When foreigners, principally the Assyrians (Syria), Persians (Iran) and the Hykos (Indo-Europeans) invaded Egypt, the natives sought refuge in Nubia (Sudan) to drive them out, it was as natural a kinship as Britain's special relationship with America.It was also an \`unwritten law' since inheritance was matrilineal in Kemet to the extent that all foreign usurpers to the throne sought to marry into the royal household to legitimatise their claim by having \`golden blood', not \`blue blood', and having the \`golden Horus name' ? an ancestral name legitimising the royal strain.Ptolemy Lago, the first of the Roman rulers, married into the royal African household to legitimise his claim. Julius Caesar did the same and had a child with Netermut Cleopatra. Mark Antony later abandoned his wife for Netermut Cleopatra for the same reasons. In effective, all the so-called Greeco-Roman rulers in the dying days of the Kemet civilisation (304-30 BC, the Ptolemaic Period) were all Africans.The spirit worldThe capability to ascribe the universe to one supreme being (monotheism), and to embrace the gods, (polythesism, which the Europeans called idiol worshipping) and divine kingship, had all been in practice by the Akan of Ghana, the Ife of Nigeria and others, long before the Europeans arrived in West Africa on their civilising mission in the 14th century.The Dogon of Mali knew how to determine mathematically and graphically the position of the sun on the ecliptic just as their great ancestors had done in the Nile Valley.The essential core of the Ancient Egyptian civilisation is spirituality, which permeated every aspect of life including science; hence Atom, the appellation of Ra the Almighty, corresponds to the atom in physics of today.Modern Western science has confirmed beyond doubt that atom particles contain elements of light which the Ancient Egyptians portrayed as a ray of the sun, and also makes the \`plants grow green' (Great Hymns of Aton-King Akhenaton). Yet science, in the hands of the Western world, has become inimical to the spirit.This centrality of the spirit, being embodied in all aspects of the living is abundantly clear in Black Africa, to the point that superstition became synonymous with Africans.A colossal volume of books (payprus) on practically every subject has survived from the Kemetic civilisation, which are currently in the possession of Western scholars and institutions.The very calendar of 365 days, the division of the day to 12-hour cycles, all created by Kemetic scientists and astrologers 4,000 years ago, based on the movement of the sun, are still in use today, as if they were invented by European scientists.Maheru Imhotep Ra (2980 BC), mystic, poet and scientist, who lived in the court of King Djoser, is the father of medicine, not Hippocrates as the world has been led to believe. Imhotep Ra diagnosed and treated diseases, and wrote over 200 books on bladder, liver, skin colour, eyes, abdomen, and tracked the circulation of blood 2,000 years before it was known in Europe ? long before Hippocrates was born.The GreeksThe Greeks travelled to Kemet in search of the knowledge of ancient African mystic systems.In effect, the legacy of scientific and philosophic knowledge was wrongly credited to the Greeks. It was then handed to the Romans who passed it on to Renaissance Europe, and on to the modern world.After nearly 3,000 years of prohibition against the Greeks, they were allowed to enter Kemet to study. This was made possible, first, through the Persian invasion and, secondly, through the invasion of Alexander the Great (from the 6th century BC) to the death of Aristotle (322 BC).The Greeks took every opportunity to learn all they could, receiving direct instructions from the African high priests. When Egypt came under Roman control, they looted and ransacked the great libraries of Egypt.This looting of the libraries was the genesis of Western scientific, philosophic and technical knowledge. This continued when Napoleon's invading army arrived in Egypt in 1798 AD.Democritus, another Greek historian, accused his fellow Greek, Anaxagoras, of having \`stolen' the Egyptian mystical teachings on the sun and moon, and passed it round as his.Socrates, one of the greatest Greek scholars, while awaiting condemnation in prison for teaching African wisdom, and also for his condemnation of corruption, admitted to his pupils for plagiarising (if not word for word) the work of the African philosopher, Aesop, the Ethiopian (560 BC).Said Socrates: \`I availed myself of some of Aesop's fables which were ready to hand and familiar to me and I versified the first of them that suggested themselves'.Homer, 850 BC, in his Odyssey IV, praised Ancient Egypt \`where the doctors are the first scientists of the world'.The death of Aristotle, who had inherited a vast quantity of books from the libraries of Egypt through his friendship with Alexander the Great, was naturally followed by the death of Greek philosophy which degenerated into a system of borrowed ideas, known by themselves as eclecticism.The compilation of Greek philosophy ? if not at the instigation of Aristotle himself, certainly students of his school ? was not authorised by the Greek government which persecuted the Greek philosophers since it considered philosophy as African and foreign to Greek sensibilities, and thus could lead to the corruption of the youth.As a result, Anaxagoras was indicted and fled from prison to exile in Ionia. Socrates was also executed for exhibiting some of the qualities mandatory for initiation into ancient African mystical teachings. Plato was also persecuted and fled to Megara for refuge.In short, what some have called the \`pseudo-science' of African-American scholars of black history is not pseudo-science after all.\`Insofar as Egypt [Kemet] is the distant mother of Western sciences,' wrote Cheik Anta Diop in Civilization or Barbarism, \`most of the ideas that we call foreign are oftentimes nothing but mixed up, reversed, modified, elaborated images of the creations of our African ancestors, such as Judaism, Christianity, Islam, dialectics, the theory of being, the exact sciences, arithmetic, geometry, mechanical engineering, astronomy, medicine, literature (novel, poetry, drama), architecture, the arts, etc. One can see then how fundamentally improper is the notion, so often repeated, of the importation of foreign ideologies in Africa. It stems from a perfect ignorance of the African past.'[...]"},{"Title":"Stolen Legacy","review":"The value of this book is that introuduces you to that the fact that there is a knowledge that is more ancient than greece.If credit was given to who it belongs in the first place than it would be no need for any arguments.Although not the best book on the subject,(the author will beat you over the head with his interpeptation)it is a good start and I give it 5 stars for that reason alone.Those who fear anything that shakes up their prospective of their views need to perhaps take a long look at themselves maybe they are afriad what they are reading is true."},{"Title":"Stolen Legacy","review":"The points raised in the book are definitely worth the time to research.

Where are you from? These are simple questions to answer for most. The African that helped to build the United States often has difficulty answering the two fundamental questions of life. The way we work, worship, relate to each other, and even play began some place. These functions were also influenced and manipulated along the way. The problem is not so much the fact that who we are has changed, but that many of us have no idea of the origins of the behavior that would best suit their natures. This is why the African kidnapped to the United States is so confused. Stole Legacy can put an end to the confusion.

Claiming that the Great Library of Alexandria is where Aristotle took his knowledge is ludacris because the library was built by Ptolemy II. The Ptolemic line was the successor line in Egypt. Alexander, himself was crowned pharaoh by the people because they saw him as a liberator of Egypt. The priests of Egypt viewed him as the son of Zeus. These priests were of the god Ammon who were told at his oracle. The Egyptian Mysterey System was a creation of white men and is a proven hoax. The first Greek philosophers most likely had some knowledge of Babylonian and Egyptian thought they added reasoning, something none existant in Egyptian or Babylonian thought. Even saying that ancient Egyptians were all black is wrong, as the people of Egyptian constituted a mixture of races. They were black and white. They were in fact Semites, like the Jews and Arabs, people who are Caucasian. Skin color alone does not tell a man's race. An Indian from India is in reality Caucasian, making him closer to Europeans than the Japanese or Chinese. Even most the languages of India and Iran are Indo-European, while the Basque live in France and Spain but speak a language isolate. If the Greeks stole anything from anyone it was the Phoneicians and their alphabet, something that is the ancestor to the Greek, Latin, Etruscan, Cyrillic, Hebrew, and Arabic alphabets. The name Kemet was a reference to the black soil of Egypt.

When Mr. James demonstrated that it was impossible for one man, Socrates, to have written as many books as have been ascribed to him and that in order for a civilization to have time to dabble in philosophy it must have internal and external stability and peace, I knew that the legacy credited to the Greeks was in fact the legacy of the Black Woman and Man of the Nile. Even the Greeks themselves admit their knowledge came from the Blacks in Egypt. This is one of the most important books every published since Mr. Lincoln's military draft document that allowed the North to arm Black soldiers, namely the Emancipation Proclamation."},{"Title":"Stolen Legacy","review":"I don't understand why people attack this book. This book is very factual in its content. I guess the reason why people disagree with this book is that some people do not want to accept the fact that the ancient egyptians were of the black race and think that &quot;afrocentrists&quot; are racist. But, if you read the writings of such white scholars as H. Spencer Lewis, Homer, and many other european writers they will admit that Greek knowledge and philosophy came out of egypt and they describe the Egyptians as being black. Rosicrucians teach that their sacred teachings and esoteric knowledge started with A'aferti Thutmose III, and the Hermitcs and European orders who practiced alchemy give credit to Hermes Trismegistus a.k.a. Tehuti as the founder of the sciences. So, I don't see the controversy concerning the Egyptian origin of Greek philosophy. George G. M. James did a good job writing this book and his research is well organized. He admits that modern masonry has its origin in Egyptian Mysteries. He goes into detail how the Egyptian Mysteries are similar to that of Greek philosophy and how these European philosophers were educated in Alexandria. Very informative and a classic book, indeed."},{"Title":"Stolen Legacy","review":"In this book, James aims to reveal the truth about Africa's contribution to the world. It is a repetitive and well detailed account of a clouded history. James provides the reader with an opportunity to check his references in order to establish fact from fiction. Doing so has allowed me to grasp a better understanding of the subject matter. Stolen Legacy, thoroughly illustrates several aspects of the Greek/Egyptian experience. This includes who the Egyptians were and what contributions they have made, how the Greeks received education from them, and the invasion and subsequent piracies of the Greek. The end product is a pivotal tool for the re-education of the world. Stolen Legacy provides us with information vital to our future. However, James' style of writing is a bit frustrating at times because his grammar is atrocious and hard to comprehend. Overall, it is a good book and was a real eye opner for me. I found Stolen Legacy to be an excellent reference for anyone seeking a different perspective of the past. However, as compelling as this book may be, I was skeptical. I did not believe everything it had to say just because it seemed plausible. This has lead me to extensive research. I would advise readers to do the same before drawing any conclusions. The world needs a change in its view of Ancient Africa's contribution. James has certainly provided us with a text for this purpose.

If \\"Greek\\" philosophy is in fact an Egyptian contribution to the world then their reward is met in the countless millions since who have embraced the truths and methods of it.This book is, while its goal is certainly admirable, is too militant in its presentation for anyone to take it seriously. It seems to be forotten, especially in the Introduction, that there have been enumerable conributions made by the African continent, especially to the Catholic Church in the figures of St. Jerome, St. Augustine and St. Athanasius. In fact it could easily be said that the contributions they made changed the face of Roman Catholicism. But again, they realized that there was a truth and reality that was above race and status, in fact, above everything else.If you will, this is also the realization of the Egyptian schools and the Greeks. The fact that the Egyptian schools remained mostly silent to history points to this. As the Greeks did not attribute the source of this knowledge properly was yet another example of the message taking precedence over the messenger. It was only because of the campaigns of Alexander that spread the Hellenistic tradition leaving the African in the mist of history. Further, if it were not for Alexander we may not have the luxury of even Greek philosophy. Lastly, there is no evidence whatever of ANY Egyptian philosophy. Considering their ambition in building and recording their achievements, it is curious there is no philosophy in any archeological records - no painting, no papyri, no wall carving, nothing...I emphazise that this book is far too militant in it approach to be taken seriously and the arguements, while factually sound perhaps, is not presented in a easily accessible fashion which leads me to believe that the intended audience is a very small audience indeed. History and Philosophy tell us that it is not important who started philosophy but rather it is important, simply, that we have it at all. For true philosophy is not so petty as to desire proper attribution.

Their own documents, in their own words say as much and while in the later (and by the way declining) years of the empire, they did intermingle with other races of peoples that they had conquered.As for the \\"Mystery System\\" to place the founding of this system in 18th century France is to show one's ignorance in full display & spectacle. If you were to do any real and detailed study into the mystery systems of the world such as the Free Masons, Kabalists, etc... you will find that their beliefs, structures and practices could be traced, as many of them do, back to the courts of the Pharoh's. Make no mistake, they have perverted most of the original meaning, but the origin is still found in Egypt. Concerning his statement that every scholar of history has stated and never denied that greece was influenced by Egypt is itself ludicrous. To this day, so called \\"scholars\\" are dening that fact, and by the way, isn't it funny how you find not one scholar in greece worthy of mentioning until after the travels and conquests of Alexander the Great in particular in Egypt, then all of a sudden here comes all of these incredible scholars and books and of course the library of Alexandria containing all of this wisdom. Why where these things not founded in greece prior to this time period if the greeks where really so scholarly?As far as the ridiculous comment: not only did the greek plagiarize them, but that miracolously, this plagiarism caused the egyptians to instantly forget all of the plagiarized material and not make any new records of it! You must remember that unlike Afrika which has historically had a respect and thirst for the both the obtaining, recording and sharing of knowledge, europeans (see rome) have always had just as much a thirst for destroying and rewriting any and all records that didn't line up with their propaganda which is exactly what happened to the records of ancient Egypt.It is clear that \\"classics lover\\" has had a hard time as most do when confronted with something that completely destroys the long held myths that they have been taught.

James, like a precious jewel, appreciates with age. While some argue that the book's title (Stolen Legacy) and the author's primary assertions, tending to totally discredit Greek civilization, may be academically counterintuitive; and while I can somewhat concur, James's work remains an invaluable educational tool in the Black struggle. Detractors may as well zip their lips and relax because this book is not going to go away! It is another great book for the ages.There is a whole lot going on here, and for that reason it's not the most relaxing read, but it is highly informative and profoundy inspiring. Black Freemasons especially, cannot afford to overlook this work. Much of the book focuses on the ancient Egyptian Mystery System, the father of Freemasonry. And for that matter, the Mystery System was also the forerunner model of organized religion.Without charging into all of the controversies and polemics--let them rage as they may--I do advance this opinion: a scholar's ken isn't required to discern that Egypt (Kempt or Khemit) profoundly impacted Greece and her philosophers, and be that as it may, James's work does present a valid argument; the Greek philosophers did at least extract much from Egyptian culture, because much of what they espoused vividly reflects ancient African thought. There should be no argument with that fact because scholars know that the philosophers themselves admit that their knowledge was acquired through Egyptian tutelege. Moreover, readers must Bear in mind that in ancint times (and what often confuses readers today), Egypt was an Occidental generic term for the whole of Africa, not just the North African country.Moreover, much of what is generally glorified today about ancient Egyptian civilization was an outgrowth spawned from within the African interior; ancient Egypt was actually the flowering of a much larger cultural influence. For James, then, as well as other notable scholars and Egyptologists, Egypt is simply an historical marker for Africa's ancient brilliance and unquestionable contribution to civilization.And if James aimed to totally discredit Greece, he may have consciously reacted to the fact that the world had totally discredited Africa. It is conceivable that James put forth a somewhat racist argument to augment his prime argument, that Africa contributed significantly to civilization, anticipating a racist reaction from a biased academia. Reverse racism--perhaps? Sometimes it's the only way to snag a Racist's attention. All that notwithstanding, James beautifully presents his own closing remarks about his purpose for writing Stolen Legacy:It is also going to mean a most important change in the mentality of the Black people: a change from an inferiority complex, to the realization and consciousness of their equality with all the other great peoples of the world, who have built great civilizations. With this change in the mentality of the Black and White people, great changes are expected in their respective attitudes towards each other, and in society as a whole.So, there you have it. Stolen Legacy is recovered history."},{"Title":"Stolen Legacy","review":"Any book that can render this kind of reaction by intellectuals and regular folk alike should be on everyone's reading list. In today's culture of complaint, people hide bad art and cheap sensational ideas behind political/ideological fads and the automatic public reactions to their support or refutation all the time. Yet even with a healthy skepticism firmly in place, one must look at the thought provoking questions that this book demands are asked- and the near automatic visceral emotions that seem to go with them.I read this book several years ago in college. Though I didn't particularly like the preachy style, or much of the rhetoric seemingly impossible to prove scientifically, it successfully started me on an intellectual journey through a plethora of Egyptological authors of the past two centuries and a spiritual awakening. This book, I am reminded, has such power, because it raises more uncomfortable questions than it answers.In the spirit of such work, the reason for being of all scholarship, I'd like to ask all others past, present and future who have or plan to review this book: have you read inki_snkm@yahoo.com's review of this yet (June 29, 1998)? Were you aware of the facts he brings to light and refers to- more importantly, the intellectual paradigms he used to formulate his opinions, as those are (linguistics specifically)part and parcel of the methods, principles and practices of all Western scholars?Why do you think all architecture schools across all of Western civilization through the centuries to today begin their students' studies with the Pyramids?Have you seen the pyramids of the Sudan and Nubia, some predating those of Giza, recently unearthed by German archaeological teams?And what do you think our Founding Fathers (Washington, Jefferson, et al) would have thought of such a work (and think of the back of the dollar bill before you answer)?This book has its faults, but its ability to make you think, whether you want to or not, isn't one of them."},{"Title":"Stolen Legacy","review":"This is a must read.

First of all, the ancient Egyptians have no relation whatsoever to sub-Saharan blacks --- this is proven by historical facts and records, as well as the science of ethnology. Second, there has never been anything such as &quot;Egyptian philosophy&quot;. Egyptians did not philosophize. There is no Egyptian hieroglyph text (not even a single paragraph) containing philosophy, and no reference to any Egyptian philosophy by anyone, Greek or Roman, Phoenician or Hebrew, Persian or Mede. (The library of Alexandria, by the way, was made by the Greek ruler of Egypt, Ptolemy the First, and its purpose was studying the Greek classic philosophers more than anything else. And it was made after Aristoteles' death, thus Aristoteles could not have gone there and copied/looted the library, as the writer supports. Also, there were other big libraries in other parts of the world, many of them having been found, so if ancient Egyptian philosophy existed, I assure you it would have been found in the library of Pergamus or Nineveh for example, or any of the ancient world's big libraries. As for the writer's claims that Greeks stole their language from Egyptians, or that the Greek architecture is a cheap copy of Egyptian, one would have to be ignorant to even take them seriously. Compare the two languages (Greek and Egyptian), and you'll see they are as disrelated to each other as Spanish (my mother language, btw) to Chinese, as any first-year liguistics student will confirm. Parenthesis: Philosophia is most certainly a Greek word. Saying Philosophia has no Indoeuropean roots and therefore is not Greek shows outmost ignorance. You see, Greek are an Indoeuropean language, thus every word that is found in Greek and *no* other (non-indoeuropean) language is certainly certified as &quot;indoeuropean&quot; (case in point: philosophia). Unfortunately, the archetypal common &quot;indoeuropean&quot; language is not found, so one cannot reach conclusions by comparing any word from any European language to the not- known common indoeuropean language. The theory for a common indoeuropean language is not based on that common mother-language, since such a language has not been found. It is based on similaritites between the different indoeuropean languages themselves. As for architecture, as one reviewer has put it, next time you go to Egypt, seek for any architecture that even remotely reminds you of Greece. You won't find any, because there is no relation between the two types of architectonic (again, like all architecture and historians alike will confirm)."},{"Title":"Stolen Legacy","review":"This book is full of ridiculously intense hate propaganda against the ancient Greeks.

I can tell you, with 100% honesty and conviction, that this book is nothing but meritless trash that has received some notice because it deals with a controversial issue.

This book, on the other hand, appears to have been written solely in an attempt to raise the self-esteem of alienated blacks, and to launch a racially motivated smear campaign against the ancient Greeks. I can only speculate that anger and unfounded feelings of inadequacy culminated in the release of such a book. This book smacks of ideology, and it's arguments are not substantiated by anything that even remotely approximates fact or evidence of same. Due to the fact that the achievements of the Ancient Greeks cannot be refuted, a select group of black &quot;intellectuals&quot; have set out to steal them, and claim them as their own. We are living in a time in which racial tension and frustration are running high, and as a result of this fact, books such as the one in question have been allowed to go largely unopposed.

James, in his landmark study of the true authors of Greek philosophy, the Egyptians.Initially published in 1954, the book shows yet again how war for the truth is waged on a battlefield, this one being Alexander's conquest of Egypt and the military policies to gain from Egyptian Priests information concerning Egyptian history, philosophy and religion & the plundering of libraries. That became the starting point for the plagarized writings of Socrates, Plato and Aristotle, with this false history being continually taught in classrooms, from elementary schools to colleges.James focuses on the Egyptian Mystery System, which was the foundation for the arts & sciences and how these doctrines found in Greek writings are traced back to the Egyptian origin.Particularly interesting are the chapters where James gives a brief biography of a Greek author and then - with an impressive listing of resources - points to major discrepencies in their lives and the doubts surrounding the authorship of their \\"original\\" works.And please note that James wrote his book with a larger mission in mind: \\"Consequently this theft of the African legacy by the Greeks led to the erroneous world opinion that the African Continent has made no contribution to civilization, and that its people are naturally backward. This is the misrepresentation that has become the basis of race prejudice, which has affected all people of color.\\"It is only right for wrongs to be correctly rewritten and the truth be told. Stolen Legacy began that process more than 50 years ago and it continues today, one reader at a time."},{"Title":"Stolen Legacy","review":"George James should be commended for his brave and enlightening work. Stolen Legacy challenges us to reconsider many of the theories and ideologies that have been impressed upon us through the American education system. We are constantly told that the ancient Greeks were the originators of philosophy, science, and many mathematical theories, but we aren't given an adequate explanation of how they developed these ideas. In fact, James offers a completely different explanation for the origins of philosophy. He claims that what has been passed of as Greek philosophy, is actually stolen Egypt philosophy and was passed down through the Egyptian Mystery System. Little has been told about the Egyptian Mystery System, but James tries to explain the basics of this system and how it spread throughout the Mediteranean world. While I do think the book could have been written more clearly, it still offers new information and challenges the norm.Regardless of whether or not you believe the many facts that James offers, we must still acknowledge the many questions that he has posed. For instance, is it possible for Aristotle to have written over 1,000 books on so many different topics? He points out that all of our present scholars focus on one, maybe two topics, while Aristotle is heralded for being an expert in practically every branch of science. Another interesting thing that is pointed out in the book is that fact that very little is known of the scholars that we give so much credence to. Of course, some of this is obviously due to lack of records, but even the people who claim to be experts on these scholars, tend to radically disagree on their lives and works. James is also able to draw many clear comparisons between ancient greek philosophers and information that the Egyptians had for thousands of years prior. Again, even if you disagree with the author's findings, this book encourages us to question the authorities that we adhere to. Without questioning the norm, we can never grow or expand as a society."},{"Title":"Stolen Legacy","review":"Forgive us, if we briefly redirect the dicussion of the Stolen Legacy toward that of a more SCIENTIFIC nature namely, comparative history and historical linguistics. James was a professor of Latin and Greek as well as Greek Philosophy, so he was familar with the Greek thought in the language that it was written. He did not know Egyptian however. Nevertheless, to truly critique this work, a true scholar should do just what James did--look at the historical context in which Greek thought was developed, consult actual Greek sources concerning who chronicled the works of the so-called Greek philosphers, and search for the anteriority of the ideas that the Greeks presented.Greek philosphy was born not on the Greek mainland but in Ionia, as we know, with Thales in the 6th century. Bertrand Russel writes, however:&quot;Thales is said to have travelled in Egypt, and to have thence brought to the Greeks the science of geometry. What Egyptians knew of geometry was mainly rules of thumb, and there is no reason to believe that Thales arrived at deductive proofs, such as later Greeks discovered.&quot;The Minoans and the Cretians did not philosphize. The Dorians didn't philosophize. From the 12th to the 6th century, Greece was in a state of military turmoil. Moreover, it was a veritable slavocracy--with wealthy landowners holding the rites to the knowledge of patriarchial gods, philosophizing was forbidden 80% of the population (peasants, medics, and slavs). It truly would have been a miracle for the common Greek to philosophize.Egypt created a 2000 years intellectual tradition that all the Greeks acknowledged. For example, Aristotle states that Egypt was the cradle of arts and science; he mentions that the Egyptians were the first men. Diodorus Siculus, Herodotus, Isocrates, Plato, to name a few, recongnized that egyptian knowledge was a the genesis of arts, science, and religion. Indeed the African Eypto-Nubians philosophized on the nature of existence(being), the inhabited world, al! l that is. They developed arts, science, literature, and yes philosophy. James compares the ancient Egyptian corpus of knowledge--the Memphite Theology, and the Eyptian &quot;mysteries&quot;--with the Greek thought. To sum up, very briefly, Greek thought is not anterior to &quot;europe&quot;. Egyptian &quot;sba&quot; or learning (mysteries) written by African &quot;sesh&quot; (at Temple of Edfou, Heirokronpolis, Naucratus, Memphis, and so on) is the genesis of knowledge or gnosis in the ancient world.The Ionians inherited this and transmitted to Greece, Greek traveled to Egypt to collect Egyptian learning. This is what James attempts to show this using only the Greek record and its egyptian antecedants.George G. M. James could not have more correct to state that Greek &quot;philsophy&quot; doesn't exist because the word &quot;philosophy&quot; is not Greek. As Theophile Obenga points out (and martin bernal) the word &quot;philsophy&quot; is not a greek word and is not of indo-european origin. Briefly:&quot;philo&quot; or &quot;filo-&quot; meaning &quot;one who loves&quot; has no indo-european root (uncommon:&quot;fil&quot;=&quot;beloved&quot;)sophia, &quot;-sophos&quot; meaning &quot;ability, general knowing; wise (in modern greek) doesn't have an indo-european root.LINGUISTICALLY, &quot;filosophia&quot; meaning &quot;one who loves knowing&quot; IS NOT GREEK OR INDO-EUROPEAN.Now, &quot;sb3&quot; is and egyptain verb meaning &quot;to learn,&quot; from which the noun sbw or &quot;wiseman&quot; derives.the egyptian &quot;b&quot; in greek becomes &quot;ph/f&quot; ex. the egyptian god nbti---&gt;is the greek nephthys. Pardon my greek, but numerous examples of the &quot;b&quot;---&gt;&quot;ph/f&quot;. Coptic shows the connection betweensb3(egyptian: learning)---&gt;b/ph/f---&gt;sph&lt; sophos (greek: ability,wisdom).James &quot;left&quot; this demonstration to the multivalent scholar Theophile Obenga (see Conceptions of History in the works C.A. Diop and Theophile Obenga i! s available from this site).When we bring the debate over African origins of Greek thought to a scientific terrain we can clearly begin moving our discussion from Egyto-Nubia &quot;sb3&quot; to Greek &quot;philosophia&quot;, from hellenomaia to &quot;lessing european cultural arrogance&quot;. James' Stolen Legacy is a pioneering work in this respect."},{"Title":"Essential RenderMan fast (Essential Series)","review":"This book is terrible.

It combines the great beauty of Renaissance art and bookmaking with the text of the Bible considred by many to be the finest prose in the English language, that of the King James version. The design for this edition is based on one of the mastterpieces of fifteenth-century art and bookmaking, the incomparable two-volume Latin Vulgate Bible commissioned by Federigo di Monefeltro, duke of Urino. This rare treasure was completed by the Florentine book dealer Vespasiano da Bisticci in 1478, its text having taken the scribe Ugo Comminelli of Mezieres four years to compose by hand. The numerous illustratos that grace the parchment of the Urbino Bible were handpainted by such masters as Domenico and Davide Ghirlandaio, among others.This volume contains all of the major illustrations in the Urbino Bible and features many other artistic details from that book, such as decorative borders, column dividers, and illuminated and historiated initial capitals.

This book provides an review and synthesis of how many fields (psychology, economics, systems theory, and others) have contributed to the development of HRD. In so doing it details how these fields, along with a growing body of research, have contributed to the development of the theoretical and philosophical foundations and HRDs emergence as a unique discipline. This is not a quick \\"how-to\\" book but rather a scholarly examination of the core beliefs, values, worldview, and principles that are the framework for HRD. It will be of primary interest to academics, scholars, and researchers. It also offers reflective practitioners the opportunity to re-examine the beliefs, values, and approaches that guide their work. The book is logically organized, well written, and replete with diagrams, models, and graphics that illustrate and clarify key concepts. Sure to become a classic text and reference, I highly recommend it to anyone who seeks to develop a deeper understanding of Human Resource Development."},{"Title":"Foundations of Human Resource Development","review":"This was a very interesting reading. It was practical and easy to understand.

The authors do not offer sufficient, concrete examples of the practical application of HRD in the workplace and are very wishy-washy in their presentation of the material. Consequently, the first draft of my essay wound up being as scant as the information in this book. Even the history of HRD seems ambiguous and up in the air the way Swanson and Holton tell it. Their contributors (e.g., Ruona, Watkins) aren't much help. There is no sense of practicality or grounding in the material these researchers offer at all, just a lot of theoretical back-and-forth. I'm an MBA seeking practical examples that compliment theory in order to help HR professionals apply them to the workplace someday, and this book was very little help. In order to strengthen my essay and my concept of HRD as well as its function, I had to buy \\"Principles of Human Resource Development (Second Edition)\\" by Jerry W. Gilley, Steven A. Eggland, and Ann Maycunich Gilley, which I highly recommend to anyone who really wants a good understand of HRD and how it's applied to the organization. This book became my primary reference and it was perfect. I also bought several books by Dave Ulrich at my professor's suggestion to offer practical examples that build on HR theory, and these books were a great complement. To get a better sense of HRD's history, I recommend Marvin Weisbord's \\"Productive Workplaces Revisited,\\" which primarily focuses on OD, but gives an excellent overview of how these human resource management theories originated at the turn of the 20th century and not in a cave at the dawn of humankind the way Swanson and Holton propose."},{"Title":"Foundations of Human Resource Development","review":"The authors present a comprehensive view of Human Resource Development (HRD) theory that is based on their professional practice in the field.

What a novel idea!Gerald Forrest's welcomed first book, &quot;Writing Exercises for the Reluctant Writer,&quot; is a breath of fresh air in an otherwise cluttered forest of erudite books on the subject. The recluctant writers of the title are all of us potential writers whose pens have been silenced because of discouragement and lack of a developmental process to bring out our own insights. Basing his natural process on his years in the classroom and counseling office, Forrest's successful formula is applicable to all writers, young or old, in or out of school.His 12 lesson approaches put the student through a series of sequential steps. Teachers will find his 98 provocative thought-provoking questions (actually topic suggestions) worth the price of the book. Cap this off with over 100 student writings, dealing with each approach, and you have the complete package. Even if a busy teacher were to read the questions and one or two student selections to the class, then ask the to write their own response, this modeling of creativity would generate something special from each writer.I feel fortunate that I was the principal who hired Mr. Forrest to develop this class, and saw the energy he put into crafting his method over these last 13 years. Students who until then were considered below-average or non-writers grew from the approach, willingly sharing their creations with the class; then opening up to listen to the unique writing of their peers. Truly, an optimal classroom environment.In truth, many of these students have made Mr. Forrest look good as a teacher. I must say that the composition entries by a student named &quot;Krystle&quot; are truly imaginative and beautifully crafted. You will find many of her works in the book.Hopefully in the future, Gerald will soon produce a teachers edition which will include specific worksheets as well as a student-oriented text with writing samples and appropriate instructions for them.

Sadly, there are no other choices at present...though we yearn for the day when computer technology will replace the printed codex and allow for (a much needed, but immensely difficult) a thorough revision of the lexicon.

The &quot;little Liddel&quot; is the best version for the beginner since it contains, e.g., irregular forms of verbs whose aorist and/or perfect principal parts cannot be predicted from the present principal part. The &quot;middle Liddel&quot; contains fewer entries but provides more room for etymological information, thus making the little Liddel best for use during Greek exams and the middle Liddel best for those whose interest includes a knowledge of the history of a word's usage. The big Liddel (the book for which this review is written) is an excellent reference on account of its completeness and the coherent way in which the entries are written. Although the Liddel and Scott Lexicon is a work of scholarship located in the tradition of late 19th century classics scholarship, that is, the editors regularly give the Latin translation of the Greek before the English (since until recently it was assumed that a study of Latin would accompany a study of Greek), the work has enduring value to both scholars and those for whom an interest in Greek is merely an enjoyment.

I specify this because this group of reviews also includes reviews of the \\"Middle Liddell\\" and the \\"Little Liddell,\\" which Amazon seems to have jumbled together.Liddell & Scott's Greek-English Lexicon is a monument to lexicography. Methodologically, though, it needs a complete redo. Whether anyone will ever accomplish this is a good question. I have seen the suggestion in a scholarly article that the most feasible way to create a new comprehensive lexicon of Ancient Greek is to compile it online, in the fashion of the Perseus Project. Such a project would be the ideal source for a new printed Greek lexicon with up-to-date principles of organization, not to mention modern English equivalents to replace the large number of thoroughly antiquated equivalents found in L&S.;This lexicon is certainly indispensable for serious students of Classical Greek literature. It is also useful for reading the Septuagint (Greek Old Testament) and patristic writers (for the latter, see alsoA Patristic Greek Lexicon). Another use which many might not have considered is for reading Coptic literature. Coptic is the latest form of the Ancient Egyptian language, and a great deal of religious literature was written in it during the first millennium or so of the Christian era. A good deal was translated from Greek as well. Whether translated or original Coptic, it made free use of Greek borrowings, much as English does. There is no lexicon devoted to literary Coptic Greek, but Liddell & Scott often have the meanings of words found in Coptic Greek, even if it's the 20th one in the list! Unless and until a complete dictionary of Coptic Greek is prepared, L&S; will continue to be a necessary tool of Coptic scholars as well as classicists."},{"Title":"A Greek-English Lexicon (English and Greek Edition)","review":"Excellent resource.

When I took a class where we read &quot;The Apology of Socrates&quot; by Plato, my professor recommended avoiding the Intermediate edition. At first I thought perhaps he was wrong, and I used it to translate some passages. After spending a lot of time sorting through it, I found that I agreed with him. The Intermediate Liddell does have locations of word use in original sources, and has slightly more vocabulary, but for the beginning and intermediate Greek reader, the Abridged Liddell is preferable. Navigating through the abridged edition is far easier and it often assumes a lesser knowledge of Greek, thus it includes some conjugated forms, which then point you to the correct verb. So as you can see, the abridged edition should suit the needs of most classical Greek students. Also, the editors took care to make sure that virtually every New Testament word is included.Are there drawbacks to the Liddell-Scott? The Victorian English often gets frustrating. We rarely use words like hither and thither anymore. Also, when more morally explicit Greek words are defined, their definition is in Latin. Also, the original printing abnormalities, such as certain parts of letters being cut off from words, remain.Learning Greek is a rewarding, but daunting task. The task is often made more difficult by grammars and lexicons that assume the reader knows more than he or she does. The abridged Liddell is perfect for the average student. When you want to dive in deeper, learn word origins, search sources, or just want to say you own the most complete Lexicon out there, you should buy the full size Liddell-Scott.

The 3 rules of Greek reading [1. know your Principle parts they will save your sanity 2. the Lexicon is your friend and 3. above all else, the first thing to do when encountering any Greek is to supress panic] don't change whether you've read two years or twenty, but you can outgrow your lexicon, and any serious readers (if you've stuck it out for three years or more, your serious) should invest in this lexicon. It is the standard and a necessity."},{"Title":"A Greek-English Lexicon (English and Greek Edition)","review":"As an ageing student of Greek, an aged pensioner only half way through the second year of a university course in the subject, I decided to ask my wife to give me the big lexicon for Christmas. Some say it is best to wait until more advanced study is required, but waiting several years at my age is perhaps overly optimistic. Generally I find the Intermediate version very useful, and I have it sitting on top of the Big One. I am sure the large version will be of considerable use, but it won't be travelling with me. I also have the small version which fits well into my luggage.The use of Victorian English does not worry me (we can all change \\"hither\\" and \\"thither\\" into more likely expressions), but the smallness of the print and its lack of clarity is a bit of a problem. I have decided that when I use the unabridged edition it will be in the daytime, and on sunny days at that! I am very thankful for a little magnifying set-up that I made when using Reading Greek as a textbook- very clear but very small print. My spectacles help too of course!A CD-ROM version may be useful to some people, but I much prefer books for frequent use. The computer is in a different room from where I do my real work. I couldn't stand having one of these monstrosities looking at me as I study Greek.So far I am very positive about the large version of the lexicon. It can hardly have five stars because it has some inadequacies, but it is better to have it than not. I might write another review in a year's time and give a revised view.................................................................Now, almost one year later I can say that I have found it very useful, especially with post-classical words, and more especially with some vocabulary found on inscriptions and papyri."},{"Title":"A Greek-English Lexicon (English and Greek Edition)","review":"The problem is photolithography. Reading some reprints can be like looking at a photograph of a photograph. You might consider finding an older typeset copy of the LSJ. Although this means buying a used book, it may be easier on your eyes.You cannot, however, identify a typeset copy by edition number, publication date, or ISBN. I browsed a copy of the 9th Edition (0198642148) published in 1961 and printed in 1992. It was offset and looked like the printer was running out of ink. I purchased a copy of this same 1961 edition printed in 1978. My copy is typeset. It looks fine.Whether a copy of the book is offset or typeset seems to depend upon who printed the book and when it was printed. At one time the University of Oxford printed its own books. My LSJ states on the copyright page \\"Printed in Great Britain at the University Press, Oxford by Eric Buckley, printer to the University.\\" My old copy of Denniston says the same thing except for the name of the printer.It seems that new books from the Oxford University Press are printed by a variety of firms located anywhere between Bristol and Hong Kong. I don't know when the University stopped printing its books, but I don't think that any copies of the 9th Revised (1996) Edition of the LSJ (0198642261) were printed by the University.I can't say as a hard and fast rule that all copies printed by and at the University are typeset; however, before purchasing and shipping anything this big and expensive, I would contact the seller and ask the seller where and by whom that copy was printed."},{"Title":"A Greek-English Lexicon (English and Greek Edition)","review":"Logos Research software has now made this edition in electronic form, all the supplements are integrated in the main text.

This also solves the problem of small typeface, you can really see everything clearly. They have also done an electronic form of the BDAG lexicon and HALOT for the OT.

It even includes Linear B Mycenaean Greek entries. This gargantuan work is the definitive Greek-English dictionary. I was not able to read Pindar or the Lyric poets easily without the Big Liddle. My major gripe is that it is rather poorly made. The edges of the very thin pages stuck together and each page had to be separated by hand or flicking the pages. The paper is sliver thin, and some of it was creased in the binding - upsetting in a $160 book. On reviewing the front, I noted that it was printed and bound in China and can't help feeling that if it were printed in Europe or the US it might have been better quality. Eventually, the pages separated and I am now able to use it without problems (although the few creased pages still irritate me).Regard this review as five stars for content but three for the quality of binding/manufacture."},{"Title":"A Greek-English Lexicon (English and Greek Edition)","review":"This is a review of the smallest version of Liddell & Scott's lexicon (\\"Little Liddell\\"). I've long felt it inadequate, but today let's try a controlled experiment. Can we use it to read the first two pages of Xenophon's Anabasis?(Xenophon's \\"Anabasis\\" has a reputation as a straightforward narrative written in a very clear style--it's what schoolboys used to cut their teeth on, before teachers grew worried that it was too boring to keep students interested in Greek.)In these first two pages (OCT edition), here are three basic questions about words that are not very clearly answered by the abridged lexicon. Page 1: lines 15-16, epi is used with the dative to mean \\"in the power of\\" someone, a meaning omitted by the abridged lexicon. Page 2: line 19, the accented form of the reflexive pronoun hoi is used, but the abridged lexicon gives only the enclitic form; line 23, amphi is used with the accusative in an only vaguely local sense (made clear in the intermediate lexicon, s.v., A/C/5, but impossible to guess from the \\"Little Liddell\\").If you can't read the opening of Xenophon's Anabasis with it, then, somebody has to say it, so I will: this book is NOT VERY USEFUL FOR ITS INTENDED PURPOSE. Spend seven more dollars and resign yourself to the extra weight and size of the intermediate. Sure, you'll outgrow it too one day, but it will always remain useful and will rarely cause this kind of frustration."},{"Title":"A Greek-English Lexicon (English and Greek Edition)","review":"By all means avoid the 2009 U. of Michigan edition of this indispensable book.

The book is grounded in the economic realities of the music business.It's a strong dose of reality. Some people might find this depressing, but I found the book to be very inspirational. It taught me not only that it *can* be done, but also how to do it, and what sort of attitude it will take to succeed.Levine focuses on the practical steps you have to take, and keep taking over a period of years, in order to get to a point where you can make a living playing your instrument. He doesn't offer any shortcuts to stardom. Nor does he downplay the compromises that the average musician has to make in order to get and keep paying work. Levine simply tells how it is for the majority of working musicians -- and how to become one of them.The book doesn't provide much information on related careers, like teaching music, or being a booking agent. There are other books for that. This one focuses on how to get paid to play and/or write music.

This is a literate, engaging and at times, terrifying story of conspiracy and blackguardness that leaves you thinking that it all is quite plausible in this day and age. The book's hero is Douglas McHarg, a tough police inspector who has hit some pretty tough times because of his nonconformist approach to his profession (and life in general). While this might sound uncomfortably familiar--how many of this type inhabit the average mystery/crime story?--McHarg is an original in many ways. But the book's strongest point is the intricate plot line that author lays out that is sophisticated and never insulting to the reader's intelligence. The characters here are also wonderfully drawn--large, but not overly so.This is one of the best mysteries I've read in a long time. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Guardians of the Prince","review":"I'm a huge Reginald Hill fan, but this early book was nearly unreadable; it was just silly and over the top. I struggled to finish it and then wondered why I'd bothered. The Dalgliesh/Pascoe books are infinitely better, so don't waste your time with this one."},{"Title":"Guardians of the Prince","review":"This book has way too many nasty murders to be believable. It did strike me after awhile that maybe Dan Brown read this book at some point and it planted a seed in his head for the DaVinci Code and the concept of secret societies with long histories. It's a pretty old book, and he might have run across it. If you're really into Reginald Hill, reading one of his early novels could be OK. It's pretty well written, but the story is too involved, too vicious, and requires too great a suspension of disbelief. The Dalziel & Pascoe books are generally much better than this.I've bought several Felony & Mayhem books by now, and I must say, none of them has been that good. Maybe F&M; acquires early or less successful titles at less expensive rates. I plan to be more cautious about buying from their list in the future. They seem to republish a lot of old mysteries, so if you're a student of the genre, some of the oldies are entertaining, but many of the F&M; titles show that they haven't aged well."},{"Title":"Guardians of the Prince","review":"Even though this isn't about his usual characters, this book is one of the best I've ever read by Reginald Hill. It's all about protecting a young and glamorous prince of Wales (and his sweetheart) against some very bad people.

His main character Inspector McHarg is beautifully handled whilst the introduction of English Royalty was a neat touch. The black character Granda Connolly is so unspeakably bigotted as to become detestable reading, ie worth skipping!. With a number of deaths keeping the detective busy it was with regret that Grandar managed to survive the last rites. A real gruesome end for the old Cyclops would have left me happier!

Never before the love affair of Pocahontas and John Smith, only platonic, and John Rolfe, quite procreative, had been told, at least as a love affair.The contention that it was collected from the Indians is of course part of the myth. We know better today since Paul Radin has vastly explained a story can only be told by a certified person, in fact a \\"priest\\" if we can use that word, an official and trained person who is keeping the memory of the tribe, a Quiackro (medicine-man, doctor, priest, memory-man, historian, poet eventually, etc, the famous Rsi of old Indo-European and Old Vedic traditions, nothing new there) and what's more this old sacred oral tradition has just been published today and it definitely refuses that hypothesis since Pocahontas is ten and nothing but ten at the time of the first meeting in 1607. At best - or at worst - this story was collected from hear say from some Indians by John Davis during one of his trips in Virginia probably by luring the Indian out wirth the story, or the story out of the Indian, with some money, some life-spirit or some trinkets. The rest is embellishment.The originality of this story is the romantic dimension of this love supposedly experienced by Pocahontas. We can of course wonder why this model was finally produced a century or so after the events, why this tale was concocted at a time when the Indians had disappeared from Virginia as said in full detail page 65-66:\\"No longer does the moon shed her silver light over the wigwams of the Indians sunk in profound repose. No more is the cry of the arrival uttered by the young red warrior approaching the hamlet. No longer are the ebon tresses of the Indian nymph fanned by the evening gale, as she reclines her head upon the bosom, and listens to the vows of her roving lover. The race of Indians have been destroyed by the inroads of the whites. Surveyors with long chains have measured the wilderness, and lawyers contended for the right of possession. Beneath these forests once the favourite seat of freedom, the swarthy slaves groan under the scourges of an imperious taskmaster; and the echoes multiply the strokes of the cleaving axe as he fells the proud tree of the melancholy waste. All alas! is changed. The cry of the hawk only is heard where the mock-bird poured his melody; and no vestige is left behind of a powerful nation, who once unconscious of the existence of another people, dreamt not of invasions from foreign enemies, or inroads from colonists, but believed their strength invincible and their race eternal.\\"Note the allusion to the Blacks slaves so discreetly including in a side remark. The Indians never were slaves. They were just plain exterminated by their own illusions about the world and probably because they did not want to become slaves and they were in the way of the colonists.This end of the tale is the basic justification of the appropriation of the land of Virginia by the whites just because John Rolfe marrying Pocahontas amounted to the Indians legally giving the land to him and all his descendents, all the Whites. The disappearance of the Indians does not have to be explained since the land was thus given by the Indians themselves, so they just vanished like a morning mist.\\"In Virginia [Rolfe] was entitled by the right of his bride to lands of immeasurable extent.\\" (63)The second motivation of the tale is to found this colonization on love, love for John Smith and John Rolfe, love from Pocahontas and her brother Nanquatas. And this is a sign of primitive innocence.\\"The lovely Indian was melted in softness, and with blushing timidity consented to become his wife.\\" (58)This implies the reduction of Argall's abduction of Pocahontas to a good thing in its end even though despicable in its means and method. The end justifies the means.\\"[Argall's] prolific brain was big with stratagem which, however unjustifiable, was likely to prove effectual.\\" (56)And this stratagem is at once shifted to the hateful character of Japazaws who helps capture Pocahontas for a simple copper kettle. And that's the third motivation of this tale: to show the childish, cruel and hateful, meaning full of hate and hence justifying hate against them, psychology of Indians. They are born liars, traitors, childish tricksters and infantile envy-devoured untrustworthy individuals. That's the vision the tale provides us in line wuth what John Smith wrote at length in his various writings.It is true the whites have come to invade and take the country, land and resources that are not theirs from their lawful owners. But the fact that they try to resist, to oppose that spoliation with violence or with wicked planning, in the narrow-minded and greedy vision of the whites, is enough to justify the full and heavily violent and bloody capture of the aforesaid land, resources and country.In other words the colonists, and in 1817 the Americans, are fully justified in their manifest destiny since if the Indians had not resisted, like Pocahontas who supposedly did not, that absence of resistance would have meant giving the land, resources and country. And since they resisted it justified the Anglo-Saxons in taking over in the name of their security. So, they surely were trespassing and indeed had no warrant to do so, except their own decision, will and ambition, not to reduce the three to the simple greed of theirs.Pocahontas was thus colonized by the tale, integrated into the folklore of the Virginians justifying both the takeover of the country and the disappearance of the Indians.The question is then to know how Pocahontas and the Indians can be decolonized from this absolute imperialism. Can she be decolonized now the Indians have disappeared, or mostly disappeared? Can the USA be decolonized without rewriting history in blood?That leads to the simple idea colonization is a twofold phenomenon and the decolonizing process can only be a dual process, a process of re-evaluation, of remembering, of reconciliation and of recommitment to the equality and historical dimension of both cultures and people by both cultures and peoples.Coming to terms with the genocide by acknowledging what those who were eliminated represented and have embedded in the culture and consciousness of those who cleansed the country of its original Indian inhabitants.Obviously that has to start with the positive assessment of the survivors and descendents of this expurgated people. Then the Americans in general, Whites, Blacks or Reds, will be able to find a modus vivendi and a modus operandi that will bring fertilization and fertility to the three cultures that are thus mixed in this vast communal bowl or baptismal fount, even if the baptizing was done in the case of the Reds and the Blacks in blood.

All of the other ASP books by WROX are excellent, so I felt safe in buying this work, assuming it would be excellent as well. Unfortunately, I was wrong. The main problem is the layout. Most programmer references are laid out in a dictionary style format. ASP 2.0 Programmer's Reference in laid out in chapters instead, making it difficult to find code snippets. To do so, one must search through the Index. For example: to find about Request.Form, you look in the Index and find: Request.Form collection. See Form Collection. Then you flip to Form Collections, 38-45 and then you have to search pages 38-45 to find anything...very irritating. Most of the book is like that. That is not to say that the book is completely without merit. The chapter on ASP 3.0 and what it will bring is mildly entertaining and informative.

While advertised as a programmer's reference, it has a lot more than just lists of objects and methods. It was enough to bridge me from C++ gunslinger to ASP pea-shooter. I found it thorough to an appropriate level, fast to read, and with a focus on performance. It does expect you to pick up VBScript yourself, but there are enough code snippets that I managed without having ever used VB more than a day.

It also tells you how to extend ASP with new components. This is also very nice.The shortcoming, however, is on the explaination of ADO.

Most of us use paramaterized queries rather than dumping a table.In summary, I would rate this book about average.

My 14 month old daughter loves this book though, so it gets an extra star for that. I like that this is a fun little song, though a slightly different version than I used to sing on the playground in the '70s. I also like that the cat and dog are on all of the pages (except one) so you can play the \\"where's the ___?\\" game.The thing that really bothers me about this book is that the illustrations seem very disjointed. I can get over rugs, slippers, pictures on the wall, etc., moving around from page to page, but it seems really odd that Tiny Tim transforms from a baby in the earlier pages of the book to a \\"big boy\\" with hair on the last 3 pages of the book. Then there is the weird page in between the baby and big boy pictures where the pillows on the bed and Tiny Tim are gone and the bedroom window is suddenly behind the bed. Tiny Tim is also in \\"big boy\\" form on the front cover along with the little girl, both of them with red hair instead of blond hair. My 14-month-old is too young to notice or care how disjointed the illustrations are, but it annoys me every time I read this book."},{"Title":"The Lady with the Alligator Purse","review":"I love singing this to my two daughters.

We owned the paperback and it was so loved that it fell apart, so I bought the board book thinking that it would be a sturdier choice. I was very, very disappointed when we received it and found it lacks one of the best pages in the paperback edition. The page has no words on it only a picture so I guess they thought it wasn't necessary, and maybe took it out to make the board book less chunky, but a picture is worth a thousand words and in this case that is definitely true.The page comes just after the page when lady with the alligator purse announces \\"Pizza!\\" and before the page where the doctor and nurse leave. It shows everyone, even the doctor, nurse, cat and dog eating the pizza. It is such a funny page, Tiny Tim has pizza practically flying into his mouth. In my opinion this page provides the perfect transition from the announcement of pizza to time for everyone to leave. Without this page I feel the transition is a little jumpy. I highly recommend the paperback over the board book, which is unfortunate because I like the sturdiness of board books. Everyone in my family loves this book, from my husband, myself, 5 year old, 2 year old, and my 16 month old (although the 16 month old only has the attention span for about half of it).PS this book is based on a song, if you don't know the tune try looking on you tube and you will find some videos of people singing it."},{"Title":"The Lady with the Alligator Purse","review":"This is one of my favorite books but once again very disappointed with the Kindle version.

Board books are generally made for the 0-3 age group, children who chew on books and bend or tear the pages. The Lady, and the rest of this set, to be accurate, is really for an older group, maybe 3-5. Hand clapping/slapping games are a bit advanced for the tiniest kids and since this rhyme is based on one of those games, it seems to indicate the book isn't for those tiniest kids.Miss Lucy had a baby... who would've eaten the bathtub if it fit down his throat. Fortunately, it didn't but Miss Lucy still put out the call to the doctor, who called the nurse, who called the lady with the alligator purse. Stop me if you've heard this before. All right, so you've probably heard it before, and a recap is probably not needed.Westcott's adaptation is fun - and cleaner than the rhyme we used when we were kids - and her illustrations are nice and the lack of the usual vibrant, colorful images that fill most books for the 0-3 age group might be another indicator that the book is aimed at slightly older little readers. Fun, and fun is good, but it's fun that's not even original, so I can't do better than 3 stars for it.- AnnaLovesBooks"},{"Title":"The Lady with the Alligator Purse","review":"This is a great book!

Although she's still too young to fully grasp all the details (she keeps trying to identify the bunny slippers as \\"measles\\") she is starting to understand why a pizza would be a good remedy for Tiny Tim.

In general, the quote is slightly superlative, but 'The Lady with the Alligator Purse' is a cute and safe story.Although neither the text nor the illustrations are terribly imaginative, 'The Lady with the Alligator Purse' is fun for children to listen to, memorize, and then recite (or sing) as they read about Miss Lucy, her ravenous baby Tiny Tim, the doctor, the nurse, and the lady with the alligator purse. The story literally is the rhyme that little girls recite on the playground during recess as they skip rope, and the pen and watercolor illustrations are nice, but somewhat primitive and rudimentary.

For me it represented hope for the future because it presented a logical answer to practices and systems that were not working in this country. Now I see some of the areas described in the book changing such as, healing and education (Flying and Seeing, a chapter from the book). However, they seem to be changing on the fringe, with some problems when placed in the mainstream. The problems are basically financial support to make change grow. Power entities, who control most of the wealth in this country,should embrace change. But I believe that Marilyn Ferguson's predictions of transformation and social reform and her systematic plans for transition will keep moving on. If you are a person, who believes in the change that is needed for this country to survive, this book should be on your shelf as a reference.

The reasons probably have much to do with why I finished Morgan's short book in only a day because I became so involved in his descriptions of the places that I considered my San Francisco-all of Upper Grant after it crosses Columbus with Caffe' Trieste and the New Pisa and of course City Lights, Discovery and Vesuvio with Tosca watching from the other side of the street.Even though I now live on the other side of the planet, these places are burned into my memory. They're memories of cold winter evenings searching for the inevitable bargain in Discovery and then going next door to City Lights to troll through its basement looking at all the titles that I wanted but couldn't afford as a student. And on Saturday afternoons going into Trieste and buying a cafe' and knowing that not so many years ago this place was the epicenter for guys that wore old berets, had beards and thought.I am indebted to Bill Morgan for writing such a heartwarming look back at a time and place that will go on in the hearts of Americans that realize there was a recent time when things could have gone another way. It didn't happen but with people like him keeping the memory alive and people who care enough to take pictures of City Lights for people like me who remember- perhaps all has not been lost.Buy the book and revisit these modern American icons before they are redeveloped."},{"Title":"The Beat Generation in San Francisco: A Literary Tour","review":"Ordered this book in preparation for my trip to San Francisco.

As I drive through Kansas to San Fransisco, this book's companion will be in my front seat. When I get to San Fransisco, I'll have this book, also in my front seat. I'm going to highlight every address, and visit all of it.Bill Morgan doesn't leave any part of any Beat Generation writer untouched. It's clear he knows his stuff. The general knowledge of people would be common: Jack Kerouac Alley, Grateful Dead house, City Lights, Vesvieu Bar (not sure I spelled it right). But knowing there is so much more! It will be fantastic to visit these remote areas, and think, \\"This is where Jack wrote Big Sur.\\" Or, \\"This is where Neal wrote The First Third.\\" (The Frist Third might not have been in San Fransisco, it might be in the companion book. I don't have the NYC book yet, only the State by State book, and this.) And I could go on...Allen Ginsberg, Gregory Corso, Lawrence Ferlinghetti, even William Burroughs. To me, this book is as much as history as is anything in Hollywood. Plus, it generalizes a history, of Sanfransisco, and the Beat Generation.The book is written in a way that makes it easy to get from place to place.

It is a sweeping account of the intellectual history of the 18th century, form its origins right into the French and American Revolutions. It traces the struggle of the small clique of 'philosophes' -a dispersed group of intellectual giants such as Voltaire, Hume, Lessing and Beccaria- as they fight against corruption, superstition and ignorance, which has kept Europe slumbering since the demise of the Roman Empire. The book vividly illustrates the ideas of the 'philosophes' and how they wanted to bring their reform programs into practice, and thereby spread the ideals of liberty and the pursuit of knowledge. Peter Gay deftly describes the cultural background of the 'philosophes' and explains how they came to challenge the establishment in order to bringing about these much needed changes so as to give their ideals a chance to prevail. The book has an extensive and well-readable bibliography with many good suggestions. This account of the Enlightenment is among the best ever written in the twentieth century, along with Paul Hazard's European Thought in the 18th century and Ernst Cassirer's The Philosophy of the Enlightenment. I do recommend all to read both volumes of this book."},{"Title":"The Enlightenment,: An interpretation; the science of freedom","review":"I picked up a copy of Peter Gay's Enlightenment as a discard from our public library.

Few other enlightenment dogmatists do the same.I'm glad that Gay exposed the radical and foundational philosophe Voltaire as anti-semitic, while the more centrist enlightener, Montesquieu, a philo-semite. p, 38. On p. 61, Gay exposes Voltaire and Diderot as cultural snobs, which their descendants continue to be.Dissapointingly, Gay on p. 125 refers to the barbarism of the [medieval] schools, but offers no proof, and thus is engaged in mere name-calling. Gay generously admits that Isaac Newton, Euler, Priestly were believers in at least the argument from design, but contemporary hubris-filled thinkers think that they are smarter than Newton and company.On pp. 169-70, Diderot is quoted as saying the human heart is alternatingly a sanctuary and a sewer, which is a fine summary of the Christian doctrine of original sin, which the philosophes fought like Cervantes fought the windmills.Many liberals consider themselves compassionate toward the less fortunate, but on p. 517, Gay mentions \\"...the suberb sneer that most of the philosophes directed, most of them at their less fortunate fellow beings.\\" This is confirmed in our day, with the very low rate of leftist giving to charity, compared to 'kindler, gentler' conservatives. Even Immanuel Kant, the last of the philosophes, described \\"the people\\" as vacillating, emotionally unreliable, unjust, cruel and fanatical.\\" p. 521In conclusion, I cite Gay as staing (178) \\"As i have noted before, like other revolutionaries, the philosophes were anything but just to their adversaries or their ancestors.\\"This trend continues in the writings of the enlightenment-reductionists to the present time."},{"Title":"The Enlightenment,: An interpretation; the science of freedom","review":"I have the desire to have the book translated into Chinese!"},{"Title":"Freedom's Cost","review":"M.T. Dresser's historical novel, Freedom's Cost is everything a good historical novel should be. The setting of Dresser's book is post-Revolutionary America when the fledgling American nation is confronted by Indian uprisings and a strong British presence in the Great Lakes' region. The British refuse to honor the terms of surrender following General Washington's victory at Yorktown and continue to occupy several strategic forts in the region and foment the Indians against the Americans by supplying them with arms and intelligence. Understanding the importance of the Northwest Territories to the future of the new nation, Washington dispatches his most trusted spy, Alex Grant, to the wilderness to access the situation. Alex, of Scottish and Negro descent and a former slave, is adept at merging into the society of his adversaries, a skill he developed as Washington's spy during the Revolutionary War. From his excursions into the wilderness to the uprising in France, Alex, known to his Indian adversaries as \\"Many Wounds\\" because of the hardships and tortures he has endured in a lifetime of struggle, must draw upon his courage and indomitable will to survive and maintain his precious freedom.Dresser's novel realistically mixes historical characters such as Washington, Lafayette, Jefferson, Paine, \\"Mad\\" General Wayne and others with her well-developed fictional characters. On the surface, Freedom's Cost is a thoroughly researched and an extremely well written novel that engages the reader from start to finish. At a deeper level, Dresser conveys the powerful message that freedom is fragile and often exacts a severe price in blood and tears from those who wish to embrace it."},{"Title":"The Novel - A Modern Guide To Fifteen English Masterpieces","review":"The 15 masterpieces are: 1.

I took off a star due to the missing figures.An interesting account of Great Britain's Customs Board cutters which were used to enforce the customs laws and thus try to ensure that all customs duties were paid. Custom duties were a significant part of the revenue for the country, and thus a great deal of effort went into stopping smuggling. Needless to say, given the comparatively high duties on things like alcoholic drinks, silk, laces etc., there was an incentive to smuggle them into Great Britain and thus avoid the custom duty cost. Smugglers could make a great deal of money, as long as they did not get caught. If they got caught, they could go to prison, or be transported, perhaps for 7 years.In the early part of this book (first part of the 1700s), Great Britain did not allow raw wool to be taken out of the country. Great Britain wanted to employ people in Great Britain to make finished cloth which would then be exported. Thus there was an incentive to smuggle raw wool out of Great Britain, as there was a demand for the wool on the continent among the weavers in the countries. Overall, the biggest problems were smuggling high tariff items into the country.Limited data is available in the records regarding the ships employed, and their manning, size and tonnage etc.. Within the available limited data, which covers some years, the different Custom Service ships and their tonnage, manning and armament as well as commanders are covered. There are numerous stories of encounters with smugglers. Some of the encounters between the smugglers and the Customs Officials in the early years were quite violent. The smugglers used brute force to beat up the customs men both on land and at sea. The Customs Service ships and patrols were frequently undermanned in the early days in comparison with the size of the crews that could be encountered doing the smuggling. Thus the King's men were subject to being overrun by a larger crew on a smuggling vessel. Later, the violence declined, and the smugglers changed over to hidden compartments and other subterfuges such as dropping a collection of weighted liquor casks that are roped together to the ocean bottom off the coast to avoid customs inspections. The casks would then be recovered by a boat or boat coming out from the coast after the revenue vessel left.Over all, an interesting and informative book. Well researched, and well written."},{"Title":"Places","review":"Exceptional book - great companion book to Art Matters by the same author.

I have read every Cussler book written. Clive and now his son, have a great formula and they stick with it. Smith's rendition has several facets that I find make the story more enjoyable. His character, Harry has to live by his own wits without some megalithic agency backing him up. I can relate to his methodical thinking coupled with his don't get mad, get even temperament that drives him. Harry's friends seem more like real folks, like the friends you and I might have right down to their vulnerabilities and oddities. In the end, I can admire Pitt but I could be Harry.It's a great read, with twists and turns you won't see coming. I didn't want it to end. The story really could be a great movie."},{"Title":"Eye of the Tiger (Heinemann Guided Readers)","review":"Wilbur Smith's \\"The Eye of the Tiger\\" is a solid, action-packed adventure story featuring a reformed thief, hidden treasure, two lovely ladies, loyal friends, powerful enemies and maritime action.Great rainy day or travelling book."},{"Title":"Eye of the Tiger (Heinemann Guided Readers)","review":"I enjoyed this book as much or more than I have all of the other works by Mr. Smith in my collection.

It falls just short of the talent that Cussler has. While I'm not so disappointed that I won't read more of him, there's just something missing that I can't quite put my finger on. For instance, the treasure is supposed to have been there for \\"a thousand years,\\" yet the books states that the treasure sunk to the bottom about 300 years earlier.But anyway, I will seek out other books by him, so I can recommend this book as an entertaining one."},{"Title":"Eye of the Tiger (Heinemann Guided Readers)","review":"I think Wibur Smith is the most gifted storyteller *ever* and I though I'd read all of his books.

In fact it's one of his best. Do yourself a favour, run don't walk to the bookstore for this one."},{"Title":"Eye of the Tiger (Heinemann Guided Readers)","review":"Eye of the Tiger is a tribute to the masterful writing skills of Wilbur Smith. This was the first book I read by Smith that took place in contemporary times, so his immense skill in creating historical settings was not necessary. He spins a hard to put down account of a search for what we will learn to be buried undersea treasure from a shipwreck.The protagonist is Harry Fletcher an ex-mercenary who is now a premier deep sea fisherman based out of the fictional island of St. Marys, an idyllic paradise off the coast of Africa. He gets lured into the search for an unknown item in the guise of a fishing charter. This turns into a web of intrigue as a bevy of unsavory characters try to get their fingers into the prize. Fletcher and his cohorts eventually decide to go after the treasure themselves. Along the way he falls for the sister of one of the players in this well thought out caper.The ending has a nice twist to it which left me with a very satisfied feeling as I completed the book."},{"Title":"Eye of the Tiger (Heinemann Guided Readers)","review":"I picked this up on a whim and was pleasantly suprised. The character of Harry and the supporting cast of enemies and allies were extremely entertaining. Lots of action that is thrilling without being insulting to the intelligence.I was reminded of Bond as Flemming wrote him. Not that there are similarities in terms of theme (this is not about secret agents) just in terms of the main character, the shady dealings and the wonderful action sequences. And of course Smith gives us what Flemming always gives us - world class villains."},{"Title":"Eye of the Tiger (Heinemann Guided Readers)","review":"Harry Fletcher lives a quiet life on St Mary's Island and he takes charters on board \\"Wave Dancer\\" for fishing and diving. Angelo and Chubby are his two assistants. But the inoffensive Harry once used to be called Harry Bruce and he used to practice the art of violence and sudden death in Malaya, Vietnam, the Congo and Biatra. Furthermore he used to lift complete collections of gold coins in the British Museum and cut diamonds in Amsterdam and to transport hundreds of millions of dollars worth of gold bars from Switzerland to Rome.One day three suspicious looking men, Charley Anderson, Mike Guthric and Jimmy North, want to hire Harry's boat claiming that they want \\"to do a little exploring\\" and that they need a full array of scuba diving and salvage equipment. Then they hand Harry a chart showing that they are interested in an area thirty miles north of the mouth of the Rovuma River. What are these men after?

First of all, \\"Eye of the Tiger\\" is one heck of a great read -- I must've read it 15 times myself, and have given it to all my friends (and girl-friends!) to read at one time or another. Harry Fletcher (the main character) is like an old friend to me; I feel I know the guy. And what a great guy he is, too! And as for the story, well it just zings along so smartly you'll be in heaven. What I love so much about Wilbur Smith is that (at his best) his language and description borders on literature, though HE doesn't agree, I'm told. This is not the case with all his books, however, and in recent years I have been disappointed. But most of the first 20 books he wrote are marvels of story telling, and one day I look forward to picking them up and starting all over again. It'll be a pleasant reminder of those dreamy teenage years. And quite frankly, after having read Hemingway and Melville and other giants of the adventure genre, I'm never so happy as when I'm immersed in a Wilbur Smith novel. If you have never had the pleasure, I envy you; you have some richly rewarding discoveries ahead. Thank you, Wilbur Smith for countless hours of reading ecstasy. Andy Todes (Born in South Africa, 1971, raised in Australia, currently living in the United States)."},{"Title":"Eye of the Tiger (Heinemann Guided Readers)","review":"When a friend found out that I am a big fan and avid reader of the Dirk Pitt novels, he said \\"if you like Cussler, you'll love Wilbur Smith.\\" I followed his advice and tried out Eye of the Tiger. This is the first Wilbur Smith novel I've read, and it definitely will not be the last. I'm definitely hooked!Why am I so hooked? It's an engrossing page-turner, it has lots of lively action, the bad guys are eminently hate-able without being cartoonish, the heros are believable and all the more lovable because they have such human foibles, and everything in the story is so believable.The hero (Harry Fletcher) is a manly-man who is able to think and fight his way out of apparently impossible situations, yet at the same time never comes across as an invincible superman. I think I also like him so much is that he is a reluctant hero. Circumstances are forced upon him, rather than him being sent in to save the world because he's the only one who could do it. In some ways, he is almost like Hemmingway's Old Man and the Sea, except that Wilbur Smith likes for his Hero to come out ahead in the end.But I think the part that I most appreciated was that there were so many unpredictable surprises and twists, yet in hindsight, all the clues were there. Let me explain. My wife refuses to watch a movie with me the first time she sees it, because the clues are so ibvious that I usually figure out who dunnit or what the big surprise will be early on, and can explain why. Either that, or I get mad because the clues are never presented at all and the hero figures it out only through knowledge of some totally arcane trivia or by way of some clue that the author never actually presents to us in the book (or movie). This sucks! At least give me a chance.Not so with this book! There were some wonderful twists that I found myself very happy to see because, in hindsight, the clues were all there, and it was totally valid for the hero to catch them, and I should have caught them to. For example, I didn't have to know about Flame Coral to draw the same conclusion Harry drew - I should have understood the implications of the other diver not knowing what it was. (You'll understand once you read the book).Bottom line: my friend was right. If you like Clive Cussler's Dirk Pitt novels, you WILL definitely like Wilbur Smith's Eye of the Tiger. I have already ordered a bunch more of Wilbur's books to add to my stack of Cussler novels."},{"Title":"Eye of the Tiger (Heinemann Guided Readers)","review":"Wilbur Smith is a master at taking action to the level of frenzy. If Pauline thought she was overwhelmed with perils, she ought to read &quot;The Eye of the Tiger.&quot; More than once when I was wondering how Harry Fletcher would survive an ordeal I discovered that his troubles were only beginning. In an underwater adventure he had to do in a giant moray eel, fought off sharks followed by bigger and meaner sharks, encountered poisonous coral. He ran out of breathing air, got the bends. He was beset with bad girls, battled waves of bad guys followed by badder guys, and meaner ones yet were on the way. Traitors lurked within his ranks.I found the story immensely entertaining. It has been a long time since I've been gripped so by a tale. I pursued it far into the night and finally had to make myself put it down.The circumstances surrounding the sailing ship Dawn Light, and how it was discovered what she carried and where she went down, were particularly well crafted. Captivating.Wilbur Smith dances dangerously close to the incredible time and again as he keeps his narrative running wildly along. Yet somehow he avoids that perilous step over the line of credibility.At least he did so until the very end. There he didn't step across the line but pole-vaulted over it. My delight was shattered by that one sledgehammer blow when he anchored a central theme of the story in quicksand. The premise underlying Sherry North's (or whoever she was) motivation was totally at odds with international maritime laws regarding salvage of treasure. England had no jurisdiction over a century-old shipwreck half a world away. No English government agency would have behaved as Smith described. We were not offered the flimsiest reason or justification for England's interest, much less involvement. It pummeled common sense. Smith obviously has the talent for imagining a plausible foundation for that critical aspect of the story. Why didn't he?There were other irritations, minor ones that would have gone unmentioned but for the colossal one. For instance, on his arrival in England Harry obtained a Benz from the Hertz depot. It continued as a Benz until midway through the episode, when it became a Chrysler. In the final scene, Harry narrates, &quot;I settled into the seat of the Swissair 727 and fastened my seat belt.&quot; Then two paragraphs later, &quot;As the Caravelle took off...&quot;The description on the back of this paperback edition begins, &quot;For a thousand years, an unimaginable treasure has rested on the bottom of the Indian Ocean.&quot; It had been on the ocean floor a hundred years, not a thousand."},{"Title":"Eye of the Tiger (Heinemann Guided Readers)","review":"If you're tired of the inflight magazine, pick this book up as I did on a recent trip back home from Chicago. I didn't realize I had read this before (I should have known, I've read all the other ones) but that did not stop me from getting caught up inthe story again.Smith walks the fine line between action novel and romance novel, in fact it was my mom who introduced me to his writing years ago, but Eye of The Tiger's 'manly' cover design won't get you any strange looks on the plane...He just draws you in. You feel like, &quot;Sure, I know what's it's like to dive in the Indian Ocean, fight off sharks, ride out a cyclone, no problem.&quot; I defy you to read a Wilbur Smith book without getting totally drawn into the story.Like I said - this one's great for a plane flight, just about the right length for coast-to-coast travel and perfect if you're longing for the sun.MM"},{"Title":"Eye of the Tiger (Heinemann Guided Readers)","review":"Reading this book was like reading Crichton or early Grisham except there was also something old-timey about it, too - like reading H.

If you are in the mood for a quick paced adventure book that has lots of fast action and violence to spare then you'll enjoy this book. The premise of a sunken treasure in the belly of an 18th century sunken ship makes for plenty of adventure and then some. I found the characters compelling enough without forming any real attachments to them but nonetheless interested in the outcome. This is my first Wilbur Smith novel and I would probably pick up another of his novels if I chanced across one. This book was definately written for pure adventure's sake.

His writing is bluff. Good, slick bluff, but bluff nevertheless.When the hero uses 29 rounds of automatic .223 to kill a man an arm's length away in his own boat when one round would have done he shows his ignorance.When the crooks try to kill the hero while the boat drifts just off dangerous coral reefs you see he knows nothing of either boats or the sea.When the hero, bathed by a cute young nurse sister, got what he describes as a monumental erection and she couldn't resist the temptation not to \\"waste it,\\" you see he knows nothing about people.The question is: what does he know? Anything?There is no truth here, no logic, no reason, nothing real at all. It's simply escapist trash, written for money, read to numb the reader's miserable existence and soon to be forgotten---as it will be in a generation, and deservedly so.

Then he meets a young man who has some clues to the whereabouts of a sunken sailing ship. Well, I won't ruin the story, but everything gets complicated after that and the bodies start to pile up. Harry, the hero with special ops experience, meets and falls in love with a younger woman who is also involved in the treasure hunt. Sound like a man's story yet?Wilbur Smith uses \\"lugubriously\\" in excess--that is to say more than zero. What a word. Yes, I figured it out without going to the dictionary, but it sure was a word that took me out of the story and slowed me down. Here is one of several uses: \\"That's right,\\" he agreed lugubriously, and pushed his filthy deep-sea cap to the back of his head.I liked \\"Cry Wolf\\" much better, but I still recommend this tale to any man interested in an African escape.----------------------------------------------------------------I'm quoting the one-star review by \\"Dr. Kingston\\" for the purpose of getting a response to his borrowing charges.

Anthony, Lucy Stone, and many others worked hard to get the vote for women. But reading this carefully edited volume of her letters will give you another view of her life: it was very quotidian. Family issues were a great concern, and she was the clerk of the females in her Quaker congregation. She cared deeply about slavery as well as about suffrage; these were her major issues but fairness in all things could have been her watchword.Beverly Palmer introduces us to her in an opening essay, and writes helpful clues as to the meaining of each section of letters, in addition to the complete and easy-to-understand footnotes, which bring out the context for each letter. She leaves center stage to Lucretia Mott, while giving us the tools we need to appreciate what she accomplished.At the time when the bandwagon for women's voting was getting rolling, her family life was heavily impacted and you can read her plaintive requests that the meetings far afield not be held so often, but then when others scheduled them anyway, her assurances that yes, she would attend and had written to others to make sure they'd be there too.Susan B. Anthony was such a dedicated person that she never married and had no children, and she saw how family life was drawing her colleagues in the fight out of the fray so she protested when each one became pregnant yet again. But Lucretia Mott did not; she was always supportive of both Susan (whom she offered to send some special tea to help her relax) and the married women with children who were also leading the movement. She undertook to write to influential men urging their support for the cause too. Reading these letters will give anyone a much clearer sense of what these women were up against.Reading a biography of Mott will provide some insights, but I would argue that you'll understand her a lot better by reading her own words. Very worthwhile book!"},{"Title":"Little Beaver And The Echo (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"We've owned this book since my oldest daughter (who is now 12) was a toddler.

You get pissed off on behalf of Carrie right from the beginning, and few authors do the \\"newspaper-clip\\" technique better than King. You get reports and interviews mixed in here and there, and by the end it doesn't matter that the story is about something completely unbelievable... it FEELS real, and that's all that matters."},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"Carrie is a novel that is often unfairly branded with the horror label because it was written by Stephen King. It's not a blood-and-guts, gory type of monster or ghost story, it's a drama/thriller with supernatural elements that would probably be labeled a tragedy if that was a term used for novels. The oppression suffered by the title character at the hands of her merciless classmates and fundamentalist mother seems all too realistic, and a good part of the book focuses on her torment in facing these real-life ordeals. The inclusion of her telekinesis, which finally empowers her to lash out at those who cause her misery, could be attributed to the fantasies of a young writer who had faced bullying and harassment himself in school hallways. Carrie is one of several stories King wrote about the bitterness and resentment young people experience as a result of social awkwardness and anxiety, including Christine and the Richard Bachman novel Rage. Carrie's most tragic quality comes from how King allows the character a brief moment of knowing how wonderful life can be, giving her a glimmer of hope that she can have the same happiness as everyone else, then subjecting her to traumatic pubic humiliation and the murderous religious fervor of her mother. Their deaths, and those of most of the town's graduating senior class, bring the tragedy to a close and leave the reader to ponder the cruelty and worthlessness of ostracizing or harassing people simply for being different. Carrie teaches a lesson as necessary today as it was 38 years ago when the book was published."},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"I was thinking about using this book for required reading for my American Literature class, but decided it was too inappropriate for our small town's southern traditional values. It was a neat story, though. Would really teach the students a lesson about bullying. I'll never think about prom the same way again!"},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"By now, everyone is most likely familiar with the story of Carrie. The movie adaptation, after all, has had a mighty and lasting impact on our pop culture landscape. I myself am a huge fan of the film, so over the years I've become intimately familiar with the story of young, troubled Carrieta White--raised in an ultra-religious household by an unforgiving, extremist mother; repeated victim of bullying at school; and in possession of a dangerous power with untapped, uncontrolled potential for destruction.This cycle of loneliness and abuse could have carried on indefinitely, until one fateful day poor, unlucky Carrie gets her period in the school's showers after gym class and the girls take their bullying too far. The unfortunate incident sets in motion a series of events culminating in a literal explosion of death and destruction on prom night.This is not a spoiler, by the way. Stephen King lets you know that you're in for a bloodbath (and when it will happen) from the very beginning. A friend once complained that this removes all suspense from the novel. I did not find this to be the case at all. First of all, the movie has pretty much spoiled the ending for any modern reader before they even pick the book up. But the suspense in the novel doesn't come from the traditional (some may say cliched) \\"what's gonna happen?\\" format anyway. What King does, in his first novel no less, is far more nuanced than that. Instead, suspense builds from the growing knowledge that when you began reading this novel you stepped onto a train that was already out of control. You could try to stop it, but there is too much momentum built up. There's a horrific crash coming and it is absolutely inevitable. The more King teases out the details, the more unsettling this knowledge becomes.There is, however, one quirk I could have done without. King has a way of interrupting his own sentences with parenthetical asides that usually reflect what someone, most often Carrie, is thinking. Perhaps it's the fact that the interruptions get their own paragraph that I find so irksome:\\"Carrie tried to swallow an obstruction and only\\"(i am not afraid o yes i am)\\"got rid of part of it.\\"In the beginning it serves as an interesting, if slightly awkward, way to glimpse inside Carrie's mind. But as the story progresses and the asides become more frequent they get to be a nuisance. If I had to guess, I'd suppose King was trying to heighten the drama of the final act by fragmenting the prose to disorient the reader. But I'm not a novelist, so what do I know? At any rate, the overall effect is to make it feel disjointed more than anything else.Some people complain about the use of 'source material' supposedly written years after the novel's events transpire, but I enjoyed them. It gives you a sense of the lasting implications of the plot--showing how Prom Night (as it is known) sends ripples out into the world for decades to come. The only one I could have done without is the very last letter excerpt, which gives the novel a cheap, Twilight-Zone-ish coda promising more mayhem to come--a point the 'source material' had already gotten across, and much more subtly, in my opinion.I've always been a fan of King's early work but for some reason I had never read his first novel before now. What a treat. Carrie was always a timeless story but it feels even more urgent and timely now, in a post-Columbine world where bullying and its consequences have come into the national spotlight.Grade: A-"},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"It's difficult to convey the impact Carrie had on the horror field in 1974.First of all, there was hardly a separate genre for it. Mostly it was people who liked HP Lovecraft and Robert E Howard. Good stuff, but remote from our daily lives. A few blockbuster novels paved the way for Stephen King: Rosemary's Baby, The Other and The Exorcist.Yet none of them captured the feel of everyday, ordinary reality, especially for young people.In some ways, it's flawed just for being told in the form of documents and newspaper clippings, like some older horror stories. In that sense, the movie is better because it's straight narrative.King pulls no punches. The in-crowd kids are just so mean. Carrie's mother is not simply religious, she's a flat-out lunatic. The final pig's blood prank is just so cruel.Carrie is still a good book to start reading King with. If you can't take it, you'll be wasting your time with his later books. If he's to your taste, it'll be an appetiser for the longer works.It's his shortest stand-alone work, but it's just as powerful as anything he's written since."},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"I have seen the movie a couple of times but recently when I was re-watching \\"LOST\\" I remember Juliette saying that it was her favorite book during the \\"Others\\" book club meeting. So I wanted to read it, I have always been a fan of Stephen King, his ability to make seemingly mundane communities into hotbeds of the battle for good and evil. So Carrie is the daughter of two religious fanatics, while reading this book I couldn't help thinking \\"This is what happens when religion goes off the rails!\\" Her mother is intent on making her into a sinless human, which is impossible, she basically sets Carrie up to be ostracized in her small town. Carrie, as one of her neighbors states was a curious child with a sweet face but when Margaret White begins her seventeen year crusade to make her a 'good girl' the result is a daughter that is painfully shy and withdrawn. Carrie is not necessarily scary in my opinion it is the kind of book that is subtly creepy, reading about the build up to Carrie's melt down, I completely understand and I sympathize because it seems that everyone was too busy with their own agenda to actually stop and realize that Carrie had feelings too. Until it was too late. This book was a fast read and I throughly enjoyed it. It only took me one and a half days to read it. Which is always a good sign. *Highly Recommend!*"},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"I know I'll probably get blasted for even having a neutral opinion of the book, it being King's first and a 'classic', but I've got to be honest.I've had a passing interest with King over the years. But, seeing as I'm a rookie author looking to get into horror, I've decided to read King's entire library of books in chronological order since the man has helped shape what modern day America sees as 'horror'.After sitting down and making a lengthy list of all his work, minus the screenplays and the works he's done with famous musicians, I went to the library and picked up Carrie.Immediately, I could see the 'Stephen King' in the story. That distinctive style he has was present even then, but it was clear that he wasn't anywhere near fully developed yet. I liked the articles about 'the event', as it came to be known, because one thing that I love is a clinical, logical, scientific analysis of something decidedly unnatural or paranormal, but ultimately these became annoying, as the events they described were immediately rehashed directly following them.I don't have much else to comment on because not much else stuck out. The end was pretty spectacular, and reminded me of Under the Dome's conclusion. Ultimately I think this would have been a much better novella, but I can understand why he didn't make it so. Until recently, there has been no real market for novellas, as they look pathetic as paperbacks.On to 'Salem's Lot."},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"Carrie, one of the best books I have ever read, has a dark and mysterious aura. With the reader not truly knowing what is going to happen next. I personally have always enjoyed Stephen King's distinctive ways of telling a story. I think he is one of the most descriptive authors of all time.The reader generally does not expect what is going to happen next in the book, as the main character doesn't either. Carrie White is not a regular girl. Everyday she gets constant ridicule and jeering, to then share wit the reader her pain is truly makes this book irresistible!Carrie White has never had a real friend, let alone a boyfriend. Everyday she puts up with crap from people who get treated like prince and princesses. Anybody that doesn't sympathize for this girl would definitely not enjoy this book. I recommend this book to anybody who likes a sufficient story, full of life and un-imaginable things.Though, I do not recommend this book to people with a weak stomach. Readers beware; anybody who is not used to blood and gore is not fit to handle this. This is book is a fantastic novel, I will say that this is not for the squeamish. Over all, this is an excellent book for most people who are fans of semi-realistic stories, and or Stephen King."},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"Even after remembering the movie (and the remake), this book still caught me off-guard at several moments for one particular reason: the movies are told from a singluar point-of-view, whereas the story itself is told from multiple (both first- and third-person) points, and also from different, yet dependent, timelines. This may keep some readers from trying (many only want straightforward reading so they won't have to think too hard), yet from all the scenes that happen (occasionally more than once), it helps understand the scenes better, more in an enhanced way, you could say.Though it is rather short from what I'm used to (at 199 pages), it seemed to go by rather quick, yet it deep have a lot of depth, not just from individual characters, but also a few \\"case studies\\" that appear to help the story go further. Constant foreshadowing, though I already saw the movies, were intriguing.The last thing that seemed really unique was how this story doesn't have chapters, but breaks from different points of views. All in all, this one book, written to break all the rules expected of first-time authors as well as social standards of the '70's (and written to literally be ahead of its time and show extremist religion to be a hardcore burden disguised to the worshipper as a \\"good\\" thing), and written in its unqiue form, I can see why Stephen persisted against the 41 rejections to become a best-selling/best-known author."},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"A classic in the horror genre, and written over thirty years ago, this book is still very enjoyable. I read it to get in the appropriate Halloween spirit, and I must say, Carrie certainly fit the bill!On a traumatic afternoon in the group showers after PE Carrie gets her first period. After being picked on by her classmates for years, this only makes it worse. Her extremely religious mother has never told her about periods. Then unexplainable things start to happen around Carrie.. Resulting in a horrible night the world won't forget soon.Having read a few books of Mr King (including It and Insomnia) I have seen quite a bit of his writing style. This was one of the first of his shorter books I have read. Even though I enjoy his longer work, it was nice to see him focus on one storyline for a change, with just a small cast of characters. One of the things I always enjoy in his books is how he portrays the character's thoughts. He understands that thoughts are rarely full formed sentences, but more like snippets of memories and impressions.Mr King's other big strength lies in describing dysfunctional relationships. The relationship between Carrie and her extremist mother was wonderfully crafted. Instead of making her mother a monster, he adds a touch of humanity that makes her into a three-dimensional character. The same thing with Carrie herself; you know from very early on in the story that she will probably kill some people. You don't know how, but you get the feeling she will. Yet still, the only thing I wanted to do was to hug her and tell her everything would be al right. She's just a sweet girl, pushed too far.Carrie is a collection of newspaper scraps, reports, scientific books, a memoir, and the \\"real\\" storyline. I quite liked the idea; but towards the ending I wished that there was more \\"real\\" and less other stuff. At times it took a bit of speed out of the story.For people that want to read some Stephen King, but don't know where to start, I would certainly recommend Carrie. It's a great story, and I will probably read it again sometime!"},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"Carrie was an interesting book that started off slow ,but near the middle I could not put it down. Reading quickened as the suspense grew. Carrie was an unusual character with extreme problems. What's sad is that many high school students have the same problems of being picked on or bullied. This story was imaginative (What else would you expect from King!) and held my attention throughout the entire book. I especially enjoyed the way he put in clips from papers and magazines to help tell the story. This book was unlike any I currently have read, and I thouroughly enjoyed it!"},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"This is a good book, like most of King's works. This is far from his best though, but is still a notable work.This book has 3 parts, but the frusterating part is there is no chapters! It can be very frusterating at times. But that is the only major thing that is wrong with the book.Storywise, this is a pretty enjoyable book. It starts with Carrie getting made fun of and pushed down into the ground, then she gets her revenge. The ending of the book is better and more shocking then the movie, while the movie has some better parts.Overall, this book does have its flaws, but is still OK. This isn't really a book for kids, but it is tamer then a lot of his work. Still, there is bad content for youngsters, and it is somewhat scary. Enjoy it, it is fun to read King's older works and compare to the new stuff."},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"This is the first of many Stephen King books. To think that King originally at one point threw the draft copy of this in the trash (to later be rescued by his wife.) is almost unimaginable. This novel is fast and brutally honest about being an outcast in high school. It is written in a very strange form but the excitement is still there. If you've never read this book you're not a true King fan. Much different from the film but just as fast and gorey. ESP powers and being outcasted are a bad combination."},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"Absolutly 100% addictive! I read this book in 2 days! I could not put it down.

He loves to scare a person. With Carrie the way he brings real live experienced into this book is wonderful. After you read this book you can see how this can happen in real life.

Carrie is tormented and teased to the breaking point by her more popular schoolmates. They do find out how aperson can get back at them for the years that Carrie was tormented by this. I really did enjoy this book. It is not a scarey as some of his other books but just as good."},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"This book explores what most of us would have done if we had a special, explosive powers when we were in high school. King explores what all of us wish at some point we could have done to those who choose to taunt and bother us. This book is superbly written and keeps your interest to the quickly coming end. This is a great book to read for those who seem to have the misconception that most of what King writes is blood and gore. (which would include most people)"},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"I thought it was a bland tasteless book with no debth. The only part I enjoyed was the crazy mother. Other than that it was not as good as many people think."},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"I haven't read much Stephen King, but I know how needless it is to mention that he is clearly the man one goes to when they're craving a tale to chill their bones and goose their bumps. However, his debut novel \\"Carrie\\", as it isn't a horror story, proves that he can do a lot more than that as well.Carrie is a heart-breaking story about a misfit girl trying to cope with her social status in high school where one's peers, as we all know, aren't always the nicest people around. Sidebar: Carrie is telekinetic, meaning that she can move and control objects with nothing more than a thought. However, unlike one may have been lead to believe (this novel's reputation precedes it), Carrie isn't the true villain of this tale. What King has done here is created a documentary-style book with some third-person narrative mixed in, all to demonstrate how horrible teenagers can be to their peers. Even the most moral of the characters here are somehow transfixed by the mob mentality that overtakes them, pushing them into cruelty that they wouldn't have expected from themselves--cruelty aimed at one particular student.The ideas King brings about here are timeless, as is his writing, but some of the pop-culture references he makes (I'm twenty years old) are lost on me. However, that didn't bug me as much as the switching back and forth between point-of-view in the climax. During the bulk of the novel, it was great to see things from other people's POVs. We saw through Carrie's eyes, her classmate's, her teacher's, and even fictional clippings from documents exploring Carrie's past. However, during the actual climax of the novel, it was a bit too much. The patches of story that were told through Carrie's eyes were the most interesting, as it fascinates me to feel pity for someone who, for all purposes, should be considered a \\"villain\\" by the end of the book. However, there is none of that black-and-white, this is good-and-evil end-of-story nonsense here. This book explores that grey area, quite effortlessly.While this book wasn't perfect, it was an entertaining, sad, and disturbing read that kept me thinking about it long after I put the book down after each short reading session. With true-to-life characters that you can both love and hate, sympathize with and want to shake, this book--even with those pesky pop-references--is a timeless work.8/10"},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"Carrieby Stephen KingReview by ericappChamberlain, Maine, where Stephen King's Carrie is based is a small, quiet town. That serenity all changes when an always-teased, outcast high school senior, who just happens to be possessed with telekinetic powers, is the butt of another of her classmates' pranks, and she decides to get even with the world. The story of Carrie, whose dominating life factors are her religious-nut mother and her not-so-nice classmates, is told through magazine articles and investigative reports by witnesses and classmates who survived her onslaught.Carrie White is one of those on-the-outs types that exist in every class. You know the sort: that person has pimples but not friends, is shy, dresses different, is not like anybody else, and is always picked on. Having been raised by an off-the-wall, domineering mother, Margaret White, who believes dating, thinking about sex, and having relationships are sin, how could Carrie be anything but dissimilar? The difference between Carrie and the exile classmates that you and I know is that Carrie possesses telekinetic powers.In the story, Carrie experiences her period for the first time in the school's locker room shower, and she has no idea what has happened (her mother never told her). Her classmates make fun of her, and they get in trouble for it. Sue Snell, one of the disciplined classmates, is distraught for her actions and wants to make it up to Carrie. Sue coerces her boyfriend, the popular Tommy Ross, to take Carrie to the senior prom. Not all of the seditious girls are as forgiving though: Chris Hargeson, another of the subversive girls, decides the senior prom is the perfect opportunity to really humiliate Carrie. After Tommy and Carrie are named king and queen and are on the stage, pig's blood pours onto Carrie from the gymnasium's ceiling. For Carrie, that's the final straw, and now it's time for revenge.What I liked most about the book is that the characters--both the good and the bad--can be related to by most of us. Haven't we all at one time or another been nasty to those around us and also have been at the other side of the spectrum--picked on? When put in a defenseless position, a typical person will wish he either had the skill to fight back or a \\"special\\" power. Although not as good as some of his later work--like Pet Sematary and Christine--King does a good job of putting the reader in each of the character's shoes, and he also makes the characters and situations seem real. Also, the book is not nearly as gory or horrifying as advertised; it is simply a story of an out-of-the-ordinary girl who settles the score.Though not King's best scribe, Carrie is an easy read, moves along quickly, and is always interesting. I would recommend this book for all readers.***1/2 stars"},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"I am 13 so it was tough reading this book but it was a great start to the Stephen king collection!"},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"Well, maybe the phrase 'kids nowadays' isn't quite all proper and may even be so obvious for saying this. But is the true horror in this book about Carrie's strange family and her own power OR is it what kids did to lead up to that night? I say the latter.In this modern, kids-bully-over-the-internet-and-followed-by-suicide-or-the-victim-goes-on-shooting-rampage world I see this book as a good lesson for that. Sure, some may still argue about the power mentioned in this book but Carrie's ability is just the method. Change that to a gun, and you will see that the core message remains the same- do not bully anyone and do not be the part of anonymous crowd to just watch, and pretend there was nothing to be done.

Carrie is a very unique character. She grew up under the surveillance of a very religious and controling mother who believed that everything related to sex was demoniac. In that kind of environment, the kid couldn't be anything but kind of crazy herself. That would be fine, if she wasn't motive of laughter in the school, and if she hadn't one very special power: telekinetics. The book is very easy to read.

But over all it was an exccelent book!"},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"What an excellent book! I saw the movie, when my parents told me that it was originally a Stephen King novel.

This makes me want to read more of Mr. King's books..."},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"I thought that this book was totally dumb from beginning to end. It had absolutely no plot whatsoever. The movie was way better than the book. It was about this girl named Carrie (of course) who was tormented by all of her classmates. Eventually when you get farther into the story you and her discover that she has these powers called telekinisis. Towards the middle of the story a popular guy named Tommy Ross asks her out to the prom. So when they get there people are staring at them. They win high school king and queen and when they get up on the stage, what happens is unbelieveable. I don't recommend this book to anyone. ..."},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"No one said Stephen King is a literary writer, andthis novel, like all his others, proves that pointaptly."},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"I hated this book!It was fine at the begining but it got really boring around the middle....I think if Carrie's mother wasn't so religous,then Carrie would have turned out alright.But why did Stephen King stop half way through the book and start telling us about what people did to her when we already know...."},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"This is a book that I can't believe has taken me so long to get around to reading! Carrie, by Stephen King is one of the classics of the horror genre and, indeed, was the one that really launched King's career.I have to say that it was pretty much what I expected, at least plot-wise. This is early Stephen King, and I really like early Stephen King. The book was shorter than I had thought but it was told in a unique way (something I often find with King's works). We see the fairly straight forward plot unfold from a variety of viewpoints, from the protagonist's own eyes, from other characters as the events take place, but more uniquely, from the perspective of newspaper accounts, court testamony, and the autobiography of one of the major charcters in the novel. And all of these perspectives are interwoven to tell the tale. Sounds complicated but it all fits together nicely and keeps the reader turning pages.The plot itself is a bit dated by today's standards of shock horror. The scenes we see are, indeed, shocking...horrifyingly so and yet for somebody like myself that has read lots of King as well as other horror writers...it seemed less shocking somehow. I have never seen the movie staring Sissy Spacek but I have seen pictures from it showing Carrie at the prom, covered in blood. I had visions of reading the book and being grossed out at how so much blood could come to be but it does have a non-horrific, logical explanation (I won't spoil it for you). This novel is much less a gore fest novel than a novel of a bullied girl that finally has taken all she can take and snaps...to get revenge. We hear of the destruction of the town, bit by bit but we \\"see\\" very little of it. Since this is Stephen King's first published novel, it is easy to compare it to his later works and see how he has grown as a writer.Definitely worth the read if this one has escaped you so far."},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"I was taken by this book when I first read it and it still remains one of my favorite King novels.The atmosphere is dark and oppressive and you can feel Carrie's pain come off the words of the page as she deals with general alienation and an extreme and painful home life.It is a quick read compared to many of King's works, such as The Stand or even shorter books by him where the reading is a bit more difficult to get through than this.A classic of horror with the usual twist of humanity, and in humanity, that are in all his writings."},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"King's first real success is a novel that brings the meld of weakness and retribution to an extreme degree. An oft fantasized example of the prey turning the tables on the tormentors. It's a story that many can relate to, though most will not admit. This time vengance is not served cold."},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"I've been one of Mr. King's \\"Constant Readers\\" for years. However, my reading of his tales began with Gerald's Game and, until this past year, I never read anything published before it.I now realize how unfortunate that was! The past few months have allowed me to rediscover Stephen King in an entirely new light. I finished Carrie this evening from my Kindle. (I've been THRILLED about all the classic King works popping up reguarly, as of late, in Kindle format. KEEP THEM COMING AMAZON!) While it hasn't been my favorite of the older works (Hey I read It and The Stand during this team; tough acts to follow to say the least!) it was an utterly captivating read. The printed version is some 200 pages, and it did feel such. It's a must read, for... well... anyone."},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"CarrieBy Sai HendrijStephen Kings Carrie is a book of the horror genre; it describes the isolation of teenage youth at an evanescent level. Basically often unseen by anyone who is not a teenager themselves or someone who can relate to that feeling. That's the main reason I recommend it to the teenage public more so than adults and much more so than the younger audiences.To start, Carrie is a teenage girl who still has not reached puberty. Until now on her sixteenth year and with it has come a new type of power. The TK gene in her body is growing and is now taking affect and when her mother and the whole student body takes their cruel jokes a little too far Carrie will pull the strings in the biggest and worst, first, and last joke of her lifeOverall reviewAll in all I thought that Carrie was an awesome book. Considering the fact that horror stories are the only ones I can really get into. I think Stephen King did a great job especially for such an old society he lived in. I feel that I should also commend on the news articles that switch time schemes from the past and present without being confusing about what was still happening. It was also a different kind of way of building suspense up to the pinnacle of the story.This is a book you should definitely read.Recommended for ages 15+For alcohol sexual references and violence"},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"The first novel from Stephen King shows the beginnings of what most people have come to love in his works, but the book has lost some of its impact as the years have gone by. Still a really good read and considerably short compared to most King novels. Great place to start if you have never read Stephen King before (if there is anyone out there who hasn't)"},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"Carrie is only the second book I have read by Stephen King, and I loved it. It is a story about a outcast teen with telekinesis trying to be normal. With her obsessive religious mother and be tomented at school she manages. But when she is pushed to far she unleashes her power and takes it out on the whole town and the people in it.I think Carrie was and unexpectedly good book. I really enjoyed reading it and couldn't put it down. I can't wait to read another of King's facinating novels."},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"Vintage Stephen King. We loved it. I had not read it but had seen the movie. I enjoyed the read."},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"The film adaptation of King's first novel is a horror classic. The iconic image of Sissy Spacek covered in blood at her prom is so well-known that it's hard to re-visit the novel without knowing exactly where it's heading. The newspaper clippings, letters, and book \\"excerpts\\" that make up much of the novel don't make for a terribly exciting read, unfortunately. If you're interested to see Stephen King learn to write before your eyes, you'll want to pick this book up just to see how much he grew between \\"Carrie\\" and \\"Salem's Lot.\\""},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"I read this book a long time ago (or at least started to) and have seen the original movie probably countless times. I picked this book up at a second-hand store and decided to give it another read and maybe better understand the book. I finished it in one sitting.While the ending isn't as great as the original movie's ending and I found the fake medical journal excerpts to be annoying (as well as the lack of actual chapters) I still thought it was a pretty good book. The one thing that I think the book achieved that the movie lacked was giving Carrie an actual voice. In the book you get to know so much more of what's going on inside her head as well as see how she deals with her powers as they grow. I also think that the book gave you a better understanding of Chris and Billy - the way their relationship was.Overall I think that the book and movie should go hand and hand."},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"I have become really turned off by a lot of Stephen King's books, because he overwrites (this is why I gave up on Bag of Bones and The Tommyknockers). The underlying ideas for those books were really good, but he couldn't get to the point. HOWEVER, Carrie is a great audiobook. The story is very interesting and it moves along well. Sissy Spacek is excellent as the reader. I couldn't shut the MP3 player off...got through the book in just a few days. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"From first to eighth grade, I was the victim of everyone in my school's harrassment and bullying. I found my locker vandalized, the kids would hide my homework, they called me horrible names, and threw things at me. When I told my teachers of my harrassment, they never believed me.I had heard of Stephen King's Classic Carrie before, and knew it was about a harrassed teenage girl. So when I was about eleven or twelve, I read this book and I knew exactly how she felt.Well about the book...Carrie is about a homely, misunderstood sixteen-year-old girl. Her father is dead, and her mother is a crazed religious person. In the beginning of the novel, Carrie gets her first period, and hasn't the slightest idea what menstration was, and the girls in her locker room all laugh the throw pads and tampons at her. She is dismissed from school, and her mother finds out her daughter has gotten her period and severly beats her. Prom night comes, and out of pity, a handsome boy takes Carrie to the Prom, and her other peers dump a bucket of pig blood all over her. Then with her outstanding telekinetic powers, Carrie gets her revenge.Besides this book being beautifully written, Stephen King has given high-school kids a good message: SHOW RESPECT FOR YOUR FELLOW CLASSMATES. I am almost a somphmore now, and have gotten help for my bullying."},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"This book Carrie by: Stephen King was about a high school girl named Carrie White who has telekinesis powers. Her mother is abusive, her father died, She had no friends, no one likes her, and she is having a bad high school year. Kids made up stories about her; everyone made fun of her and blamed her for everything that went wrong. Some of the kids wanted revenge, for what had happened in the girl's locker room. Their way of revenge on Carrie is setting her up, to go to the prom with some boy and a tragedy had happened the night of the prom. For them doing that to Carrie the town had a big problem ahead of them. I felt that this book started off slow, and advanced on and got better. The beginning of the book didn't catch my attention as much as the middle and the end did. The middle and the end got better; it had more action, and more meaning. The book catches you in the moment, even though it starts off slow you don't want to put it down. If you haven't read this book yet you should, because it is good, once you get past the beginning."},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"In this book, a tormented girl names Carrie has no friends, gets made fun of and can't take it any more. Oh, and she has telekinetic powers that she ends up using in very bad ways.What chaos she causes when she rampages through Chamberlain, main, once a quiet town, now covered in ash, darkened skies and downed power lines. The inhabitants of this town are trembling with fright as the news about the school prom, Carrie destroying the school, and the people dying as the destruction she wreaks passes through.Adding to the mayhem, Carrie's mother is insane, about God especially, and, to her, Carrie is the devil's spawn because of the evil she thinks her \\"cursed\\" daughter unveils in this exciting thriller."},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"This is the second book i read of Stephen King after Hearts in Atlantis and i must say each book sometimes makes me feel emotions I don't want to.The character &quot;Carrie&quot; was a brilliant one and it definitely opened my eyes to the subject of TK.I felt great pain for Carrie and everyone around the world like her who have to go through some very very rough years in school and sometimes also in university and feel ashamed of how we treat people without thinking."},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"After reading The Green Mile, another novel by Stephen King, I decided to see if Carrie stood up to the same level of greatness. Regarded as \\"Gory and horrifying...you can't put it down,\\" by the Chicago Tribune, Carrie entertains readers with an eerie story of a young girl growing up in Chamberlain, Maine as the focal point of others' ridicule and cruel jokes. Margaret White, Carrie's mother and also a religious zealot, plays a large role in why her daughter is always teased. Carrie possesses a special telekinetic power and often times expresses her bottled-up frustration by utilizing her power. One day at school, Carrie is asked by a popular boy to accompany him to the prom. Thinking the many years of taunting are approaching an end, she agrees to his request. Once at the prom, Carrie realizes she was wrong about the teasing, but this time her classmates take things a little too far and drive her over the edge. The future of Chamberlain now lies in the hands of Carrie White.Carrie is a swift read, full of colloquial dialogue, horror, and various literary devices that make the story very interesting. I really enjoyed reading Carrie and plan to continue with more Stephen King novels. I recommend this book to all those in search of a good book, excluding young students because of the many sexual references that are found throughout the story. Overall I rate it four stars out of five because the setting often changes from past to present, causing some confusion."},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"Great Book. Carrie is made fun of constantly in school, but does nothing about it. She takes the abuse and tries to keep her cool. However as the book progresses, Carrie anger and hurt begins to boil. She has a strong hatred for everyone in her life and is learning how to use her newly found telekinetic powers. Everyone is in for a big surprise!"},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"Ok Carrie is my favorite Stephen King book. The moment I read about it I new I had to read the rest. Anyway, it's about a high school girl (named Carrie, duh) who is tricked and tormented by her classmates and abused by her religously nuts mother,until she learns that she is telekinetic....(later in the book, at the prom) She gets her last trick. With her power she kills most of the people, not only at the prom, but most of the town too.....Rated: (R), for STRONG language and ... activities."},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"I had been planning to read a Stephen King book for a long time, and I decided why not start with first, and most classic, book CARRIE? I started reading it on Saturday Morning. I was done with it by Sunday Afternoon. The first two paragraphs of CARRIE just reel you in, and it's a hook you're glad to be stuck on.CARRIE is about a character named Carrie White, who is the one outcast that everyone only pays attention to when they're in search of a good, cruel laugh. There's one thing they don't know about her, and that is that Carrie is telekenetic (T.K.), a mental condition where the effected mind can be capable of amazing feats, sometimes even deadly ones...and when a girl like Carrie has that power, no one knows what might happen. Stephen King shows all sides of the story beautifully by having various characters revolving around Carrie, and all the well-thought-out bits of information about Carrie herself from books, court testimonials and such.I give it only four stars out of five because near the end of the novel, there was more action than I wanted, so I became slightly bored. But as soon as it went back to Carrie's Point-of-View, I was once again hooked.This book, in itself, is very shocking. The sexual terms that Stephen King uses in his writing are always shocking, but for some reason, I wanted to read more of the shock material. I think that in our minds, we always yearn for what we're reading to go over our usaual boundries, and CARRIE most certainly does that.Because of the shock material, I would recommend this book for anyone older than a very mature twelve year old. It's a great book to just sit down with, read, and enjoy the ride!"},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"Considering that this was a first novel, it is wonderfully assured. And to this day, i am convinced that it remains one of Stephen King's very best books. For a start, it is one of his shortest, and thus more concentrated. Its a very emotional and powerful book, telling a simple story in a simple way. Personally, i could describe it most aptly as a huantingly beautiful tale.Carrie is great character, and the way she is treated by her peers brings a tear to the eye (as does King's foreword in the english version, telling how he came to write the story. Heartbreaking, if you're of that kind of disposition.) However, the only place this book may fall down under close scrutiny is the fact that there is perhaps not enough detail of past events in Carries life involving her classmates constsnt mocking of her. Indeed, some may call that adding unnecessary cruelty to the book, but personally, i feel it would have given the book even more emotional impact, and made Carrie's final actions even more believeable, scary and yet empathiseable with. We are told that Carrie is bullied, but we aren't shown. Not quite enough, anyway.Needless to say, this is an excellent novel, full of power and emotion. It comes straight from the heart, to attack the reader. For we have all commited similar sins against people like Carrie. This book works so brutally well because of several reasons. The guilty of the reader, the sorrow of the reader, the sympathy of the reader with Carrie, and the disgust of the reader against Chris, even though i suspect many of us see elements of her in actions we have commited in our pasts.The inclusions of entries and excerpts from letters/textbooks/diaries is good. Some people say that they are only there to make a short book longer, but if you actually take proper notice, all of them help towards telling a little part of the story. They are merely a different aspect of King's narration, but still valid.This is an incredibly good book, and i am positive that it is still one of Stephen King's very very best. (Alongside \\"it\\" \\"The Stand\\" \\"The Dark Half\\" \\"The Shining\\" \\"'salem's Lot\\" and \\"Pet Sematary\\".) I feel that he deserved a round of applause when this was published. And i am sure he is worthy of it as it continues today."},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"Stephen King made a big, bloody splash with his first novel CARRIE, written in the early 70's and published in 1974. It ushered in a new era in Horror fiction. Instead of Gothic Horror dealing with vampires, or Frontier Horror dealing with werewolves, this was the genesis of Modern Horror: taking a modern-day dramatic situation using ordinary, everyday characters and letting the horror grow out of the situation and the characters.I can see that, when the book was released, how CARRIE was lauded as a modern masterpiece. I guess it is; after all, it put Stephen King on the map and began the career of the most successful American novelist of our times. The advent of Modern Horror was momentous---and a cash cow---for the fiction industry. But I saw the film first (actually, at least three or four times before buying and reading the book), and by comparison, it disappointed me. I liked the narrative of the film better, I found Carrie more sympathetic in the film (for example, in the book, she knows she will kill her mother when she gets home) and I just flat-out enjoyed it more. However, for any Stephen King fan, I definitely recommend going back to the beginning, where it all started for him---and us.RECOMMENDED; AGES 14 &amp; UP."},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"I was a little reluctant to read Stephen King's Carrie. As I wasn't impressed with the movies and have been ridiculed for sharing Carrie's name, I wasn't sure. But as soon as I found it shoved behind a rack of books at a dusty public libaray, I knew it was serendipity. I was immediatley taken in by Stephen King's writing style. He makes you feel comfortable, and it doesn't seem like a horror story until something tramautic happens, as shown in It and Carrie. The point of the story is Carrie White, a girl who has been ruined by her religious fanatic mother and happens to have telekinesis. The story is told through interviews, newspaper articles, and some experiences of Carrie, all leading up to prom night. Stephen King is a MASTER, and of Misery, 'Salem's Lot, Night Shift, and Christine, this is his BEST.Do yourself a favor. Read Carrie and be spellbound"},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"I have recently just finished reading the book titled Carrie By: Stephen King. I feel that this book has got to be one of my favorite books that I have read in a while. I like to read and when I read books like this it really makes me want to read more. This book, unlike others gives you a feel for what the main character \\"Carrie White\\" has been going through for her whole life. Carrie White is just a really nice innocent girl who just want to have a couple of friends but is constantly picked on by her peers. Then when she goes home all she has is a religious mother who forces her to pay horrible prices for her \\"sins.\\" She doesn't have any friends and her mother won't even let her have any friends, she says it is the \\"devil\\". One day just like any other day she goes to school and goes into the locker room just like she would any day. After P.E. she gets out of her clothes and steps into the shower with the other girls to wash up when suddenly she feels blood running down her leg. The other girls tell her it is her period but she just doesn't listen, she tought she was dying. The other girls started throwing tampons at her. From that day on Carrie has been tormented for life she couldn't even go to school with out being told something.She was invited to the prom by this really nice guy and she decided that she wanted to go. She went home and made her dress and went to the prom. When she arrived there something so horrible happened you wouldn't believe that teenagers could be so mean to one girl.Once you read this book you will just fall in love with it. Once you pick it up you won't want to put it down, you will be up all night reading it. I have read a couple of Stephen King's books and I really enjoy them. If you have read any of his books you would know what I mean. What suddenly brought on this idea for this book. Was he tormented in his youth, or was his wife? If so his writing has been his worst revenge. I recomend this book to all of my friends and family members and especially you!It is a really great choice of book for anyone into mystery and horror types of books."},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"...we have Carrie White, the mousey, constantly put-upon brunt of everyone's joke with the ferocious gift in Stephen King's first published novel. Originally released in 1974, it was a harbinger of the vicious talent King himself would demonstrate for blowing us all away book after book after book.Carrie's is an apocraphal tale of the ultimate loser, the ultimate prank, and the ultimate revenge. It is also a razor sharp examination of the kid-Cuisinart known as high-school, its often comical and cynical tone belying King's own past as a weary English teacher. Thrown into the mix is the obligatory-for-70's-horror religious allegory, with mother Margaret White an overpowering vision of evangelical madness and Carrie her sacrificial Jesus figure. And King also taps into the taboo of mysterious and often terrifying female biologogy to unforgetably shock the audience...the opening is a shower scene as worthy of timelessness as Hitchcock's Psycho.All the King's literary touches are present: excerpts from newsclippings and after-the-fact biographies to provide different access points into the story, the italicized(my god will I string together another awkward compound sentence)inner-thoughts of the characters, the telegraphing of story elements to sharpen the dread of the inevitable doom to come. It's all here, and while it may be as subtle as a nuclear first strike, it's never boring and always cathartic. Upon release it proved Stephen King a force to be reckoned with, as the master of disaster draws first blood."},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"A classic horror story, in which the reader will feel both deep compassion for and great fear of the main character.

The book was hard to get into. For the most part, it reads like a text book, with news articles that completely take you out of the story. There are too many of them and they interrupt the flow of the story, making it a real chore to read. The first scene is great, a classic scene, actually, but once it's over you are bombarded with the news articles. If I wanted to read so many news articles, I'd pick up the newspaper and have at it. I don't, that's why I picked up this novel. King uses the articles to tell the story instead of a normal narrative, sacrificing an enjoyable read.To put it bluntly, there are better Stephen King novels out there. I don't recommend newbs starting with this one. King had a great premise here but it wasn't executed well at all. A real shame, too. Anyone interested in this story might do well watching the movie instead, which was undoubtedly better."},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"Although Rage and The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger pre-date Carrie, this was the first novel Stephen King ever published. The rest is history. Strange how things work out. The right time, the right place and the most popular author on the planet is born. Had Carrie been published today, would Stephen King be the publishing icon that he is now? Great question. What's the answer? I doubt it. As a first novel, Carrie takes us back to high school where Carrie White, the unfortunate 'out' girl is constantly tormented by the more popular kids. Her face is not pretty and her clothes are not fashionable and her mother is a phychotic religious fanatic and that spells ultra persecution for Carrie. But....she has telekinesis. Best not to f*ck with her. Right? No, lets dump pig's blood all over her at the prom as a joke. Kids will never learn and Carrie unleashes hell on earth to those who humiliate her and those who are just unfortunate enough to be there.Great.Wow!Stupendous....Not really. Carrie is a good effort by a man who would become a legend and that is really all. There is nothing extraordinary about Carrie as a novel. It could have been written by anyone.

Carrie is a very unattractive High School girl and is picked on by the prettier schoolgirls.But Carrie just might have the \\"last laugh\\" on them because she has the Power Of Telekenisis i.e, the ability to move objects using her mind. This is King's literary debut and in this book we see his usage of a Graphic Shocking Scene in a girl's shower room. This attempt to Shock the reader then became one of King's trademarks in his future novels. This book is way too long as King plays his \\"one note song\\" as was obviouly \\"padded out\\" so it could be released as a full size novel. King himself has admitted \\" I write like fat ladies diet\\".The reader sees Carrie bravely trying to cope with her life but at this point of his writing career King did not have the skill in making any of his female characters likeable and sympathetic to the reader.Read this book if you want to see how the King Bandwagon started rolling.I give this book 5 stars because no doubt every High School pencil necked geek and loser bought it to fantasize about revenge on their tormentors ."},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"Many people see Telekinetic as a disease, but for Carrie White it is not only a disease it is a thing people use against her to tease her. The trouble for Carrie White all started when after gym class all the girls went into the locker room to change except for Carrie, because Carrie was scared to change in front of everyone, and her mother Margaret called it a saint. So Carrie went into the locker room, but she never changed or showered, she just sat there and watched. One day though in the locker room, Carrie had an unexpected surprise, she had gotten her period, and was scared and had no clue what it was, why it was happening, or what to do. So when the gym teacher came in to tell the girls to hurry and get to there next class, Carrie was crying and said she was bleeding to death. So the gym teacher had fronted her on what was happening and she needs to clean herself up.She just continued crying, and sat there, and told the teacher she had no clue what to do, and so the gym teacher understood, and told the rest of the girls to go to there next class. So the girls went to there next class and the teacher helped Carrie get cleaned up. So after Carrie got cleaned up, her teacher went over with her once again the steps of menstruation. Once Carrie got back to her class room that's when all the teasing had started, she got called names and made fun of and they just wouldn't stop. Why most of the people hate her so bad in the first place, is because of Carrie's mom Margaret white. She is a very religious girl, and has problems with a lot of things and thinks everything and everyone is a saint and fake. In this story you will read the consequences of growing up telekinetic in a small town were no one understands her.The kind of person I think should read this book is a kind of person who likes to read books that are frightening but in a way realistic. The age range I would say should be around 14 and over, because of all the violence and serious things that are taken place in the story. How I felt and thought of my book is sad in parts, anxious to find out what would happen next, and otherwise I felt scared. I thought it was a very good book, because in ways it taught you some things like on how not to tease or hurt anyone in anyway, because you don't know what will come back at you in the future."},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"An outcast teenager gets revenge on all of them who have tormented her. This theme really plays to our emotions.The \\"nerd\\" in this story is Carrie. She is mistreated by her mother and ridiculed by her classmates. When she discovers she has certain \\"powers\\" to make things happen, things start to get out of hand.This is a good, scary book that keeps you on the edge of your seat."},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"I LOVE Stephen King and Dean Koontz novels, but I have to admit that Carrie was pretty dissapointing. It was his first novel, and you can tell by its sloppiness. It hardly seems like the same author. I had to force myself to press on at times and the whole pig farm scene was disgusting. Those kids were truly dispicable, so much so that I was turned off. It's just a VERY mediocre book compared to the likes of Misery, Rose Madder, Pet Sematary, and The Shining. Outdated and overrated, and just not very good."},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"i know there's alot of stephen king's fans out there, but i never was, until i read this book... i watched alot of his movies but while reading this book it hit me \\"this is one heck of a writer\\"... i mean, from page one till the end, its so well written i thought carrie s' gonna pop at my door step any minute ( joking )... anyways i wud recommend this to anyone who's interested in such creepy stuff, this is a sure creeper... enjoy"},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"This was the first Stephen King book I read, and while I liked it, it was \\"Misery\\" that made me a fan.Carrie centers on a girl (Carrie White) who is relentlessly picked on in school, a girl who seems to be the butt of every joke. Her mother is overly religious and always punishing her, and only her telekinetic powers can save her.Carrie is written in two aspects. There's the bit (mostly called \\"The Shadow Exploded) that talks about events that have already passed, and seems to be analyzing it, while the other is the story itself.For me, this was where the story went down hill. Since the book begins with us already knowing how it's going to turn out (the main story anyway, not the ending) the only thing we have to worry about is getting there. Yeah, it's horrific and suspenseful, but truly, I felt like some of the fun was taken out of the book because I was already told by the author just how the Prom was going to turn out. In short, the only surprising aspect of the book was its remarkable ending and that saved it from three stars.Carrie wasn't really a boring read. I could care less about the moments where the events Carrie caused were being analyzed. I wanted to SEE it happening, not \\"hear\\" about it. The main story itself was a joy to read, but it's interrupted too much by the scientific analysis.And the characters were no fun either. Carrie, she was interesting and so was Sue, but that's about it. I think what really took the joy out of the characters was Carrie's overly religious mother. At first you want to believe she's just a psycho, but King really took her far beyond the boundaries of a \\"believeable\\" character. She wasn't just a psycho, she was from another world! Carrie's mother seemed to subtract a little from the story for me because she just came off as too high-strung. She was too far beyond my imagination to think of as \\"believable\\".Carrie wasn't a bad book, just not what I expected from someone who is generalized as a master of the genre. Carrie was by no means a scary book. The joy and experience of it was taken out from the very beginning. I would say Stephen King's later works are much more exciting than this."},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"This was a book that I read and didn't really enjoy. It was confusing to read and was too gory for me. The book had a good story line but wasn't my type of book. I have read a few other Stephen King novels and have enjoyed them tremendously but this was not one of them. To me it seemed confusing how the story jumped from telling about the past to reading about what people said about it in other books. I can usually read books that jump back and forth but this book made it really difficult. What the people in the book did seemed so cruel that it was hard to read. It just made you almost mad at them. If it would have been written a little differently it might have been fine. I had trouble picking the book up again and finishing reading it but you want to know what happens in the end. In some ways it had suspense but not enough to hold my attention. This book could be considered well written to some people and most likely is but it wasn't written in a way that I consider good. It defiantly had potential and could have been a book I enjoyed. Maybe one day I will read it again and it will be, but at this point I don't think it is. I think this book is for, for one, a strong reader who can understand complicated writing and for two, I recommend it for someone who can take the gore and how mean the people were to Carrie and how Carrie got revenge. I would also recommend people to read it for themselves and make there own judgement because I make it sound like a terrible book but you could enjoy it."},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"it was very good enjoyable and i liked it. Stephen king used his imagination a lot."},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"I bought this at a half-price bookstore. I started reading it then I got hooked and couldn't stop reading until the very end. I recommend this book to anyone who hasn't read it. It is a must read. Like I said, the first is usually the best!"},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"This book was a thrilling ride though time. Carrie, is one the greatest books written by Steven King. He took the average high school child and mixed her with a mother with a chronic lord loving disease.Carrie is just one other person in the world trying to get through high school without disobeying her mother. She doesn't have many friends (the average outcast we all never get to know), but from a certain incident the most popular boy in school asked her to the prom. While Carrie is going though all these problems she learns she has an ability to move objects with her mind, called telepathy. At the prom everything goes wrong and she pays back everyone who as ever been cruel to her in the past..."},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"I always liked the movies made with Stephen King's books, and that's why one day I started reading his work. Carrie of course is a classic, and even if I knew what was going to happen, I thought it was a very good book. I highly recommand it!"},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"The book dealt a lot with a teenage girl who was a complete outcast...P>This book was an excellent book to read. It makes you think about all of those that you have hurt throughout your years in school. As an example, the book had a teenage girl who was a complete outcast and no matter what she did, she could never fit in. When she finally thought that she was being accepted and got invited to prom, she couldn't have been more wrong. At prom, the election for prom queen was tampered with and she won. As a joke someone set up a bucket of pig's blood over the spot where she would be standing. When she stepped into position, the bucket fell down, covering her with blood. This ended up being the last straw for her. She locked all of the doors with her telekinetic powers and set the place on fire. Everyone inside with a few exceptions, burned within the gym. As teenagers we should think about when out making fun of someone could go too far. It is amazing when you sit down to think about it, as to how many of our peers we have hurt the same way that Carrie was hurt. Even though you may not think that all of the teasing and ignoring could make someone go to the extreme and kill their peers, it does happen. Just think about what happened in Colorado/Columbine. Somewhere along the line those kids didn't feel like they fit in and thye eventually started to hate their peers enough to kill and injure them."},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"If you are new to Stephen King I would certainly suggest reading &quot;Carrie&quot; first. It is one of the most twisted and disturding books I have ever read, but one of the best at the same time.(as it seems for alot of people) &quot;Carrie&quot; is my first Stephen King book, and I will read alot more of his work."},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"I sat down and read this book in about one hour, I just couldn;t put it down. It was very creepy, and King does and incredible job or letting you inside the characters heads. Although the transitions inbetween characters can be confusing at first you soon get used to it. Wonderful book. I would recommend it to anyone."},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"Master writer stephen king has done it again in carrie. This book is extreamly unique and great. It is about a girl named carrie who has the gift of tk. This book was so great I finished reading it in 2 days. If you like stephen king you wont be disapointed if you read this book."},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"Carrie is one of Stephen King's best novels. It is also one of my favorite books. Carrie is about a teenage girl with telekinesis. She is continually picked on and tormented at school. Carrie soon learns she is different when she find out she can make things happen around her. Carrie's mother, who is obsessed with her religion, does not allow Carrie to do anything because of her own beliefs. Carrie tries to control things with her power whenever other kids and her mother torment her. One of the girls who makes fun of Carrie feels guilty and decides to have her boyfriend, who is class president, ask Carrie to the prom to make up for her actions. When he asks Carrie to the prom, she is weary about whether it will be just a practical joke or a nice thing.Carrie is one of the best books I have ever read. I like this book because it is interesting throughout the whole story. It is a book that never gets to a boring point. This was Stephen King's first novel that he wrote. This book is also one of Stephen King's shortest books, which doesn't take very long to read, but it is still very entertaining. It is a suspenseful story and it actually has some good horror parts. Carrie is a very good book that I think is definitely worth a read. I would recommend for anybody to read this book who likes Stephen King whether a fan or not."},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"This book was creepy and so good. I read it when I was 13 (10 years ago) in a little over a weekend and found it hard to turn the lights off and go to bed, I was that scared. If you want a scary and riveting page turner, you've come to the right place. This is one of King's bests!"},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"This was not as spooky as it was made to sound. Not the best King novel but I dont rate on that. A must read for anyone. It's easy enough to understand and not very long(about 250 pages), unlike It and The Stand. The novel is about a high school girl named Carrie White and her involvement with telekinesis(or TK as the novel calls it). This is all I can reveal without giving away the plot and the ending."},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"I'm one of the people -- and I suspect there are many -- who was drawn to CARRIE because I was always branded as an outcast and tormented by my peers. Since some publicity pictures of Mr. King show him wearing strong glasses, and since my own thick glasses were what got me into the let's-pick-on-this-guy category, I assumed that King had suffered a similar fate and that CARRIE had been inspired by empathy for the outcast character.I was dismayed to discover that I'd assumed wrong. In his nonfiction book ON WRITING, King tells us that one of the reason he almost abandoned CARRIE was that he didn't like the title character. He also tells us that he occasionally joined in the harassment of some of his outcast classmates. Still, it's to King's credit that he could create a sympathetic point of view for a character that he actually viewed with contempt.But there was one major problem I had with the book even before I found out where King was and wasn't coming from with respect to the title character. I felt he should have given us one major plot complication, rather than trying to balance two. The core of the story is Carrie's telekinetic power and how it enables her to punish her tormentor at the prom. But there's this insane religious fanatic mother she has to deal with, who I think muddies the waters a bit. I would have preferred that King write two books, one about the telekinetic girl and one about the girl with the insane religious fanatic mother.Still, both of these are admittedly subjective complaints. The fact remains that King is a good story teller and can write speculative fiction in which the characters don't get overshadowed by the speculation. In this case, I also felt the snippets of court transcripts and other official documents were an effective touch. (In fact, I wish the movie had retained the idea of a government investigation into the incident.) The book deserves its popularity. I wonder, though, if this was one time when telling the whole truth was a bad idea."},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"I expected to get some chills, but this book never took off with any action. The blood/fire pieces played more like foot notes then anything chilling. The newspaper snips, and excerpts from the \\"books\\" detracted from the flow of the story. I was bored and couldn't wait for the book to end. This is the rare case where the movie was better than the book."},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"I must admit that I disliked King's lack of chapters in this work - the story lost quite a bit of cohesion this way - but at the same time the characterization couldn't have been any better than if the characters really existed. I found Sue Snell's character to be a bit wimpy - not quite what I had in mind for a girl that's supposed to be with &quot;the in crowd&quot; - but the rest were top-notch. The character of Chris Hargensen in particular was perfection, because I frankly wanted to reach into the book and smack her silly. All in all, not a bad read for a beginner King fan, but I still prefer his meatier works (i.e., The Shining, The Dead Zone, etc.)..."},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"\\"Why read Carrie? Stephen King himself has said that he finds his early work \\"raw\\"...\\" I think these words from Amazon and the man who wrote it say it all. I will admit, I haven't read any of Stephen King's other books, but I have seen many movies based on his work, so I figured I would read something by him. And why not start at the beginning? Bad choice. I keep hearing people say, \\"No, you should have read such and such from later on\\" and maybe they are right, but this has definitely made me think otherwise. I feel the movie was such a success as well as Stephen King himself, that it has made this book better than it really is. Don't get me wrong. It is well written, but the story lags for the first fifty pages or so. I'd rather just see the movie. The author himself even said he only put in those articles to fill in space because the story was so short."},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"Carrie is included in nearly every list of \\"great Stephen King novels\\", but to me it was not scary and pretty boring. I never felt any sense of anxiety for any of the characters, and never had the can't-put-it-down experience that I've grown accustomed to in other King stories. I expected a lot of Carrie, and it really disappointed me. I especially was bugged by the \\"nobody remembers what happened, but here is a vague description of what may or may not have occurred\\" climax. After the whole book points towards the scene at the dance, the action is more or less skipped over.As for the book's positives, for one, it is short. I suppose it's better to read a short book and be disappointed than a long one. Second, it is a pretty interesting read if you are looking into the mental and social state of an outcast high school girl. It is interesting how he is able to show how her background makes her different from the other girls, and how she gets relentlessly picked on. Carrie has a sort of good anti-bullying message, but of course the bullied girl getting her revenge by killing her peers kind of dilutes any positive message that could be received by teens."},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"It is easy to see, after reading Carrie, how Stephen King became regarded as one of the perfectors of the horror genre of fiction. Inspired by H.P. Lovecraft, Stephen began his career under the pen name John Bachman, with a few very interesting books. While those books no doubt generated some interest for this budding young author, I personally feel he never really developed that truely inspirational creative edge until he penned this book. Carrie is a great drama, set in a high school setting, which was to become Stephen's well spring of creative compositions for years to come. Carrie to me, represents a lot of elements which are uniquely Stephen King, and the way it is presented, with many multiple viewpoints, was way ahead of its time. It is a short book, maybe even considered novella length, but the entertainment value is not diminished at all.Overall, the story of the high school square peg has been told numerous times. Never like this. Never with these results. You see flashes of the books to come in its pages, and you smile...Highest Recommendations..."},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"As many have said, Carrie was Stephen King's first published novel. It holds up pretty well and is an enjoyable, and quick, read. I do agree with some of the other reviews that said the back story parts (book excerpts and press releases) do kinda break up the flow of the book. King definitely progressed in this area in his future novels. Nonetheless, if you're just getting into Stephen King you should check this book out."},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"Great book could not put it down king holds you in every page and does not let go"},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"I think that Carrie was a very excellent book. However, I enjoyed the movie more than I enjoyed the book. Carrie's mother sounds terrifying. My favorite part of the book was when Carrie was at the prom. Right before Billy and Chris poured the blood on her. One reason why I liked this part of the book was because it was the only part of the book that Carrie actually felt like a person."},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"Carrie is not a great book. Is it entertaning? Of course. Stephen King wrote this book of a girl with Telekenetic powers. It's about someone pushed to the point of destruction. (We've all been there). I loved the fact that it was pretty different from the movie. SO if you've seen the movie and said \\"i don't need to read the book, i've seen the movie\\". Your wrong then. Pick it up and enjoy it. It's not great. But a good read."},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"You can feel her pain and hoplessness. The true evil in this book was human nature. We pick on the weak. Sometimes the weak turn out to have the power, and have been pushed hard enough to use it. This book explored a lot of different personalities, and I truly enjoyed it very much. Stephen King was ahead of his time, and as always better than the rest."},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"I felt as though I knew Carrie personally. I could feel her pain as she struggled just to fit in and be accepted. Then I felt her overwhelming happiness as she was crowned queen of the prom and was finally accepted by everyone. The humiliation that finally sent her over the edge was so real. But she showed them all!! The part that really tears my heart apart is the fact that her mother turned her into the monster that she became by telling her she had the devil's power and in the end her mother ultimately destroyed her. I've read it at least 20 times and will read it at least that many more I'm sure. Excellent!!!!"},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"Carrie is a great novel.

It was short and straight-forward."},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"This book is totally incredible. Even though you think things like this could never happen, King portrays the characters well enough to be believable.I recommend this book for anyone who has never read any of King's books or if they didn't like his other books. Personally, I think that this book wasthe most interesting to teenagers and easier to read than some of his other works."},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"This is perhaps one of the best books I've read. You couldn't help but feal sorry for Carrie. The reasons it didn't grab that one extra point? It was a little slow at first, but when you get to the prom, don't expect to go to bed that night. It was a little distracting when he added so many magazine articles, but some of them added to the story.

I really enjoyed this and would have loved to read it 20 years ago and I will still want to reread it 20 years from now. Good stuff!"},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"Carrie is my favorite book. I read it at least once a year, usually over the summer when I have more time for reading. I'm not a big fan of horror, but am a big fan of science fiction. This book raises a very interesting question: What if a teenage girl who has been turned into a social outcast by a mentally ill religious zealot mother, discoveres she has telekinesis? And Stephen King does a masterful job answering that question. Powerful stuff."},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"Carrie is Stephen Kings first published book. I like how this story is told in a kind of interview style. It keeps it exciting throughout. Everyone knows the 70's version of this movie with Sissy Spacek and John Travolta. I would say that the book and movie are pretty close. There was a remake made in the 00's that is more accurate, but you get the idea. If you dont know what this story is about (there cant be many that dont) Carrie is picked on all her life and discovers she has telekenetic powers. She ends up \\"getting even\\" with everyone at the prom. The insanity of Carries mother, Margaret is the creepiest thing about this book. Anyone with a mother like that really has no chance of being normal. Lets hope there arent any others as insane as her in the world (although there probably are) Carrie is less that 200 pages, a very quick easy read. Like all other SK books, I definitely recommend it."},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"Carrie is one of my favorite heroines of all time!

King is a wonderful weaver of tales. When I read this book while in my teens, I was bored with it and just didn't get it. Reading it again as an adult, I can better see all of the inner turmoil that the characters are facing. It's also interesting how he breaks up the narrative with exerpts from real sounding commission reports, news stories and post-event accounts of the events of prom night. Truly a well written story of the terrible things that adolescents do to one another and what might happen if the right person is pushed past her threshold of tolerance."},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"Well the book i read was by Stephen King one of the greatest authors ever. Well I think this book was most interesting because these things that happened to carrie can really happen. Like being fiscally and verbally abused. Also when he stated the fact that she was sixteen and had her first period in front of everybody, i mean she has already been picked on and laughed at all her life i mean what worse could happen besides getting tampons and napkins and pads thrown at you. Well trust me you will have more to read, and also she found out that she had telekinesis whoa thats another thing coming for you.But the most part is can't believe the way her mom treats her. Her mom tries to act like she is the most holiest person in the world, and even when she creates sins her self by abusing her daughter and throwing her in the closet for hours and not giving her food. But when she finds out the cutest boy Tommy wants to take her to the prom she thinks nothing else could go wrong. Well she was wrong about that. She thought since she was with Tommy everyone would want to be her friend. Even though she wasn't the prettiest girl or really skinniest girl she thought every thing could actually be normal for her.But the day of the prom she actually was the prettiest girl in the room nice red dress her breast all out. Even Tommy didn't believe that it was her when he picked her up. She was a totally different person from when he first asked her to the prom. But the ending a can not tell because it is far to interesting for me to go and ruin it for you so just buy or rent the book and start reading. And trust me all that reading it is worth it."},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"Raised by a very religious mother, Carietta White finds out that she has strong telekinetic abilities. Against the advice of her mother, Carrie - as a high-school student - tries to be accepted by the society of football players and cheer-leaders. But unfortunately she will discover that she isn't accepted at all. Being the victim of a cruel mockery, she want's revenge.What I admire in Stephen King is his ability to show his readers that Evil comes from within us. In \\"Carrie\\" the cruel 'joke' makes her raving mad and she's responsible for all the sadistic violence that ensues (for the psychologists among you, is Stephen King responsible for the cruelty of his personage? In other words: is there really such a difference between fantasy and reality?). I think that an experienced writer like Stephen King is capable to draw a line between his world and the world of his novels. Anyway, Stephen King knows that our subconscious is not a nice old lady on a tea-garden visit but a nasty little devil.It's a cruel world out there and where are the innocent? I'll send you a word when I find out."},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"This is Stephen King's first published. And though it does have some markings of a first book, (some characters are not perfectly developed, and more time is spent on literary garbage rather than the story at times) it is still a good read."},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"This is my first Stephen King novel and it won't be my last! Carrie is a real good, thriller/suspenseful story. Once I started reading it, I could not put it down. It had me interested from start to finish.This story takes place in 1974 Maine where an outsider by the name of Carrie White resides. Carrie is a sixteen year-old who is shunned and ridiculed by her high school classmates and even by her own mother. She's a shy girl who has trouble making friends and \\"fitting\\" in. The kids tease her about her appearance and the way she dresses. She's not liked at all. There's an incident in school where Carrie unexpectedly begins her monthly cycle while showering after gym. Instead of receiving sympathy from the girls, all they do is laugh and tease her while throwing her towels. When she tries to discuss this with her abusive and religious-fanatic mother, she makes Carrie pray in a closet for all the sins she has committed. She soon realizes she has telekinetic powers and slowly begins to use them.Since the schoolgirls tease her all the time, there is one girl who feels sorry for Carrie. The girl, Sue, asks her boyfriend to take Carrie to the prom instead of her. When Chris, the \\"leader\\" of the bad girls finds out about this, she plan an evil plot against Carrie to take place sometime during the prom. Since Chris has been banned on attending the prom, she and her boyfriend want to make sure this is one prom Carrie will never forget. Remember, no one knows Carrie has telekinetic powers, so when she is crowned Prom Queen, a bucket full of pig's blood is poured over her. She is humiliated and angered to the point that she's had enough! That's when Carrie unleashes her \\"special powers\\" and gets even with all of them!Although this novel has no happy ending, it is worth reading. I sympathize with Carrie due to the terrible life she had in school and at home and it's unfortunate things turned out the way they did."},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"This is where the genius started his famous reputation and talent.

But I think people who would like this book would be someone who likes scary and wierd type of books."},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"king's first book didn't show his real greatness. this is much more &quot;simple&quot; than his later works. we got a girl terrozised by her mother, teased by her schoolmates. however, it turns out she has powers. now there are some good psychological reflections, but not as great as the psychology in K's later works. some lovely details, not in so much depth as, yes, later. and K's writing style is much simpler here. not that it's bad, but it does not show K's greatness. but it's a good read, and not of his worst"},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"This is King's classic novel and the one he is best known for. If you haven't read this and you consider yourself a fan of horror/thriller novels, then you are missing out. I loved the development of Carrie and her struggle to fit in. I feel that King is using this novel to comment on today's teens and how so many of them think they have to fit into a certain crowd to be liked or &quot;cool.&quot; This novel is a classic and worth your time. Trust me."},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"I loved this book Carrie. I loved it because it had a great plot, and a lot of gore. This book was also good too because King took a lot of time and thought into writing this book. Also what what I like about his writing is that he uses a lot of description in his books too. The characters in Carrie were so descriptive, it was like you almost knew them. I would definitely recommend this book to people who like a good plot, alot of gore, and good characters."},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"CARRIE is an absolute classic. It was the secound book by King that I ever read and I thoroughly enjoyed it. I passed my information on to my good friends, who devoured it in a few days, and went on and on about it when they finished it. Carrie White is a seemingly innocent schoolgirl who is constantly tormented by her cruel peers and her strange mother. Carrie holds a power inside her that comes purely from anger and hate. Her mother, Margaret White, has a very strange view of Christianity...forcing Carrie to go into a small closet and pray for forgiveness after events as innocent and simple as her first period. Carrie finally gets a break when Tommy Ross asks her to go to the Prom. Little does she know that her hateful classmates are planning a surprise for her."},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"So you think you know Stephen King? You think that he is all vampires and aliens? Well, let his first novel prove you wrong. Man, this book was strange, but very good all and all. King takes this innocent young, tourtured highschool girl and turns her into a person to haunt your dreams. Throughout the book you learn of Carrie White and her power to move things. Now, im sure most people have seen the movie, but the ending is so much creepier in this book than it is in the movie. It is a little bit slow paced, but it is all worth it by the end. It is the kind of scary that makes you shiver. Not like you are afraid to go to sleep, but more in a way that it is just so strange that it messes with your head. This is the book that skyrocketed King's career. His writing style was a little different back then, but not bad. I thought this was a really cool book and most definetly recommend it."},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"This book is unlike Stephen King's other material because it is short and to the point. Whereas in some of his other books, he will spend 700 pages developing a plot, this story is told in 200 more-or-less pages, and it moves from the get-go. I love the style that he uses, interspersing tidbits from media reports, and the way that he inserts peoples' thoughts sporadically into the flow of thought. It is a scintillating debut novel for a writer, much better than most people's first works, and I would reccommend it to anyone."},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"Considering that this is Stephen King's first novel, this is an amazing book. In &quot;Carrie,&quot; King does his best job out of all his books at developing a character that the reader can really just feel for. He gets you to feel so sorry for her for having to put up with all of the things that happen to her, whether it be at her school where she is constantly tormented by her peers, or at her home, where she must live with her psycho-religious mother. While doing this, he also manages to develop a diabolical plot that leads up to one of the most stunning climaxes of any novel. I definitely recommend that you get this book."},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"Wow! What a great book! Out of the 4 Stephen King books that I've read (pet semetary, thinner, salems lot), this one is now my fave. This is a very disturbing story about a girl who is an outcast, large in part due to her religiously fanatic mother. She is often the center of jokes and harassment by her peers, and..well we all know how this one ends.Let me say that this is much better than the movie. All the extra detail that this contains, and the graphic descriptions, make this worth the read."},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"This is the first major novel of Stephen King and I suppose in a certain way it shows if you consider it in relation to his later books. Stephen King has often referred to his earlier works as &quot;raw.&quot; However, in the case of this book I think that &quot;rawness&quot; lends to the story rather than detracts from it. The story also adheres to an episodic approach, jumping between Associated Press write-ups, fictitious book quotes, and interviews with people after the fact by an investigatory committee. All of that worked really well in this book when interspersed with the events as they had taken place. In a lot of books that kind of approach can be distracting but it worked perfectly in Carrie.My one complaint: some of the characters are meant to be high school kids and yet their thought processes were sometimes a little too adult sounding. This is not to say there are not very mature high school kids, of course, but rather I just do not feel that they made sense in the context of this book. One example: Susan Snell. Relatively speaking she was a flat character in the story and yet her thought patterns were shown to have a depth probably beyond her years. (Again: this is not impossible, I just think some of the characterizations did not fit with the story. Rather they were blatant attempts to move the story forward by introducing the plot points.) This, however, is a small overall criticism of the book.This is definitely a book where, in a lot of ways, you root for Carrie White. She was an anti-hero in the truest sense of the literary term. For anyone was ever picked on in school or witnessed this happening to others, you cannot help but feel immense sympathy for Carrie. And her actions, while violent and catastrophic, are ultimately understandable. And it is that understandibility that raises the book from being a just a simple horror novel to one of tragedy. The book also makes you consider, however briefly, what makes people like Carrie. The focus of the book is not on her power - that is actually incidental to the plot. The focus is on Carrie herself and what fashioned her into the human being she eventually becomes. It shows how children can be formed by the events of their crucial years and how that formation can go disastrously wrong. Overall the book is about injustice: injustice to Carrie White in how her parents raised her, injustice in a school system that has a derived system of cliques, injustice in a world that will not recognize the birth of something new even when it leads to potential danger.If you have already read a lot of Stephen King's later works, you may find yourself not liking this book as much simply because of the different writing style or length. If, however, you want to see the evolution of Stephen King's thought (and writing) process as well as sit through a good story, pick this one up."},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"Carrie is the story of a young teenage girl who is hounded by bullies at school and hounded by her nuerotic mother at home. An example of the craziness of her mother is when Carrie gets her period. Carrie was never informed of what this is and thinks she is dying. She turns to her mother who beats her and tells her she is of the devil and that she must pray for forgiveness. Carrie soon learns that she has telekinetic powers and can use it to her advantage. The climax of this story involves Carrie and her wrath against her schoolmates. You won't believe what they did to her and what she does back to them. This is a terrific King book!"},{"Title":"Carrie","review":"Stephen Kings Premier novel Carrie, is the best Stephen King book I have read, it is fast paced, which is unusualy for him considering that The Shining was horridly slow.Now comes Carrie the story of a somewhat tortured girl, with a bizarre talent.
