Author did a great job of telling this almost unbelieveable story with detail."},{"Title":"Wild ride: The rise and tragic fall of Calumet Farm, Inc., America's premier racing dynasty","review":"I purchased this book after reading &quot;Seabiscuit&quot; and expected to get the same type of biography. However, my enjoyment was hindered by Auerbach's excessive use of financial jargon regarding the Wright family's trust as well as the battles and litigations that ensued. I do have to commend the author for digging down into the nitty-gritty, though I did sometimes wonder about some of the finer details and their credibility. I'd recommend this book to anyone who really wants to know the story of Calumet Farm, as long as they don't mind drudging through pages and pages of boring and often confusing jargon."},{"Title":"Wild ride: The rise and tragic fall of Calumet Farm, Inc., America's premier racing dynasty","review":"Auerbach's book about the history, rise and fall of America's most famous racing stable, Calumet, is for the most part outstanding. Reading it I was captivated by the story of the Wrights and others who made the stable a success. She also documents its fall in the hands of one J.T. Lundy, married to one of Louise Wright Markey's granddaughters, who totally mismanaged the farm and veered it to bankruptcy and liquidation. There is no doubt in my mind Lundy was totally out of his league in running a racing stable.However, being inept or greedy is one thing, having a horse killed to pay debts is another thing entirely. Auerbach makes the fatal mistake in her book by veering away from straight reporting and plunging headlong into speculation and insinuation. Now to date there is no evidence whatsoever that the farm's great stallion and most valuable asset, Alydar, was killed for the insurance money, but Auerbach insinuates the possibility in her book. This is very irresponsible for a supposedly reputable writer to do. I do not believe such a thing happened; it boggles the mind that anybody could ever be that greedy and that cruel. Shortly after Alydar died, I saw an interview with Lundy and he certainly didn't look very happy the horse died. So, no, I'm not buying the Alydar conspiracy theory.For the reason I stated above, I cannot give this book, which has so much in its favor, the highest rating. It still does have much valuable information, however."},{"Title":"Wild ride: The rise and tragic fall of Calumet Farm, Inc., America's premier racing dynasty","review":"How could this happen?

Everyone knows he killed Alydar. How he can hold his arrogant head up is amazing. He should share Alydar's fate. Calumet meant everything to me in the 40s when Citation was the first millionaire race horse. Affirmed was my hero, but Citation was my favorite when I was just a child. It gives me the creeps to think of Lundy and what he did. It wasn't just Calumet. He changed horse racing probably forever.

And how did her wealthy, powerful family react at the time?This book paints a detailed financial picture of the deals that (likely) led to Calumet's fall. But there remain considerable back stories to be told."},{"Title":"Wild ride: The rise and tragic fall of Calumet Farm, Inc., America's premier racing dynasty","review":"A fantastic book that provides thrills and suspense from cover to cover. The book details the story of the revered Calument Farms that dominated the American horse racing scene for most of the 20th century before a sudden collapse into bankruptcy.

One of the important things that David Ball establishes is the chronology of Michaux's publishings. Michaux often published a string of small books between major collections - the major books overlapping, partially containing and redacting the earlier books in a highly complex and confusing way. In some cases, the larger work even duplicates the title of a smaller work. Ball untangles this gnarly time-line once and for all.This is the most extensive selection in English from all phases of Michaux's long poetic career. It includes excerpts from his prose works - the travel writings and the mescalin writings, although nothing was taken from A Barbarian in Asia and Miserable Miracle. There are some plates that provide a view of Michaux's often superb graphic art.The translations stand up pretty well against Richard Ellman's in Selected Writings (also highly recommended); however, this is a much larger work. Ball is perhaps on the literal side as a translator, a respectable choice. Probably, the only way to translate a poet impeccably, is to have a team of accomplished poets working in direct collaboration with the living poet who also speaks the second language well. And, of course, that's not the case, here. As far as I know, among major 20th. century poets translated into English, only Jorge Luis Borges was tranlated in this arcadian manner. That said, there's nothing wrong with these translations, except that David Ball, though possessed of a good ear, is not himself a poet, or trying to use a translation of a poem as an occasion to write another poem. Again, this is a respectable choice. In a sense Michaux is easy to translate. His language, though highly individual, is clear and direct (except when he's creating his bombastic new words). It's this language and conscience (John Ashberry's critical insight) in service in service to a deep and powerful visionary faculty, that makes Michaux one of the truly great poets of the 20th. century."},{"Title":"Darkness Moves: An Henri Michaux Anthology, 1927-1984","review":"This early 20th century psychonaut is the latest embodiment of the Poet Maudit, intuitively following the program set out by Baudelaire and brilliantly brought to fruition by Rimbaud and Lautreamont and added to substantially by the surrealists. It is, however, Michaux's connection to the author of Maldoror that draws me to him, and as in Ducassean texts, Michaux's writings reveal numinous monsters aplenty, strange landscapes, psychic flora and fauna that are noted, illuminated from all sides, catalogued in precise detail. A selection of the art is given as well. These are good to excellent translations, as noted in the previous review. The selection and chronology makes this book stand out over the New Directions standard that we've long depended on for our picture of Michaux."},{"Title":"Darkness Moves: An Henri Michaux Anthology, 1927-1984","review":"Michaux is a genius. He should be read many times. His language and images are haunting and thrilling. His work is very inspirational and insightful.The translation is also excellent.I can highly recommend him."},{"Title":"El ano del diluvio","review":"Pretty okay book. Don't feel like writing much more than that as I have to go write an essay on it."},{"Title":"El ano del diluvio","review":"The plot is quite simple: a nun fall in love with a rich man that collects everything he can, even extravagances like seducing a woman consecrated to God and simultaneosly raising money to build a home for old people. Is a short book, intense with that so special characteristic that Mendoza applies to the words: humour. A good book for a plane trip."},{"Title":"Three Little Ships","review":"In the early summer of 1940, the British army was forced into retreat by the invading German army, which was swarming over France. In a desperate attempt to return the soldiers to England, so that the British army could regroup, Winston Churchill called upon the owners of any kind of seacraft, over 30 feet long, to travel in a convoy to the sea port of Dunkirk in France, to help pick up the men stranded on the beach and to ferry them to waiting naval ships for their return to England. The naval vessels were too big to get in close enpugh to the shore, so smaller craft with a shallow draw were essential. Boating people from all over the land volunteered their vessels and the most amazing armada since the days of Drake, was formed and was either towed by bigger boats or went under their own steam. This is the simply, but effectively told story of three separate families who took part in this valiant operation. For days on end, these tiny boats plied backwards and forwards, ferrying the soldiers, with themselves being under constant strafing and bombing attacks from the Luftwaffe. It's a story of the great courage shown by ordinary people when driven to the edge by the unspeakable horrors of war."},{"Title":"Three Little Ships","review":"\\"Three Little Ships\\" has to be the best book by Lilian Harry so far. She tells the story of the evaction of Dunkirk from the point of view of the three captains of boat that were call upon to rescue trapped BEF who trapped on the French Beach in the mid 1940's. She also gives the readed an idea about what it must have been like waiting on the beach, hoping to make it off before the Germans came.To me, this is the best book that Ms. Harry has done to date and I can't wait to read more by her."},{"Title":"Central Problems in Social Theory: Action, Structure, and Contradiction in Social Analysis","review":"I recently revisited this book, which I had read long ago and was my first real introduction to arguments in contemporary social theory. I later read 'The Constitution of Society,'which is where one should go for Giddens's full statement of 'structuration theory,' but I'm especially fond of this work, which really is a collection of articles treating different concepts (power, structure, domination, contradiction, conflict, etc.). Giddens discusses a vast range of authors in an attempt to synthesize them into a coherent framework of social theory; sometimes, I think he indulges in displaying his erudition, but I think overall it's invigorating to see so many different figures brought into a synoptic vision. I don't think the synthesis always works - structuration theory impressed me less and less after thinking about it over the years - but this book felt like a series of fascinating puzzles that motivated me to read further into rather than turn away from sociology and social theory."},{"Title":"Central Problems in Social Theory: Action, Structure, and Contradiction in Social Analysis","review":"Giddens' approach to theory takes functional-structuralism and gives it a diachronic facelift. One of the greatest flaws in structuralism (sorry LS) is that it does not address problems related to social change in context of time and place. Giddens' attempts to do this, albeit with a few flaws, but all in all is a sound theoretical base from which to pull from when creating models.Kind of repetitive at times, considering it is a collection of articles rather than one manuscript."},{"Title":"Central Problems in Social Theory: Action, Structure, and Contradiction in Social Analysis","review":"It seems unneccessarily complicated riddle to solve to us, sociologists. actually Giddens's writing style in this title is not that easy to grasp judging from sociological convention. and worse he cited too many names like Saussure, Hegel, Levi-Strauss, Heidegger, Husserl and even Derrida and Wittgenstein! those that makes readers wandering around jargons from philosophy. because this book stem from the controversial atmosphere of 70s when French Structuralism prevailed over intellectural map. Giddens wanted to conter their assertions. we can see he was right at 80s when structurism collapsed into trendy postmodernist jargons. Anyway I recommend to read this title if u read 'The Constitution of Society'. which title is not that hostile to reader like this title. but something lacks on it. You can find what miss in later masterpiece. This title is somewhat earlier endeavor to clarify his theory of structuration. so thorems were not that clearly founded. it makes it the way to hostility to readers but sometimes this kind of imperfection is more valuable to portray one's image of theory."},{"Title":"Kings in Hell","review":"Imagine the greatest personages of the ages, together -- in hell. That's the premise of this series by two very talented sci-fi fantasy writers. A brief excerpt: Whump! The ground shook and reports of the guns on the hills kept up, explosions slamming against the hill in front of them. Save the equipment. Save their shelter. Protect themselves against the chance that some enemy up there had something to answer the tanks: a general in Hell never assumed anything, and lasers and disruptors and tactical nukes were always a possibility. Get themselves and their equipment out of here, and discover why later-that was Julius Caesar's priority. Cleopatra was shouting orders of her own, snatching up equipage and personal belongings and wreckage and shoving them at an orderly while legionaries struck the tent they had been sleeping in. That sudden flattening of the canvas as Julius glanced back showed him the chopper on the field beyond the camp, all aglare with its landing lights and making a target out of itself-till it roared back into the air and beat directly overhead, throwing unwelcome lights on the camp. Achilles was taking a recon or deserting them, it was a tossup which."},{"Title":"Michael Jackson: Making History","review":"This is a great booklet that has beautiful pictures plus a poster of Michael that I love so much.

Shapiro is a master of structure, a poetic maker who understands that what makes grief bearable is the song the poet builds to contain feeling. This volume begins with an extraordinary hymn to Apollo, a poem which points to the way that poetry's work is to marry the pleasures of music to the stuff of human experience -- to sing, in other words, about our suffering, our failures and our nobility. It's a poem that points to this collection's project, and prepares us for the deep humanity, psychological insight, and formal grace of the poems that follow. This is one of the best books of the year."},{"Title":"The Dead Alive and Busy (Phoenix Poets)","review":"Alan Shapiro has, in this volume, created a world where, for better or for worse, the past is not missing: instead, it walks around in our world, befriending us or pestering us, stopping at nothing, even death. And yet these are poems of loss, or loss that will not complete itself, as in Joyce's &quot;absence is the highest form of presence.&quot;Take the poem &quot;Ghost,&quot; in which a dead woman speaks to her widower: even the past is haunted by its own past. Or the poems of or to the speaker's dead or dying relatives &amp; loved ones: the touches that have ended in withdrawn hands but remain in lingering feeling.Shapiro's knowledge of poetry is astounding, &amp; he uses that knowledge (which is, by the way, so much more than mere knowledge) to build subtle, strong, and elegant poetry. He has been doing it for years; his earlier work--excellent as it is--is mere exercize for the power of The Dead Alive and Busy."},{"Title":"The Dead Alive and Busy (Phoenix Poets)","review":"Many of the poems in Alan Shapiro's The Dead Alive and Busy deal with aging, death, grief, suffering, and illness. Throughout the collection, Shapiro blends personal narrative with references to mythology, history, the Bible, and literary figures.The urgency of the personal subject matter paired with Shapiro's careful structuring, control of language, and vivid description allow the best poems to be intimate and revealing without becoming sentimental. In the poem \\"Feet\\" Shapiro details the physical act of rubbing lotion into his father's feet: \\"my fingers working the moisturizer / down into the parched soles, the rinds of calluses, / over the bunched skin rough as braille above the heel bone.\\" The rich specificity of this external description then helps Shapiro to create a snapshot of his father's life while imagining an internal landscape: \\"feet of the love bed, feet of we had / a few good years before the war, before you children, ... as I let them down / so slowly that the weight, the gravity, the pulling from the earth's core for a moment's mine, not theirs, then theirs / again.\\"Less successful tend to be the poems that focus more exclusively on the external subject matter without interweaving the personal. As in the poem \\"Thrush in Summer,\\" a meditation on \\"Hardy's thrush, frail, gaunt, but silent,\\" where the description and the beauty of the language, while still evocative, seems more ornamental and one-dimensional without the underpinnings of narrative.Through three numbered sections the poems in this book, for the most part, build upon each other and gain resonance. The voice is consistently honest, direct, and precise, often while engaging with difficult subject matter. With carefully handled purpose and clarity, many of these poems gain a significance that approaches truth."},{"Title":"The Verse by the Side of the Road: The Story of the Burma-Shave Signs and Jingles","review":"With the low-brow humor of &quot;whazzzzzup&quot; and high-speed editing of MTV-style ads dominating the landscape, it's almost hard to imagine how memorable the quaint multi-sign Burma-Shave ads were. The combination of clever verse and brilliant exposition -- stretching along the wide-open road until the punch line could be delivered -- is unlike any other ad delivery in history.Author Frank Rowsome, Jr. tells the story of the campaign's creation and life, and provides a listing of all signs from the first in1927 (&quot;Shave the modern way / No Brush / No Lather / No Rub-in / Big Tube 35-c Drug Stores / Burma Shave&quot;) through their last in 1963 (&quot;Our Fortune / Is Your / Shaven Face / It's Our Best / Advertising Space / Burma-Shave&quot;). In between is an amazingly clever collection of poems, including contest winners, shorter signs for smaller displays, spin-off tooth powder and lotion jingles, and regional ads.Great reading for those remembering the signs as well as those who just want to get a smile from some great advertising - one of the USA's most underappreciated art forms."},{"Title":"The Verse by the Side of the Road: The Story of the Burma-Shave Signs and Jingles","review":"I read this book twenty odd years ago, and I loved it. It brought back such fond childhood memories of my days on the farm in Belsano, PA, where a set of the signs stood soldier-like in the lower field of my grandad's farm. I heard from the grown-ups that someone paid him to put them there, and money was scarce in those days.I was always intrigued by those signs, so when I saw the book advertised for the first time, it was a must-have for me. I cherished owning a complete set of the verses, most of which I'd never seen.The book is well-written in that it has a lot of historical fact, loads of humor, and the story-telling holds your interest to the last page. One of those &quot;can't put it down&quot; types.Somewhere in my travels, I've lost my copy and have mourned it's loss.

From what I can gather, the book is primarily oriented towards designing computer control systems and information management systems that can react to failures of individual hardware components or attack by malicious code. From my point of view, this is the almost opposite view of what I'm interested in, namely, using an information processing system to predictively model an organism (or a component thereof).Therein lies the beauty of it! It seems that computer science and the biological sciences have so far developed independently, and yet curiously moved closer to each other. Biology becomes a data driven science, and computers become complex systems with emergent behavior. All that is needed is the final few pieces to fall in place to link the two in a seamless unity, one which we can use to discover the deep laws of biology. In Immunity-based Systems the approach is from the computer science side.The book relies on the concept of the idiotypic network, which from what I can gather is a somewhat outdated and discarded model of immune system regulation. It does interest me though, and I wouldn't be surprised if there isn't some grain of truth to it.Here's one interesting tidbit from early in the book:\\"Physical systems have a concept, such as heat, that can be defined on an upper hierarchical level as a macro measure obtained by averaging over states at a lower level. It is difficult to find such a macro concept or measure in biological systems. One reason why a macro concept is lacking in biology is the difficulty of understanding biological systems in terms of hierarchy alone, since biological systems have a recursive structure (as the \\"self-reference\\" found in self-reproduction in biological systems). Therefore, information flow is neither unidirectional nor fixed in direction like most of the hierarchies found in physical systems. A hierarchical view view does not suffice for biological systems, a recursive view is needed.\\" Page 9I'm not going to lie, this book is expensive and although short (&lt;200 pages), it is quite dense. There's a fair bit of math, philosophy of systems, and computer science that I really didn't get. If you stick with it though, I think there are quite a few valuable insights to be had. I will be reading this one again."},{"Title":"Determination (Buddhism For You series)","review":"These books are great for anyone who practices (or doesn't practice) this Buddhism.

Prisoners, rapists and child molesters all had their depraved say as to their version of 'normal' sex including pederasts who would perform oral or physical sex on children, toddlers and BABIES - and stimulate them until the children had seizures and went into shock which Kinsey decided as an orgasm.His poison has infected countless millions into believing all sex is okay no matter what the ages are between the target and the perpetrator.Garbage in, garbage out: because he relied on prisoners, pederasts, rapists, homosexuals and those depraved individuals who were into bestiality and copulating with corpses, his 'findings' are skewed from the beginning to the end, and has been taken as gospel by the depraved with an agenda to corrupt; and embraced by the 'anything goes' mentality of excess in Hollyweird.Children are now being brainwashed in kindergarden to accept all kinds of sex including homosexual.

If it's your line you'll want it, and if it isn't you won't! Still, since my late mother was a Philabaum I feel compelled to write this.This is a book covering the descendants of John Phillebaum born in 1767, probably in Pennsylvania. This book does not cover the more famous line of Conrad Philabaum, also of Pennsylvania, of which there may or may not be a link.This is not quite a complete book, the author was in his 90's when this book was published and I don't think it's unkind to say he was rushing the manuscript for obvious reasons. There are some lines that could use a little extra work, yet.Also, Vern introduced a new pedigree chart format. This may or may not be an improvement, but it is not innate for those who are used to the more typical charts. It did save space in the book, so it did serve a purpose.There is a great appendix showing the author's correspondence, which does show a research outline for anyone who wants to go further. However, and this is a big however, there are no sources for the majority of the information on descendants, which extended to those living at the time of publication. Sources are included only for about the first two generations.There are plenty of photographs and the will of John Phillebaum is abstracted within.If you're a Philabaum no matter the spelling, I hope this was enough information for you to decide whether or not to investigate this book further."},{"Title":"Mind, Brain, and Language: Multidisciplinary Perspectives","review":"Written at a high enough level to be comprehensive, edited well enough to be comprehensible, the data presented in these articles is consistently fascinating from the viewpoint of a student studying neurolinguistics.Having some background in neuroscience and linguistics helps, but the most advanced concepts (and longest acronyms) are spelled out clearly, sometimes even with helpful re-definitions later in the articles.Not a casual read, but priceless.

Just goes to show that anytime a person adds in more than the Standard Works, what you get is nothing more, or less, than that person's opinion. If you want some truly interesting uninspired writings, read the Apocrypha instead."},{"Title":"Mormon doctrine,","review":"This book was written to be seen as an authoritative, one-volume encyclopedia of Mormon doctrines and beliefs, listed alphabetically. Because the author was a Mormon apostle, the book was instantly accepted by Mormons in general as being authoritative. But, in reality, the other LDS apostles (there are fifteen, total, at any one time, except when death causes a temporary vacancy) were very displeased, even shocked, when the book appeared, because it had been written and published without their consent or knowledge. (The recent book, David O. McKay and the Rise of Modern Mormonism, further explains this.)The book was allowed to stand in order to protect McConkie's reputation, though other LDS apostles found many dozens of errors in it.There are too many topics in it (hundreds) for me to comment upon here, so I will limit my remarks to just one, as indicative of the mentality of the author, and why his fellow apostles cringed so much at its contents. Under the alphabetically listed heading, \\"Psychiatry,\\" the author's \\"doctrinal\\" comment begins, \\"See, Church of the Devil,\\" another of book's topics. If you, as a reader, believe that psychiatry is best approached and understood in conceptual terms of \\"church of the devil,\\" then you might be one of the many people who are happy with Mormon Doctrine as a book. If you think, however, that to perceive psychiatry as part of \\"the devil's church\\" is surprisingly ignorant and childish thinking, then you very likely will have as many reservations about this book as did the author's fellow apostles who were first offended by its appearance in print.For your information, today is December 14, 2005, and it was just yesterday that I was stunned anew to see, in the current edition of Mormon Doctrine in a Border's bookstore, that this book still contains McConkie's \\"See, Church of the Devil\\" reference. How the LDS Church tolerates this relatively uneducated comment to remain in print is puzzling. Why McConkie's heirs don't edit out this sort of absurdity is at least equally as puzzling."},{"Title":"Mormon doctrine,","review":"Every time a Christian debates with Mormons, after the Christian demolishes the Mormon arguments, the Mormon unfailingly accuses the Christian of being \\"anti-Mormon\\" and adds that, if the Christian really wants to know what the LDS church teaches, he should avoid critical literature and ask Mormons.I decided to heed their suggestion: who could know their doctrines better than one of their own \\"apostles\\"?For this reason, I decided to read the authoritative book \\"Mormon Doctrine\\", by the late LDS \\"apostle\\", great LDS theologian and general authority Bruce McConkie.This book is an encyclopedic, comprehensive book that explains all of the main doctrines of Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints.Unlike today's LDS literature, Bruce McConkie does not shy away from expounding the LDS cult's main tenets: polygamy and racism.Most of today's LDS, when faced with the issue of polygamy, quickly answer that the practice of plural marriage is no longer an issue, because it was discontinued in 1890. Before pronouncing these statements, these individuals should have asked the opinion of high-ranking LDS \\"apostles\\", like McConkie.He commented: \\"Obviously, the holy practice will commence again after the Second Coming of the Son of Man and the ushering in of the Millennium\\" (p.578)For this leading LDS authority, what many Mormons call \\"a non-issue\\", is a \\"holy practice\\" that will be soon reinstated!Regarding black people, McConkie explained what the LDS stance on the issue was before 1978:\\"The Blacks are denied the Priesthood; under no circumstances can they hold this delegation of authority from the Almighty\\"\\"The Negroes are not equal with other races where the receipt of certain blessings are concerned, particularly the priesthood and the temple blessings that flow there from, but this inequality is not of man's origin, it is the Lord's doings.\\" (Mormon Doctrine, p. 527, 1966 edition).Following the pressure of social services, the LDS church removed its priesthood ban for blacks in 1978. In later editions this part was removed. Are they ashamed of what \\"apostle\\" McConkie (along with most \\"prophets\\" and \\"apostles\\" before 1978) wrote?But even in recent editions the Mormon racism is evident. On page 527 McConkie wrote: \\"it means that members of all races may now be married in the temple, although interracial marriages are discouraged by the Brethren\\"Why are interracial marriages discouraged? That is because they do not consider black people equal with white people! Shame on them!Although some Mormons, deeply ashamed of the fact that McConkie tells the truth about their \\"church\\", criticized this work, much of the Bible dictionary that is included in the LDS-published Bibles contains excerpts or paraphrases from Mormon Doctrine.Apparently impressed by the content of this book, in 1972 Harold B. Lee, the \\"prophet\\" of the LDS \\"church\\" back then, called McConkie to serve in the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles.To conclude, if you are frustrated by LDS missionaries delibately lying to hide the most controversial parts of their theology, and you want to know what they really believe in, this book will be invaluable."},{"Title":"Mormon doctrine,","review":"Bruce R.

I feel that it is essential to look at the sources that Elder McConkie uses: the scriptures, JST, Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith, and the writings of other prophets. The key is not to look past, but through Elder McConkie and see the foundation upon which he builds.This book is an encyclopedia format; so like the dictionary, it has no plot, just reference entries! It covers many subjects, and provides scriptures to reinforce Elder McConkie's analysis. It is interesting to see how far and wide the Restoration goes, and the endless variety of subjects that are embraces within the Gospel!This is a handy one-volume book for people wanting an introduction to the Gospel, but can't afford the Encyclopedia of Mormonism.The main problem with Mormon Doctrine, and everything else Elder McConkie writes, is that many people talked about Elder McConkie, but few ever read or understand Elder McConkie! Hopefully we will read with a careful eye this book.I also find it rather unusual that some people won't forgive Elder McConkie for making one mistake in doctrine.

Eternal, unchanging truth isn't dressed up by marketing, made politically correct, then given spin in the newsroom. It isn't concerned with what our culture or time finds popular or pleasing.

If you are Mormon, you will be riduculed if you quote it and if you are not Mormon, you will not get an accurate portrayal of official doctriine.

His style is to set the record straight on everything he can think of.

It will be of no help to investigators or the just plain curious."},{"Title":"Mormon doctrine,","review":"I agree with Gene Fojtik's opinion of this book, as recorded in an earlier review. As an evangelical Christian, I do not agree with much (if anything) Mr. McConkie said as a Latter-day Saint apostle. Yet this man was an authority who held one of the highest positions you could possibly have in the LDS church, which is comprised of 10 million + adherents. Who better to learn about LDS doctrine than from an LDS general authority? However, by utilizing this encyclopedic book, the reader will notice that Mormonism and evangelical Christianity are at polar opposites. Both cannot be true. One must be false.We must consider the words of McConkie very seriously, then, and determine if he is speaking the truth as recorded in the Bible. Having studied the issues out, I believe McConkie was very sincere, though sincerely wrong in his doctrine. And, as Mr. Fojtik pointed out, he did change his mind on certain teachings, including the black issue, as church policy was reformed. While I disagree with his theology, I still believe Mormon Doctrine is an important read for those who want to better understand what Mormonism is all about."},{"Title":"Mormon doctrine,","review":"As a Bible-believing evangelical Christian, I believe it to be extremely valuable to study and explore other faiths. After being challenged by a Mormon friend to further explore their doctrine, I purchased this book. Ironically, even though the Mormon church states that the BOOK OF MORMON contains the \\"fullness of the everlasting gospel\\", you'll find many contradictions to the Book of Mormon and Biblical theology in \\"Mormon Doctrine\\" and other 'sacred' Mormon writings and teachings.I believe that God was always God and that Christ is His ONLY begotten son, that He is not married, does not have a body of flesh and bones and as He is now He has forever been and always will be. This book helped me to see that the complexities involved in the Mormon religion are simply beyond reason, and I am thankful that this resource is available to show Mormons where the contradictions within their religion lie. I also found it interesting to note the different definitions that Mormons use for the same \\"jargon\\" we use in the Christian world. Most notable was \\"atonement\\" ... interesting.God bless any Christian who reads this book in order to more effectively discuss what matters most with their Mormon friends.

Over the past year, the study of comparative religion has interested me greatly, and at first, my approach to study was marred by the use of unreliable and biased resources. I made the mistake of trying to learn about Mormons by reading anti-Mormon literature. However, what I found there (in books such as The God Makers, Kingdom of the Cults, etc) was not only appalingly uncharible and vindictive, but also appalingly deceitful and false! Unimpressed with their rhetoric and straw men tactics, I decided instead to do what I should have done in the first place; ask the Mormons what they believe.Aside from the BOM and D &amp; C, this is the first resource I purchased. The layout was impressive - very easy to use, concise, and well cross referenced. I was at first dismayed at the lack of an index, but that became a moot point since the book is so well laid out. Furthermore, although I know this is of course not scripture any more than the writings of St. Thomas Aquinas are to Catholics, it does present a good yet fallible summary of, well, Mormon Doctrine. My only complaint is that McConkie is a bit too brief in covering some points, and doesn't always give references to relevant sections in the canonized books of the Mormon Church. Because of this, further study is not always easy to persue. On the pro side of that, this book can rightfully be considered a &quot;primary source&quot; when citing, by and large.While I still disagree with many aspects of Mormon theology, at least now I can be confident that what I am stating on a particular point is actually what the LDS church believes. Persuing Mormon literature (and conversations with Mormons) prevented me from going down the fiery path of polemics and hatred for Mormons. As a Catholic, I know all too well what it is like to be on the receiving end of hatred and bigotry which roots itself in misunderstanding. As someone who is oftentimes on the receiving end of counter apologetics, I know well the difference between mere theological disagreement and outright bigotry. The distinction makes all the difference in the world when it comes to dialogue.Persual of literature such as this will require some extra effort, yes, but it will also help you obey the commandment not to bear false witness. There is no excuse for lazy research.Anyway - I fear that this book review had turned into an admonishment for my fellow apologists to be honest. However, since I think it needs to be said, and it does tie into this book in a sense, I'm keeping it here. In any case, if you want to learn about Mormonism, don't listen to idiots like Dave Hunt. Rather, you do well to start here for a good, reliable primer and a lasting resource."},{"Title":"Mormon doctrine,","review":"The unusual thing about McConkie's Mormon Doctrine is that it has little to do with the loving, gentle image presented by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in its advertisements. Bruce McConkie's approach may be disconcerting to many non-LDS, but his candor makes Mormon Doctrine well worth the time.I seriously recommend this volume to all those persons who are investigating the theology of the LDS simply because it addresses so many issues which will probably not be discussed during investigator classes and missionary meetings. In other words, practically all of the Gospel Doctrines of the Restored Church are presented in alphabetical order, with reference sources clearly noted. I personally feel that Mormon Doctrine is a wealth of information concerning one of the fastest growing Faiths in the world. So, if you are interested in learning more about &quot;Intelligences&quot;, &quot;Heavenly Parents&quot;, &quot;Eternal Progression&quot; and the &quot;Father of God&quot;, Mormon Doctrine is the superb resource. Elder McConkie pulls no punches, and the clarity of his expositions on his Faith make his work understandable on all levels.The style of Mormon Doctrine is very forthright, clear, and authoritative. Although at the very beginning of the book there is the caveat that Mormon Doctrine does not necessarily represent the views of the Church, and thus represents only the views of the author, the book is clearly one of the standard references in official Church publications, with references being made to it frequently in Sunday School manuals and other publications.At this point, I must state that Elder McConkie's references to non-LDS Churches (and especially Roman Catholicism) tend to be rather harsh, so please keep that in mind when reading Mormon Doctrine."},{"Title":"Mormon doctrine,","review":"I grew up with several Mormon friends and my brother has converted to Mormonism.

It was hard to find out what Mormon's really believed. I had other resources that were produced by &quot;mainstream&quot; Christians. However, these resources dealt with archaine theologies that while they are historically accurate are different from what most LDS believe today. MORMON DOCTRINES is an invaluable resourse to understand the current beliefs of the LDS Church.The first step in being able to talk to someone about their faith is understanding their faith. This is especially important in being able to bridge the language gap between Mormonism and &quot;Mainstream&quot; Christianity. MORMON DOCTRINE is especially good for this due to its encyclopedic format.

It isn't because it is hard to navigate - the encyclopedic format is very helpful, even more so in the days before internet search engines. It certainly isn't because it was written by a fringe author with a shallow grasp of the subject matter. Bruce McConkie was a member of the First Quorum of the Seventy when he wrote it, and would later be ordained an 'Apostle of the Lord'. It isn't because it is not authoritative. It is still an oft quoted source in modern day lesson manuals. It isn't because the content isn't thoroughly backed with references to the Standard Works and the words of the 'living prophets in this, the last dispensation of the fulness of times'. It is.The reason so many Mormons run away from this book is simple: It is too forthright. This isn't Gordon B. Hinkley flip-flopping over eternal progression; this is no apologies, no holds barred, rock 'em sock 'em Mormonism in the raw. This is 'The Meat' ladies and gentlemen. So what if it doesn't sell well in the 21st Century, the last I checked The Lord God of Hosts was the same yesterday, today, and forever - steadfast and immoveable.

One of the most stressed matters within the work is the identity of Christ, from His premortal commission, His earthly ministry, the things He is bringing to pass in the latter days, and His glorious second coming. Worthy of mention here is that the work includes the most complete summary of what the scriptures say are the signs of the second coming of Jesus Christ.

I agree that it has its message about spiritual aspects to healing, and that modern medicine ain't the godsend that seems to justify all the faith people put in it. But I want to point out a couple of things: First of all Mehl-Madrona's spirituality is not pure native american by any stretch of the imagination. I would be generous if I said it was a combination of native american and christian beliefs. Second, and more important, the &quot;healing&quot; that he claims occured was never proven medically. There's no official results shown before or after the &quot;treatment&quot; that indicates there was indeed a sick person that became well. You're just taking Lewis's word for it, and the truth of the matter is that I doubt it - I read it and I doubt it.I'm all in favor of getting in touch with our spiritual nature, and I do believe that good medicine requires strong direction from the patient as to the course of the cure. The kidney patients in the beginning of the book are a prime example of how &quot;medicine&quot; can go bad when it takes it's own unmanaged course. I applaud Mehl-Madrona for writing about that. But oddly, he exudes powerlessness throughout the entire book.

Despite being simply written it has a very strong and clear message - modern medicine has strayed too far from nature and become too self important."},{"Title":"Coyote Medicine: Lessons from Native American Healing","review":"I chose this book after watching a program on spiritual healing that featured Dr. Mehl-Medrona. I am grieving the loss of my husband and only child and want something other than the western medicine that is practiced with the grieving.

I am impressed with the author's casual way ofteaching the reader. His information has improved my mental health and outlook."},{"Title":"Coyote Medicine: Lessons from Native American Healing","review":"I loved this book. It should be required reading for all Doctors and anyone in the medical field. It is more about faith and community than medicine as it is practiced today. It shows there is more to healing than taking a pill or having surgergy, there are a lot of alternative ways of healing. This is about one mans struggle to follow his path in life but it's far from boring. A very good read."},{"Title":"Coyote Medicine: Lessons from Native American Healing","review":"It's been years since I finished this book- I do remember wanting more- so much so that I ordered two more books that this healing artist had written. I jut picked up from the recesses of my bookshelf Narrative medicine from the same author. I remembered why reading Lewis Mehl-Madrone's books is such a pleasure; he has a true gift of explaining his process by revealing in his steady narrative, what is true for him, emotionally , holistically . His humility is what makes him such a wonderful healer"},{"Title":"Coyote Medicine: Lessons from Native American Healing","review":"Coyote Medicine is the fascinating story of Lewis Mehl-Madrona and how he became a healer. Mehl-Madrona takes us on a wild ride through his childhood and adolescence, off to college early as a boy genius, med school, and then into ERs and hospital rooms. When he takes us into Native American sweat lodge healing ceremonies things get really interesting.Mehl-Madrona has a unique perspective on biomedical and Native American medicine. If you are interested in either, then you should read this book.In the words of the author, \\"Help yourself to a little coyote medicine, and thrive.\\""},{"Title":"Coyote Medicine: Lessons from Native American Healing","review":"Lewis' experience made me aware of my need to align myself with life. I now visit a Shaman. White man's therapy simply strings a person along until they either run out of money or insurance. Bear, my Shaman, gets right to the point. Lewis made me aware that I had this option."},{"Title":"Coyote Medicine: Lessons from Native American Healing","review":"This book comes from a veiw that is very seldom seen in a person combining modern technology with his born heritage. He makes it seem like you are right there with him all the way through the whole experience of his life and modern practice. It is a must read for anyone who is studying Native American beleifs and culture."},{"Title":"Coyote Medicine: Lessons from Native American Healing","review":"I enjoyed this book very much! It is full of truths ! I believe as does this man. I look forward to reading any book he writes.It was a easy read and on a level that I understood completely.I laughed and cried with his stories.I just loved it!"},{"Title":"Coyote Medicine: Lessons from Native American Healing","review":"This book blew me away. I have reread much of it so many times and bought multiple copies for friends. I have filled the margins of my copy with notes and filled notebooks with essays and thoughts inspired by Dr. Mehl-Madrona's book. It is nothing short of miraculous itself, in addition to describing medical miracles and how they are brought about by spiritual intervention and Native American healing.A child prodigy, Lewis Mehl-Madrona hitchhiked to a local college while still in high school, read philosophy science voraciously and was the youngest peacetime graduate of Stanford Medical School. The more impressive since his childhood was at times difficult.At medical school, Dr. Mehl-Madrona became interested in shamanic traditions and attended some sweat lodge and tipi ceremonies. Here he encountered otherwordly phenomena such as blue light, sparks, sensorial stimulation and miracle cures in cases that were deemed too far gone by western doctors. Most importantly, Dr. Mehl-Madrona learned how shamans talked to patients, asked questions about their families and lives and spent long periods of time with them. The author learned that shamans tap into the inner healer of the patient, and consider themselves only partially responsible for any cure.At the same time, Dr. Mehl-Madrona was encountering negligent and dehumanizing healing practices in his western medical pursuits. A few spine-chilling tales display the callousness and arrogance that exists in some hospitals and clinics. One example: two obstetricians made a bet concerning the fastest C-Section birth and the winner, very triumphant at seventeen minutes, accidentally tied something shut in the woman's internal organs. It was fixed and the woman even wrote a letter of thanks to the hospital! Such is the blind and sometimes unjustified trust the public has in the medical establishment.The book is wonderfully woven with many colorful strands of storytelling. On one level, it is a memoir of Dr. Mehl-Madrona's journey to reconcile his western medical training with holistic and in particular Native American healing. He is part Native American, so this pursuit poignantly reflects his mixed heritage. Poignant because Dr. Mehl-Madrona often felt like an outsider in all areas of his life, as a Native American man, as an American man, as a western doctor and as an aspiring and ultimately successful shaman.Another strand of his story is the Native American tradition of healing itself, which we discover in almost the same timeframe that he does. We are introduced to the traditional practice of storytelling as a healing technique at the same time that he is. Early in the book, when the doctor is a resident, he is tending a man whose medical condition is exacerbated (and perhaps caused) by his intensely critical nature. A wonderful passage in recounts Dr. Mehl-Madrona's tentative attempt at telling a story to the cynical patient, himself a psychologist, who groans with sarcasm as the story begins. As it continued, he was intrigued, however, and even hazards a guess at the meaning, to which guess the doctor gives an ambiguous confirmation. The great part of this passage is how Dr. Mehl-Madrona successfully enacts the role of enigmatic shaman even though he himself is still unsure of the story's meaning.Coyote Medicine also discusses the role of the supernatural in shamanic healing, and the perception of magic and nature. For anyone who ever sat in the woods or even on his aparment steps late at night and felt a mystical connection to something unseen and bigger than himself, Coyote Medicine is a kindred spirit.At one point the author goes on his vision quest and meets his power animals and is given shamanic healing tools. We as readers are present at many important moments in his life, including personal and family struggles (his first wife, according to the book, seemed to wrestle his children away from him and resented his shamanic efforts), professional travails (Dr. Mehl-Madrona's questioning intelligence, sense of dignity for the patient and also his holistic beliefs created friction with several different western medical institutions). When, at the end of the book, the author finds an accepting partner and on a professional level, a venue where he could combine holistic healing with Western, we feel as thought a close friend has triumphed in the face of great odds.I would recommend this book to anyone interested in healing, either for herself or others, and also about finding one's own individual path, as difficult as and untraveled as it might be, but that is true to the traveler.Many blessings on this book and thank you Dr. Lewis Mehl-Madrona.Robert Murray Diefendorf, Author of Release the Butterfly"},{"Title":"Coyote Medicine: Lessons from Native American Healing","review":"Coyote has always been a special animal to me, so the title jumped out at me. The two feathers and physician's symbol on the cover present a beautiful balance. The physician's symbol has the twin serpents and the two wings of the one. In the background is the four, the Mystery.Lewis' experiences are related in an interwoven manner. He rushes through life in the quest for medical expertise and validation. In doing so, he trips himself into bouts with infinity as his beautiful plans fall through, day-by-day, year-by-year. However, his rapidly depleted physical/mental being is slowly but surely filling from the inside out. The book is a wonderful, candid sharing of one human's journey to clarify his purpose, his vocation, and to realize such.He seems like a powerless pawn at times. Have you felt that way? I have. It takes courage to choose the walk toward balance with a fellow being. Lewis had to learn the way of the warrior to survive his path as a healer.The sweat lodge accounts are beautifully done. I felt it better than any other accounts I have read. Although I have not participated in a lodge, I have experienced years of &quot;spirit stuff&quot;. He is talking from experience. Lewis tells us without violating the trust of his friends, manifested or otherwise.The visions he describes are direct accounts, rather than attempts to relay deep knowings into a form the reader may understand. Visions come in dreams, in rituals, in waking, everyday consciousness, you name it. If we need it and are open to input, we will receive guidance. A vision is experiential, so there is no way to relay the richness and life of such an experience.Ya gotta walk the walk--it's the only way.I laughed pretty good at his experience learning to talk with the desert. I too learned this while out alone walking in the desert. At first I thought my spirit friends were nuts--and said so--but I did it and learned a lot. You'll have to read the book to find out.There were tears of joy and tears of sorrow while reading this book, and a lot of laughter. Thank-you for making the great leap and taking the risk of sharing, Lewis!"},{"Title":"Coyote Medicine: Lessons from Native American Healing","review":"This book is a well written merging of two subjects. The first is a personal sharing of Lewis Mehl-Madrona's upbringing and life experience as a half N.A. Native, his pursuit of a medical degree and specialty and his increasing disillusionment with the &quot;science&quot; of medicine as it is now widely practiced. The second is about Lewis' discovery of N.A. Native spirituality and shamani sm. He leads us on a winding path of discovery that introduces us to the intriguing characters who use shamanism to heal others, often while their own lives are in disarray, to those who sought healing and perhaps most importantly, to the spirits who assisted in the ceremonies. While pursuing this path of curing the individual, rather than the symptom, it seems that Lewis will lose site of his original goal to obtain his medical speciality. But, as so often occurs, as he helps others to heal, the path circles around to encompass his own needs and he completes his original path, a more well-rounded and enlightened human. More capable of understanding. More capable of giving what is really required. I found the writing to be powerful, the personal drama riveting and the glimpse into the ceremonies, symbolism and spiritualism of the N.A. shaman both moving and educational. After all these years of hearing the stories shared by N.A. natives, but not really understanding, I finally &quot;got it&quot;. This book slaked a thirst I didn't know I had. Lewis not only shared his story but acted as a teacher and I know that I've grown as a result. I highly recommend it and hope that we'll hear more from this writer."},{"Title":"Coyote Medicine: Lessons from Native American Healing","review":"\\"Coyote Medicine\\" is a tremendous source of insight and experience within the path of shamanism and health. Dr. Mehl-Madrona's story-telling is magnificent and at times very suspenseful hitting directly on our sensitive health and spiritual issues we face culturally. But, he doesn't give you easy answers, because his path to becoming a healer was very complex. For me, this book opened up parts of my consciousness and answered questions I was asking and some of those I hadn't yet asked. This book was truly a God-send and I am savoring every word I read."},{"Title":"Coyote Medicine: Lessons from Native American Healing","review":"I have no Native American blood, but every page of this book awakened fresh awareness why I feel such despair in dealing with what is called &quot;healing&quot; among American practitioners of medicine. I have a niece who went from terminal cancer to no traces of cancer in ONE sweat lodge and prior week of preparation with Mehl-Madrona. She was able to believe.His approaches will grate on those who value dogma and replicable rigidity over substance and intuitive responses to the individual. This book rates ten stars in my response to it. It moves toward sanity; away from the profits to be made in pushing destructive &quot;medicinal&quot; drugs that mask rather than cure."},{"Title":"Coyote Medicine: Lessons from Native American Healing","review":"On combining Native American and Western medicine. Unbelievably good. I was stunned, I would never have thought a book this good could be written. I went back and bought another copy for a friend after I got my first copy. Beyond merely outstanding. Good coverage of Native American holistic approaches to healing- true healing, not mere treatment without regard for the patient as a human being. The biography part was quite relevant. This book gives me a great deal of hope in the future of medicine- just reading it feels great. I hope to see more from this author, I'd set up a standing account at Amazon to buy anything he puts out whenever it comes out, as I do with Tom Brown, Jr., books."},{"Title":"Coyote Medicine: Lessons from Native American Healing","review":"This is THE best book on Native American spirituality I have ever read. Lewis Mehl-Medrano did an excellent job of sharing his autobiographical experiences as a &quot;half-breed&quot; in learning the spirituality of his family in a way that was relevant to those readers unfamiliar with N.A. spirituality. His presentation was refreshingly non-New Age in an honest, clearly written description of Native American healing beliefs and practices juxtaposed with his training and experiences as a western-trained medical doctor. The book was inspirational without being syrupy or lecturing. I truly enjoyed this book and will read it again."},{"Title":"Coyote Medicine: Lessons from Native American Healing","review":"Having suffered from a chronic major depressive illness for what seems like forever, and finding no relief from subscription anti-depressant medications, I was starting to panic because I was losing hope in the medical treatments that were being given to me to relieve my symptoms. I had long ago given up hope of finding someone who could possibly find the cause of this depression and be able to cure it once and for all. Thanks to fate, I guess, I picked up Dr. Mehl-Madrona's book and the rest, as they say, is history. He is director of the Center for Complementary Medicine in Pittsburgh, a two-hour drive for me, which was a small price to pay for the possibility of actually getting well. Upon first meeting Dr. Mehl-Madrona, I was struck by his unassuming, unpretentious and unthreating manner, especially in light of the fact that he is intellectually gifted. He was unlike any doctor I had ever met. We mapped out a course of treatment, which was not conventional by any stretch of the imagination. But, after only a few short months of treatment, I am a different person, a whole person, thanks to Dr. Mehl-Madrona's healing methods which integrate all levels of being - physical, mental, emotional and spiritual. I literally owe my life to this wonderful doctor. He put me in control of my healing, but he was there with me every step of the way. He treated me as an equal, as a partner in the healing process and the results have been nothing less than amazing.Read this book. It is a revelation of the lack of compassionate health care that is rampant in our society today. Dr. Mehl-Madrona is a light in our world who passes that light on to his patients and readers in order for them to see clearly the medical establishment that has lost touch with what's real and what's sacred about being human. If you take away nothing else from this review, remember this. Don't give up, don't ever give up. There is hope. And he goes by the name of Lewis-Mehl Madrona, M.D."},{"Title":"Coyote Medicine: Lessons from Native American Healing","review":"I am a registered nurse who has struggled with the reasoning behind many of our current medical practices for chronic care.

Just reading this book is a healing experience. The writer certainly has experience with native american culture, and he really does justice to their healing tradition. This is a book I wish I had read when I was in high school. It is very simply written, and profoundly healing. The right story, told at the right time, can be truly empowering.

The reviewer, rightly, characterized this novel as a remarkable recreation of the chaos and confusion that existed among the Bourbons and their followers during Holy Week, 1815, as Napoleon moved towards Paris to reclaim his throne.Aragon describes this week through the eyes and thoughts of an extensive cast of characters - turn coat Marshals of France, soldiers and officers of the Bourbons, and, particularly, Theodore Gericault. The descriptions of thoughts, events and locales are beautifully rendered. I really felt swept up in these events. I have read extensively on the Napoleonic period and the Hundred Days, but had never really fully empathized with the feelings of those going through this stunning reversal of fortune (to be suddenly repeated in June after Waterloo).I heartly recommend this novel to anyone with a good grasp of French who has an interest in this period of French History."},{"Title":"The Product Manager's Handbook : The Complete Product Management Resource","review":"As a new product manager, I found this book quite useful as an overview of what is to be expected of a product manager. The book covers the roles, skills, and expectations of the product manager, covers the different organizational structures that cover product management, and uses detailed examples to show how those functions work in practice.My only criticism is that it is a broad overview, and as such some of the areas (branding, for example) are covered very briefly. This book probably won't teach anything to the experienced product manager, but it might be useful as a reference to how other companies approach product management."},{"Title":"The Product Manager's Handbook : The Complete Product Management Resource","review":"For product managers and, in fact, *anyone* who contributes the to the making, marketing or selling of products, this is a great reference book to have on your shelves. Linda Gorchels does a masterful job synthesizing all of the issues a product manager must be capable of tackling. She accomplishes this task with clean, well-structured text and examples. The heart of the book is really a series of extended checklists which are comprehensive, well-researched and accesible to the lay reader.My only complaint is that the book is front-loaded with some some compartively less important stuff, including a chapter entitled &quot;Product Manager.com.&quot; I suppose this emphasis is reflective of a book written in 1999 and published in 2000. But as I cast my eye warily at that chapter I was *this close* to just chucking the whole thing.Just then...bingo. The red meat arrived at Chapter 5 when *finally* the planning skills required to be a PM were introduced. The book from this point (p. 69 in hardcover) on is cram-packed with tremendous information that you'll use again and again.So, my word of advice when you get this book is either (a) don't give up on it early, or (b) proceed directly to Chapter 5."},{"Title":"The Product Manager's Handbook : The Complete Product Management Resource","review":"I wish I had bought this book a year ago when I began building our PM Department! I live in Germany and the role of the product manager is poorly understood by many people I come into contact with. So it helps to have written examples which indicate that I am moving in the right direction. Even today, I find the book to be quite useful and the scenarios described in the book certainly apply to much of what I had to learn the hard way. It is a bit general for an experienced product manager but its small form-factor makes it easy to have with you at all times. It is an invaluable resource for those who are new to product management and is full of great ideas to help you move your product forward."},{"Title":"The Product Manager's Handbook : The Complete Product Management Resource","review":"Information was helpful however it was very general. As a new product manager I was able to gather enough general information to formulate some idea of how product management is received in organizations.

Again, this book is not for the advanced Product Manager."},{"Title":"The Product Manager's Handbook : The Complete Product Management Resource","review":"This book provides a very good overview of the role and responsibilities of the new Product Manager. It is aimed basically to describe the new concept of product management emerged out of corporate product marketing. Lot of literature is available to explain about new product development explaining the aspects of research, target customers etc. but it is not helpful for understanding of the complete role of product management. It has all inputs for setting up new product management team for organizations. As a new product manager I found this book helpful while making my role description. As I see, this second version has some new additions when compared to the first version and I hope, the next version will provide some additional information about branding, positioning and product marketing aspects to help experienced product managers as well. This book surely helps new product managers."},{"Title":"The Product Manager's Handbook : The Complete Product Management Resource","review":"I read this book in 2000 when I started my first job as a PM. Since then, I have re-read it a few times. Each re-read is such a pleasure as I am able to tie in my experience to more and more facets of the book that were previously unclear. The book is an industry independent, general review of the roles and responsibilities of a product manager. It lays a nice foundation for those who are new to the position by outlining business processes, internal and external interactions and organizational roles a PM can expect to have.The book does not delve into the mechanical details of marketing: such as conducting research, performing surveys, managing channels or evaluating effectiveness. However, it does talk about which kind of product managers would benefit from certain types of marketing initiatives.If you are new to Product Management or would like to learn more about the processes involved in managing a product's lifecycle, this book is an excellent introduction."},{"Title":"The Product Manager's Handbook : The Complete Product Management Resource","review":"The Product Manager's Handbook is a good, general introduction to the subject.

The book gives a good description of the different steps it takes to transform ideas into commercially viable products and the skill set expected from a performing product manager. The critical financial side of product management, however, deserves more space than only 8 pages in a 290-page book dedicated to the product manager. At the end of the day, a product manager must show the money. Otherwise, the products will be \\"killed\\" sooner or later."},{"Title":"The Product Manager's Handbook : The Complete Product Management Resource","review":"This is a very good introductory text to anyone who aspires to be a Product Manager.

There are books that offer in-depth coverage of specific areas of product management areas such as marketing planning, business planning, marketing analysis, data mining, and so on.Although a bit light on details, I gave it 4 stars because if it went into details it would have been a 5000 page book as Product Management sits anywhere between a simple to complex discipline depending on what industry and what firm one works in."},{"Title":"The Product Manager's Handbook : The Complete Product Management Resource","review":"This book gives a good introduction into the roles and responsibilities of a product manager. It makes no assumptions of any prior knowledge or experiences. For each chapter, it provides worksheets or process flow charts. In addition, case studies of actual events are presented. At the end of each chapter, it provides a set of checklist. Therefore I will recommend this to any reader interested to know more or making a career change.Overall, this book provides an excellent overview of the on-goings within business processes. Below is a brief summary.This book is divided into 4 parts. Part I gives an introduction into product management. Part II highlights the process that the product managers (PMs) can use in their annual planning activities. It provides a format or guidelines for the annual product marketing plan. Part III highlights the analytical skills of PMs, which is to evaluate existing product line and to determine & implement new product strategies. Part IV elaborates on the marketing skills necessary for a successful product line. Special attention is devoted to pricing and marketing communication decisions and activities.Briefly, product management is about the planning, forecasting and marketing of products and services. There is a need for PMs to be cross-functional leaders. The overall responsibility of the PM is to integrate the various segments of a business into a strategically focused whole, maximizing the value of a product by coordinating the production of an offering with an understanding of the market needs and requirements. PMs manage not only products, but projects and processes as well. The PM's job is to oversee all aspects of a product/service line to create and deliver superior customer satisfaction while simultaneously providing long term value for the company.In terms of time allocation, the PM typically spends 40-55% on day-to-day activities, 20-30% on short term activities and 15-25% on long term or strategic activities. Therefore excellent time management is crucial. Examples of day-to-day activities are maintenance of product fact books, motivation of the sales force and distributors, collection of marketing information including competitive benchmarks, trends and opportunities and customer expectations, acting as liaison between the sales, manufacturing and R&D;, etc teams. Examples of short-term activities are controlling budget and achieving sales goals, participation in annual marketing plan and forecast developments, working with advertising departments or agencies to implement promotional strategies, coordinating tradeshows and conventions, participation in new product-development teams and predicting and managing competitors' actions, modification of product and/or reduction of costs to increase value, recommendation of line extensions, participation in product elimination decisions, etc. Examples of long term strategic activities are creation of long term competitive strategy, identification of new product opportunities, recommendation of product changes, enhancements and introductions, etc.PMs need a variety of knowledge including product/industry knowledge, business knowledge and interpersonal/management knowledge. In the beginning, PMs typically spend most of the time gathering and organizing information on products, customers and their competition. Product knowledge is paramount. As they gain experience, the focus shifts to more comprehensive business knowledge, including finance, marketing and strategic planning. At the same time, they develop team building, negotiation, communication and leadership abilities. For PM to be effective, they need to build bridges throughout the company and be cross-functional leaders. For product management or marketing management, the emphasis is on being market-driven and not product-driven.In terms of new product development, the role of the PM will be to represent the voice of the customer, balancing the corporate ROI (rate of investment), customer satisfaction and the manufacturing cost. Whereas for strategic interactions, the PM must work continuously with operations to improve and enhance production line. PMs are frequently involved with operations on cost-reduction projects."},{"Title":"The Product Manager's Handbook : The Complete Product Management Resource","review":"This book is a good piece for brand manager's or product manager's over consumer goods.

At times I felt lost because she jumps from one topic to another and makes the reader confused when she throws a few strange sounding names without explaining who they were. As for the research of the subject I can't comment on the french part, however, on the polish side, the author didn't do a whole lot research because she couldn't even spell the name of an ex-King of Poland correctly! It's Stanisaw Leszczy&ntilde;ski, not Stanislas Leczinski!!! She also undermines the linguistic abilities of the readers, thinking maybe that no-one but the French can really figure out the french language. I would not recommend this book if you really want to learn something about Voltaire and his love life, because there was no love life in that book!!"},{"Title":"Voltaire In Love","review":"Nancy Mitford is not the author to look to if you like your history full of facts and wars and power politics. Nancy Mitford takes a difference approach, one more concerned with how simply delightful things (especially French things) were before that really vulgar revolution took all the fun out of being an aristocrat. She sees Voltaire as not only the pre-eminent humanist philosopher and writer of his time, but also as a sentimental fool who just could not help but run off with the lovely, but rather too intellectual Marquise de Chatelet. They kept getting into all sorts of elegant French trouble with the censors and the court, all the while being dreadfully brilliant about the whole state of the world. Delicious scamps! Miss Mitford's historic accuracy is not in question, nor are her skills as a writer or biographer. But she is more of a gossip than not, and is certainly more of an unmitigated snob about the French aristocracy than some down-to-earth readers might like. I for one adore this cosy, catty biography, and find it a welcome anecdote to the tons of weighty tomes on Voltaire and his endless epistolary relationships. Miss Mitford writes pastry -- light, airy and fluffy and yummy. She lets the others serve up full-course histories, heavy, balanced, probably good for you, but so often bland as oatmeal as just as charming."},{"Title":"Voltaire In Love","review":"I couldn't put this book down, and tore through it in a matter of days. Despite being a voracious reader, it's (sadly) seldom that such a book comes along for me. The main draw for me in purchasing this book is being an avid fan of Voltaire. I had wondered just how strongly the &quot;love story&quot; element of the book would play out, as I'd known prior to purchasing this book that all of the intimate correspondence between Voltaire and Emilie has been lost. I'm not a &quot;love story&quot; kind of person, and was hoping this book would provide more of a strong picture into the personalities, foibles, strengths, habits, and routines of Voltaire primarily, and Emilie secondarily. I was not disappointed.If you count yourself a lover of Voltaire -- the man and his writings -- then this book is truly a must-read for you. I've read much of his essays, philosophy, short stories, et cetera, and finally (to my immense delight) feel I &quot;know&quot; the man.The personalities and temperaments of both Voltaire and Emilie were rather as I'd figured they would be, although there were a couple of genuine surprises -- some flattering, some not so flattering.What continues to make me curious is how these two persons defined the word &quot;love&quot;...the dynamics of their relationship and love was interesting, and sometimes confusing, to say the very least. Ah well, I'm speaking of dead persons here. Respect for their personages and for the deceased prohibit me from going further. And besides, after nine years of marriage, I too admit the word &quot;love&quot; has a myriad of nuances.Please enjoy this book! Ecrasez l'infame!"},{"Title":"Voltaire In Love","review":"I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in the literature and history of an absolutely fascinating time period, the eighteenth century. This work is especially interesting not only, of course, to those who study the life and writings of Voltaire, but also to those, like myself, who study the life of Frederick the Great of Prussia. As usual, Mitford's writing style is intriguing and the reader is provided with unforgettable and very human portrayals of the principals. This book is a real &quot;must&quot; for any student of both literature and history.

However, it is to her credit that she superbly presents a view of history thru a man and an era of events in a real sense of humanist expression. Ms. Mitford's social perception of Voltaire is unequaled ! Her attention to detail and it's colourization is incrediable, although perhaps not entirely historically accurate, but why complain at all....especially when her very style of writing just entraces the reader in such a manner that one shall want to read and reread as much as possible any book by Nancy, or for that matter any written work by any of the fascinating Mitford sisters....!"},{"Title":"Voltaire In Love","review":"Nancy Mitford's Voltaire in Love is an entertaining book, full of historic characters, revealing both their best and worst attributes in politics, society, the arts, and the bedroom.The book is primarily about the long affair between Voltaire and his mistress, Mme. Emilie du Chatelet, which was certainly a meeting of two exceptionally brilliant minds of the Enlightenment. Yet the book really covers the early adult years of Voltaire and does not cover his later successes and fame.Voltaire, a graduate of Louise-le-Grand Jesuit School, was a brilliant but sarcastic student, who became popular with his witty poems and plays. Yet his satire often went to far which on more than one occassion resulted in imprisonment in the Bastile. Like Moliere, Voltaire wrote witty comedy that appealed to the sophisticated upperclasses. Yet early in his career he is forced into exile to London where he wrote plays for Queen Caroline and King George. Gradually his star rose in the French court of Louis XV. Queen Marie Leczinska found him charming and gave him a pension. Louis XV also gave him a pension but was less comfortable with Voltaire than was his wife and his father in law, Stanislas Leczinska, ex-king of Poland. The king's famous mistress, Mme. Jeanne-Antoinette de Pompadour, was an admirer of Voltaire also and there is some evidence that she came to his rescue when he ran afoul of the censors of Louis XV. Thus much of the book is about the highest levels of French society and their impact on the arts, sciences, and humanities.As is the case with many bright and opinionated thinkers, rivalry and jealousy and ambition create the conditions for long lasting enemies. This is the case between Voltaire and Jean-Baptiste Rousseau, a philosopher whom Voltaire seemed to disdain. However Voltaire's primary rivalry was with Abbe Desfontaines. Abbe Desfontaines was found molesting male adolescent chimney sweeps and was sentenced to burn at the stake for sodomy. Voltaire was one of his only allies and Desfontaine was saved. Yet, amazingly, Desfontaine became extremely critical and bitter and vindictive toward Voltaire leading the reader to recognize that no good deed goes unpunished.The attempts of Frederick II of Prussia to lure Voltaire into his court was amazing underhanded strategy. Frederick II, creating a completely male homosexual court, seemed to be obsessed with Voltaire and secretly tried to undermine him in France so that offers to come to Prussia would be more appealing.The book however is primarily about the affair of Voltaire and Emilie du Chatelet. They were quite a pair, both studious and brilliant, who allowed each other ample space to think and create. Voltaire and Emilie both popularized the works of Sir Issac Newton and advanced the fields of science and mathematics. French scholarly society prefered to continue to support Descarte's theories, primarily because he was French, a loyalty that Voltaire saw as standing in the way of rational thought. The book takes us through the many journeys of Voltaire and Emily outside of their remote mansion in the countryside. We see Emilie struggle in a game of strategy with King Frederick II for the loyalty of Voltaire. We see Voltaire trying to be supportive during Emilie's outrageous gambling addition. Her son, Florent-Francois is virtually raised in a home with two fathers. Eventually Emilie falls into lust for the handsome bright Saint-Lambert and wishes to continue her 3 man life with a rich lenient legal husband, her older more mature lover who has become her best friend, and her younger sex toy boyfriend. Unfortunately she becomes pregnant with Saint-Lambert and at age 43 dies 2 days after giving birth.Well written, well documented, engaging, entertaining, and full of witty satiric details, this is an accomplishment that you will enjoy."},{"Title":"Voltaire In Love","review":"\\"Voltaire was a consistent pacifist. Warring Princes to him were, 'hateful spiders, tearing each other to pieces instead of spinning silk.' Ever since Frederick [King of Prussia] had invaded Silesia he had been scolding him for breaking the peace of Europe. 'I am so afraid that you will come to despise human beings.' 'I only put my foot on the banks of the Styx, but I was grieved, Sire, at the number of poor wretches I saw passing by.' 'Will you and your fellow Kings never stop ravaging this earth to which you say you want to bring Happiness?' Frederick took all this quite good naturedly: 'It's the fashion now [1742] to make war, and presumably it will last a good long while.'\\"~ Nancy MitfordThis is an in-depth chronicle of a love story between Voltaire and the love of his life, Emilie, the Marquise du Chatelet. Emilie was married, had children, and had one of the most brilliant scientific minds in France -- she was a mathematician and physicist. She enchanted Voltaire, and he stayed with her, with her husband's consent, until she died.Theirs is a fascinating story -- won't spoil it. Voltaire was one of the eminent French writers, thinkers, and wits of his day. Emilie was a strong, bright, compelling woman, at least to Voltaire. He called their meeting the turning point of his life, and began his \\"Memoires\\" with their meeting. That Emilie's husband graciously accepted Voltaire in their life for more than 20 years made this story even more compelling.Having just finished Candide and developed a strong admiration for Voltaire and a curiosity about this love story, it was a delight to find a book which dealt with only that. This work is highly recommended for anyone who wants to investigate the great Voltaire."},{"Title":"Voltaire In Love","review":"By reading this book, you will get a witty, lively and erudite view of Voltaire's life, loves and many friends.

I bought 'Volatire in Love' expecting to be thrust in a world of soirees, lasciviousness and all things French bound together by the magic of literature-something that M.V. Llosa does effortlessly with Gaugin in 'A Way to Paradise'-only to find that I was dealing with an author and a subject with a tendency to fall in love with their own prose. Maybe it was my expectation that let me down, but then again it may not have been me."},{"Title":"Voltaire In Love","review":"All Nancy Mitford's books are brilliant - except this one.

There were many times I wanted to be able to respond to the author because I felt that she tends to judge others in the Christian faith for their beliefs, but as I kept reading - she shared her struggles regarding judgment of herself and others.

This was also found in a great fiction novel that I had read recently, titled: LUMINOUS by Peter Quest. It too had amazed me with an open dialogue on faith and its meaning to the average Christian.

Lamott meditates on life's experiences and makes good, solid, even holy connections with these experiences. She prays and teaches her son to pray and she has found a good, caring community of pray-ers who need help and help others in return. St. Thomas Aquinas and his Summa Theologica just can't cut it with today's crowd. Lamott can and will. I hope she keeps on writing.

The opposite of pastel, sun-drenched &quot;religious&quot; text, Traveling Mercies is an invigorating, refreshing chronicle of Ms. Lamott's own spiritual journey; and what a wonderful thing it is to be in the passenger seat beside her for the ride.Jewish, Christian, Muslim, Mormon, atheist, etc., it doesn't matter. This book is as universal as water and just pure, assuming you don't live in New York.Thinking about buying it? Stop thinking about buying it and just order.

SOME THOUGHTS ON FAITH.","review":"This book is one of those that gives me fits when I ask for it in a bookstore. The cashier says, &quot;what section would it be in?&quot; and I answer &quot;well, nonfiction maybe... um, literature. Personal essay, is that a section? It could be under religion or spirituality... or autobiography?&quot; The cashier just looks at me and tries not to laugh.Lamott writes about herself and all around her. The first third of the book, my favorite part, is a journey of faith from California hippie agnosticism/mysticism to strict atheism to christianity. She writes about her son, about her friends, alive and dying, about her journies and discoveries. She is very real, very tough, very high-strung emotionally and quite honest, I think. She reminded me of Ani Difranco -- if Ani Difranco was a bit older, had a son, was christian, and lived in California.This book could be a cool drink of water to many sick and tired of &quot;mainstream&quot; christianity. Anne Lamott isn't mainstream, but she is definitely christian. She writes, &quot;My friends like to tell each other that I am not really a born-again Christian. They think of me more along the lines of that old Jonathan Miller routine, where he said, &quot;I'm not really a Jew -- I'm Jew-ish.&quot; They think I am Christian-ish. But I'm not. I'm just a bad Christian. A bad born-again Christian. And certainly, like the apostle Peter, I am capable of denying it, of presenting myself as a sort of leftist liberation-theology enthusiast and maybe sort of a vaguely Jesusy bon vivant. But it's not true...I could go to a gathering of foot-wash Baptists and, except for my dreadlocks, fit right in. I would wash their feet; I would let them wash mine.&quot;Anne Lamott describes herself as &quot;slightly more anxious than the average hypochondriac&quot;, and maybe it's well-earned. There is a lot of disease and dying in this book -- often used to paint a wonderfully painfully important lesson about faith, God, and people. I can't quite decide if reading this while being close to a serious illness would be incredibly good or disastrously bad.All, in all, her writing is pretty good. At the end of some chunks, I was a little lost about how we got to this conclusion, or even what conclusion we came to. But the book is quite enjoyable, and potentially powerful. It's a quick, easy read, with pieces to savour.A sample:&quot;Nothing happened. No burning bush, no cereal flakes dropping from heaven, forming letters of instruction in the snow. It's just that God began to act like Sam-I-Am from Green Eggs and Ham. Everywhere I turned were helpful household hints on loving one's enemies, on turning the other cheek, and on how doing that makes you look in a whole new direction. There were admonitions about the self-destructiveness of not forgiving people, and reminders that his usually doesn't hurt other people, so much as it hurts you. In fact, not forgiving is like drinking rat poison and then waiting for the rat to die. Fortune cookies, postcards, bumper stickers, everything but skywriting -- yet I kept feeling that I could not, would not forgive her in a box, could not would not forgive her with a fox, not on a train, not in the rain.&quot;..."},{"Title":"TRAVELING MERCIES. SOME THOUGHTS ON FAITH.","review":"When she is not traveling on book tours, or out of town doing public speaking or teaching writer's workshops, Anne Lamott can be found in her native Marin County, California, usually hanging out with her son Sam, who is a little boy in this book. Anne is a single mom, and never was married to Sam's dad, who is one in a succession of lovers she has had in her quest to fill the gap left by her now deceased Dad, whom she loved as much as sunshine, air, and life itself.Anne embodies a unique blend of sorrowful sensitivity, sharp observation, unashamed candor, unmarred eloquence, and spiritual sweetness and vulnerability. Her humor delights and astonishes, as does her wisdom, often expressed in brief epigrams worth becoming the armataure around which you just might restructure aspects of your life. I love the woman and trust her because above all, she is unafraid to be real.However, this fearlessness did not come naturally or easily. Anne has had a messy life. In Traveling Mercies she pulls the bandages off her wounds that we might see. In her \\"Overture,\\" titled \\"Lily Pads,\\" she retraces her fragile journey into the arms of God, telling us how she was dragged kicking, screaming and crawling, into the Kingdom by pierced hands, and how her wounds are now healing. What follows is twenty-four chapters divided into seven sections: Mountain, Valley, Sky; Church, People, Steeple; Tribe; Kids, Some Sick; Body and Soul; \\"Fambly\\"; Shore and Ground. She reveals glimpses, sparks, glimmers of God's glory in the mundane relationships and neurotic struggles of her life, teaching us about forgiveness, grace, and hope. Never preachy, she is always vigilant to preserve life's mixed quality, light in the midst of darkness, hope in the midst of despair, joy, wet with tears of sorrow. You won't find a plastic Jesus on the dashboard of her car, or anywhere in this book.Lamott's candor, humor, faith and groundedness are everywhere apparent, as in this quotation: \\"God: I wish you could have some permanence, a guarantee or two, the unconditional love we all long for. 'It would be such skin off your nose?' I demand of God. I never get an answer. But in the meantime I have learned that most of the time, all you have is the moment, and the imperfect love of people\\" (168).The book is aptly titled. She is sharing with us the some of the mercies she's found traveling the bumpy, potholed pathways of life in the raw. If you are looking for pat answers, look elsewhere. But if you're in need of mercy and a little light in the midst of your own darkness, find it here."},{"Title":"TRAVELING MERCIES. SOME THOUGHTS ON FAITH.","review":"I have to hand it to Anne Lamott for being honest with herself and her past. She is a Christian and her growth is shown in this book as she discusses family, friends and raising her son Sam. The first quarter of the book may be disturbing for some with its graphic description of the author's drug and alcohol problems, but by the end of the book, the reader has developed a certain respect for Lamott and her insights into life born from her past. She is a woman comfortable with herself, her faults and her relationship with God, although she is well aware that she is far from the person that God believes she can become. The best reason to read this book, however, is not necessarily for the stories, but for her writing style. Lamott is a gifted writer. She believes in her faith and in her writing, both of which shine through in this short book."},{"Title":"TRAVELING MERCIES. SOME THOUGHTS ON FAITH.","review":"As LaMott keeps writing, she just gets better and better and this is one of her best book. He whole life has been a journey from tournament tennis player (see Crooked Little Heart) to sex, drugs, and alcoholism (see Hard Laughter) to single parenthood (see Operating Instructions) to grace and forgiveness in a spiritual community. She shares her hard learned and irreverent wisdom with us in Traveling Mercies and (and Plan B). The humanity of this book will make you cry and then laugh because you have found a kindred spirit."},{"Title":"TRAVELING MERCIES. SOME THOUGHTS ON FAITH.","review":"I loved this little book by Anne Lamott. Her honesty in dealing with spiritual struggles and truths is touching. She encourages others to embrace their faith and hold on for dear life, even when things aren't going smoothly and their lives are broken and rough. She reminded me that God wants me just as I am, not how I think I should be before I approach Him. He doesn't mind if I am broken and humbled before Him, in fact, He knows that it makes me realize my need that much more.Anne's candidness is effective and her stories are enjoyable. This is a quick read and has short chapters. It's good for the \\"in between\\" times you have a second to read like when you take a break at work or have a few minutes to yourself. Pick it up. It can't hurt!"},{"Title":"TRAVELING MERCIES. SOME THOUGHTS ON FAITH.","review":"Traveling Mercies is an achingly beautiful reflection of Lamott's faith journey. Although Lamott is so honest it makes me uncomfortable at times, I still want everyone I know to read this book so we can share the experience. Lamott weaves humor, beauty, pain and mystery into every chapter. In the end, you are left hopeful."},{"Title":"TRAVELING MERCIES. SOME THOUGHTS ON FAITH.","review":"What a neat little book! Lamott's charming account of her experiences in finding and living the Christian faith is neither too preachy nor too flippant. She simply tells her story in her own voice. And, that voice is often hysterically funny, occasionally poignant and sometimes shocking. But, it is always honest. To those of you who have complained that the book is self-obsessed, what did you expect? Of course it's self-obsessed; it *is* a memoir for pete's sake!You don't have to be born again, or even very religious (I'm neither) to enjoy this book. Begin it with an open mind, you won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"TRAVELING MERCIES. SOME THOUGHTS ON FAITH.","review":"Ann doesn't bash you over the head with the Bible. She is not out to convert you. Her writing is not judgemental. It is honest, emotional, and strong.I connected with this book in a big, big way. While going through the MOST trying time of my life, Traveling Mercies fell into my lap. And although I had a hard time feeling sorry for the self abusive and self destructive author in the first few chapters, I grew to understand her faith and the strength she draws from it as the book progressed.This book gave me strength to face each day. I would reread chapters and repeat lines from the book to myself because I found power in them.God works in mysterious ways. That is why this book found me. If you need a spiritual boost, read it. And read it again. If you are looking for just another recovering-alcoholic-author-bio.....it is good for that too. But the faith stuff is where the book's power lies."},{"Title":"TRAVELING MERCIES. SOME THOUGHTS ON FAITH.","review":"Most other books on faith or spirituality that I've read are solemn, dull, and seem to lecture the reader about how &quot;deep&quot; and &quot;meaningful&quot; life is and how seriously we must always regard it. What a breath of fresh, hilarious air Traveling Mercies is! Anne Lamott expertly delves into the complexity of the human condition in a way that is accessible to everyone and shows us how &quot;deep&quot; and &quot;meaningful&quot; life really is without preaching at us. I love the way she uses her own life to illustrate what it means to just be human. Many readers may not have had problems with alcohol or drugs as she did but her point is, who among us can say they have never struggled with jealousies, resentments, insecurities about their bodies or creativity, or pain and doubt in their personal relationships? Each chapter ended so neatly and gracefully, skillfully tying up all the strands she had laid out. Her lessons in how one can live by small, personal acts of faith and connections to fellow humans, rather than traditional, sanctimonious, grand(iose!)gestures of spirituality was so inspiring! I have been astounded by reviewers who apparently missed her point entirely and seemed to resent reading about faith from a very personal perspective. To my mind, there is no better way to understand and learn about it, as each of us has to develop our own personal sense of faith in order to survive and prosper in this world. I hope many more people read this amazing book (and &quot;get&quot; the message!)."},{"Title":"TRAVELING MERCIES. SOME THOUGHTS ON FAITH.","review":"I had no idea what to expect in this, my first encounter with Anne Lamott. The wide assortment of reviews convinced me to purchase the book--plus, the idea of reverence paired with irreverence, since we can all use a little humor to season the subjects that matter most...that therefore become so stinkin' divisive! Wow! When I'm not laughing at Anne's great writing and gritty insights, I'm pushing down that lump in my throat. Anne plants and waters the flowers of faith and grace, but pats down their seeds beneath the coarse dirt and smelly manure of life. I'm not trying to match her metaphors, I'm merely responding to the fresh light she's shone on my own recent experiences. This woman can write and, boy, does she have something to say. If she steps on your toes to get to the podium, so be it. Hear her out. She writes of a heartfelt belief in Jesus that I share. But she also drags out the skeletons that we born-again Christians are so afraid to let out. Ironic, isn't it, that those who follow Christ--the most amazing example of love and acceptance and forgiveness to the &quot;unlovely&quot;--are the very ones who insecurely point their fingers at those outside their box. I grew up in that box. I still love Jesus, still consider myself &quot;born-again,&quot; but I, along with Anne Lamott, refuse to live in that box anymore. Jesus, speaking to the religious leaders of his day, called them &quot;white-washed tombs full of dead man's bones.&quot; Anne, in her gracious, irreverent way, says the same. Mercy me! What a breath of fresh air!"},{"Title":"TRAVELING MERCIES. SOME THOUGHTS ON FAITH.","review":"If you're experiencing a lot of spiritual &quot;static&quot; as I am right now, this book will immediately make you feel better. It will assure you that you're not the only one to feel doubt and need and grief, and yet it will give you countless opportunities to release those emotions through laughter.I have highlighted much of the book so that I can reread the great ways that Anne Lamott captures these experiences. She talks about grieving over her late best friend, saying she was, &quot;thinking of how much we lose, yet how much remains.&quot; Then she says, &quot;I thought maybe I wouldn't feel so bad if I didn't have such big pieces of [her friend} still inside me, but then I thought, I want those pieces in me for the rest of my life, whatever it costs me.&quot;Lamott writes about trying hard to translate her spiritual beliefs into everyday treatment of others, and she's particularly funny when she writes about the mother of her son's friend. She berates the woman first for wearing bicycle shorts (&quot;because she can&quot;). Lamott says, &quot;...she does not have an ounce of fat on her body. I completely hate that in a person. I consider it an act of aggression against the rest of us mothers who forgot to start working out after we had our kids.&quot; Lamott tries to be better, saying, &quot;I tried to will myself into forgiving various people who had harmed me directly or indirectly over the years--four former Republican presidents, three relatives, two old boyfriends, and one teacher in a pear tree--it was &quot;The Twelve Days of Christmas&quot; meets &quot;Taxi Driver.&quot;I loved this book. I didn't want it to end. It made me laugh. It made me think. These are qualities I seek in my friends and my books."},{"Title":"TRAVELING MERCIES. SOME THOUGHTS ON FAITH.","review":"In \\"Travelling Mercies\\", Anne Lamott chronicles her journey of faith. From drug addiction, to alcoholism: through the deaths of her father and best friend, and the birth of her son, Ms. Lamott traces her spiritual journey in a series of moving, funny, and deeply personal anecdotes. One warning: this book is probably not for those seeking a traditionally-minded, conservative Christian memoir, as it is definitely not either traditional or conservative!For those whose faith is less structured, this book is an incredibly funny, searingly personal and deeply moving account of one woman's transformation through faith. Ms. Lamott possesses the rare gift of translating her faith into day-to-day experiences and sharing her innermost, most difficult or stressful thoughts in a very funny, realistic, human way.Other readers have mentioned the story of the woman in bicycle shorts (Ms. Lamott's \\"Enemy Lite.\\"), which is truly hilarious. Other highlights included the\\"celebration\\" of Ash Wednesday, and her encounter with another Christian whose faith seemed to be quite a different order from her own. Ms. Lamott is also wonderful when she writes about children: whether about her own son or her friends' children.This would make a wonderful gift for those who are \\"teetering on the edge\\" of Christianity, wondering, can this faith, this tradition possibly ever mean anything to me? Through these stories, Anne Lamott illustrates the miracle that is her faith, and leaves the door open for anyone who wants to follow. A wonderful, inspiring and very funny book."},{"Title":"TRAVELING MERCIES. SOME THOUGHTS ON FAITH.","review":"As a word of warning, this book is full of crass and offensive language and situations. You will not find someone pretending that everything is okay, but freely admitting the painful details of her life. Lamott has suffered through many trials in her past including early and frequent promiscuity and abortion, heavy drug use, financial problems, alcoholism, bulimia, and suicidal thoughts. Yet, because of this \`hold nothing back' mentality, the book is very real, funny and sometimes insightful. We see a woman grasping for faith and hope in the midst of a crazy life full of heartache.This book may help those who feel they are unacceptable to the church because of things they have done. Lamott reminds us that God's grace is for all people in all circumstances. It pushes us past the misunderstandings of Christians as people who have everything together. Here, we find a very non-typical \`Christian' woman, who may help reach others with the Good News that Christ died for us while we were still sinners. I would recommend this book to friends and others who have been turned off by traditional Christianity, hoping that it may provide a door for them to reconsider what this Jesus stuff is all about.Finally, the book serves as call for all of us in the church to live out the Gospel message through lives of love and service. Lammott says, \\"when I was at the end of my rope, the people at St. Andrew tied a knot in it for me and helped me hold on. The church had become my home\\" (100). I pray that her experience may describe all of our churches as we reach out and welcome in all types of people, so that they may know their true home in the unconditional love of Christ."},{"Title":"TRAVELING MERCIES. SOME THOUGHTS ON FAITH.","review":"&quot;Traveling Mercies&quot; is a book about both humanity and spirituality. It is also about accepting with grace the idea that we are all have an &quot;E Ticket&quot; on an unpredictable rollercoaster ride. Lamott finds that it is only faith that's gives her an anchor and a point of reference as &quot;life happens&quot;.Anne Lamott walks us through her own amazing story complete with pain, glory, revelation, heartache, serendipity, tragedy, self-loathing, tiny-but-profound personal victories and the eventual peace of self-acceptance (sort of.) Sound familiar? That's because we are seeing the reflection of our own lives in Annie's mirror.What do I have in common with the author? We are both humans. Beyond that, not much. I am not female, liberal, a recovering addict, a former atheist or have I suffered from bad hair. But I'm betting most readers see glimpses of their own personal photo albums throughout this remarkable book. It's just that all of our pictures are a little different. The difference is perspective.It's amusing to see some of the reviews in which readers are badly missing the point. Lamott writes willingly (and ironically) about her about her obsessions, self-destructiveness and compulsive/addictive behavior. She has achieved a truce with her shortcomings -- and, implicitly, is suggesting all of us accept our own imperfections (and those of others). If we wait for &quot;perfect&quot;, we'll be waiting a long time. That's why it's ironic to read reviews in which a few readers complain that she exposes her faults on the pages of the book. And seems obsessive about it .... Hello, fellow reviewers? Anybody home?By the way, the book is also laugh-out-loud hilarious from time to time. Read slowly, let it sink in and enjoy. Travelling mercies to you, too, Anne."},{"Title":"TRAVELING MERCIES. SOME THOUGHTS ON FAITH.","review":"Traveling Mercies by Anne Lamott is a compelling story infused with acute and wonderful insights about life and faith. A collection of Lamott's personal experiences, this book shows how hard life can be, and how gracious God always is. Traveling Mercies is about, among other things: a troubled childhood, drinking, drugs, bulimia, death, empty relationships and fulfilling ones, a search for spirituality, parenting challenges, and bad hair days...but nonetheless, and most of all, it's about faith-miracles and blessings, forgiveness and grace. Lamott writes with the clarity and honesty of one who is self-aware, perhaps painfully so at times. Funny and frank, she uses her own struggles and joys to illustrate truths a reader can recognize, all the while demonstrating a faith tested and formed by the real world."},{"Title":"TRAVELING MERCIES. SOME THOUGHTS ON FAITH.","review":"I picked this book up in an airport as a present for an Episcopal friend, expecting not to be interested myself---and promptly read the whole book before the plane had landed. I've been familiar with Anne Lamott from fiction, other books of essays, and local radio programs for a while now, but only with this book did I realize that she has a strong religious identity. To be honest, I expected that to put me off---like so many, I feel plenty &quot;spiritual&quot; but get a little antsy when anyone else talks about their specific belief set, especially one so dogmatic as Christianity. This book, however, is more about the spiritual questions that consume us all (yes, even us non-Christians) and the joy and pain of our attempts to answer them. Anne is completely readable, funny, and (unlike many writers who tackle the topic of spirituality), NOT HOKEY. Well worth reading, and, for me, re-reading in sections pretty often."},{"Title":"TRAVELING MERCIES. SOME THOUGHTS ON FAITH.","review":"I am a Christian, the homeschooling Republican variety ;)[edit: Not a Republican anymore], and I find Lamott to be wonderfully honest and real. Those who are offended by her introspection shouldn't have bought a memoir, for starters, and realize that all writers rely heavilly on the self. Lamott is just too honest to pretend that she isn't almost always writing about herself.Furthermore, those who think she isn't spiritual enough to be writing a book on faith miss the whole point. SHE ISN'T SPIRITUAL ENOUGH! That's the point. None of us are. Faith is believing IN SPITE of our frailty and inability to understand.If you want to pretend that only perfect people understand faith, don't read Lamott. If you want to have a little fun while being encouraged to consult God a little more and treat others with compassion, this is a great little read."},{"Title":"TRAVELING MERCIES. SOME THOUGHTS ON FAITH.","review":"Almost funnier than this wonderful book by Anne Lamott are the people who claim to be &quot;true&quot; Christians and prove it by picking up a handful of sharp stones to throw (anonymously, of course) TRAVELING MERCIES is powerfully poignant and hilarious - self-deprecating and adroitly drawn stories of a faith that I for one can definitely believe in. Pay no attention to the people who would have been first in line to string up you-know-who a few centuries back. Jealousy is so sad, some people really need to take a few cleansing breaths and perhaps some Sam-e. It's funny, but don't let it get in the way of enjoying this great and pure-hearted book. Annie, I hope you are laughing your head off."},{"Title":"TRAVELING MERCIES.

I'm on my second go-round and have moved from yellow hilighter to red pen to mark favorite passages. This will be a colorful read if I can part with it to pass it on to someone else. These &quot;essays&quot; are little glimpses into a very human life and one comes away with - among other mantras - &quot;Thank you, thank you, thank you&quot; for the gift of life and faith."},{"Title":"TRAVELING MERCIES. SOME THOUGHTS ON FAITH.","review":"I, too, feel that this book is more about finding oneself than about finding faith in religion. It was obvious from Ms. Lamott's experiences that she had a lot of grief in her life, but that only made me feel like I was reading about a real person; someone to identify with. And, as she grew older, she came to terms with her problems. I felt the book was an honest account, painting a true picture of Anne Lamott. I also found it funny - in some parts I actually laughed out loud - and a little sad at times, too. It was well worth the read."},{"Title":"TRAVELING MERCIES. SOME THOUGHTS ON FAITH.","review":"This is definitely one of the best books I have read in a really long time. Anne Lamott had a great sense of humor and a razor-sharp wit. As someone who is funny, thoughtful, intelligent, well-read, emotional and religious she is a great role model for anyone who struggles with questions of religion and faith."},{"Title":"TRAVELING MERCIES. SOME THOUGHTS ON FAITH.","review":"I haven't finised reading &quot;Traveling Mercies,&quot; but so far, it has been an enjoyable experience. For whose who think that Lamott is self-absorbed, who else do you spend most of your time with, other than yourself? You are born by yourself and you die by yourself.Someone once told me that that world is always going to ask you the same question when you want to achieve (or have achieved) your greatness, &quot;Who do you think you are?&quot; Therefore, I thank Lamott for her attempt to reveal to us an honest testimony of herself in a world full of resentment towards individuals who show us their true selves. Revealing the truth of oneself, doesn't have to be grandiose, worldly or great, it only has to be honest and clear."},{"Title":"TRAVELING MERCIES. SOME THOUGHTS ON FAITH.","review":"It's amazing that all the reviews of this booke either seem to be five stars or one star. Lamott is apparently a polarizing figure and her style of writing is perhaps a bit conversational and informal for many. However, I found her to be one of the more genuine and unabashedly honest writers I've ever come across. She tells it like it is, and that has always, and will always, ruffle many feathers. You go Annie! Who else would take a break from a prayer to flip off a fellow motorist? I suppose you call that an authentic centrist."},{"Title":"TRAVELING MERCIES. SOME THOUGHTS ON FAITH.","review":"Traveling Mercies is a revelation that strikes a deep chord in the heart. Anne Lamott has put her finger on our struggles to find meaning and to believe God has something to do with it. Her situations (like bad hair or the &quot;aunties&quot;) are the same ones we deal with every day. How wonderful to confirm that this is where we find God--in our everyday acts. No pious platitudes or preaching here. What a joy! It is one of the realest books I have ever read, while at the same time laugh-out-loud funny and sometimes touching to the point of tears. Because it is so real, it is deeply believable. Thank you, Anne, for living it and writing it."},{"Title":"TRAVELING MERCIES.

It's amazing that Christians, who know this about salvation, fail so regularly at depicting what a conversion experience is like. Lamott tells a lot of stories and shares a host of ruminations in this book, but her account of her conversion experience is the highlight and is more than worth the price of the book."},{"Title":"TRAVELING MERCIES. SOME THOUGHTS ON FAITH.","review":"Anne Lamott is a single mother, former addict and alcoholic, and a believer. We couldn't be more different. But I loved this book: her tales and struggles, how she has become part of a community of believers without a lot of dogma and fanfare. I loved the descriptions of people in her church and how they help each other, her concerns and deep love for her child, and the losses she's been through. I am astonished that, given her background, she has written books that can be so helpful to others. Like her earlier book, BIRD BY BIRD, this one inspires and teaches through her human fears and doubts.I would recommend this to writing students because Lamott demonstrates how writing about the details of your life in your own voice can make even the simplest events compelling and interesting.~~Joan Mazza, author of DREAM BACK YOUR LIFE; DREAMING YOUR REAL SELF; WHO'S CRAZY ANYWAY? and 3 books in The Guided Journal Series with Writer's Digest Books."},{"Title":"TRAVELING MERCIES.

This is a superb account of one woman's struggle and ultimate victory in finding spirituality, and with it herself. Refreshing frank, Lamott writes for a male audience as well as a female one. Her truths resonate with human frailties, human strengths, and the human comedy. A book you read and then want to buy copies for everyone you know!"},{"Title":"TRAVELING MERCIES. SOME THOUGHTS ON FAITH.","review":"Unsuspecting people will buy this book because it appears to be a memoir of a troubled woman's journey to religious faith. Anchor Books promotes this impression by (a) on the cover, putting the title of the book on a signboard in front of a church -- as if it were the title of a sermon, (b) subtitling the book &quot;Some Thoughts on Faith&quot;, (c) on the back of the book, classifying the book as &quot;Memoir/Spirituality&quot; and stating that the book &quot;shows us the myriad ways [Lamott's] faith sustains and guides her&quot;, and (d) on the publishing information page, encouraging such card catalogue entries as &quot;1. Lamott, Anne -- Religion&quot; and &quot;3. Christian biography -- United States&quot;.This is false packaging. There is very little about religion or spirituality in this book; it is much more about gaining faith in one's self than it is about gaining religious faith.So what is this book? It's part Fran Leibowitz, part Annie Dillard, and great dollops of self-indulgence. If you are looking for a book about faith, spirituality, or religion, then you have come to the wrong place. If you seek an &quot;irreverent&quot; book about growing up drug-addled, having a child without benefit of marriage, being obsessed with hair and cellulite, and how to come to terms with these assorted conditions, then this is your book."},{"Title":"TRAVELING MERCIES. SOME THOUGHTS ON FAITH.","review":"Anne Lamott's thoughts on faith are an alternative to the &quot;how to be a better Christian&quot; alternatives we find in our Christian bookstores. Many of us feel weary of trying to become &quot;the perfect Christian&quot; when it is actually an impossible feat. I appreciate Ms. Lamott's honest reflections about her life and her faith.However, I wish liberal Christians could see that they can still be political, social, and economic liberals without supporting abortion. Jeremiah 1:5 says: &quot;Before I formed thee in the belly I knew thee; and before thou camest forth out of the womb I sacrificed thee, and I ordained thee a prophet unto the nations.&quot; Psalm 139 should also be considered.The only thing that makes a person a Christian is our faith in Jesus Christ as Saviour. (John 3:16) That is all! It is that easy. But after salvation, why do Christians choose only bits and pieces of the bible to believe as truth? If I could ask the talented Ms. Lamott one thing, that would be it. Why pick and choose?Anne Lamott's commentary of the Old Testament story of Abraham and Isaac is alone worth buying the book for."},{"Title":"TRAVELING MERCIES. SOME THOUGHTS ON FAITH.","review":"This book has some amazingly well written passages, especially the one that describes her father's condition at the end of his life. I am a writer and a follower of Christ, so this book left me conflicted as to what to think of it because of how flippant she is with the name of Jesus. At one point she talks about wondering if Jesus would want to drink a bottle of gin, and although there are probably a lot of you reading this who think &quot;So what?&quot;, it really angered me that she claimed to be a follower of Christ but then threw his name around in disregard. She also says that she supports abortion theoretically and politically, and again if she is a true follower of Christ she would know how much he loves children and would never want to harm them, no matter how young they may be. There were several passages in this book that really inspired me to write, but all in all in this book she really is centered on herself to a fault."},{"Title":"TRAVELING MERCIES.

This sort of behavior is nauseating enough in teenagers; in a middle-aged woman, it makes for bad memoirs.Her treatment of Christianity is so superficial in these pages as to be insulting to those of us who believe that God is something other than a Santa Claus who dispenses wishes. This book has little to do with faith; it's mostly a compilation of how the world has somehow wronged Anne Lamott. Perhaps some people find her privileged whine amusing, and I might have looked more kindly on the book if it didn't purport to be about &quot;faith.&quot; But there are better memoirs by bulimics out there, and Anne Lamott's sophomoric &quot;humor&quot; gets on my nerves."},{"Title":"TRAVELING MERCIES.

I realize that this book is about her travels towards faith and that is a uniquely individual thing, but I am really struck by how self-involved the author is...her brand of Christianity seems solely to be how can God enhance her life and the life of those she loves. It all revolves around how finding God has improved her life...with nothing about what God requires of her. I don't consider myself Christian in the born again sense but I was certainly raised in a Christian manner...by parents who volunteered in a million different ways in order to serve God and those less fortunate.

Given that three of her last four books are all about HER, and given that each one is increasingly more self-absorbed and self-pitying, I am not about to pick up another one of her books ever again.

She presents her own spiritual quest with humor, humanity, honesty and courage. She is a prophet for our ages.I cannot remember a book on spirituality that touched me more. I highly recommend this book for those who are on a search for God. He is there waiting for us, all of us, especially those of us, like Anne, who are imperfect. This is the message of this book. Anne's God is a God I can finally and fully embrace. Thanks Anne. I will recommend this book to all of my friends and family. In Lamott's own words: Grace, &quot;it is unearned love...It's the help you receive when you have no bright ideas left, when you are empty and desperate and have discovered that your best thinking and most charming charm have failed you. Grace is the light or electiricity or juice or breeze that takes you from that isolated plae and puts you with others who are as startled and embarrassed and eventually grateful as you are to be there.&quot;"},{"Title":"TRAVELING MERCIES. SOME THOUGHTS ON FAITH.","review":"At a friend's suggestion, I bought this book when it first came out in hardcover. I delved into it... but either the time was not right for me or perhaps the book is just slower in the beginning. This time, I read through it in three wonder-filled days. This woman is funny, yes, but more importantly she has an authentic, unique, more aware take on what life is all about. I found myself highlighting and underlining and starring passages to read again and again. I've already sent some samples to friends around the world. I recommend it to anyone whose reflections on life and the things that mean the most need a kick-start."},{"Title":"TRAVELING MERCIES. SOME THOUGHTS ON FAITH.","review":"God rescued Anne from a horrible situation. And the thing that broke the ice, so to speak, was something that most church-goers like myself hardly think of as a missionary outreach: the simple act of singing songs of praise to God when we are gathered together. At that point in her life, Anne wasn't much interested in hearing preaching, but the music, and then the love, drew her in.God, in his sovereign will, chose to use a Christian congregation far outside of my \\"box\\" to reach Anne. And as the story goes on, we see that Anne also has her God in a pre-conceived box. But I, from my conservative point of view, have to be merciful, remembering what God has brought Anne, and me, out of.Every Christian is in recovery, from all the crap of our past whatever it was. And with God's help, we are growing, learning to love those who don't think like we do, and slowly realizing that God is beyond any of our human boxes: totally awesome, pure, wise, loving, forgiving, patient....Anne Lamott, I, every Christian, are \\"traveling\\" on that road to greater faith, and we are in constant need of God's \\"mercies.\\""},{"Title":"TRAVELING MERCIES.

SOME THOUGHTS ON FAITH.","review":"I love Ann Lamott's writing style and her wonderful imagery, but her narcissism got in the way of my really enjoying the book as much as I was hoping to. In the beginning, her egocentricity and narcissism were acceptable because of the humor with which they were depicted, but after a while, I found myself becoming somewhat disenchanted and hoping that by the end of the book she would \\"grow up\\" a little and communicate on a deeper level with her reader. Unfortunately, that didn't happen. Disappointed Reader!"},{"Title":"TRAVELING MERCIES. SOME THOUGHTS ON FAITH.","review":"Lamott's Traveling Mercies takes the reader along on her journey of self-discovery and search for faith. A touching, wonderful, thought provoking story."},{"Title":"TRAVELING MERCIES. SOME THOUGHTS ON FAITH.","review":"I loved this book! Anne LaMott's day-to-day struggles quickly became mine. I could relate to what she said, what she felt and how she met God along the way. Though I don't have a child I was able to relate to her stress about the way she struggled raising her child on her own. But she wasn't alone, was she? She had her church family to help her along the way. This book was continuing proof to me that sometimes &quot;God wears skin&quot;. Read it, enjoy it, and pass it on!"},{"Title":"TRAVELING MERCIES. SOME THOUGHTS ON FAITH.","review":"Annie Lamott is extremely gifted - funny, touching, insightful, and (above all) real. How often can one say (using and old warhorse of a review (bordering on parody), &quot;I laughed! I cried!&quot; and then go to earnestly say &quot;I was moved, not just emotionally but spiritually.&quot; We all have different jouneys and paths of the spirit. Travelling down Lamott's road with her has enhanced my view of my own. I'm grateful."},{"Title":"TRAVELING MERCIES. SOME THOUGHTS ON FAITH.","review":"This is a powerful, emotional memoir of the author's struggles through life and with faith. It is not neat and linear; and it can be petty and bitchy sometimes. While I embraced this honesty and loved this book, others might very well hate it. I'm sure there are those who won't like when she admits how she's jealous of her son's friend's mother, or how much she used to drink, or how angry she got at her young son. So if you're looking for a book about a messed up person who's gotten better and writes about it with skill, humor and insight, this one is great. If you're inclined to dislike judgmental, irresponsible people even if they get their act together on a semi-regular basis, then you should probably give this one a miss."},{"Title":"TRAVELING MERCIES. SOME THOUGHTS ON FAITH.","review":"After reading Operating Instructions, I was hooked. Not many people are as honest as Anne, especially when it is painful or embarrassing. I was so excited to see this new book, I checked it out at the library as soon as it hit the shelf. I got to page 46 and had to buy it for myself. I have shared it with so many people. I've made people listen to me read to them on the phone, sent it to others with passages marked for them to read, and just raved about her message. I was particularly touched by the importance of having a church home. I wish I could find someplace that lists where she is speaking/reading. I would be there in a heart beat."},{"Title":"TRAVELING MERCIES. SOME THOUGHTS ON FAITH.","review":"Annie (I can call her that; the way she writes I'm sure she'll agree she's my new best friend) shares EVERYTHING with her readers. If you think your life has been rough, you haven't read this book. Annie Lamott spent many years worshiping a trinity of drugs, alcohol and writing. She managed to make a living, so to speak, as a writer. Hangovers and serendipity drew her to a ramshackle church in a poor suburb of San Francisco whose congregation would prove to be her salvation. And just in time, for she became pregnant with Sam, whom she would have and rear with an extended family of friends. In Traveling Mercies, Annie shares vignettes of her life, blending each tale with reflections of her faith. Her musings offer glimpses of wisdom every reader can treasure. I cherish one in particular. It was Sam's seventh birthday, and he had been invited to fulfill a long-held passion to go paragliding. What's a parent to do? Of course you want to say no. Of course, you want to say yes. Of course you ask every friend you know and trust for advice; in desperation you even ask perfect strangers. Finally, Annie found the answer in the only place she could find her truth: her gut. She drew on advice a priest gave her when she was choosing to have Sam, and the odds of success as a single mother weighed against her. &quot;Get quiet for a moment,&quot; the priest said, &quot;and then think about having the abortion: if you feel a deep and secret sense of relief, pay attention to that. But if you feel deeply grieved at the thought of it, listen to that.&quot; We know she chose to have Sam. You'll have to read the book to find out if Sam got his birthday wish. I'll only tell you this book has a wonderful ending. And a fascinating beginning and a very perfect middle. Anne Lamott is a vulnerable, endearing, talented writer who has generously shared herself and her vision of God. It's lovely summertime reading sprinkled with spirituality, humor and love."},{"Title":"TRAVELING MERCIES. SOME THOUGHTS ON FAITH.","review":"Ann Lamott brings her own special sense of humor and unflagging honesty to this wonderful look at her journey toward faith. A must read."},{"Title":"TRAVELING MERCIES. SOME THOUGHTS ON FAITH.","review":"I...have read very few religious books that I could feel comfortable giving to a friend. Nonetheless, I found this book so meaingful that I convinced our Thursday morning book club to read it. Once a week, we'd discuss one chapter. Our group has become somewhat of a therapy session without laying out $100 every thursday. Ann would probably be glad to know that her stories of brokeness, faith, doubt, depravity and salvation sustained our little group for over a half a year, wherein we shared our own brokeness, faith, etc. We are still meeting, but now we are trying to figure out the next step from Travelling Mercies. In the meantime, we're perusing the Gospel of St John. Ann Lamott challenges the notion that Christians are conservative, stuffy, prudish, and humorless. A great book for the believer and doubter alike."},{"Title":"TRAVELING MERCIES. SOME THOUGHTS ON FAITH.","review":"This book is full of witty, touching, sad, lovely stories and wise insights from this wonderful writer, Anne Lamott. I've read almost everything she has written, and while her fiction seems somewhat dull and bland, her nonfiction is supreme, full of passion and love and humility--it's hard not to think of her as having an expansive, generous soul. I belong to a church I rarely visit, a church full of stiff ceremony, dusty old prayer books, and stale bread--they should all have to read this book, I think, the members of my church, so some feeling can flow back into their cold blue veins, and they can remember that humanity, love, compassion, and forgiveness are at the heart of true religion. I love this book."},{"Title":"TRAVELING MERCIES. SOME THOUGHTS ON FAITH.","review":"This book is a whole bunch of snapshots, excerpts, essays, and thoughts on life and faith. Anne Lamott is one interesting character with her dreadlocks, Christianity, hippie days, feminism, and belief that God may be a woman; and what great reflections on life. I love literature and authors from C.S. Lewis to Steve Martin. She's not anywhere near as profound as Lewis, nor nearly as slap-stick as Martin, but she may well fall somewhere between this odd couple. If there is any indication that I enjoyed this book, I just purchase her other work &quot;Bird by Bird&quot; and I am nothing less that ecstatic to receive it. It should be noted this book is not entirely linear, nor is it a &quot;complete&quot; story, yet the message is worthwhile and humorous throughout and insightful in many parts. If you want a better understanding of what a &quot;normal&quot; Christian might look like, or need to understand you aren't the only one with a hippie past this book will likely inspire you."},{"Title":"TRAVELING MERCIES. SOME THOUGHTS ON FAITH.","review":"I felt like Anne was writing about my story of faith, the intellectual parents, the flirtation with many religions, using men and magazines and television to distract myself from the existenialist questions that were plaguing my heart, yet we are different women, no alcoholism, abortion, or bulimia on my end, yet we both got to that same great place - church and God and Jesus. I laughed out loud at her irreverent humor and she made me want to be a better 'prayer' - who knew you could talk to God about such things in such a manner!"},{"Title":"TRAVELING MERCIES. SOME THOUGHTS ON FAITH.","review":"Anne Lamott has a gift for telling stories that few authors have. I was a bit apprehensive about reading a book on faith and religion, but Lamott's ability to relate her religious experience into everyday language made this book a joy to read. I would recommend it for anyone, religious or not."},{"Title":"TRAVELING MERCIES. SOME THOUGHTS ON FAITH.","review":"I love all of Anne Lamott's nonfiction. She touches on so many real life topics and highlights with so much humor our neurosis. I have two best friends that also loved this book. We each came away with something personal that spoke to us. I just found out that Anne has a new book coming out this March and I am going to give it to my best friends as a gift in celebration of our friendship."},{"Title":"TRAVELING MERCIES. SOME THOUGHTS ON FAITH.","review":"Overall, this book is entertaining and engaging. I echo the opinions of other reviewers in saying that Anne Lamott's honesty and transparency in her descriptions of her internal and external life are refreshing and endearing. I also understand the sentiments of some of the reviewers who found her irreverance, well, too irreverant. She is a self-proclaimed &quot;drama queen&quot; and lives up to that title and then some. Usually her &quot;drama queeniness&quot; is hilarious, because you can tell that her supposed self-centeredness comes from a constant need to prove herself (as she herself admits). She says that she has a superiority complex rooted in an inferiority complex.People who have trouble with this book are wanting to make Anne Lamott a role model instead of a story teller. We can certainly learn from the authenticity and self-awareness shown in the way she tells her stories in this book. She does not shy away from the less flashy aspects of faith--doubt, sin, suffering, etc. and that is what makes this book realistic and honest. She is not writing a story about how we should live our lives, and it is wrong to take that book in this way. But in the end it is a real and engaging story of love and relationships; between her and God, her son, friends, the church, family, and life. It is greatly entertaining, and a refreshing look into someone's life who is as open with her blemishes as with her crowns."},{"Title":"TRAVELING MERCIES. SOME THOUGHTS ON FAITH.","review":"This is a high impact book. I am a speed reader and have a hard time slowing down to digest a book. This one slowed me down. I can only read a bit each night as I want to savor it, think on it, pray about it. I thank the author for sharing her ugly thoughts, her fraility, her human qualities. We are truly made in the image of God and Anne shows us true humanity. We hide so much behind our facade of make believe Christianity that we have difficulty when someone shows us our true selves. It frightens us when someone dares to show what we think inside, how we feel about others. This is what Christ died for, to save us from our selves. But He loves us for ourselves also. I am so uplifted by this writing and sharing. Thanks Anne"},{"Title":"TRAVELING MERCIES. SOME THOUGHTS ON FAITH.","review":"A real and honest person. I wish I knew her. She is fearless in her admission of fear. She wrote what so many think but deny out loud, even deny to themselves. God loves us where we are. He is the inventor of humor and appreciates it. You can't shock God."},{"Title":"TRAVELING MERCIES. SOME THOUGHTS ON FAITH.","review":"I loved &quot;Bird by Bird&quot; by Anne Lamotte,and &quot;Traveling Mercies&quot; is just as good if not better. In this series of interconnected auto-biographical essays, Lamotte delineates her stuggle to find faith in an atheist, humanistic home and how she found it. While this is definitely a spiritual book, she uses occasional profanity, discusses her addictions and bulemia, and gets down to the nitty gritty, rather than bringing a &quot;God wants us to be happy and if we aren't, we aren't good enough people&quot; attitude. This book is real. Lamotte is a liberal Christian, which is an anomaly in today's world of those who have found the one true way, and believe all others are condemned to eternal perdition if they don't follow in lockstep. Lamotte preaches love, especially of self, and mindfulness of the moment. She is a wonderful writer and this is a wonderful book."},{"Title":"TRAVELING MERCIES. SOME THOUGHTS ON FAITH.","review":"Traveling Mercies is one of the best books of 1999-funny, wise, gentle-she can make you laugh and cry within one paragraph and that's no small feat. not only is Traveling Mercies is spending its fifteenth week on the bestseller list-Bird By Bird With Annie a documentary about Ms. Lamott has opened to rave reviews, and her other book Operating Instructions has been selected as one of the best non fiction books of the 20th century. And to those of you who think she's self absorbed or whatever-let me quote Rita Mae Brown:&quot;If you don't like my books, find books you do like.&quot; Or as AL would say-life is too short. Meanwhile for the people who love Anne Lamott like I do-let us congraduate AL on her great success and commend ourselves on our good taste!"},{"Title":"TRAVELING MERCIES.

But I can settle with re-reading a book that makes me laugh and cry on every other page, that makes me look at myself and my own spiritual path with more acceptance, more insight, and with more than an occasional giggle. Anne changed the way I see myself, my body, my faith, and my struggles. I'm buying copies for all my closest friends (and their aunties!)"},{"Title":"TRAVELING MERCIES.

SOME THOUGHTS ON FAITH.","review":"This is not a review, but a crass and hopeless attempt to tell this writer how much I love her. Annie, you are marvelous. This book is about the Jesus who has dogged my steps, too. I think the three of us should get together. I want you to meet my wife, my children, preach in my church. You are so fine. Yes! Yes! Yes!"},{"Title":"TRAVELING MERCIES. SOME THOUGHTS ON FAITH.","review":"Once again Anne Lamott has proven herself to be a witty and irreverent commentator on some of life's more gnarly issues, although this time the subject is ironically her devout belief in a divinely endowed universe. I wish I knew more Christians like Anne Lamott -- a true believer who is nevertheless willing to bare (almost defiantly at times) her doubts, fears and weaknesses. Finally, a protagonist of faith I can identify with! Lamott's struggles and musings have a very familar ring to them, and the light of faith that she manages to shed on these events is meaningful and touching. The only negative in this collection that I could find is Lamott's unfortunate tendency dwell a bit over-long on her admittedly neurotic (but understandable) worries about her own and her son's health, which gets a bit wearying about midway through the book. Nevertheless, there is much to love about &quot;Traveling Mercies,&quot; which I know I'll refer to for some time to come to renew my own commitment to a life of faith. Well done!"},{"Title":"TRAVELING MERCIES.

Said in the greatest prose and without a smirk."},{"Title":"TRAVELING MERCIES. SOME THOUGHTS ON FAITH.","review":"From the start to the end, Anne Lamott's writing is greatly captivating and keeps her readers guessing as to what she's getting at, then leaves us with great philosophical insight, all the while keeping her humorous input she's so famous for.Although she writes with freedom and confidence, some of her ideas about \\"faith\\" may not be what most people expect, but then again, these are her own thoughts about faith, what she's gone through and how she has come to be the person she is today.She carries along a great novel, somewhat of an autobiography with her son Sam, and warmly welcomes any readers willing to read to the very end. Lots of great quotations to write down; a definite read for anyone."},{"Title":"TRAVELING MERCIES. SOME THOUGHTS ON FAITH.","review":"Several years ago my Pastor recommended Traveling Mercies. It took me a while to get my own copy but I'm so glad I did. Anne Lamott shares herself in a raw, honest way that is touching and heartwarming. Not many books touch my emotions, but I've found myself laughing and crying and feeling nostalgic many times. I look forward to reading her other books. You will enjoy Traveling Mercies whether or not you have a personal faith."},{"Title":"TRAVELING MERCIES. SOME THOUGHTS ON FAITH.","review":"Loved this book, love the author. She is so open and honest in her life's assessments. It's not easy being Anne, yet she is willing to share her life with all of us. I write poetry and Anne LaMott has inspired me to write several. If you love to read, and,especially if you love to write, you will thoroughly enjoy this book. I very seldom laugh out loud when reading a book, but with her sense of humor you can't help yourself. She makes you laugh, cry and muse--all in the same book, no less."},{"Title":"TRAVELING MERCIES. SOME THOUGHTS ON FAITH.","review":"this is an amazing book; riot funny and knife twisting painful at the same time, written in a &quot;no water being tread&quot; pace that leaves you breathless.

SOME THOUGHTS ON FAITH.","review":"My women's sprirituality group read &quot;Traveling Mercies&quot; last fall and we loved it! Anne Lamott is a woman who writes about life, love, sprituality and God in a way that's inclusive and applicable to everyday living. Can't we all relate to the author's prayer to God the day her old Volkswagon breaks down in the middle of a storm, or the fight she has with her son in the morning and how she feels guilty all day until she can see him and apologize?Every member of my sprituality group was moved by this book, no matter our age, background or occupation. My only complaint was that the book ended too soon!Read this book, you'll love it!"},{"Title":"TRAVELING MERCIES. SOME THOUGHTS ON FAITH.","review":"I wasn't sure what to expect when I purchased this book, as I am not a fan of &quot;religious&quot; books. This however, cannot be described as a religious book, if anything it is a book about one woman's struggles for SPIRITUALITY. Anne happened to find her spirituality in Christianity and yet, acknowledges that not every one does. There's a great quote in the book that reads something like this &quot;religion is for people who are afraid of hell and spirituality is for people who have been through hell&quot;. Anne covers so many aspects of human nature in this book with grace, humor, honesty and forgiveness. I absolutely loved her chapter on her mother. She is also very forthright on her struggle with alcoholism and addiction. I would buy this book for many people on my shopping list this Christmas (well, maybe not my republicans friends)"},{"Title":"TRAVELING MERCIES. SOME THOUGHTS ON FAITH.","review":"Being a Christian, I was prepared to dislike this book. I thought Anne Lamott was &quot;christian&quot; as opposed to Catholic or Jewish or Muslim. I was wrong. She is a true sister in Christ who struggles with her faith and her obedience to God just as I do. We travel in completely different spheres, I'm a politically conservative, married, 2 kids, theologically conservative, soccer mom (OK, not soccer, piano lessons) kind of Christian. And I loved this book. Anne writes honestly about Christ's pursuit of her; and in turn, her own pursuit of a godly life. Her thoughts on grace are profound and I find myself meditating on various passages. God has used her words to work in my life and I'm thankful for her obedience in sharing them."},{"Title":"TRAVELING MERCIES. SOME THOUGHTS ON FAITH.","review":"This is my first Anne Lamott read and I am confident I will purchase everything she has ever written! As an agnostic, I found Lamott's writing about her evolution of faith moving and inspiring. It is rare to read about liberal Christianity (and I mean that in the most faithful of ways so don't be put off) and Lamott's style is very street-smart.If you don't catch on in the first couple of chapters, hang in there a little longer. It is fairly chronological and as she grows she has more stories/thoughts to share.I was moved so often that I did something I NEVER do: began re-reading as soon as I was done and marking passages to share with friends.If you are a fan of this book OR Barbara Kingsolver's High Tide in Tucson, I recommend them both as similar reads (though totally different subject matter)."},{"Title":"TRAVELING MERCIES. SOME THOUGHTS ON FAITH.","review":"This was one of the most amazing books i have ever read. I happened to read it at a time when i am exploring my own spirituality. The author seemed to speak to me in a way that no other has on this topic. Once i started on her journey i couldn't put the book down and read it in one night. I highly recommend this book to everyone who is on a quest to understand themself better and gain more clarity about their life."},{"Title":"TRAVELING MERCIES.

She made me think &quot;out of the box&quot; so to speak reminding me that God reaches people where they are. I have recommended this book to my friends and family because I think it makes one think in new ways about ones own faith. I have read several of Lamott's books and feel almost like she is an old friend as she puts her heart and soul into her books."},{"Title":"TRAVELING MERCIES. SOME THOUGHTS ON FAITH.","review":"Super, super, super.I can't say it any better than many of the other reviews I've read of this book, so I'm just going to second all the five star reviews in this collection.Anne Lamott did me the supreme honor of offering to write a cover blurb for my own book, so I owe her big time. But even if she'd not done me, a first time author, this supreme honor, I would kiss her toes and paint them with sparkle glitter green polish for having written this nitty-gritty, HONEST, shining and quirky book about her own journey to faith.I have to share my favorite line (paraphrasing, cuz I can't find it right this minute...): I'm not going to tell you what I really thought of that woman in her Lycra bicycle shorts, because if I did, it'd make Jesus drink gin straight out of the cat's dish.You've gotta love her. I just wish she lived next door."},{"Title":"TRAVELING MERCIES. SOME THOUGHTS ON FAITH.","review":"I bought this book the day that I found out my father had terminal cancer. The writing is insightful, touching, funny and amazingly human. Without this book, that next year would have been a completely different experience. Tonight I found myself, over three years later, reading excerpts to a friend over the phone. I came to Amazon.com tonight to send her a link to this page, so she can get a copy for herself. After all, I wouldn't give mine up for the world."},{"Title":"TRAVELING MERCIES. SOME THOUGHTS ON FAITH.","review":"Every time I picked up this book, Anne Lamott was sneaking up behind me and tapping me on the shoulder. Of course it is HER memoir, but time after time she was talking about subjects that were of importance to me. Like her I am a recovering alcoholic, I've worried about not being pretty-pretty and found myself trying to &quot;put my father's dog suit&quot; (as she puts it) on a man in my adult relationships. She's funny and just as honest about the absurdities in her life as the joys and the pains. Even though my interest in spirituality is not specifically Christian, I found her accounts of her experiences both moving and relevent. I loved this book."},{"Title":"TRAVELING MERCIES. SOME THOUGHTS ON FAITH.","review":"I resisted reading this book based on the many 1-star reviews it received on this site. I just knew that I would agree with all those readers who, clutching their stomachs, had pleaded with Anne to \\"ponder pride as one of the seven deadly sins.\\" For some reason, however, I did read the book and I am here to tell you that, yes, it was relentlessly self-absorbed, but it is still a book that I feel has value. Part of the reason I may have enjoyed it is that I am a lot like Anne, except that I didn't have intellectual parents or a child out of wedlock, or become a Christian or an alcoholic (although my problem with bulimia -- on the vanguard before there was even a name for it, and long-resolved -- was worse than hers). I thoroughly understand her need to refer everything back to herself, and the capacity to be prodigiously witty as long as one is looking in the mirror. For those people who don't have such narcissism, it may be trying to endure a 15-page rant about her hair, which you just know she loves, and is only complaining about in order to flaunt. I understand the fragile gratitude which can turn all your particular friends and their children into the most amazing and singular people on earth, and your epiphanies and triumphs into the most breathlessly momentous. Sure, she was the architect of most of her own misery, but so was I, and that doesn't make it any easier to take, it just makes it more pathetic and picayune. The book must be approached as you would a diary, not a mature work of spiritual accomplishment. While several chapters were so overworked that they reminded me of Hawaiians making poi, others were gripping and direct. Ms. Lamott has a rapier-sharp wit, which is trained primarily on herself, and though her spiritual struggles may seem jejune to some, they are reported candidly. If you can cut her some slack, there is much to relish about being a voyeur to her inner workings."},{"Title":"TRAVELING MERCIES. SOME THOUGHTS ON FAITH.","review":"I was encouraged to read this book two or three times before I was assigned to read it for a class. All those who had recommended it said it was a little off color, but really told a great story of faith. For me, I was most impressed with Lamott's writing style which was quite poetic at times. Due to the seriousness throughout much of the book, the off color and silly comments made me laugh out loud. I really enjoyed reading it, especially the first two hundred pages.Yet, I would not say this book was about religion, or spirituality really. It's a book about life and how this woman views her life through her experience with God in Christ. I think what makes Lamott's book different from other Christian bookwriters is that she is honest, she was a sinner before her \\"conversion\\" and she is still a sinner after. Inspiring really.When I read Traveling Mercies, I got the feeling that she would tell me this story the same way she wrote it and that made it very engaging and made me want to talk back."},{"Title":"TRAVELING MERCIES. SOME THOUGHTS ON FAITH.","review":"I've read several Anne Lamott books and this is a really great one. It's give you some great background on the author, who had a pretty interesting life, and on her spiritual experiences. The cool thing is that this book is religious but not conservative, shove-it-down-your-throat religious. It helped me gain perspective on things that were happening in my own life at the time. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"TRAVELING MERCIES. SOME THOUGHTS ON FAITH.","review":"I read this book about four years ago and it was the catalyst that allowed me to finally set out on a journey to explore my own faith like I never have before. Lamott is unconventional to say the least, but her candor caused me to question my own sense of spiritual propriety. I don't think I have ever encountered someone who I have nothing in common with and everything in common with to such a degree. While I think her frankness might be a bit much for some, I think every Christian owes it to him or herself to read this. I haven't even begun to tell you what this book could be me to those who are still searching. If you like this book, you should also check out Blue Like Jazz, by Don Miller."},{"Title":"TRAVELING MERCIES. SOME THOUGHTS ON FAITH.","review":"In this quirky insightful memoir, Lamott reveals a remarkable range of emotional aptitude. Ranging from the ridiculous to the sublime, her spiritual flounderings might be amusing were it not for the deeply painful or exuberantly gratifying circumstances under which her understanding of her place in the universe steadily evolves. Anne Lamott is a mother who prays. She says, &quot;Here are the two best prayers I know:&quot;Help me, help me, help me,&quot; and &quot;Thank you, thank you, thank you.&quot; She then tells us that ,&quot;A woman I know says, for her morning prayer, &quot;Whatever,&quot; and then for the evening, &quot;Oh, well,&quot;.........When all of the theology and dogma are rinsed from the muddied waters of religion, those four prayers (help me, thank you, whatever, and oh, well) will be visible in the sands below for anyone snorkeling by to celebrate. Funky faith stories whose author courageously tells us more than we deserve to know about Anne Lamott will continue to circulate this book from one spiritual seeker to another."},{"Title":"TRAVELING MERCIES. SOME THOUGHTS ON FAITH.","review":"You've gotta love Anne Lamott's honest appraisal of her decision to turn herself over to God. Most such stories are fraught with angst or deep self-reflection. My guess is hers actually was, but she paints a much more real-life picture of a person who has decided to quit hiding from herself. If she can be accepted by Christ after this kind of acquiesence, there's hope for all of us!What I enjoy so much about her essays is her ability to find spiritual moments in the most mundane of things, whether it is the advance of cellulite or making peace with her hair. I still find myself laughing over her decision to forgive a woman who didn't even know she WAS her enemy, but she was. She wore Spandex in all kinds of weather. Because she COULD!Although many of her insights will ring especially true for women, men shouldn't discount them, either. I recommended this book to my pastor, who then chose it for his clergy book discussion group. She may shock, she may make you laugh, she may touch deep chords, but you know these are the musings of a person who has lots of flaws, like all of us."},{"Title":"TRAVELING MERCIES. SOME THOUGHTS ON FAITH.","review":"No, &quot;Liberal Christian&quot; is NOT an oxymoron, thanks to Anne Lamott and &quot;Travelling Mercies&quot;. This book is a refreshing look at faith from the point of view of a liberal Christian, one who sees God and Jesus as loving, understanding, and forgiving. While this book may make the skin of Conservaitve Christians crawl, it gets to the true essence of faith, that is, acceptance and love. Maybe this book will inspire more liberal Christians to &quot;come out of the woodwork&quot; and tell about their experiences. Thank God for Anne Lamott, her exceptional writing style and her powerful message."},{"Title":"TRAVELING MERCIES.

It helped me in many ways to deal with the illness in my own life. . .If you want to another read a book that goes straight to your heart, read Stolen Moments by Barbara Jeanne Fisher. . .It is a beautiful story of unrequited love. . .for certain the love story of the nineties. I intended to give the book a quick read, but I got so caught up in the story that I couldn't put the book down. From the very beginning, I was fully caught up in the heart-wrenching account of Julie Hunter's battle with lupus and her growing love for Don Lipton. This love, in the face of Julie's impending death, makes for a story that covers the range of human emotions. The touches of humor are great, too, they add some nice contrast and lighten things a bit when emotions are running high. I've never read a book more deserving of being published. It has rare depth. Julie's story will remind your readers that life and love are precious and not to be taken for granted. It has had an impact on me, and for that I'm grateful. Stolen Moments is written with so much sensitivity that it made me want to cry. It is a spellbinder. What terrific writing. Barbara does have an exceptional gift! This book was edited by Lupus specialist Dr. Matt Morrow too, and has the latest information on that disease. ..A perfect gift for someone who started college late in life, fell in love too late in life, is living with any illness, or trying to understand a loved one who is. . .A gift to be cherished forever."},{"Title":"TRAVELING MERCIES. SOME THOUGHTS ON FAITH.","review":"The title is a fair summary of the contents of this book. It really is just a collection of thoughts by Anne Lamott, largely on faith. I was expecting it to deal more with a specifically Christian faith, but Lamott really doesn't do that. In an alternate reality, if she had found Buddha instead of Jesus in her time of need, and if she had a strong community that didn't happen to be a church, there are really only three or four pages in this book that would need to be changed to fit her circumstances. Lamott references a couple of verses from the Bible about forgiveness, and (in my favorite story, probably because it hasn't been so long since I helped scatter my mother's ashes) she connects the idea of Ash Wednesday to the way a person's ashes stick to your hands and you can't ever really let them go. She admits that her son is trying to irritate her by claiming to believe in \\"all the gods\\" instead of just Jesus. But in general, this is religion lite: an occasionally moving (deeply moving - when she succeeds, Lamott really succeeds), often funny, usually frustrating collection of thoughts from someone who seems to like God but doesn't seem to know any more about him than that (to the point of referring to God's gender with \\"his or her\\" and making statements like, \\"If there's a heaven, I imagine it will be like snorkeling.\\").Lamott herself can be quite irritating - she is open about her quirks, her struggles, her neediness (she describes one boyfriend as being unable to deal with her tears and fears, and I found myself sympathizing with him). Also, her only interactions with God are when she wants something - praying for herself but also for others, always wanting God to change something, never wondering who he is, reading about what he's done, that kind of thing. It's a well-meaning people-centeredness, but that doesn't make Lamott's spiritual outlook one I would want someone else to adopt. I was relatively entertained while reading, but I can't imagine a situation in which I would hand a copy of this book to someone I liked and say, \\"You should read this, because in some area of your life, I would like you to be more like this author.\\"This is a pretty popular book among young Christians these days, so I recommend it for the purpose of being in the loop, but that's about it. I think someone on a spiritual journey, if he or she desires a book in this style, would be better served by hitting Donald Miller."},{"Title":"TRAVELING MERCIES. SOME THOUGHTS ON FAITH.","review":"I pretty much love any essay Anne Lamott writes, and I appreciate her foray into the spiritual side of life. She makes faith very real and very every day/accesible ... something we all need. Her humor and witty prose make the reading enjoyable as well."},{"Title":"TRAVELING MERCIES. SOME THOUGHTS ON FAITH.","review":"Anne Lamot's self-effacing humor just doesn't work here. Readers are supposed to believe that she can teach them something about spirituality simply because her book was published. Her self-congratulatory stories about her various addictions, how \\"fat\\" she thinks she is (even though anyone who has seen a photo of her knows she's thin) and episodes of neglecting her son do nothing to inspire me or move me spiritually. Lamot thinks God exists to dole out rewards for self-indulgent behavior and make her feel good about herself. If this is the God you believe in, then by all means, enjoy this book."},{"Title":"TRAVELING MERCIES. SOME THOUGHTS ON FAITH.","review":"This certainly does not sound like a book on faith. At least nothing like I am accustomed to. That is the main thing that kept me reading it. The book was referred to by Gigi Graham, a friend that I admire, but I was shocked this book would be on her referral list, her coming from a \\"holy\\" family and all.I had difficulty getting past the multitude of four letter words, and at times peaked over my shoulder to see if anyone was watching me read it as I sat in the waiting area and after boarding my flight. Then when I gasped or burst out laughing I know I received some prunish glances form the annoyed or sleeping co-travelers.Anne's disprespect for the reader was unnerving. A violation at times. So, I simply kept reminiding myself, \\"I'm a big boy.\\" - it's not like I haven't heard these \\"terms\\" before.Still her journey is stimulating and her writing, well she's a kind of Meryl Streep really, very versitle and somewhat intoxicating.Careful what you reccomend - this is not for the faint of heart - but I still pick it up once in a while - just for the creativity and all."},{"Title":"TRAVELING MERCIES. SOME THOUGHTS ON FAITH.","review":"Ann Lamott puts us in a classic conundrum because of her bold-faced honesty. Do we embrace her Christianity or dismiss her vulgararity?Travelling mercies is filled with her customary wit, humility, and frenetic disorganization that quite honestly characterizes most Christians were they honest as Ann is. Her willingness to admit her failings and weaknesses is something to admire and applaud. Her transparency is recommended in every believer.What I find troubling with Ann is that she seems to revel in all of her problems. She is proud of her vulgarity and her affinity for things she knows disappoint the God she loves. I'm a firm believer in grace, but should we willingly abuse the test God's mercies? He wants us to come as we are, but not stay that way. That's why he's given us His Word to point to a better way. That's not to say any of us have arrived, because we haven't. We're all feet of clay.Believers, especially new ones, might get the false impression that sin is okay and that it's okay to stay spiritually immature. They might also get the impression that anyone who earnestly tries to honor His God is altogether pious, legalistic, arrogant, and boastful. Many Christians are, but far more are not and would people like Ann open an honest dialogue, they would discover fallen people like themselves on a journey toward Christ-likeness.Travelling Mercies is intelligent, well-written, and refreshingly to the point. I can't however, in good conscience, give it a complete thumbs up, because of some of its content. But, I do pray that God blesses the irreverant Ann Lamott."},{"Title":"TRAVELING MERCIES. SOME THOUGHTS ON FAITH.","review":"I read this book for a bookclub I belong to. It was highly recommended. In my humble opinion Anne Lamott is very whiny and lacks purpose with this book. I was not looking for an inspirational read or a comedy I just wanted a book I could enjoy and this was not it. I found myself wondering what is so special or uniquely terrible about her life and my answer is; nothing. I felt I wasted my time reading this book."},{"Title":"TRAVELING MERCIES. SOME THOUGHTS ON FAITH.","review":"Anne Lamott is a tragic character. The great sadness is that Anne Lamott isn't a character in a book - she's real.In this book, she details her thoughts on faith - something I'm very familiar with. I love reading memoirs and stories of redemption. Unfortunately true redemption, which is available through the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ, eludes Anne.She covers her family wounds, addictions and neuroses with humour and excellent writing. It's easy to laugh along with Anne; she makes the pain feel like it belongs to another person but at the end of the day Anne is left without a redeemer except for herself. For her or any of us, that's a hopeless place to be.Her book title promises nothing other than an offering of thoughts on faith. That's exactly what it delivers. Anne herself doesn't exercise faith - not really. She is a confused individual, substituting truth and faith for just pieces of truth and faith from many different religions. Although Anne professes to be a Christian, there doesn't seem to be a relationship with Jesus Christ, which is the foundation of Christianity. Without the relationship, it is just another religion that helps a person, at best, cope through life. It's a set of rules, which at the end you realize doesn't bring justification for sin; only through a relationship with Jesus can do that.Technically, this book deserves an A for writing. Anne Lamott is without question, a good writer. However, overall I give it a C because the book doesn't leave me feeling encouraged by her thoughts on faith. In fact, I feel heavy and depressed. It's sad that Anne has not experienced the freedom found in faith but the good news is that Anne is still alive, so as long as there is breath in her, full redemption of her life is possible."},{"Title":"TRAVELING MERCIES.

SOME THOUGHTS ON FAITH.","review":"God save us from sanctimonious and self-absorbed people like Anne Lamott. Me, me, me, me, and more about me...and what do you think about me. That's the collected works of Lamott. I wish she'd shut up for a while and and ponder pride as one of the seven deadly sins."},{"Title":"TRAVELING MERCIES.

She is a lovely soul and just the like that lost sheep Christ spoke of. She makes me smile, and I'm sure she makes Jesus smile. What a gift she is, and I thank her for sharing.By the way I must comment on a couple of the reviewers' observations. This book is a compilation of autobiographical sketches. I can understand why it isn't everyone's cup of tea, but complaining that an autobiography is about the author is a bit strange. I was also interested in the lady who was in the hospital and Jesus didn't visit her, therefore, Annie was making it all up. Ah, the powers of deductive reasoning. I never wrote a symphony, ergo, neither did Beethoven. Finally, am I the only one who thinks perhaps that person claiming to be an &quot;English lit prof&quot; from Cornell is diddling with the truth? If he is, indeed, who he claims, I strongly urge him carefully review his &quot;Strunk and White&quot; before he attempts another review or teaches another class."},{"Title":"TRAVELING MERCIES. SOME THOUGHTS ON FAITH.","review":"You can read this review which is actually a blog post on my blog, Emily Jane&lt;...>Like most women, I struggle with body acceptance. There isn't a day that goes by that I'm not thinking about, obsessing over or self-loathing about my weight and how I appear in the eyes of others. I'm not really happy with my size. I have to admit, though, I do love myself. I adore me, what I'm about, how I view the world, my artfulness, and my tendency to think in flowers. I do, however, find it difficult to smile down on my ever expanding waistline and blossoming butt. If I could change three things about me it would be to grow a longer chin, stretch out my neck and have thin upper arms. I could deal with the rest.Trying to find a positive, healthy way to look at my external self has gotten a little easier since I read Anne Lamott's book Travelling Mercies...Some Thoughts on Faith. Her chapter entitled The Aunties was like a breath of fresh air. It brought tears to my eyes and made me realize I am being much too hard on myself. She discusses the way she has dealt with her own body image struggles (she hates her butt and thighs and the nappy hair she was born with) as a middle aged woman and while on vacation at the beach with her son she adopts a loving, whimsical way of looking at her imperfections and ultimately accepting herself that is both funny and enlightening.Anne on applying makeup to cover her aging face:I wasn't thinking that I looked awful and wanted to look like someone else; that is the point at which you can come dangerously close to female impersonation. I just remembered that sometimes you start with the outside and you get it right. You tend to your spirit through the body. It's polishing the healthy young skin of that girl who was there just a moment ago, who still lives inside. It's saying that sometimes maybe one looks a little pale and wan and wants to shine a little light on oneself. Then, when you're in that honoring place, it's almost like makeup becomes a form of light, just as on those days when a little cloud cover makes you really notice the sun's rays that come slanting through. Maybe the key is simply a wry fondness for the thing you're slapping this stuff onto, instead of a desire to disguise; so it's not that you're wearing a coat of paint, but a mantilla.f you haven't read Travelling Mercies, I suggest you order yourself a copy, cozy up on the sofa and read it. Anne is a genuine person whom I believe speaks the truth. She says it the way it is and I embrace that.Anne implied something that resonated within me and enabled me to think for the first time that despite the fact that I am not a thin woman and I have issues and struggles with my body, I should love my physical self and embrace my body because it is the very thing that houses my spirit-my lovely, perfect spirit that is the essence of who I really am."},{"Title":"TRAVELING MERCIES.

Is she completely self-absorbed? Yes!But, she's also a very gifted writer. So much so that I'm leaning towards reading her other books.I laughed out loud at times, cringed at other times, and found her annoying more than once or twice (her contempt for the mom in bicycle shorts who drives her son to school just bothered me, sorry.) But, she writes powerfully. She writes very conversationally. She struggles with faith and is honest about her struggle which I appreciated."},{"Title":"TRAVELING MERCIES. SOME THOUGHTS ON FAITH.","review":"Anne Lamott is one of the best non-fiction and autobiographical writers I know of. Along with \\"Bird by Bird\\", this book is her crowning achievement so far. There are two main things I like about Lamott-her relentless honesty, particularly about herself- and her great writing skills. It's like nitro and glycerine-put them both together and you get dynamite. This book offers plenty for mature Christians, the open-minded unbeliever, and those in between. That's extremely difficult to pull off, people. One should read this book, in for no other reason, than to see how well-written and engaging spiritual autobiography can be.I would think that this book would be particularly helpful to those people who, like Lamott, were raised in spiritually deprived homes. Raised in an atheistic household in which she was taught that no one with sense believed in, of all things, Christianity, Lamott courageously and honestly worked through all that pseudo-intellectual junk in order to find a faith of substance she today can call her own. That's a very, very tall order. I admire her courage. It would have been so much easier for her not to fight for her right to honestly believe in a loving God. Pick up this book if you're in the same boat she has been in--you'll learn a lot about yourself in the process of reading it."},{"Title":"TRAVELING MERCIES. SOME THOUGHTS ON FAITH.","review":"Traveling Mercies is the second book I've read by Anne Lamott. She is as mesmerizing a writer in this as she was in Operating Instructions.I was amazed at her ability to find God in situations where, through our busy-ness, we might overlook Him. She writes in a way that puts you right in the middle of what is happening and what she is feeling. I highly recommend Traveling Mercies for its humor, insight and wisdom."},{"Title":"TRAVELING MERCIES.

I for one wish there were a copy of this delightful book in each hotel room, right next to the Gideon Bible. Except people would steal them... perhaps there should be a chain attached, like on phone books.Traveling Mercies is warm, hilarious, self deprecating and life affirming; it reminds us with finely crafted prose why we are here on this planet. There are one or two \\"reviewers\\" who have been lobbing vicious hand grenades at Ms. Lamott's sites, but no matter, for this book is clearly a winner -- just wonderful.

Faith is certainly many of us; we try to figure -it -out as we go and as we figure out what it means to be a Christian. She describes each twist and turn in her life and is enjoyable to get inside her head to see how normal we all are as we try to figure the answers to all our questions. Very funny - some may not like the little blurts of swearing but it book that had me laughing out loud and thinking a bit about myself a lot. Enjoy."},{"Title":"TRAVELING MERCIES. SOME THOUGHTS ON FAITH.","review":"A gorgeous, funny, original, insightful book that can breathe new life into anyone who feels the tiniest bit stale in their devotional practices (as well as new life into just about anyone else who might read it). Makes me realize all over again that Christianity (or any other religious path, if followed sincerely) is a living organism waiting for us to tap into its richness. Anne Lamott legitimizes my own shipwrecked prayers and validates my own unorthodox approach to God. TRAVELING MERCIES should be required reading for very priest, minister, pastor, seminarian and long-time church/synagogue-goer. It will help keep us from getting embedded in (and deadened by) habits of posture and vocabulary that are naturally generated by any religious institution or repeated personal devotional practice."},{"Title":"TRAVELING MERCIES. SOME THOUGHTS ON FAITH.","review":"If you have read anything by Lammott, you feel like you are reading many different essays on the same subject. Even her fiction reads like each chapter is a different episode of a television series. Traveling Mercies stands in this same line. After reading this book, all her wittiness, honesty and storytelling mesh together. When I think about this book a few days after having read it, I see themes appear over and over, attitudes surface here and there, and inside jokes pop up again and again. If you have read Bird by Bird or any of her fiction you will recognize Lamott's conversational style in Traveling Mercies. After reading this book, you feel like you know her, like you just had a long conversation with her in your living room."},{"Title":"TRAVELING MERCIES.

And when I finished the book, her special eyes had rubbed off on me. Life seems freer, fresher... Ann reminds me that God is, indeed, at work in our lives. Her ability to capture the special in the mundane is a rare gift, and I just couldn't get enough of it."},{"Title":"TRAVELING MERCIES. SOME THOUGHTS ON FAITH.","review":"I was taking a break last Saturday from my own work as a writer about the Bible, and found this book on the shelf. Once in my hand, my work was done for the day and evening until the last page was turned. Anne Lamont accomplishes that most rarely done task: helping people to find God amidst the most ordinary struggles of daily life. In other words, she's the kind of &quot;theologian&quot; Jesus was. Each story is a parable in which the reader cannot help but ask, &quot;was God present here? If so, what does this say about my own ways of seeking or finding the divine in daily life?&quot;And one of the best things about the book is that she shows that you can be a &quot;born again Christian&quot; and actually live a Christian life, opposed to war, injustice, poverty and oppression; and in solidarity with the outcasts, the sick and the dying. Three alleluias for Anne Lamott and this glorious testimony of faith!"},{"Title":"TRAVELING MERCIES. SOME THOUGHTS ON FAITH.","review":"I like, no love, great writing. Writing that is as clear, concise, and brilliant as the musical phrasing of Miles Davis or with the simple complexity found in Beethoven's Ninth. Lamott's writing does for the soul what Miles did in Kind of Blue and Sketches of Spain and Beethoven did in the fourth movement of the Ninth: she lifts you higher and brings you closer to the mirror that reflects human experience---hers,yours,and mine. Run, don't walk and get this book. And find a quiet place to have your spirit experience rapture. Her writing is &quot;all that&quot; and more!"},{"Title":"TRAVELING MERCIES. SOME THOUGHTS ON FAITH.","review":"This book is subtitled &quot;Thoughts on Faith&quot; - of course it's selfcentered. Did you think she was going to highlight YOUR thoughts on faith? That would be a difficult task for any writer.Clearly a book of this type is written from the author's perspective on her own life and experiences. I find her irreverant view of god inspiring and refreshing and while there are some things I didn't necessarily embrace, it's a glimpse into another person's life: it's not supposed to be a mirror."},{"Title":"TRAVELING MERCIES. SOME THOUGHTS ON FAITH.","review":"I am not sure what I expected when I began to read Anne Lamott's TRAVELING MERCIES, except that I would probably enjoy the book. After reading BIRD BY BIRD, her volume about writing and the literary life, where she mentions the role of faith in her life, I decided to purchase the book and read it.Perhaps the best way to describe Anne Lamott is to say that she is a contradiction in the interesting and best meaning of this word, and for Lamott, this is a compliment. The story of her coming to faith and becoming a practicing Christian has all the same qualities of a standard Christian conversion, but the way she lives her faith is anything but typical. She is proud to be a free thinking liberal, but she belongs to a Church that is filled with the stereotypical \\"church ladies\\" whom she admires. She is a close friend with a number of Catholic priests, yet she would probably have some issues with a number of Catholic teachings. She is not enamored of right wing fundamentalists, but while her opinions may differ from theirs, she shares their conviction. She is hardly conventional, but then again Jesus Christ was not either, and his followers were not conventional either.While the picture of God in this book is clearly Anne Lamott's version of God, the book is hardly a \\"God and Jesus Christ in my terms and my terms only.\\" Lamott struggles with living a life of faith, acknowledging that her life now is always better than her life before faith, but not always easier. Throughout the book we get a sense that Lamott see how far she has come in faith, but also knows that she has a ways to go. In other words, she is just like all believers, a work in progress, which gives all of us a sense of encouragement."},{"Title":"TRAVELING MERCIES.

Lamott writes with raw power about her struggles with faith, drug addiction and being a single mother. I especially liked the line, \\"Lots of people are scary and dangerous.....Drugs and alcohol make people stupid and violent, but I don't think that necessarily makes them evil. Evil is when you choose to do such harm.\\", because that is so true, and I think we do tend to judge people as evil when they do things we don't like, even though we don't know their intentions. If you are a conservative Christian, Lamott's irreverence with her faith may be uncomfortable, but all in all, I definitely recommend this book to everyone."},{"Title":"TRAVELING MERCIES. SOME THOUGHTS ON FAITH.","review":"This is not your typical Christian inspirational--you know the kind--the one that makes you feel as though you'll never measure up, that the author is just too holy for you. Anne Lamott lays out her problems one by one--alcoholism, bulimia, promiscuity--the list goes on. And how many Christian inspirationals are sprinkled with obscenities? Beware gentle reader. Lamott is a modern Christian and doesn't claim to be perfect.I found some of the most inspirational and touching stories to be the ones which involved her son, Sam. This single mom and her son have a great relationship and rapport, although here too Lamott is very honest when she describes their imperfect relationship and at least one occasion when she loses her temper big time. Lamott doesn't sugarcoat life or single parenthood or even her relationship with her mom. She describes the pain of seeing her mom grow old and how she seems to become a child again when Lamott is there to lean on, in the same way that children often act more child-like when they are with their parents.I recall at least one time when Lamott's prayer produced a small miracle, and I was very touched by the story of the day she and Sam witnessed God's handiwork at sea.If there had been more of these small miracle stories I would be keeping it as an inspirational tome for my bedside. But this is more of a typical coming-of-age story in our modern times when young women find themselves truly lost in a sea of strange men and dangerous substances. It will be a comfort to many young women who wonder will God still love me despite my very imperfect life? Lamott shows how God has reached out to her and been with her through her struggles with sin. But for a Medicare recipient, such as I, perhaps I'm slowing down and need more inspiration and less tribulation."},{"Title":"TRAVELING MERCIES.

But, when a friend mailed me Traveling Mercies, I began reading it immediately--while spooning cereal to my baby. And I didn't put it down until I finished it two days later. Now I wish I hadn't finished it so quickly, because this book, as the others I have read by Lamott, Operating Instructions and Bird by Bird, have left me with a craving for more and more. It's wonderful, it's real, it pulls together hundreds of normally unconnected things into a new perspective in a hilarious, heartbreaking way. (One of my favorite stories was when her son Sam returned from visiting a very &quot;cool&quot; friend and proclaimed him not so cool because he didn't have the Disney channel.) She's a genius. In spite of her very difficult and challenging earlier years, she now seems to lead a magical life filled with wise and wonderful characters. Or, maybe that's simply the way she views her life. Maybe that's a result of her faith. I can't wait for her next book."},{"Title":"TRAVELING MERCIES. SOME THOUGHTS ON FAITH.","review":"I know that I'm just an ant among billions of other ants, rarely stopping to reflect on the mystery of life and this faith inside us that somehow guides us and holds us close, but I need to stop NOW and express my thanks to Anne and Sam Lamott, to V. Goines and the St. Andrews congregation and, especially, to that Great Nameless Power behind everything that allowed this book to be born. While having my heart stirred by a book is not all that rare (I'm one of those sentimental fool types), this one stands out on it's own. Way out. Far out. It's art without artifice. Well, anyhow, the seams are invisible. It is deeply honest and shines with genuine wisdom that the author would undoubtedly deny of herself. Those of us reviewing this with glowing hearts probably seem like scarey shiney people to Anne Lamott (who, thinking we know the inside of her head as perhaps we may a tiny bit, has to be reading our comments after all). But, hey, this very personal book does leave hearts glowing. So, please excuse us for sounding like we want to put you on an altar and worship your toes. It's a genuine reaction... Love escaping from opened hearts can look gosh darn silly doncha know. Please read this book folks - it's a beautiful sandcastle on the beach surrounded by life's horrors. To Anne Lamott, thanks for the terrific Merwin poem in front and thanks for surviving the fires that melded such a great artist. To others who read this review, 3 other books that touched my religious sensibilities in meaningful ways were: &quot;Quarantine&quot; by Jim Crace, &quot;Tao Te Ching&quot; by Lao Tzu, and &quot;The Essential Rumi&quot; by Coleman Barks. Oh lordy, I may just have to find a way to write this author a personal letter. Then again, I bet she's deluged and she does need space to write. Thank You, Thank You, Thank You!!!"},{"Title":"TRAVELING MERCIES. SOME THOUGHTS ON FAITH.","review":"Anne's honest self-reflecting is inspirational. This is a great book for anyone who is experiencing a life-struggle. Also a great read for recovering individuals. Thanks Anne."},{"Title":"TRAVELING MERCIES. SOME THOUGHTS ON FAITH.","review":"I bought this book hoping to be inspired and moved. At times I was. Mostly, however, I was disappointed in the liberal agenda Anne Lamott seems to have. Anyone who disagrees with her is 'homophobic' or a 'Right-Winger'. Is she any better by labeling people this way? No. I don't think so. Her introspection is limited, or maybe it is too intense. She has a very shallow view of the world. Loving only those who love in return, hating anything Republican, avoiding Fundamentalist Christians as though they are all rabid vermin. I was disappointed with her limited vision and her quasi-intellectualizing of the Christian faith. I'm sure she is a beautiful person and I feel sorry for her. I believe her intentions were truly good in writing this book. I wish she had been less vague and 'transcendental' in her approach."},{"Title":"TRAVELING MERCIES. SOME THOUGHTS ON FAITH.","review":"I read this book in one sitting. It made me think about everything I valued in life, re-think, re-evaluate my own perceptions and beliefs. This book spoke to me on many levels. Anne Lamott has the ability to create a world for her reader that not only pulls you in, but enlightens and inspires at the same time. A book that can galvanize change.As a mother of two, it reminded me so much of another utterly inspiring and unforgettable book I just read called \\"LET THE BABY DRIVE: Navigating the Road of New Motherhood\\" by Lu Hanessian. Lu and Anne see the world with similar eyes, even thought their lives are so different. Two of the most impactful, tender, brilliantly funny and beautifully written books I have read. If you're a mother, \\"Traveling Mercies\\" and \\"Let the Baby Drive\\" will change the way you think and feel about yourself, your children, and the world."},{"Title":"TRAVELING MERCIES. SOME THOUGHTS ON FAITH.","review":"...Lamott gives us so much in these various snapshots on her journey(s) to her faith...it seems as if she was &quot;bottoming&quot; out and in the worst condition(s)--the drugs, the booze, bleeding from evisceration--she was able to align with her spirituality. Some may say that her use of language is kind of coarse, but lessons and thoughts like the one gained when she was in one of her Dewar's binging phase and she asked a friend what Christianity is like--the pawn shop analogy--(that one I found myself misty about) are simply priceless. We should feel grateful that Lamott is so real in these essays and testimonials. It gives quite a view of what it truly is to be a modern woman in search of her soul...and that, my friends, helps us all."},{"Title":"TRAVELING MERCIES. SOME THOUGHTS ON FAITH.","review":"I found this book to be as much about a single mom with a young son as about faith. Certainly the author didn't pull any punches with her own life prior to this time but it was all done with humor and affection. Very readable."},{"Title":"TRAVELING MERCIES. SOME THOUGHTS ON FAITH.","review":"Having read some of Lamott's other books, this was a continuation of her autobiographical take on life, religion and spirituality. Entertaining because I had read some of her other books, but nothing to profound in the spirituality department. I do love Lamott's brutal honesty of where she has been in her life and what it has taught her in a very humanistic way."},{"Title":"TRAVELING MERCIES.

It was an easy, funny and heartfelt read. Thanks"},{"Title":"TRAVELING MERCIES. SOME THOUGHTS ON FAITH.","review":"Anne Lamott provides an inspirational and compelling story of her life and her faith journey. In the face of so many of life's darker sides and personal challenges, she finds a path of light through some of life's darkness. The most important thing is her thankfulness to God. Through all the adverse circumstances, Anne Lamott breaks through the darkness and into a world of hope and light to a great life of faithfulness and prayer which supports and carries her and her young son, even when the life throws them curve balls and ugliness. A very compelling read!"},{"Title":"TRAVELING MERCIES. SOME THOUGHTS ON FAITH.","review":"\\"Traveling Mercies\\" is a book of cutting-edge revelations. Life is Lamott's landscape; the daily routine, the process of aging and inevitability of maturing, with pen in hand, as the logic she craves escapes her and Spirit let's herself in.Fresh. Succinct. Bitter one-liners. Poignant references to childhood interrupted by explosions of the sublime yet often tormenting moments of the effect of single motherhood upon her, from start to finish. Spirituality? Oh, yes. Spirituality revealed to the reader in the way in which one moves while washing the dishes; uncovers a thought from a linnen closet; reflects upon and remains present and mercilessly fearful for oneself,one's child and ones' future, in the overall scheme of things.Nuggets of wisdom, pain and awe!Once you have finished reading it, she stays with you as you walk down the street, comb your child's hair and hope for a solution to your latest dilemma or an answer to your prayer: \\"You are not alone,\\" it reads. And neither are you Ms. Annie Lamott. Neither are you."},{"Title":"TRAVELING MERCIES. SOME THOUGHTS ON FAITH.","review":"Anne Lamott has a gift for touching on the deepest parts of the soul while making you laugh and gasp at the same time. She is raw, irreverent, and the most honest writer I have read in a very long time. Even though the book is about spirituality, you find yourself laughing out loud many times. This is a must-read!"},{"Title":"TRAVELING MERCIES. SOME THOUGHTS ON FAITH.","review":"An awakening to the very God that some do and do not believe in is what happened to Anne Lamont in her book, Traveling Mercies. Many times over, we have asked ourselves at some point - does God really exist? How do we know if he is real or not? Only in our own experiences can we really answer that.Anne Lamont was born and raised by parents who were Presbyterian missionaries, who didn't believe in God and a father who despised Christianity. It was very hard growing up believing in something you could not see and Anne Lamont lets you into her life to see her beliefs that she was raised with unravel very slowly into a personal relationship with Jesus.The author talks about when she was a young girl, her believing that she was heard by a higher power other than her father. She didn't necessarily believe in Jesus, but she believed in something. As she started to mature in age, she began to not only smoke and drink with friends, but she also did it with her father. Anne spent lot of her younger years living and admiring her friends family life, their kindness and love for God, which was displayed to her, in a so-called Christianly manner. Affection and prayers were definitely lacking in her household. Watching her parent's friend's smoke, drink and commit adultery was a way of life for her, and soon Anne was living a life of promiscuity herself, along with the heavy drinking and smoking.Her central question throughout her life, trials and errors was basically does God exist? Her thirst for the truth was answered when she was introduced to a book in her college class by Kierkegaard's Fear and Trembling. That is when, as Anne puts it, she crossed over. Her heart was opened to seeking more about God. In no way does she begin to live a \\"perfect\\" life at that point, but she goes on to weave in and out for the reader her daily struggles with drugs, drinking and sleeping with married men. The honesty she tells about the overcoming her struggles is greatly appreciated.Kim Thompson-pg 2A struggle it really was as she ended up getting pregnant by a guy she barely knew. She contemplated abortion, but she ended up speaking with a pastor who helped her see beyond the here and now -into the bigger picture. She found herself in day-to-day life problems, family and friends dying and having to deal with grief and pain in her life. Having found a few churches to go to for support, she begins to call them home.Anne begins to teach her son about praying and believing in God to help him find his way in life when all is well and when it's not. To find his strength in seeing that God is always near and ready to answer and help him get through any and all problems life may through at him. She doesn't beat anyone over the head with her belief, but she shows through her own experiences how Jesus would quietly wait for her to answer and receive his help.Anne Lamott helps you to understand the very gentle nudging of God through her first person experiences. I would recommend this book to read. She is not afraid to lay it all out on the line, her language and honesty about situations she has been in is not for a judgmental person. It is for an audience that understands we are in no way perfect."},{"Title":"TRAVELING MERCIES. SOME THOUGHTS ON FAITH.","review":"Love this book so much I have been trying to savor each page because I know when I'm finished with this great book that I'll be so sad the incredible journey through her writing will be over.Love you Anne Lamott for writing such a great book that truly touched my soul and made me laugh and cry out-loud as well as there was so many moments I totally was changed by what I read."},{"Title":"TRAVELING MERCIES.

Reading Traveling Mercies is like looking into a pool of water -- at first, you might see only your reflection.

Her work is her - funny, sad, ferocious, crabby, tender, insightful, hopeful and ultimately about love and faith. She is one of the few authors I buy in hardback, read, then buy many more to give to friends.As a single mother of teenagers, I must warn her that if she doesn't write about that I am gonna get on her case.

SOME THOUGHTS ON FAITH.","review":"Reading Lamott's book made me long for her friendship. I could identify with many of her musings...her ambivilent feelings toward her mother....her excitement about her faith. She made me laugh and sometimes I felt like crying.

Thank you, Anne!"},{"Title":"TRAVELING MERCIES. SOME THOUGHTS ON FAITH.","review":"I've always had 5 favorite books...until now...now I have 6. I can unabashedly say I love Ann Lamott. Her humor, her doubts, her witticisms, her one-liners that will zing you into the next dimension. Through every chapter I laughed til I cried and then I cried the whole last chapter. Finishing her book was like saying good bye to a great friend. A better book you'll not find, a cast of characters I wish I had for friends."},{"Title":"TRAVELING MERCIES. SOME THOUGHTS ON FAITH.","review":"I found this book to be most inspiring. As a Christian, I realized I am not the only one out here trying to hang on to my faith. One of my favorite passages from the book was &quot;courage is fear that has said it's prayers.&quot; Through all of her trials and tribulations the reader finds her to be a living, breathing, mistake making mother, friend, daughter,and lover. But, always a child of God. I have my own &quot;God box&quot; now and it is filling up quickly. Loved her humor and straight, although sometimes rough, language. This is by far, one of the best books I have read this year. Do something nice for yourself. Buy it. Read it. Higlight it. Keep it as a reminder of God's amazing grace."},{"Title":"TRAVELING MERCIES. SOME THOUGHTS ON FAITH.","review":"If you liked Bird by Bird and Operating Instructions, you'll like Traveling Mercies, too. I have to admit, I am a bit disappointed that I have read some portions of the book before, in the form of columns for online magazine Salon. That is only because I read them so hungrily online that I selfishly wanted all-new material here.Lamott captures a moment or sensation so perfectly that you may wonder why no writer has ever described it that way before. If you don't agree with Lamott's politics, I like to think you can still admire her technical prowess as a writer (I guess that is easy to say when you do agree with her more often than not).Even though I have to admit that my life seems nothing like Lamott's on the surface, I find it comforting that we all seem to find ourselves seeking for answers to the same problems. Lamott's anxieties and celebrations mirror those of many people, and her unique way of expressing them connect us all."},{"Title":"TRAVELING MERCIES. SOME THOUGHTS ON FAITH.","review":"I found this book to be lacking the insights I was seeking. Anne Lamott's life is simply not that inspiring. True, she is a recovering addict who is also a single mom. True, she is a writer. But I didn't find any insights into the nature of God or faith in this book that I felt would qualify Lamott to teach me anything about God I couldn't learn from my own life or my own prayer."},{"Title":"TRAVELING MERCIES. SOME THOUGHTS ON FAITH.","review":"Until I read Anne Lamott I associated the word &quot;Christian&quot; with holier-than-thou, priggish, etc. Now I see clearly that that's just a stereotype. It IS possible for a Christian to be a liberal with a wicked sense of humor.Lamott isn't afraid to present herself in a less than flattering light whether it's secretly hating her mom or yelling out of frustration at her young son. We all do these things, but most of us prefer to show the world the &quot;good&quot; side of ourselves. Lamott is wonderful when it comes to making the everyday petty irritations of life funny, so that you empathize with her rather than judging.Lamott writes about children, her friends, relatives and church. She writes about the competitiveness that can develop among parents of young children, and she writes about the path she took to becoming sober. Unlike some reviewers, I don't think it's going to be detrimental to her later relationship with her son when she makes him go to church. There could be a lot worse things she could force him to do.In one essay, she writes about feeling unattractive after standing with a group of teenage girls waiting for a bus back to her hotel. Then she realizes that no one in the group is probably satisfied with her body, and this is something I've started to tell myself when I find myself in that kind of situation, too.This atheist gives this book two thumbs up."},{"Title":"TRAVELING MERCIES. SOME THOUGHTS ON FAITH.","review":"Anne Lamott style of writing and style of life make this collection of essays a delight to read. She's honest, humble, humorous and spiritual-all wrapped up in a nice package. Every person reading this book will identify with the life challenges, questions about faith and quirky happenings that Anne speaks about. She shows us the answers to all of it come from within us, as does our own happiness in life. I would also recommend reading, \\"The Goddess of Happiness- A Down-to-Earth Guide for Heavenly Balance and Bliss\\"."},{"Title":"TRAVELING MERCIES. SOME THOUGHTS ON FAITH.","review":"A must read and must have for every mom, this is more than just profound reading - it is a reference book on parenting and faith. Anne Lamott examines the fragile bonds of family, the demands of faith and the fallibility of humans with generosity, humor and stark honesty. Undoubtedly the most valuable book I have read."},{"Title":"TRAVELING MERCIES. SOME THOUGHTS ON FAITH.","review":"Simply, I do not understand why the interest in this book. Very confused and lonely person with no answers."},{"Title":"TRAVELING MERCIES. SOME THOUGHTS ON FAITH.","review":"As a conservative, male, Evangelical Christian, I am concerned that my church is too willing to let people like a lost Anne Lamott drown and too content to preach to the choir. Anne's concern to win the lost is obvious from her concerns about her son's salvation mentioned near the end of the book. But clearly she is sensitive to the knowledge that feminists would quickly toss the book in the trash upon a hint of evangelism, an attribute that makes it easy for most Evangelicals to look the other way as lost liberals flounder through life. I wish she had consulted more on &quot;religious principles&quot; with members of her own congregation because they are the reason Anne is alive and able to write a book that can save many thousands like her. My opinion that most liberals simply can't see or just refuse to see the &quot;big picture&quot; was evident in Anne's analysis of Houston as a broken city based on the poor quality of taxi drivers and cash register clerks when actually this is a sign of a city living the conservative-led American dream."},{"Title":"TRAVELING MERCIES. SOME THOUGHTS ON FAITH.","review":"All of Anne Lamott's memoirs make me laugh and warm my heart. This one is no exception. I read it two years ago and plan to revisit it soon. This book is full of humor and wonder about life and spirituality as Lamott takes us through her tragedies, better days and everydays. For her, every moment is worth writing about and she always has a way of keeping you interested with her observations of the cotidian."},{"Title":"TRAVELING MERCIES. SOME THOUGHTS ON FAITH.","review":"First of all let me state I'm a fan of Lamott and will continue to take an interest in everything she produces. But while Annie Lamott makes a very personal case for her faith and honestly depicts her experiences, I was not moved by this book as I was by BIRD BY BIRD, which, unencumbered by the &quot;baggage&quot; of religion, is filled with compassion, understanding and tenderness toward the human condition. TRAVELING MERCIES is much more self-indulgent, trite and unconsidered - okay if there's nothing else around to read, but hardly &quot;essential reading&quot;!"},{"Title":"TRAVELING MERCIES. SOME THOUGHTS ON FAITH.","review":"I don't agree with much of what Anne Lamont writes about regarding her faith (and often lack thereof) but this I found this book to be quite touching and sensitively written. I hope that she follows up with a book on her faith 10 years from now-I suspect that there will be more much maturity."},{"Title":"TRAVELING MERCIES. SOME THOUGHTS ON FAITH.","review":"As a fan of Anne Lamott's fiction I picked up this book on, of all things, faith (gasp!) with some hesitancy; afraid one of my favorite authors was going to reveal some sort of new agey/road less travelled/care for the soul atrocity. Thankfully, she did not. She made me laugh and nod my head and believe there is hope for even the heathens and those that get jealous of their neighbors and yell at their children. She made faith into something accessible, human, and appealing. With her wit and honesty she does what so many other books these days claim and/or try to do: inspire and comfort."},{"Title":"TRAVELING MERCIES. SOME THOUGHTS ON FAITH.","review":"I'm always looking for authors who can write so well that you can almost most taste the words. In this book I can taste the pain, and nuances in every passage. It is uplifting and courageous. Many of the lines sink deep in your soul and give you thought, about christianity and the spiritual journey you may be on. I plan on buying her other books."},{"Title":"TRAVELING MERCIES. SOME THOUGHTS ON FAITH.","review":"I found the book entertaining--laughed at parts, agreed with parts, but not very thought-provoking. I was particularly annoyed with the author's easy dismissal of the role of fatherhood in her son's life. Men don't seem to be too important to Ms. Lamott, as she goes through them like tissues. I did enjoy her style of writing, however, and I like her sense of humor. I find that many people struggling with their faith are self-absorbed and hypocritical, and Ms. Lamott's book has not disappointed me in that regard."},{"Title":"TRAVELING MERCIES. SOME THOUGHTS ON FAITH.","review":"Once more, Lamott has applied a poultice for the soul with her words. She possesses the ability to make people laugh out loud, to incite a placid and mildly depressed reader to spew beef vindaloo over the pages of a book while discovering a hilarious passage from the pool of truth. This is an author who makes some of us queasy when one considers her first book, Hard Laughter, which was great and got great reviews and which was published at 23, an age when most of us are trying to find a waitressing job in a fancy restaurant. From then on she continued cutting her swath of Hell, with wonderful novels like Joe Jones and Rosie and All New People, which I've read three times. Ironically enough, this is a woman who has professed to knowing no cosmic reason why she should contiunue writing. If I, like all people created, am a part of God, and I've heard that I am, then I hereby decree that Lamott must continue to write books. Although she need not do it at breakneck speed, she must definitely do it (I would also like to abolish January and Howard Stern). So there's your cosmic reason, Ms. Lamott. Additionally, any of you out there who consider yourselves Lamott fans but have not read All New People and Joe Jones are not being completely honest...so read them after you read Traveling Mercies (its Tribute to Jennie Holzer book jacket must also be admired -- at least it's not a white dove in a shaft of sunlight or some other religious type book jacket, fleecy cloudy blue sky with a hand coming out of it or whatever.) Anyway read it. Read it all, preferably with Indian food."},{"Title":"TRAVELING MERCIES. SOME THOUGHTS ON FAITH.","review":"Annie Lamott shows us the modern path to Christ in this twisted, comical, and grossly honest book! Not for the timid reader but still for the Christian who wishes to read about experiences vastly different than their own. Annie supports abortion, homosexuality, and Feminism. She does not hide her support of these causes, she only claims to have found Christ in the midst of them. No one can deny that she is HONEST, in fact, she is what I would call a HARDCORE HONESTY JUNKIE. She does not pretend to be something she is not. She brings a whole new dimension to the Gospel of Grace! The beauty is that God does love her, as he loves each of us regardless of our upbringing, political position, and/or emotinal stability. A surprisingly inspirational book!"},{"Title":"TRAVELING MERCIES. SOME THOUGHTS ON FAITH.","review":"Love this book!

I've been two out of the three (not a parent), and could relate to her becoming an authentic person of integrity. Her brutally honest admissions about having a \\"social 6-pack\\" or two was hysterical.Apparently, there are perfect people in the world. Perfect Christians who do not have any use for the imperfect or understanding of the trials that face the Rest of Us.

SOME THOUGHTS ON FAITH.","review":"Traveling Mercies: Some Thoughts on Faith by Anne LamottAnne Lamott's honesty in her book Traveling Mercies: Some Thoughts on Faith was truly moving and inspiring. She did a fantastic job of brining the reader through her conversion of faith. The book covers a wide spectrum of her life, building up to the moment outside her home where she simply discovered it was not possible to ignore God anymore. Anne's writing is one that will have you laughing out loud and then quickly silent by the struggles and things she faced.This is by far a must read for young adults and older who may be struggling with discovering how a life of faith and the difficulties that life throws our way. Anne's story will inspire you to find the relevancy of God and God's involvement in all of this."},{"Title":"TRAVELING MERCIES. SOME THOUGHTS ON FAITH.","review":"What is outstanding about this book is Anne Lamott's writing skill. She is a nimble writer who draws amazing analogies and parables through her stories of life as the daughter of a famous author, a single mother, and a very human human-being.Her stories capture you - I read this book in one day... could not put it down. She speaks rawly about her exploration of truth, and her daily struggles in life... I LOVE IT!It was a National Bestseller, and I had read a review in the Hartford Courant, then added it to my &quot;BUY&quot; list and then finally purchased it in the Spring, 2000.Though Anne Lamott &amp; I differ in political views, and in our approach to a shared faith, I have already passed it on, and recommended it to many...Anne Lamott is also the author of the very popular and necessary reader on the art of writing, called &quot;Bird by Bird,&quot; which my mother read in one sitting."},{"Title":"TRAVELING MERCIES.

A book that will stay with you long after you have read it."},{"Title":"TRAVELING MERCIES. SOME THOUGHTS ON FAITH.","review":"Knowing that I'm not one who particularly enjoys most of the contemporary Chrisitian literature out there, a good friend of mine bought me the book Traveling Mercies as a gift and said \\"you have to read this.\\" So, I did. I was introduced to Anne Lamott's brilliantly witty sense of humor and poignant vignettes about life, God, love, sex, family, grief, and many other universal themes we can all relate to. One does not have to agree with every political and religious statement Anne makes, but everyone should have an appreciation for the life she has lived, how far she has come, and the many nuggets of truth she has learned along the way. I highly recommend this book to those who struggle with a narrow view of God or those who have a difficult time seeing God in their circumstances. Lamott paints a picture of Christianity that is raw, honest, real, transparent and often completely hilarious. She isn't flaky, superficial, preachy or trying to be anything she isn't. Anne lets you pull up a chair to the kitchen table of her life and listen to her prayers, her fears, and her unanswered questions as she candidly puts her heart on paper. Anne Lamott is now my favorite contemporary author and I recommend her to all of my friends."},{"Title":"TRAVELING MERCIES. SOME THOUGHTS ON FAITH.","review":"Let's be completely honest for a moment. Life is hard. Sometimes it can be incredibly hard. Bad things happen to good people and this happens quite often. We live in a fallen and sinful world. Contrary to the \\"Gospel of Prosperity\\" (aka greed) that seems popular in many places (and promoted by preachers such as Joel Osteen), you can sacrifice everything and still have nothing to show for it in this world. In fact, as followers of Jesus we have been promised \\"trials and tribulations\\". Yet, as followers of Jesus we have hope, joy, love, and peace. We have everything that the world (and what we ourselves) seek. It's not easy to not give into the despair and disillusions around us. We can get caught up in existing instead of living just as easily as anyone else. But, we can truly live and live a life abundant. It is a struggle, but it can be done.This struggle is a lifelong one and in TRAVELING MERCIES Anne Lamott examines how it has affected and changed her life. From her childhood growing up with free-spirited liberal parents, to her drinking problems, an abortion, the death of her best friend, and the birth of her son, Lamott explores how Jesus has intervened in her life and taught her about grace and helped her overcome her feelings of inadequacy and despair.Lamott writes in a very simple, yet eloquent personal style. Her writing is filled with beautiful metaphors that make her writing quite vivid. She can capture a complex thought or emotion in one paragraph or sometimes even in a sentence. Her writing flows like water from the heavens on a rainy day in May.I enjoyed TRAVELING MERCIES immensely. There were times that some of the passages moved me. I am already a Christian, so the book did not cause me to convert or change my faith. However, it did reinforce many of my beliefs and provided me encouragement in my own struggles. I also learned a great deal about writing from reading this book. I love the style that Lamott writes in; it reminds me of an older, female (and slightly paranoid) version of Donald Miller's writings and reminds me of my own writing style. Much of it is pose written through poetry.Though TRAVELING MERICES is a book I highly recommend for anyone who likes to read, it isn't for everyone. There were statements that Lamott made (such as when she refers to God as \\"she\\") that struck a nerve within me. I also know that there are probably many things Lamott and myself would disagree with politically. This did not dissuade me from enjoying TRAVELING MERCIES. In reading the book I felt like I was traveling with an old friend, one whom I would disagree with sometimes, but a person who was a dear friend and companion. We don't exactly have to agree on everything to follow Jesus. He's the one who will judge, not us. Nevertheless, I know that there are readers who will read this book and will hate it because of some of Lamott's ideas and leanings. Should you read it, try not to do that. TRAVELING MERCIES is simply one woman's honest (and sometimes raw) account of her journey so far and how grace found her when she wasn't looking.If you're a writer and read this book, you should also check out Anne Lamott's book on writing, BIRD BY BIRD. It's just as honest and raw as TRAVELING MERCIES, but it's all about writing."},{"Title":"TRAVELING MERCIES. SOME THOUGHTS ON FAITH.","review":"I would very much like to write the kind of glowing review of \\"Traveling Mercies\\" that some others here have written. Anne Lamott is a very gifted writer with an eye for detail, a penchant for turning a phrase, and a sass that permeates everything she sees. She also writes about matters of faith, a faith I share (although from a different tradition) and that desperately needs more airtime in our ferociously secular culture.But I didn't like the book, and for reasons that I had a hard time pinning down. She struggles earnestly with life's messes, trying to find grace in the mundane or the irritating or the sorrowful; she is clearly a loving and devoted mom (although c'mon: wouldn't you have let your kid go hang-gliding?); and she would probably make a fiercely devoted and rather interesting and unpredictable friend. But I kept getting the sense in reading through the vignettes in this book that I was watching a home movie, one where the camera was trained almost exclusively on a somewhat confused middle-aged baby boomer as she stumbles into and then out of the various crises in her life. But her crises are nothing we haven't all experienced, and many would have been completely avoidable with a tad more foresight and common sense. So by the end (and, truth be told, long before), my reaction was: so what? Augustine or Bonhoffer this isn't.About midway through the book, Lamott reads a review of a lecture of hers that described her as \\"narcissistic\\", and that, I think, hits the nail pretty much on the head. It's not that one cannot find inspiration here, or humor, or compassion; the main difficulty in Traveling Mercies is that the essays are so consistently self-absorbed as to miss many of the lessons she could have learned were she able to get beyond herself even a little bit. So we have her chalking up as a minor miracle her being able to play the \`bon vivant' with a fellow air-traveler who happens to be of a religious and political persuasion at which she would normally have sneered; it never seems to occur to her, however, that were the shoe on the other foot (as in: \\"I actually talked to a feminist today, and even though she's spreading Satan's lies, she really wasn't all that bad!\\"), the essay would have read as intolerably patronizing. Elsewhere she talks about how lovingly her church accepted her unwed pregnancy, unlike what might have happened had she been in a church in the South (one of a few such gratuitous swipes at the South). But then again, perhaps not: I used to live in the South, and she might well have found there the support and acceptance she craved but mixed with the kick in the butt and the admonition to \\"sin no more\\" that she needed.So this is a mixed bag overall. I think it's fair to say that pretty much everyone will find something to relate to in Lamott's recollections, and few are better than she is at the craft of writing. But if you're looking for wry stories of domestic crises, read Erma Bombeck instead; she's funnier. If you want a spiritual autobiography, try David Brainerd or Julian of Norwich; they're theologically meatier. If your quest is a tale of life's adversity overcome imperfectly, I'd recommend C.S. Lewis' A Grief Observed. But if you want somewhat witty autobiographical essays by a neurotic left-coaster whose theology seems to have come straight out of a blender, look no further than Traveling Mercies."},{"Title":"TRAVELING MERCIES. SOME THOUGHTS ON FAITH.","review":"I guess this book could also have been called The Road Less Traveled, but that name was already taken. I am always amazed at the individual care God uses when bringing us to faith. Never the same path for any two of us, even when we have similar backgrounds.I will be honest with you, reviews are split on this book, primarily along liberal/conservative lines. I can only say that I found this book to be life changing... in a good way! I'm not going to be condescending and mock those who don't feel it's their cup of tea. I can understand that. But I have to say that I'm a better person because I read it. God met me in the pages of this book and used it to open my heart.I read it after church last Sunday and I loved it. It's interesting to me that in reading many of the reviews people had a sense that Lamott was now their friend. I can certainly appreciate that. The writing is so honest that when I finished the book I felt like I wanted to call Lamott and catch up on old times... and to thank her for being such a good friend.God is awesome. Lamott's life and work is certainly a testament to that. I thank them both for sharing."},{"Title":"TRAVELING MERCIES. SOME THOUGHTS ON FAITH.","review":"I can't fault this book, only praise it. For who else has written in such a unique way about a faith journey? Lamott makes it real (for someone of her age [middle-aged] and from a definitely Californian point of view.) But, her observations and the way she writes about them are universal. And funny.If you can't laugh at yourself, your foibles, and even at God, don't read this--you'll start feeling self-righteous and will be quickly entering a &quot;how dare she?&quot; review. You will, of course, have totally missed the point.Everyone can learn something about the way LIFE has a sneaky way of surfacing painful and joyous memories and feelings. These emotions are triggered by life's details, which Lamott expertly captures. She finds the most unassuming triggers to release a flood of feelings about various topics. The stories she tells are God-given, precious moments. Perhaps we don't &quot;see&quot; these moments and reflect on them enough in our lives. Is that why Lamott touches us? Thankfully, she remind us that they are there.Read and savor this book, if you are open to what makes someone an imperfect person--and a Christian."},{"Title":"TRAVELING MERCIES. SOME THOUGHTS ON FAITH.","review":"I was wary of this book when I saw the title, but found that it was not an in your face account of spirituality in which religion is shoved down the reader's throat, but instead an honest look at one woman's struggles to find God. I found the book inspiring. I also found LaMott's prose to be some of the best I have ever read. I read each sentence slowly and carefully, not wanting to miss a single word. I also disagree with the reviewer who said gen-xers would not enjoy this book. I am 28 and think it is one of the best books I have ever read."},{"Title":"TRAVELING MERCIES. SOME THOUGHTS ON FAITH.","review":"This is the book that brought me back to God. Anne Lamott is brutally honest about exactly how damaged and self-destructive she was before becoming a Christian. The writing's fantastic, as always, but the real reason to read this book is to understand how good God can be."},{"Title":"TRAVELING MERCIES. SOME THOUGHTS ON FAITH.","review":"Traveling Mercies is the first book I have ever read by Anne Lamott and all I have to say is &quot;incredible.&quot; She writes with honesty, humor, depth. Her short stories are multi-layered and resound with me. I found myself &quot;connecting&quot; more than once with her offerings while I could not stop thinking about the book after I put it down for the day.For all those naysayers who say she is writing about &quot;me, me, me...&quot; this style of writing is called memoir, which usually means &quot;a narrative composed from personal experience&quot; so the writing is autobiographical. Also, I found that while she did write on her past personal experiences, she did not dwell on them. I found most of the book more on her faith journey than a moan and groan, why me?, life is so terrible exercise!Be that as it may, what I found especially powerful was her &quot;conversion&quot; experience. In a society where &quot;God&quot; seems to take a back burner in many ways, I found her thoughts on the subject of faith relevant and persuading. We all should be so lucky as to be on a continual spiritual journey ala Anne Lamott."},{"Title":"TRAVELING MERCIES. SOME THOUGHTS ON FAITH.","review":"If I were inclined to buy some billboard space, the first thing I would do would be to spread the letters of Anne Lamott's name and her Traveling Mercies title as joyously as if I were paving the staircase to Heaven with my two hands. Anne Lamott allows her personal history, a newly-found and budding faith, and personal experiences to collide in Traveling Mercies, without letting her personality slip out the back door. She writes on topics we all know: family. Loss of loved ones. The joys and perils of parenthood. And, of course, her &quot;aunties&quot;: the thighs that follow her around like a pair of loving aunts. After reading Traveling Mercies, I was amazed at the clarity of a point she makes: Christians can screw up. (Gasp!) Yes, believers have their doubts occasionally. And some of us repeat the same sins and the same mistakes countless times. Anne Lamott is willing to admit it. What a breath of fresh air. And that isn't the only breeze blowing through Lamott's text. She's witty, insightful, sarcastic, and blatantly honest. Finally. Someone who's willing to admit their faults, credit their faith with guiding them through life, and occasionally spout -- unapologetically, nonetheless -- the ever-universal F word. If you're looking for a book to satisfy a craving for entertainment, Traveling Mercies gives a heaping helping -- with a little dose of faith instruction on the side. Three cheers for Anne Lamott! Now, about that billboard . . ."},{"Title":"TRAVELING MERCIES. SOME THOUGHTS ON FAITH.","review":"Reading any book by Anne Lamott is like watching the best-ever episode of Northern Exposure: you guffaw even as your eyes tear, and you squirm in delight at the quirkiness of the human imagination. To those who accuse Lamott of being too &quot;self-absorbed,&quot; I say, &quot;Go soak your benighted head.&quot; Since when are humility and gratitude, keynotes of any of Lamott's reflections, indications of self absorption? Lamott is the best friend we wish life had bestowed upon us, sharing her angst, grief and glories with such startling wit, brutal honesty, and hilarious self-deprecation that we thank God for the privilege of being members of her species. Wit, honesty, and self-deprecation in a spiritual book are a rare and wondrous blessing."},{"Title":"TRAVELING MERCIES. SOME THOUGHTS ON FAITH.","review":"I DO care about your dreadlocks, annie. well, ok, not your hair exactly -- but your wonderfully adroit and compassionate way of writing about hair, thighs, love, death, disease, and yes -- even God(not necessarily in that order). I adored this book, especially the pieces entitled TRAVELLING MERCIES and TRIBE -- but then I'm splitting hairs :) or dreads -- because the entire book is finely crafted and superb. the bitter will spew venom in your general direction as a way to alleviate their own suffering, no doubt -- success, especially a woman's success, is hard for some to swallow. I suggest a rest cure and/or Ginko for those who would throw stones at a talented author who has never been grandiose or posing -- just real. I'm sure the (thankfully few) naysayers will have a chance for a complete and cleansing rebuttal when their own books get published by Hyperion."},{"Title":"TRAVELING MERCIES. SOME THOUGHTS ON FAITH.","review":"Well, I'm a huge fan of Lamott, having read almost all she's written, but this one really got me.And as odd as it may sound to some of you, several times since I have finished this work I've needed some extra help from the wo/man upstairs. Take today for instance, I got involved with my 9-year-old's relationship with someone else, messed things up, and said a little prayer, asking for some help or inspiration. I got it........Not that dreams always come true by a long shot, but I thank Anne for reminding me of that awesome higher power who's willing to help out a mom in 100 degree heat, in the car, with 2 whiny kids, and provide her with a helpful answer. I loved this book, I love this author, and I only hope and pray that I can sustain the strong belief that she has in God above. God bless you and your child, Ms. Lamott"},{"Title":"TRAVELING MERCIES.

A great exploration of the human soul."},{"Title":"TRAVELING MERCIES. SOME THOUGHTS ON FAITH.","review":"Since the time of my own conversion experience - at age 38 - I have had a special place in my heart for others with similar experiences and Lamott's is one of the most beautifully described conversions I have ever read. A week after an abortion she finds herself one night, drunk and losing lots of blood. She's terrified and when the bleeding finally stops she turns off the light and tries to go to sleep only to become aware of someone in the room with her - first assuming it was her [dead] father. She turns on the light to find, of course, no one in the room. \\"But after a while in the dark again, I knew beyond any doubt it was Jesus. ... And I was appalled. I thought about my life and my brillant hilarious progressive friends. I thought about what everyone would think of me if I became a Christian, and it seemed an utterly impossible thing that simply could not be allowed to happen. I turned to the wall and said out loud, 'I would rather die.' I felt him sitting there on his haunches in the corner of my sleeping loft, watching me with patience and love, and I squinched my eyes shut, but that didn't help because that's not what I was seeing him with.\\"Thanks be to God."},{"Title":"TRAVELING MERCIES.

It was quite some time after, I was getting books to take with me on a trip that Traveling Mercies became the perfectly timed book for me to read.Anne Lamott writes like she's talking to you as a friend. I would recommend this book to anyone, even if they are not a religious person. For me, it spanned beyond religion, and became a book about life. It came into my life at a time when my mother was having cancer surgery, so perfectly timed.This is a story about Anne's journey while finding her faith, becoming a mother, dealing with very large problems and passing her quirky wisdom onto us, the reader."},{"Title":"TRAVELING MERCIES.

Remember you cried a little too, saying &quot;Oh, it sounds just like me.&quot; Sitting down with Ann Lamott's book is almost like meeting a friend you haven't seen for a long time and listening to her endless, funny, scary, sad stories. This book is a must-read for everybody, who has problems with self-esteem (and who doesn't?). It's a book by and about a very imperfect person, full of inner conflicts and fears, who seems to have found the way to love herself. Oh, and there is a little philosophy too, some of it is actually quite controversial. But being a simple person like you and me Ann Lamott probably didn't consider lecturing you on &quot;highly spiritual matters&quot; to be a good idea, so she put it simply - perfect God and imperfect people can have much fun together."},{"Title":"TRAVELING MERCIES.

As a product of the sixties I could relate to many of her trials, starting with experimental excesses &amp; finishing with eating disorders. Anne has lived my life &amp; described it better than I ever could. At times I had to stop reading reading to dry my tears...resulting from both uproarious laughter &amp; silent weeping. If I had known that she was to be a guest of Rosie O'Donnells I would have changed my schedule to see that show.

But then, driven along by the need to learn what events got Anne to this point in her life--bestselling author, devoted mother--it is hard not to appreciate the stark honesty shown here. Annie is amazing. She must have been aware of the kind of criticism she would face, yet she didn't let that censor her. Folks, the things that happened to Annie on her way to faith happen to many people in the real world. God did happen to have a special plan for her, as He does for all of us, but her road just had a few extra twists in it.Don't criticize her for admitting it. Instead, enjoy her fabulous humor in recounting these very serious problems. Enjoy her power of description. Enjoy seeing her transformed gradually into a Christian--Oh, the C word!Anything but trite, Annie gives us a genuine perspective on faith missing in much of Christian literature today. I've seen them--I work in a book store--pithy volumes of sage advice and empty platitudes. You always get the feeling that those authors have no idea what life is like without God in their lives. Say what you will about Annie, but she knows what that is like, and she is able to impart that knowledge to her readers in her own honest, uproarious way.I've bought this book for a friend, my mother, and my sister.

Even her profanity was funny because it was just &quot;her&quot; telling about her life the way she experiencned it and processed it. The way she described events and feelings were hysterical. Even now, there are a few lines that can make me smile just thinking about them. Her descriptions of people, events and circumstances are a work of truely awesome art. After completing the book, I immediately looked in the library for more works by her. Since I only read non-fiction I am anxious to read Bird by Bird next. Thanks, Anne Lamott for your honesty in sharing your life and being able to laugh at yourself as you struggle through it, making all the rest of us feel good in our attempt to do the same.

My problem is that despite the wonderful work that the Lord has obviously done on her life, she did not mention that anything she had done or that those around her were into was sin. . it just seemed like she was condoning too much in order to draw people in. She can definitely be used to inspire those who are looking for faith, yes, but at the same time I had a hard time reading things due to my personal knowledge of the Bible and scriptures. I can certainly see that the Lord is still working hard on her, and that she has a relationship with God, and so that made me happy. It just wasn't the right book for me to read.

SOME THOUGHTS ON FAITH.","review":"This book is about the need to believe. If you want something badly enough you can convince yourself of almost anything. For example her experience after getting an abortion was an example. She had to find some kind of meaning to it so out of a deep wish, she convinced herself she was feeling the presence of Christ. I was in the hospital myself faced with death. Jesus wasn't there for me. I prayed and all I felt was coldness. For every Anne Lamott out there, there is a person like myself, and if that is true; is it that Jesus is only interested in half the people that need him? I don't think so I think it's nothing but fantasy. In other words it is a bunch of head tripping nonsense."},{"Title":"TRAVELING MERCIES. SOME THOUGHTS ON FAITH.","review":"Having read previously published books by Anne LaMott, I admit I was unenthusiastic about reading this book group selection. Much of the material is rehashed from previous works but now autobiographically instead of as \\"fiction.\\"I found her self-depricating tone to be disingenuous and much of her self pity to stem from personal problems that were self-inflicted. (Did that last sentence mention \\"self?\\") The book is centered on her self involvement which often attempts to depict herself as being gritty, worldly, and street-experienced.While she has had experience as an alcoholic and sex addict, she never seems to rise above it in any inspirational way. Authors such as Frank McCort of Angela's Ashes and Jeannette Walls of the Glass Castle were confronted with horrible childhoods but managed to survive with a spunk and spirit I admired. I couldn't figure out what was so bad in Anne LaMott's life that she had to complain about and/or turn to self abuse to cope. I grew up with my own share of dysfunction but chose to take a more optimistic outlook on life.Although I agree with many of her political points of view, it did not sit well with me how she launched personal attacks on those who held opposing views. \\"The New Adventures of Old Christine\\" is able to satirize those annoying holier-than-thou mothers at the PTO in a much more humorous way and that's saying a lot for a TV situation comedy compared to this literary selection.I forced myself to finish the last third of the book after our book group discussion because those chapters seemed to be the most poignant. Yes, that was the best part of the book.

The naysayers were right: There's nothing here."},{"Title":"TRAVELING MERCIES. SOME THOUGHTS ON FAITH.","review":"I read this book because it was chosen in my book club. Everyone felt it was just an O.K. book. Parts of it were really good, funny. Mostly, I felt that I just couldn't connect with her, couldn't relate to her. Being from Northern California, we all enjoyed the references to places that we know. Overall, it wasn't one that I'd recommend."},{"Title":"TRAVELING MERCIES. SOME THOUGHTS ON FAITH.","review":"There's no question that this is a well written book about one WOMANS spiritual journey. Heavy emphasis on woman. As a man,I had a hard time relating to many of Lamotts essays. Specifically the ones about fat thighs, not being pretty, bad hair days, not looking good in a bathing suit, eating disorders, boyfriend problems, etc. I just couldn't relate.The book gets kudos from me, however, for showing that it's possible to be a liberal and a Christian. I also liked the overture section that detailed her path to Jesus. Women will love this book (as the review show), men might have a hard time relating to Lamotts life story."},{"Title":"TRAVELING MERCIES. SOME THOUGHTS ON FAITH.","review":"...and let's face it, if there's one thing we need more of, it's feelgood stuff where God is credited with performing 'miracles' that don't actually involve anyone getting healed of an incurable disease.Actually this book is quite readable and good fun. Some of it is charming. There's a surprising amount of humourous self-reflection that reminded me more of Bridget Jones's Diary than anything else, but such is the nature of trendy Christian thought, apparently.Particularly illuminating is the old joke about the guy who crash lands in the snow, complains about how God didn't rescue him, and, when reminded that he is in fact alive to tell the tale, says that it was because some Eskimo came along and saved him. We laugh because we are so used to Christian apologists using the 'mysterious ways' ploy, so we all know it was really God that sent the Eskimo, right? Lamott parrots this one without a comment. It would have been interesting to see her think about it a little; I'm disappointed that she accepts something so fatuous at face value.This is good to read on a plane or a beach. You'll enjoy it, toss it aside, and never think about it again."},{"Title":"TRAVELING MERCIES.

SOME THOUGHTS ON FAITH.","review":"This book has as much to do with Faith as Bird By Bird has with writing. Lamott sees, and writes, nothing beyond her own self-centered view of life.

Boring (to me) were the anecdotes about her drinking, her dieting, worry over her son's wanting to ?parasail, her son's health, whether a mole she had was cancer,etc. This is a book for women and for people who have been drunks and are now sober. Some of the anecdotes were good, but I didn't feel any of it said much about religion - yes, there was a chapter on finding God, but it didn't impress me. The author is intelligent and can write well, but that's about all I can say. This book is not a memorable one for me. Now I'm in search of one of those books that just carries me seemingly effortlessly into another world and one from which I will feel I have gained some truly valuable insights."},{"Title":"TRAVELING MERCIES. SOME THOUGHTS ON FAITH.","review":"I didn't enjoy this book as much as I thought I would. \\"Traveling Mercies\\" is not a conventional book about faith and spirituality (which is the only reason I chose to read it). I figured it would be the story of one woman who was less than perfect and found ways to integrate faith/spirituality in her everyday life. And the book is just that. It's also relatively well-written and mildly amusing at times. My main issue is with the author herself. She is very honest about her life and her relationships in this book, and she is a quite messed up woman. Her problems and general shortcomings are not what bothers me, though. I just find this woman annoying! She's also a total whiner/complainer, from the start of the book, and building and building all the way through the end. I didn't really enjoy this book or take much of what she said to heart because of that. If you are looking for an accessible guide to spirituality for believers and non-believers alike, this may be a book you enjoy, but I hope you don't find the author as obnoxious as I did."},{"Title":"TRAVELING MERCIES.

From the start, I found the writing style frenetic and almost stream of consciouness-like and very hard to follow. When I adjusted to the writing style enough to focus on the content I was more disappointed as I found it to be a self-absorbed account of someone's individuals journey with very little in the form of a messesge or inspiration. Very rarely do I read a book that has little or no value or impact for me, I would rate this one at a negative impact. perhaps I just speak another language and others will find it helpful or interesting, hope so."},{"Title":"TRAVELING MERCIES.

Only Miami Herald hoot Dave Barry is more deadpan. But I came away feeling like I'd rather party with Anne than pray with her -- and that shakes my sobriety, serenity, and spirituality all at once! I'll be watching to see how God shapes her soul, over time."},{"Title":"TRAVELING MERCIES. SOME THOUGHTS ON FAITH.","review":"This is the book that got me hooked on Anne Lamott. Most poignant and precious are the insights about life as a recovering alcoholic. Raw facts about motherhood were astounding, too. Her word choice at times caused my gut to spasm, but I survived and went on to read all of the book she had previously written. To my delight and the benefit of mankind, Lamott's newest book, Blue Shoe, avoids profanity."},{"Title":"TRAVELING MERCIES.

God will bless..."},{"Title":"TRAVELING MERCIES. SOME THOUGHTS ON FAITH.","review":"Or, more specifically, what has Anne Lamott missed? This book is not about faith, but about a confused and lonely person who seems to regard religion as a sort of personal improvement program, like AA or therapy. I fully agree with the reviewer who said that Anne Lamott needs to contemplate pride as one of the seven deadly sins.Since the book isn't about faith, what is it about? Well, one woman's feelings of inadequacy resulting from a rather difficult life. In the hands of good authors this can be interesting, even deeply moving, but Lamott never moves beyond the whining peevishness of a high-school girl. I had felt the same way about her &quot;Bird By Bird&quot; but thought I would give a book on faith another chance. But all one hears from Anne Lamott is &quot;me, me, me.&quot; Hard to find God, or even Christian fellowship, in all this."},{"Title":"TRAVELING MERCIES. SOME THOUGHTS ON FAITH.","review":"This book is written differently than just your average book. It's a compilation of several life lessons all molded into one story. The short stories are really interesting and her humor gives it a fun kick. She tells her stories in such detail it feels as though you're experiencing it with her. The stories are so diverse that I guarentee someone finds some story in there that they relate to. No matter what your religion is, this book is a really powerful read. Prayer helps the author out in numerous ways that will prove to the readers that there is power in prayer. This book is touching and it really makes you think about life."},{"Title":"TRAVELING MERCIES. SOME THOUGHTS ON FAITH.","review":"Another gr8 book from Ann Lamott. She demonstrates a delightfully earthy approach to spirituality."},{"Title":"TRAVELING MERCIES. SOME THOUGHTS ON FAITH.","review":"I enjoyed the strange, mildly eccentric reflections in this book. Anne Lamott is not one for conservative feelings or politics but she is very honest and shoots straight from the hip! I was a little put off by the cussing and the bashing of Christians who take the Bible literally. Heaven will be the most 'diverse' place imaginable and it is the likes of Anne Lamott (and weirdos like myself) who will make it intersting! I enjoyed her beat-around-the-bush testimony! A great little book!"},{"Title":"TRAVELING MERCIES. SOME THOUGHTS ON FAITH.","review":"This book trace the spiritual journey of Anne Lamott.

SOME THOUGHTS ON FAITH.","review":"I loved this book. It is touching in a quiet, profound way. Almost all of the essays made me cry (I'm a complete softie of the TV-ads-make-me-cry variety.) The stories in this book are straight forward, remarkably honest and often hilarious - I'd love to meet the author. I will definitely be reading some of her other books - what better recommendation can I give?! (This book was recommended to me by sewgeeky.com, another hero of mine!)"},{"Title":"TRAVELING MERCIES. SOME THOUGHTS ON FAITH.","review":"Anne Lamott doesn't seem to be your conventional Christian. She doesn't try to be anything she isn't, so this book includes dissertations on her drug and alcohol abuse, her bullimia, her son who does not have an acknowledged father. She seems much more like the millions of people who have experienced these issues in their lives, and left conventional religion by the wayside. Yet the difference between Anne and other people is the constancy of faith in her life. She is a regular churchgoer, but I'll bet she doesn't dress up in a flowery dress and a big hat to attend. The message of the book is simple - no matter how you spend your life, God will not abandon you. A very pleasant read."},{"Title":"TRAVELING MERCIES. SOME THOUGHTS ON FAITH.","review":"I read this book in about one day, couldn't put it down--am not now nor have ever been either Alcoholic or Christian. In fact, I seldom read books on religion, faith, or spirituality and chose this particular text because I am an Annie Lamott fan, not a believer (in the more conventional sense). I do, very sincerely, respect other people's beliefs, however orthodox or UN-orthodox, and I greatly enjoyed reading the way someone so totally unlikely to write about a spiritual journey nonetheless found herself on one when she became sober.I was very moved, and actually envious of the comfort Lamott's faith has given her life. Not only has her spiritual awakening played a role in controlling her alcoholism, but it has lead her to a Christianity more resonant of the teachings of Christ than is true of many more &quot;traditional&quot; spiritual authors.However, this book may in many ways appeal more to those who are TOLERANT than those who might find the word &quot;faithful&quot; as the first on their tongue to describe themselves. Even the deeply skeptical, or the totally without faith will enjoy this book if they are &quot;tolerant&quot;, because it is about the faith of someone so unlike those one generally finds writing about spirituality. This fact also makes the book a great deal more interesting than one might expect of a text about a spiritual journey (for those who aren't wild about that sort of literature in general), because you get to see how Lamott sustains her faith despite a mind with little of the &quot;obedient&quot; nature one generally associates with religious fervor. This is particularly true for those of us who see the word &quot;religious&quot; and think more of Pat Robertson and the Religious Right than somebody we might like to talk with at dinner.I read this book maybe a year ago, and was shocked to see it now on the best seller list, since it's really quite liberal, and is not the sort of book I would expect to appeal to a wide range of Americans, given the fact that so many people voted in primaries for the son of George Bush--a man for whom Annie Lamott has never had a good word (to put it MILDLY! ).Anne Lamott writes for Salon.com, and is not your average American by a longshot. She's got an incisive mind, she is witty and articulate, but she is also wildly opinionated (in a way I find attractive), and so liberal that most right wing &quot;Christians&quot; (as opposed to Methodists or Episcopalians or Roman Catholics)will run in the other direction should they pick up this book by accident-- These are probably the people responsible for most of the one star reviews of this book.For the rest of the reading public, however, this is a taste of Annie Lamott at ALMOST her best--(I do think that &quot;Operating Instructions&quot; is even better, but so few books in my life have been capable of making me laugh OUT LOUD in the New York City subway system during rush hour, that it may be the funniest book about motherhood on the planet--and motherhood is its own unique kind of spiritual journey.)It is also true that this book is about religious faith--the sincerity of this woman's vision of God is very touching for those of us willing to admit more than one concept to the way in which God is defined. It's somewhat disturbing to read reviews on this page where the way Lamott talks about God is considered offensive--this book is definitely NOT for those into dogma, fundamentalism or thought control.It is however, a delight for those of us who have not entirely lost the idealism of a generation much maligned by the numbers of its members who have become so conservative with age that they view their younger selves as the enemy--if that's you, avoid this book like the plague, because there's lots of things here that will offend you. And for those who find reading about one person's spiritual life interesting--a fairly self-destructive person whose faith has enabled her to cope without flipping her out into a person who believes her way is the only way--the book is an incredibly enjoyable, irreverant and sincere journey documenting her less than well-traveled path."},{"Title":"TRAVELING MERCIES. SOME THOUGHTS ON FAITH.","review":"Every time I picked up this book, Anne Lamott was sneaking up behind me and tapping me on the shoulder. Of course it is HER memoir, but time after time she was talking about subjects that were of importance to me. Like her I am a recovering alcoholic, I've worried about not being pretty-pretty and found myself trying to &quot;put my father's dog suit&quot; (as she puts it) on a man in my adult relationships. She's funny and just as honest about the absurdities in her life as the joys and the pains. Even though my interest in spirituality is not specifically Christian, I found her accounts of her experiences both moving and relevent. I loved this book."},{"Title":"TRAVELING MERCIES. SOME THOUGHTS ON FAITH.","review":"As i neared the ending of this book, I prolonged finishing it as I didn't want my journey with Traveling Mercies to end. This book allowed me to relect on similiar life experiences and to grieve my own losses. I enjoyed her honest humor when describing difficult people and difficult situations....Even though we are Christians, her words reminded me that it's okay to be honest with how we really feel. The only bad part about this book is that I wasn't able to embrace Anne Lamott when it ended."},{"Title":"TRAVELING MERCIES. SOME THOUGHTS ON FAITH.","review":"This was more autobiographical than I expected; Anne has had an awful lot of trauma / challenges in her life - whew!

Some of the minutiae was tedious . . . but the overall journey was absorbing!"},{"Title":"TRAVELING MERCIES. SOME THOUGHTS ON FAITH.","review":"I was utterly amazed by Anne Lamott's book, Traveling Mercies. Her writing style is just wonderful and she tells great stories.

I will certainly share it with others. A must read for those who are interested in the inner life."},{"Title":"TRAVELING MERCIES.

SOME THOUGHTS ON FAITH.","review":"Books about spirituality usually turn me off because the authors write as if spritual people should be above things like living. Anne Lamott knows, however, that living is all we've got, and that we find God in making through the chaos of life. And as she details her path, and her small epiphanies, she lets me know that small victories are all we need to keep going. Her essay on forgiveness is a small gem. Her essay on realizing that your father is really dead 20 years after the funeral is a large gem. A book to read and reread, and find new meanings in."},{"Title":"TRAVELING MERCIES. SOME THOUGHTS ON FAITH.","review":"I guess everybody falls into pain and crises during their life, and it seems to be my turn right now. As Anne said, to quote preacher Veronica, &quot;. . . the world sometimes feels like the waiting room of the emergency ward and that we who are more or less OK for now need to take the tenderest possible care of the more wounded people in the waiting room, until the healer comes. You sit with the people, she said, you bring them juice and graham crackers.&quot;Traveling Mercies has brought me juice and graham crackers. I am most appreciative."},{"Title":"TRAVELING MERCIES. SOME THOUGHTS ON FAITH.","review":"Anne Lamott's latest nonfiction work is not her best yet, but it's still a very satisfying read.Traveling Mercies works best in parts; many individual chapters and essays are excellent. Some of them, however, just seem drawn out and indulgent. And, as a collection, it doesn't seem to add up the way I was expecting.I must say that it's refreshing to read a Christian writer who doesn't attempt to bully or rationally argue the reader into converting to her belief. One of Lamott's real strengths is to share stories of herself, to indicate how things affect her and why, and to let the reader take or leave it as she will.As an atheist, I don't share Lamott's belief in Jesus. Anyone with an open mind, however, should find much value in this book, whether or not he agrees with her views on life.Definitely worth reading, but not as good as Bird by Bird or Operating Instructions.(I also have to mention that one of Lamott's best stories dealing with her faith doesn't appear in this book, although you can find it in the archives of Salon Magazine. Search the archives for &quot;My Advent Adventure.&quot;)"},{"Title":"TRAVELING MERCIES. SOME THOUGHTS ON FAITH.","review":"I am not a writer but I recognize genius when I read it.

SOME THOUGHTS ON FAITH.","review":"Lamott's metaphors, similies, anologies and just plain description take my breath away. She paints pictures with words that are so real that I am there. I am more there than here. It is a gift and rare talent she has. Also a gift is her at-times brutal, at other times beautiful, honesty. It offends my own personal sensibilities when she refers to the omnipotent, onmiscient God that I worship as &quot;him or her&quot; and even more so when she uses His name as an obscenity, a curse. But it doesn't take away from the fact that her writing skill is light years ahead of everybody else's and that going where she takes me is an excellent thing, a rare blessing and opportunity."},{"Title":"TRAVELING MERCIES.

I have to say the Bird by Bird is still my favorite, but Traveling Mercies is also a great book. Anne is so likeable to me, I feel like I would love to just hang out drinking coffee with her and discussing our paranoias. I also agree with another reviewer that you don't have to be religious to like this book, though if you are profoundly un-religious you may be turned off. This is a great book to keep around and just pick up and flip through every now and then.

I had heard great reviews about the book and decided to borrow his book for my flight to Tampa one weekend. This book touched my heart in ways I can't describe. While everyone's faith journey is personal and unique, I felt that in addition to having many similar life experiences, Anne and I shared a similar journey of faith.

I'm sure the other people there were glad to escape the lunatic who was laughing out loud one minute while crying shamelessly the next.I got hooked on Anne Lamott when I heard Michael Feldman interview her on &quot;Whaddayaknow?&quot; I ran out and bought Operating Instructions and Hard Laughter. Took the rest of her books out of the library and then bought the ones I liked best. When I saw the topic of her latest, I was wary, since I'm not generally fond of &quot;those right-wing Christians who think that Jesus is coming back next Tuesday right after lunch&quot; and I was terrified that Anne had become one.

Sam, her son sounds like a great little boy and how could he help but be with how he's been raised. St. Andrew Presbyterian is a model for all the rest of us who struggle with our denomination and see glimpses of what we can be. I will read more of Ms. Lamott's work."},{"Title":"TRAVELING MERCIES.

She exposes the deep dark chambers of her brain, her shameless soul and big open heart and parades these parts around and it becomes a wondrous account of life studded with faith and hope.

Thank you Anne."},{"Title":"TRAVELING MERCIES. SOME THOUGHTS ON FAITH.","review":"Anne Lamott the talks candidly and humorously about her relationship with God. The first fifty pages were a little slow, but this is a book well worth reading. Anne also describes growing up on the west coast in the sixties, and becoming an author and a single mother. As a conservative Christian, I was able to understand how different people find God and relate to him in different ways. I intend to buy a few copies of this book as gifts."},{"Title":"TRAVELING MERCIES. SOME THOUGHTS ON FAITH.","review":"What she relays from the heart is bitingly honest and sweet and pure. In this day where &quot;messy&quot; parts of an author's life are not included in an &quot;autobiography,&quot; or are cleaned up for the public's viewing, Anne Lamott reveals all her foibles, mistakes, drugs, drinking, etc., with a forgiving heart and a wonderful sense of humor. Her love and faith constantly come to the surface in a very human manner. In the spaces of these beautifully written pages I would laugh, cry, laugh and then cry again. Experiencing so many different emotions from her story. She is absolutely the best writer in this genre. I eagerly look forward to reading anything she willingly shares with the public."},{"Title":"TRAVELING MERCIES.

You'll never think of your thighs, or your aunts, again without at least a chuckle. While her humor is original and her lines are enormously entertaining, this book is not for the reader who wants only to be entertained. Whether Annie is describing her addictions, her neurosis, or her newly found faith, she brings laughter, honesty, and ackowledgement of the pain of living we all share."},{"Title":"TRAVELING MERCIES. SOME THOUGHTS ON FAITH.","review":"That is, you've made me laugh again until my sides hurt on a topic that one might consider solemn. This is another one of Annie's classic soul-bearing essays (pun intended)where she exposes &quot;everywoman&quot; in her writing. If the reader doesn't mind LaMott meandering through her life through her essays, eventually the reader will see the ties throughout. LaMott uses her everyday experiences and the people she loves to reveal her faith in God as something very attainable and very present in the small things. Her life, as she describes it, shows the very presence of God both through her faith in herself (and she HAS overcome some real addictions) and in other people (forgiving her mother and father, continuing to try relationships, and of course, wonderful Sam- her son). There is so much in this book for everyone- I'm certain that most women in the &quot;fortish&quot; age group (that LaMott is in) will see themselves a hundred times over. It's that fact that makes me love Annie LaMott. She is me. Only she has had the courage to bear her innermost thoughts and neuroticisms, laugh both at and with herself, and she makes me feel like it's terrific to be wierd and imperfect. This book inspires you to think that God can and will help you to pick up the pieces if you just give him a try. Wonderful book. Again."},{"Title":"TRAVELING MERCIES. SOME THOUGHTS ON FAITH.","review":"Ann Lamott wrote Traveling Mercies in a style of simple grace and beauty. She displayed her once wounded soul for readers to judge and compare with what she is today: a perfectly centered human being. The source of her motivation to change was Sam. He is a gift who illuminated her spirit and restored Ann's inner strength to find the key to happiness: forgiveness. The act of forgiving allows our minds to see the little miracles constantly flowing in every nook and cranny of the human experience. Miracles replenish what appears to have been taken away from us, and by perceiving the world through forgiving eyes, order and purpose are restored so that we humans can say, &quot;Everything happens for a reason.&quot;Each chapter in Traveling Mercies is like a lesson in A Course in Miracles. Take everything in life, relinquish control, release it to God and watch the healing process begin. Sometimes an outcome was not what one expected, but what may seem wrong today often turns out fine tomorrow, and the mystery of a miracle reveals its truth just a little bit."},{"Title":"TRAVELING MERCIES. SOME THOUGHTS ON FAITH.","review":"I was introduced to this book by my spiritual director and once I picked it up, I could not put it down. I appreciated Ms. Lamott's incredible honesty and her ability to weave her life experiences into lessons about God and faith. For some, her journey may be shocking but it speaks to a reality of experience that is attractive in its unvarnished approach."},{"Title":"TRAVELING MERCIES. SOME THOUGHTS ON FAITH.","review":"Anne Lamott is a good writer, so I understand all the five-star reviews she's getting here. But this book doesn't really work as a collection, or as anything but a mere surface-level look at faith.I share her beliefs and her style of humor-filled, laid-back Christianity, but after a while I got tired of her whining. Lamott should have been much more ruthless in editing a book about God and faith. And she should have tried to delve deeper than she did.But...still worth reading."},{"Title":"TRAVELING MERCIES. SOME THOUGHTS ON FAITH.","review":"Ms Lamott is brutally honest, funny and touching about her transformation from a lost, addicted woman to a person who found her faith is inspiring.I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for the presence of God in their lives and can't seem to get past the grit and detail of real life. What Ms. Lamott tells us in the his book is that sometimes that's exactly where we find that divine spark."},{"Title":"TRAVELING MERCIES. SOME THOUGHTS ON FAITH.","review":"This book is a gem. Anne Lamott is a Christian who has the courage to be a real human being. . ..a rare combination in today's church, and sorely needed. Pick this book up for yourself, get a copy for your friends. Lamott's honesty and faith will shock and inspire you to love God, by way of learning how to love yourself."},{"Title":"TRAVELING MERCIES. SOME THOUGHTS ON FAITH.","review":"The ironic thing about the title of Anne Lamott's new book Traveling Mercies is that it really doesn't cover any new ground and basically covers many of the same experiences as her previous books. She doesn't stray much from events relating directly to her, nor does she write about how they may be affecting other people around her. Even Christianity seems to be just another excuse for Anne to talk about Anne. For a book on faith it doesn't seem to deal with the Gospel or Jesus in particular detail or depth. It is as if the challenges or conflicts of being Christian aren't worth being mentioned. Towards the end of the book, you can't help but feel annoyed at an author that seems so arrogantly self absorbed. There is a thin line between autobiographical and being narcissistic and Traveling Mercies crosses it."},{"Title":"TRAVELING MERCIES.

I bought this to replace the very used copy in my library, and donated it to them."},{"Title":"TRAVELING MERCIES. SOME THOUGHTS ON FAITH.","review":"I love reading Anne Lamott. She's one of the few Christian writers, along with Thomas Merton and Kathleen Norris, who doesn't make me want to take out my pocketknife and start carving on somebody's face."},{"Title":"TRAVELING MERCIES. SOME THOUGHTS ON FAITH.","review":"Brutally honest, endearingly quirky, funny as the dickens, and turning on dimes to catch a reader's heart by surprise. This little volume is a treasure. From discussion of her formative years and early losses, through alcoholism and on into single parenting, Lamott holds nothing back. Her prayers, her curses, her neuroses, her blessings, are all laid out for inspection. Through it, despite her admitted self-absorption and bottomless fears, wisdom born of close attention and contemplation leaps off the page. More than once the reflected brightness lit up parts of my own life and character and motives that suddenly seemed to have lain too long in the dark. Breezy and deep are not two words I would commonly apply to the same essay. Here they fit."},{"Title":"TRAVELING MERCIES. SOME THOUGHTS ON FAITH.","review":"I keep a list of best-loved books, which is coming in handy lately as I hit my forties and tend to rebuy books I've already read (sometimes getting through several chapters before I figure this out). If I put the list in order, Traveling Mercies would immediately make my top five. Lamott's autobiographical essays are hilarious and heartbreaking and wonderful, and make me wish she lived next door. I've read Traveling Mercies all the way through at least six times, and picked it up countless other times to enjoy one of the stand-alone chapters. I love the poetic compassion of some of the passages so much that I read them aloud. If you're a mom, you've got to read the chapter on forgiveness - Lamott's attempt to deal with her resentment of a perfect, day-planner writing, cupcake baking, field trip-chaperoning mom. We've all been there on some level. I keep going back to this book when I need to teach adult Sunday school, because it's such a beautiful exploration of Christian faith in a life that's messy and funny and difficult and real."},{"Title":"TRAVELING MERCIES. SOME THOUGHTS ON FAITH.","review":"This is a retelling (and often a very emotional one) of one person's struggle through life and with faith. It is not geared towards those analytically-orientated who like to read things that are organized and linear. This book doesn't just teach, but it draws the reader into the real, often ugly world of a real person. This is certainly not fashioned propaganda trying to convince others to join the ranks of Christianity. Lamott is for those, spiritual or not, seeking to enrich their thoughts and engage their own concepts of faith and ideas of what it means to live. One can definitely say without a doubt that she is, at least, always honest. Many may think uncomfortably so. She is shown at times to be both judgmental and irresponsible; and even though she eventually gets her act together (for the most part) she doesn't hesitate to be honest about where's she been and what's she's done.For those who have come to associate the concept of Christianity with being judgemental, intolerant, holier-than-thou, strict home-lives, etc. this is an absolute MUST READ. It shows to perfection just what it is that can make imperfect people (meaning every single Christian on the face of the planet) Christian. All some of us would have to do is change the choices, circumstances and steps to grace and the story could be our own. What I think Lamott tells us in the this book is that anyone looking for the presence of God in their lives but can't seem to get past the icky, boring or dirty details of real life is looking in the wrong places. That the divine relationship people seek can be found exactly in those dirty places that people always try to get out of."},{"Title":"TRAVELING MERCIES. SOME THOUGHTS ON FAITH.","review":"My first interaction with this text was an excerpt that was read in class, highlighting the chapter, \\"Why I Make Sam Go to Church.\\" I found this excerpt to be engaging, interesting, and thought provoking -- why DO we make our kids go to church? Lamott's response, I think, powerfully demonstrates that the church, and God's love, is big enough for all of us, even those of us who struggle along our path.I enjoyed getting to explore this book (for a different class) and really tried to embrace the perspectives that Lamott gives. I found her storytelling style to be genuine, honest, and real -- something which I appreciated a great deal. Her struggles with a variety of issues and how God met her, and CLAIMED HER, just as she was, is inspirational to me. Specifically, I felt like I could relate to many of her feelings of desperation at times...not completely understanding where God was in the mix of the world, but knowing He was somewhere, and clinging to that notion.While this book, reviewed as \\"reverent and irreverent\\" (San Fransico Examiner and Chronicle) might make some readers uncomfortable with some of the life situations described, it does a great job of reminding us that God can be found in many places in one's life....not just inside of a church building.A quick read. Definitely recommended."},{"Title":"TRAVELING MERCIES. SOME THOUGHTS ON FAITH.","review":"Have been an avid reader for 30 years, but never before felt compelled to write a review or letter to an author before...This book, perhaps more than any of the thousands of others I have read, struck a chord in my soul. On the recommendation of a friend I had read &quot;Operating Instructions&quot; about three years ago. While thumbing through a Book of the Month Club type catalog I ran across the photo of a white woman in dreadlocks and was struck with admiration for the woman who would present such a public image. I was pleasantly surprised to read that her name was Anne LaMott. I ordered the book &quot;Traveling Mercies&quot; and was delighted and completely engrossed by it. Ms. LaMott puts words to emotion I cannot personally express when she speaks of her &quot;Christian-ish&quot; life-orientation, her likening of her personal experience of coming to the Lord as to that of a stray cat trying to enter her life, and the pain and sublime joy of rearing her Sam. Like Annie,(oddly enough the name my own mother, a story in and of itself, was called as a girl) I came to a personal relationship with God through voyeurism into a congregation of Black believers, and like her, was taught life lessons I didn't know I needed through my interaction in fellowship with them. I thank God for the talent with words he has bestowed upon Anne, ask his blessings upon her and her loved ones, and recommend this book to anyone who finds him/herself surprised at the move of the Holy Spirit in his/her life."},{"Title":"TRAVELING MERCIES. SOME THOUGHTS ON FAITH.","review":"Anne Lamotte has given us a book about faith that is greater than any I've ever read. She shows us how her faith grew through the drawing into a community of an alcoholic and drug addicted young lady with dreadlocks. She shows us that people of faith are humans with all the flaws of humans, and that there is not \\"miraculous event\\" that occurs to \\"cure\\" all out ills or our sinful nature and actions.As a person suffering from depression and alcohol addiction recovery, and struggling with my faith and my relation to God and his or her relation to me, I find myself seeing visions though the words of this wonderful woman that I've never seen before. Those visions are helping me to find my way back to a path of emotional and faithful contentment.Thank you Anne Lamotte for your ragged and blatent honesty! If more people would be so honest, the world and the church would be a better place."},{"Title":"TRAVELING MERCIES.

I went out and bought the last copy of her book at my local bookstore. Read it in two days. She is everywoman....every person. I took my copy and lent it to a friend with written instructions to pass it on. I want it to get all the way to Anne and have her come and have a cup of tea with me."},{"Title":"TRAVELING MERCIES. SOME THOUGHTS ON FAITH.","review":"The lovely and moving descriptions of her neighbor friend who is cancer-ridden yet life-filled; the way Jesus moved through not just her life but the life of others like a graceful wind, the hilarious stories of serendipity involving the kindess of strangers and lug nuts for a VW convertible, the beautifully crafted, warm hearted and open journey that is not narcissism, but heartfelt reportage that surrenders self. Put down the axe and reread."},{"Title":"TRAVELING MERCIES. SOME THOUGHTS ON FAITH.","review":"Life shouldn't be this difficult! Lamott, through witty, humorous, clear, concise writing and compelling stories shows us how, in many ways, we are our own worst enemies. But she also shows us ways out of the problems we create and gives us a glimpse of how our attitudes and perseverance can overcome even the problems of alcoholism, drugs, being a single Mom, and being poor.On the surface, this is a very self-centered book, focused almost entirely on the feelings, friends, enemies, and weaknesses of the author. Yet, Lamott manages to use her story to demonstrate to us that through love and faith, one can overcome seemingly insurmountable odds. If one reads these stories while keeping compassion in his or her heart for another suffering human being, then a spiritual journey unfolds with many wonderful lessons along the way. But it takes work to get by the feeling that we're learning far more about the author than we needed to.Yet Traveling Mercies becomes a wonderful sermon since it afflicts the comfortable and gives some hope and comfort to the afflicted. And perhaps the discomfort one feels when reading it is the same as that of being around sick family members or friends. And how can one tell the story of love and compassion for others bringing grace into one's life without sounding self-centered and a bit self-righteous? In the end, Lamott does precisely that. The reader grows respect and admiration for this frail human being as she tells of her own spiritual journey from someone who could not stand being &quot;in the same room with a Christian,&quot; to someone who can lean on God and accept Jesus. And she does so without trashing anyone else's faith system.&quot;I make him [her son, go to church] because I can. I outweigh him by nearly seventy-five pounds. But that is only part of it. The main reason is that I want to give him what I found in the world, which is to say a path and a little light to see by. Most of the people I know who have what I want--which is to say, purpose, heart, balance, gratitude, joy--are people with a deep sense of spirituality. They are people in community, who pray, or practice their faith; they are Buddhists, Jews, Christians--people banding together to work on themselves and for human rights. They follow a brighter light than the glimmer of their own candle; they are part of something beautiful.&quot;I spoke of this book to a minister friend, and recommended it as good reading. He in turn mentioned it to a friend who was having difficulty with a wayward daughter. The daughter read Traveling Mercies and reported back that it had changed her life. That she was able to see how to get things back into control. Perhaps that is the only recommendation this book needs. It changes peoples' lives for the better."},{"Title":"TRAVELING MERCIES. SOME THOUGHTS ON FAITH.","review":"These are the last three sentences of the book, \\"Traveling Mercies\\" by Anne Lemott. And they sum up this collection of stories beautifully. This is a book about faith and a book about gratitude. It is intelligent, thought provoking, funny and highly readable. Anne Lemott, Annie--as it appears her friends call her--lets us into her world and shares a very personal and poignant path of a unique and awkward girl taking off her \\"glasses of puberty\\" and coming of age. She lays everything bare, from her feelings about her bushy hair and alien eyes, her drug and alcohol additions, to her love for her father and dealing not only with his death, but also with the death of her best friend. We enter the world of a single mother, a struggling and ultimately successful writer, and all her feelings of self-doubt. She seems to have a third eye when it comes to seeing those around her, and through her observations and writing, we too can appreciate people and situations to a greater degree.Writes Lamott of a sick woman from her church in a story named Ashes: \\"It must have been too annoying for everyone to be trying to manipulate her into being a better sport than she was capable of being. I always thought that was heroic of her, that it spoke of such integrity to refuse to pretend that you're doing well just to help other people deal with the fact that sometimes we face an impossible loss.\\"The underlying theme throughout each brutally honest passage is the message of her faith in God and how she came to discover this faith. She LEARNS to pray and uses prayer to get her over the large and the small humps. One can't help but come to love this child of God, and everyone in her life."},{"Title":"TRAVELING MERCIES. SOME THOUGHTS ON FAITH.","review":"Anne Lamott makes Kathleen Norris seem stodgy and Rebecca Walker seem prim. She writes with a crackle and snap that can be endearing or enervating, depending on her topic. The story is familiar: a child of the 60s discovers that religion isn't just for octogenarian bishops, it's for cool people like you and me. Cool = progressive, in case we haven't learned that by now.There are passages that should be read aloud to a friend or relative or spouse or captive listener, to be fully appreciated. On substance abuse, Lamott combines the wisdom of the Serenity Prayer with the savagely funny humor of Denis Leary. Truly memorable.If we read this as an autobiography of a funny &amp; fascinating gal, we won't be disappointed. But if we're looking for a faith that transcends the narrow, doctrinaire confines of hollery redhamite progressivism, we probably won't find it in &quot;Traveling Mercies.&quot;When Lamott writes about abortion, she is ardently pro-choice, as might befit someone whose first child succumbed to a &quot;legal medical procedure.&quot; But her detailing of the after-effects of that procedure could be used as material in a pro-life argument. Also, witness her reluctance when counseled by a clergyman to end her second pregnancy in a similar fashion.I wanted to throw this book across the room when Lamott describes a man being mean to his dog and says it was the most heartless, brutal, inhumane thing she had ever witnessed. Then she goes on, flippantly, casually, to detail how she once grabbed her child with such force that her fingernails became embedded in his forearm. But it was all right, because she didn't mean it. You see, Anne Lamott is one of the cool people, and cool people don't do mean things. (We could ask which is the more inhumane action: striking a dog with a stick or dismembering a gestating baby, but this rhetorical question might force some people to think. Heaven forbid that persons who are unaccustomed to serious cogitation about moral truths should be forced to think about these things.)There's something endearing, even to this curmudgeon, about Lamott's wisecracks &amp; dreadlocks; her voice is neither omniscient nor Olympian, but she is always ready to give an opinion, and sometimes we find the opinion disagreeable. We're glad to have read &quot;Traveling Mercies,&quot; but also glad to have bought it at a used bookstore. There's a fine line between the endearingly hip and the gratingly flippant, and Lamott crosses this line dozens of times, with almost reckless abandon."},{"Title":"TRAVELING MERCIES. SOME THOUGHTS ON FAITH.","review":"Anne Lamott has created a gem. this book has reminded me that I'm not alone, saved my sanity more than once, and brought me to both tears and hysterical giggling in one sitting. I am a Christian who finds herself sighing at the uncreative, and often judgemental popular Christian-living books. I am tired of hearing from wealthy southern preacher's wives about how to let go and let god. I am so excited to pick up a book (and I have more than once already) that offers a look at a HUMAN grip on grace.I feel like I have a piece of anne to laugh with, and a piece of her that will assure me I'm normal, when i'm feeling quite the opposite. She writes with political awareness, intecllectual depth, and tremendous faith and humor. READ THIS BOOK if you are looking for a lovely happy medium between same ol' Christian Living books, and far out Goddess/anti-religion books. She is real, and makes Faith real."},{"Title":"TRAVELING MERCIES. SOME THOUGHTS ON FAITH.","review":"I really wanted to like this book. I had heard good things about it and read lots of reviews of people liking it. To me though - it seemed like it was just a look of reflections on the author's life without much direction. There seemed to be very little about her faith and how that had helped.I apparently just missed the point."},{"Title":"TRAVELING MERCIES. SOME THOUGHTS ON FAITH.","review":"\\"Traveling Mercies\\" is a dangerous sort of book to write. Readers tend to either love or hate the authors who write them and to do this loving or hating with great immoderation. There's good reason for strong reactions: it's hard not to come off as a self-obsessed, self-important, self-congratulatory windbag when you're using your own life-struggles to illustrate how you came through the fire so tempered by hard-earned wisdom.Let me clarify my own position: I happen to be in the camp of those who love Anne Lamott so this episodic spiritual autobiography did not seem the exercise in self-indulgence reviewers in the opposite camp might consider it. One thing, above several others, saves it from being an \\"oh-look-at-me-aren't-I-so-marvelous,\\" one-woman self-love fest. Lamott turns an unflinching eye on herself and does what strikes me as one of the most difficult, riskiest, and therefore most courageous things a \\"beloved author\\" can do: write about herself warts (literally moles) and all. She truly doesn't come off as a very likeable person in a great many of these pages--or, at best, she seems a person who is often difficult to like. She no doubt recognized this in the writing and the risk she was thereby taking of alienating her adoring fans, yet she wrote herself \\"ugly\\" all the same. Love her or hate her, that takes guts.She's by turns an alcoholic, a sex addict, and a drug abuser. She's cranky, angry, needy, clingy, judgmental, unforgiving, hypochondriacal, hysterical, bulimic. She's a bad daughter, an insecure, sometimes inconsistent parent, a high-maintenance lover, and, if all that weren't dicey enough, she has really bad hair. She doesn't hold back many punches in beating herself up. But that's rather the point. She keeps getting up. She keeps trying. Most of all, she keeps loving herself, trying to love others, and be, against all odds, a better person. She shows, by example, that you can do this, too.You notice, maybe, that I haven't mentioned the religious aspect of this book. Not a word about Jesus yet. Lamott risks alienating two large camps of people in this book: those who believe in God and those who don't. Lamott's quirky, irreverent, individualistic interpretation of Christianity's message is not likely to play well with conservative types, true believers, or fundamentalists of any stripe. The fact that she prays and believes at all in any kind of \\"higher power,\\" nevertheless Jesus, is just as likely to turn off atheists and other intellectual-types who find the whole business of religious belief to be vaguely embarrassing, about as reputable as an addiction to porn.Think of Lamott as a kind of Gnostic Christian, though, the way that term was originally used, as a seeker of knowledge of God outside of tradition, depending not on dogma for the bedrock of her belief but on signs garnered from personal revelations as she walks the path of her own life and you've got a better idea of her notion of faith. Hers is something of a DIY Christianity supported by a like-minded community of friends and fellow-believers ready to lend a hand to whomever among them falters. Again and again in these pages, Lamott shows that although we can't do it alone, we have to do something. A faith bought simply on faith alone isn't worth much.\\"Traveling Mercies\\" is an almanac of small miracles found in everyday life in unexpected places, little revelations that, added up, can lead one, if not to the Promised Land, than at least to the doorway where one can catch an occasional glimpse of it. It is, like so much of what I've read so far of Anne Lamott, good companionship on the journey."},{"Title":"TRAVELING MERCIES. SOME THOUGHTS ON FAITH.","review":"I absolutely loved this book. I felt that Anne Lamott had invited me into her home for a cup of tea and while she wrapped me around a quilt that she had knit herself, shared her thoughts and stories on spirituality, life, her son, and herself. It's a warm account of her life, her faith, her friends and everything that matters to her. She did a brilliant job capturing the magic that makes her spiritual and how it is infused in her everyday life. The writing is superb, top-notch, and her book is elegantly structured with essays beautifully tied together like the quilt I had mentioned before. Once in a while, one gets quite saddened that a book is about to end, that a voice is about to close, and that is how I felt when I read the last page. I've been reading many spiritual memoirs lately, and this is one of the best thus far."},{"Title":"TRAVELING MERCIES. SOME THOUGHTS ON FAITH.","review":"A real human talks uncensored about faith. Now there is a thought. Read it. You don't have to agree with Anne, just read it."},{"Title":"TRAVELING MERCIES. SOME THOUGHTS ON FAITH.","review":"In an e-mail exchange, a ministry colleague asked, \\"I have never read Anne Lamott. Do you recommend her?\\" I responded:Knowing your heart for broken people and for Jesus, I can recommend \\"Traveling Mercies\\" to you without qualification. I have only about 16 feet of easily reachable bookshelf, including my favorite reference books, yet this is one book that I keep avoiding moving to attic storage.Lamott is blunt about what she has gone through, how she has felt (especially about those of us who make a career of being nice), and her determination to keep Jesus out of her life at all costs. She is a product of multiple dysfunctions, and you can see why she'd have a hard time learning to love herself or to admit that perhaps God could love her. But I love the sentences by which she let Jesus come in; I have never otherwise heard such a simple prayer of conversion, nor one that is so true at the heart level.My daughter-in-law said that if I enjoyed Lamott, I'd also enjoy Kathleen Norris (The Cloister Walk). I did, but Norris is more cerebral. Lamott is at once pithy, practical, shocking, and profound. \\"Traveling Mercies\\" has confirmed in me, probably more than any other source has, an understanding of how varied, unexpected, and original God's work is in any one individual's life."},{"Title":"TRAVELING MERCIES.

I adore her honesty and willingness to risk herself with her words. \\"Traveling Mercies\\" helps those like me that have been so shunned by the 'faithful' that we drink in her message with abandon.

I love this book and have gifted it to many friends."},{"Title":"TRAVELING MERCIES. SOME THOUGHTS ON FAITH.","review":"In this beautifully written book, Lamott describes how all of our lives are lead by spirit and marked by little miracles - whether we able to recognize it or not. We are reminded that nobody is exempt from the first noble truth- that the price of being human brings with it tears, sorrow, pain, and death. But it is also up to us to recognize the joys and gifts with which we are graced. I am convinced that anyone giving this a low rating is likely a conservative Christian threatened by her radical slant on truth. But in her book, she is even able to find grace in her encounters with those archetypes. For those who are liberal Christians, interfaith or with Buddhist leanings, this book is a welcomed read and goes down like honey when your throat is too parched to swallow. I myself lost my husband to head/neck cancer a few months ago and now find myself not only a widow, but alone and wheelchair bound with an advanced form of multiple sclerosis at the age of 42. In so many words, I have wanted my (relatively young) life to end a hundred times. This book has given me a greater sense of affirmation, comfort, strength and hope than have the clergy and shrinks with whom I have consulted since my husband's death combined. This is not only incredible writing, it is a form of pastoral ministry. Thank you Anne, for being such an AUTHENTIC guiding light. May God in all its miraculous and merciful forms keep you travelling always!"},{"Title":"TRAVELING MERCIES.

I, in fact, think it's healthy to read authors now and then who make you think and who provide varied perspectives. First of all, I really like good writing and Lamott can write. Second, she's genuinely funny and I like that. Third, she has been through some very tough times, faced them, and struggled through them with God's help. I would like to think that Anne is real and humble enough to learn from more conservative Christians as we are willing to learn some things from her. Meanwhile, I like her writing and see no reason to fire potshots at her."},{"Title":"TRAVELING MERCIES. SOME THOUGHTS ON FAITH.","review":"I love Anne Lamott. She's funny, frank, smart, insightful, and her writing always leaves me inspired. So I decided to read this book despite the fact that it was about faith and God and a religion that I rejected years ago, trusting that Anne's writing style would compensate for the subject matter. And boy, am I glad I did. Who knew that you could be feminist, pro-choice, lean sharply left politically, AND be a devout Christian? It makes me think that there might be hope for me yet. ;)Oh, and once again Anne delivers. Her writing is touching, deft, lyrical, and I can hardly wait to read the rest of this trilogy. As for the 1 and 2 star reviews, what can I say? This book is a memoir, so yes, it's mainly about Anne. And Anne is not your typical conservative and traditional Christian, which in my eyes is not a bad thing. What I didn't love about the book? The design of the cover -- yep, a tiny thing not even really worth mentioning. :)"},{"Title":"TRAVELING MERCIES. SOME THOUGHTS ON FAITH.","review":"This book just goes to show you how God specializes in \\"broken things\\" (i.e. flawed humans).\\"Traveling Mercies\\" is easily the best (by far) of all 3 books Anne Lamott has written on her faith journey.Yes, she can be self-absorbed (can't we all be?); yes she's a Liberal (so what?), but her wonder over the love of God and her adoration over Jesus once she finally \\"gets it\\" is truly beautiful. She gathered the jagged shards of her life... the alcohol and drug abuse, the bulimia, the abortions and other issues, etc. and placed them into God's Hand and gets....what? LOVE AND FORGIVENESS. That's what it's about. And it's ALWAYS incredibly beautiful.Remember please that God enters EACH of us through a private door. The journey is intensely personal for each one of us.And also remember that Jesus was a Radical and a Revolutionary in his day.... he hung out at the \\"back of the line\\" with society's outcasts.So, before you cast stones at the liberal writer from Northern California.... read the book.It's refreshing, hilariously funny, and profoundly moving."},{"Title":"TRAVELING MERCIES. SOME THOUGHTS ON FAITH.","review":"I love Anne Lamott. I use her book, Bird by Bird in my writing classes taught through Santa Monica college community education. And this book is filled with her truth and she is both reverent, very funny and can also bring tears to your eyes. She can write about how to celebrate her son's birthday or her hair and have you engaged and loving her to pieces. Thank you, Anne for sharing the deep and humorous truth of your heart and soul. This is why I read (and write.)Rachelle Benveniste"},{"Title":"TRAVELING MERCIES. SOME THOUGHTS ON FAITH.","review":"Anne Lamott recounts the stories of her growing faith from disbelief to belief in a God who crouches down and waits patiently for her to open the door and welcome Him in. Anne recounts a harsh life of challenges with addiction, love, family, and herself. She shares her simple yet profound spiritual conversion careful to incorporate the people who have had some of the greatest impact in her life.We catch glimpses of her faith story through the people she shares relationships with: her childhood friend, a Jesuit, the people (especially the older women) of her church community, and her son. We see in her life the mundane, the struggles, a person who can be gritty in one breath and sweet in the next. Anne Lamott tells her journey of faith, in a way that is not for the faint of heart. (or the straight and narrow) She packs this memoir with everything that life is made of and allows one to enter into her story and glimpse the God who unwearyingly waits."},{"Title":"TRAVELING MERCIES. SOME THOUGHTS ON FAITH.","review":"Our book group at my Episcopal church read this together, and loved every moment of it - the way God led Anne Lamott gently throughout her crazy life with spiritual guides in the person of her friends' parents, music from a nearby church, people who popped up when she was ready for them. If you object to \\"raw\\" language and will condemn anyone who uses it, you'll probably be turned off. We felt it was necessary to be true to her story. The image of Jesus waiting outside her room, waiting to be invited in like a stray cat is one that will stay with me forever. He doesn't force us to follow him, he waits. He puts himself and his choices in our way, and we get to let him in or turn away. So much humor in the sadness, such a wonderful odyssey! Thank you, Anne Lamott!"},{"Title":"TRAVELING MERCIES. SOME THOUGHTS ON FAITH.","review":"When I first began writing and presenting my short stories about Iran, people in my workshop class looked nervous. No doubt remembering the fatwa placed on Salmon Rushdie's head for his Satanic Verses, they asked me, \\"Don't you think Iranians might take offense at some of the things you've said here? I mean, don't you think you come off as a bit bigoted?\\"The question bothered me a lot. What was I trying to accomplish with these stories: Why did my stories usually involve horrible Iranian men and frustratingly stupid Western women?And even when I figured out what it was I was trying to portray, for the longest time my stories lacked depth. Some were overburdened by sarcasm-- I was trying to make light of some dismal experiences I'd experienced living in Iran, experiences I would have a hard time explaining, even after all these years, to people like my mother. Some stories went round and round in circles and never seemed to arrive at any real conclusion.In the midst of my dissatisfaction--why doesn't this sound right? why can't I paint the scene properly?--my mother dropped a book off at my house. Now, my mother, being passive aggressive, will often \\"forget\\" a book on the coffee table whenever she wants to get a point across. Let an author do the arguing for her, that's what she's all about.There was Sex Before Marriage when it was time to have \\"the talk.\\" And Not Without My Daughter when I was threatening to follow my then husband to Iran.Here, now, layTraveling Mercies: Some Thoughts on Faith, by Anne Lamott. An innocent paperback with a quaint, little church on the cover. No doubt Mom's way of spoon feeding me a dose of organized religion. Disappointed as she's been that God never took with me.So there it sat, for months on end, this Traveling Mercies church propaganda. Until, completely distracted, I forgot what Mom was trying to do and flipped through the pages for a quick read.I didn't want to, but I fell in love. Anne Lamott threw a spot light on all the bad stuff that lurked in my own heart. All the fear I had about myself. About the worth of my writing:\\"All those prophecies you heard in the dark have come true, and people can see the real you, see what a schmendrick you are, what a fraud.\\"And in a book about finding God, about Grace and personal salvation, Anne Lamott wrote about the less than admirable life that led to her transformation:Life was utterly schizophrenic. I was loved and often seemed cheerful, but fear pulsed inside me. I was broke, clearly a drunk, and also bulimic. One night I went to bed so drunk and stuffed with food that I blacked out....I made seven thousand dollars that year and could not afford therapy or enough cocaine. Then my married man called again, and we took to meeting in X-rated motels with lots of coke, tasteful erotic romps on TV like The Bitch of the Gestapo....Her writing was, to use her own words, \\"so sexy and intimate and stark that you almost have to look away.\\" Frankly, I want to lift all of her words and rearrange them on the page, because \\"Everything is usually so masked or perfumed or disguised in the world, and it's so touching when you get to see something real and human.\\"I laughed. I cried. But I never judged Anne Lamott, a woman who made such raw confessions. I understood her. It dawned on me then,that what was missing in my writing was honesty. I had started with the idea of, \\"Look what happened to me!!\\", but what I needed to explore was, \\"Look, what happened to me?\\"Maybe, just maybe, I could tell this story without a smokescreen of justification. Maybe, just maybe, it's OK to be the flawed hero of my own tale. A damsel in distress who is also manipulative, insecure, aimless, and confused.It's easy to talk about Iran. The Ayatollah Khomeini, Ramadan, a post-war economy. But, like Anne Lamott's search for Grace, what's hard to capture is the far more universal crux of the thing. The glaring mistakes. The failed expectations. The hearts that got broken. I wasn't just an innocent victim; I was the second party in that proverbial tango.For every sin I've committed, I get that there's someone else out there who carries the same weight. Anne Lamott figured this out. And this too:When I quit in 1986, I started getting healthier in almost every way and I had all these women helping me, and I told them almost every crime and secret I had, because I believed them when they said that we are as sick as our secrets."},{"Title":"TRAVELING MERCIES. SOME THOUGHTS ON FAITH.","review":"Anne Lamott's style of writing and style of life make this collection of essays a delight to read. She's honest, humble, humorous and spiritual-all wrapped up in a nice package. Every person reading this book will identify with the life challenges, questions about faith and quirky happenings that Anne speaks about. She shows us the answers to all of it come from within us, as does our own happiness in life. I would also recommend reading, \\"The Goddess of Happiness- A Down-to-Earth Guide for Heavenly Balance and Bliss\\"."},{"Title":"TRAVELING MERCIES. SOME THOUGHTS ON FAITH.","review":"Anne Lamott speaks to my heart, soul, and beliefs as she talks of becoming and remaining a Christian. I began this book on a day when the hairs of my soul were rubbed backward. As I read her words, my heart was soothed as I was reminded of what truly is important. It is difficult to remain a liberal, intellectual Christian at times. Lamott reminds us, in an irreverent way that I love, that we are in this boat together. The love of Jesus and our higher calling supersede all of the grumbling here below. The chapter on forgiveness and the &quot;perfect mother&quot; is one that I will turn to often when the feelings that I am in competition return."},{"Title":"TRAVELING MERCIES. SOME THOUGHTS ON FAITH.","review":"Each time I read another of Anne Lamott's works, I think it is my all time favorite, until I read the next one. Traveling Mercies is now my favorite. Anne Lamott is one of the most genuine and brutally honest authors I have read.I am not a religious person, and in fact much the opposite, but I loved this book. I loved the way Anne fully admits that she does not &quot;conform&quot; to the traditional ideology of Christianity, and yet Jesus loves her anyway. I love the writing about her son Sam, her lost friend Pammy . . . all the people who have touched her life in one way or another. All of these people make her look deeper inside herself, and also to God, for answers and solutions to problems that we all face every single day. Of course, her sense of humor also plays a part in this book, as I don't think it's possible to read Anne Lamott without reading her sense of humor. It would just be wrong!Traveling Mercies touches on the issues that we all have with feeling &quot;not good enough&quot; or like a failure; and how to overcome those things through the stark realizations that flash before our eyes now and then and also through humor.Truly, if I had one wish on this earth before my life runs out, I would wish to meet her and be a part of her life . . . and after reading Traveling Mercies I can see that she is even more of a loving and compassionate person than I had already assumed. Beautiful writing of a beautiful, though messy at times, life.I admire Anne for being a Christian but for also accepting others in their own faith, no matter what that faith may be. I think that, truly, this should be a required read for anyone who is a Christian . . . a lesson in acceptance because none of us are perfect and none of us will ever believe exactly the same things because we are all so shaped by our life experiences. Anne Lamott is truly beautifully amazing, and I recommend this book, and all of her others, to everyone."},{"Title":"TRAVELING MERCIES. SOME THOUGHTS ON FAITH.","review":"Anne Lamott's writings on faith are so gentle and simple, even old cynics and non-believers -- like myself -- are charmed and enlightened. If you're an atheists and think you may find yourself in a foxhole, take this book with you."},{"Title":"TRAVELING MERCIES. SOME THOUGHTS ON FAITH.","review":"Anne Lamott, author of 'Bird by Bird,' 'Hard Laughter,' 'Operating Instructions' and 'Blue Shoe' has written this personal account on her journey of faith and spirituality. Her leap of faith in everyday life braves the challenge of leaping across the abyss of doubt with fear and trembling. She recalls from Micah...and what does the Lord require of you, but to do justice, and to love mercy, and to walk humbly with God. Both a divine human comedy and error of Christ-like suffering and passion with a penance for honest and wise sense of humor that has raw courage to spill it out on the page.If you're still struggling with faith and you've tried source books after another. Then I'd recommend Ms. Lamott's 'Traveling Mercies.' Lamott tells it like it is with a been there, done that kind-of-spirit who wasn't afraid of living life but still loved God with all the passion and yearning. She shares her life with open insight and truly genuine faith in raising her son Sam, the relationships with her family, old friends, women of her church and men she dated. She tells us in a vibrant, warm and funny way in her journey of faith that sustains and guides her. Traveling through as a shining light in the darkest of life and exposing her inner well of meaning and hope. Lamott is a cross between Erma Bombeck, Cyndi Lauper and Ruth Graham. Well, sort of. If you're trying to find your walk of faith and what to understand in an honest, wise straightforwardness approach to the ups-and-downs of daily living Ms. Lamott can be your friend. My top recommendation on real faith."},{"Title":"TRAVELING MERCIES. SOME THOUGHTS ON FAITH.","review":"What a lovely book of revelation, personal quest, and spiritual fulfillment! Anne Lamott takes the reader along on a personal journey that is both difficult and heartbreaking, but which rings with the realization that there is life after no-matter-what-kind of previous life you might have had. We travel her road of addiction and grief as she searches for the right path in her life, while at the same time we become involved and caring in her life. When she stumbles into a community church after years of denying the need for religion, not to mention Christianity, she finds the home that she didn't even realize she needed. Her subsequent acceptance of Christ as her savior is as much surprise as it is revelation, and it becomes a life-changing event. Not only can she fight, and defeat, her addiction, she can also pray with her son whenever life affords a problem that seems insurmountable. But this is not a schmaltzy touchy-feely book of fundamentalist dogma. It is truly a blessing, both for the author and for the reader. The simple acceptance of God and His healing power along with the love and comfort of a supportive community illustrate the changes that can occur when one is ready to surrender to a higher power. It ends too soon and one longs for &quot;the rest of the story.&quot; Let's all hope that Anne Lamott will continue the saga of her spiritual journey."},{"Title":"TRAVELING MERCIES. SOME THOUGHTS ON FAITH.","review":"I read this book over the course of a vacation and found it intriguing. Intriguing in the sense that I have never read a book about the quest for spirituality written from her viewpoint. Her thoughts are at once bawdy and poignant, helping us to realize that we too have a place in the quest for God. Too many books of the spiritual genre reflect on the bad times in ones life as past - as a struggle that is over having achieved nirvana. Anne Lamott's writing underscores the fact that the journey towards spirituality is an ungoing process, and a process that is worthy of all."},{"Title":"TRAVELING MERCIES. SOME THOUGHTS ON FAITH.","review":"I have Anne Lamott's book, Bird by Bird. It is trulyinspirational, and I love the way Annie sounds like she is sittingdown to tea or coffee with you. I saw Traveling Mercies in the bookstore and picked it up and ended up standing there in front of the display, totally captivated. I love Anne Lamott's writing style, the way she expresses just what she thinks and feels but you never feel like she's forcing it on you or teaching you a Lesson. It's simply who she is and she is sharing it for those who are interested. I can find myself agreeing heartily on some points, shaking my head no on others and laughing all the way through. I saw a clip of her reading a part of this book and it was just delightful to hear her inflections, her little lisp at times, and the comforting sound of her voice. It truly was like sitting across from her, sipping that latte or whatever and being completely enveloped in the grace of a great storyteller and the honesty of one of God's eloquent children."},{"Title":"TRAVELING MERCIES.

Her first &quot;I'm a reformed druggy, drunk..&quot; may have struck a chord with readers the first time round, but c'mon now, how many times can this poor, sad-sack woman milk this line.

Just talk about it.\\"Jesus says to those in the faith, \\"By your words you will be either acquitted or condemned.\\"Annie breezily trips off multiple profanities that lace her essays, amusing many, offending just as many (unnecessarily!).Jesus says, \\"I tell you, love your enemies, pray for them.\\"Annie rejoins, \\"I tell you what, I can't stand/hate right-wing conservative so and so's (a few more choice expletives @*!#).Jesus says, \\"In the Scriptures are eternal life...God's Word is TRUTH.\\"Annie feels, \\"Buffet-style spirituality works for me. Jesus in my belief system is first-among-equals along with Buddha, new-age, eastern meditation, Virgin Mary, dalai lama-blessed scarlet wrist cord, etc.\\"Jesus says, \\"Judge not lest you be judged. For with the measure you mete out, it will be measured back to you.\\"Annie passes judgment on those persons/groups she vehemently opposes with biting, witty, sarcastic, venomous barbs of bile.Jesus lovingly says, \\"Repent of ALL your sins or perish...observe EVERYTHING I command you..If you love Me, You will do what I expect as My disciple.\\"Annie seems to shrug, \\"I've taken care of the biggies that I write about again and again. But my mouth and attitude and stance toward opposite political views and bitterness and hostileness and self-absorption and selective discipleship and selective use of the Bible? God loves/accepts me just as I am, thank you very much. That's what makes Grace/Faith so wonderful.\\"Jesus says, \\"By their fruit you will know true forthtellers from false prophets.\\"Annie, not just privately, but publicly, vocally and unabashedly in print before thousands 'preaches' a faith that in comparison to what Jesus preached and lived, comes across as a worldview 'transformation' sans noticeable life and language reformation - this after being a churchgoer since the late '80's with the shepherding of her pastor and friends in the faith.Thoughts on Jesus? Thoughts on His Faith as found in the Gospels? Hardly. More like thoughts on what she wants to believe as evolved-extract from multivarious sources topped off by a form of christianity that needs much more extensive acquaintance with Bible instruction and discipleship mentoring that leaves out the aggressive lip and lives out the agape love.Yes, the hallmark of the genuine Christian faith is that the Lord Jesus (term never seen in the book?) is like a gentle fisher of people: He catches us first, then cleans us. King Jesus loves us just the way we are, but loves us too much to leave us that way (proved by His bloody death on the cross - see The Passion of the Christ to get an idea of HOW MUCH HE LOVES Annie and all of us).When a book purportedly on 'Christian Faith' subtly encourages the reader to become like (or at the least accept the self-satisfactory state of) the author rather than to become more Christ-like in every aspect of life, you have to wonder what sort of belief system is advocated."},{"Title":"TRAVELING MERCIES. SOME THOUGHTS ON FAITH.","review":"The first half of the book was somewhat interesting, and then it went downhill. I found nothing moving about the events upon the author. Needed to see some growth or something different by the end."},{"Title":"TRAVELING MERCIES. SOME THOUGHTS ON FAITH.","review":"I had really high expectations for Anne LaMott. And I was hoping that an introduction like this would drive me to read all of her work. I was expecting that this would hit me like the work of Donald Miller, but it really didn't. This had some very beautiful moments. But in short, a lot of times I found it getting on my nerves. But when I say that, I know that a lot of people have been inspired by her work. But also with something like this, you have 3 choices: Love it, hate it, or just survive the journey like I did and laugh in the right places.I can say that I can respect a woman like Anne, because she's come a long way. That's obvious. She's honest in everything, added with a twist of humor through a lot of it. She writes openly about her struggles with the bottle, and basically her walk through faith. She speaks with pride of her son, Sam. In short, she doesn't complain about what she doesn't have, but about what she does have.But then, yep, with me unfortunately there is a gripe or 2, and I couldn't help but letting it get on my nerves. Ok, one thing I strongly believe in is loving the sinner, hating the sin. Now I have to work with all kinds of people, and I get along with them for the most part. But unfortunately I know people out there might make the kind of remark that says, \\"Homosexuals are some of my best friends.\\" HMMM. Seems like Anne LaMott is one to say that too. And she's proud of it as well! When I hear people make a statement like that, especially Christians make statements like that I sincerely have a couple of questions for them. First of all, who cares? Ok? Just because a homosexual happens to be YOUR best friend, that doesn't change what The Bible says about it, ok? And second of all, what're you really trying to do when you say that? Trying to make a point, or a statement? When people come out and make a remark like that, it looks as if you say that out of favor. Now, if you're trying to impress people, ok. But come on! I'm friends with black people. I'm white, and I actually have a few friends that are black, are you impressed? Didn't think so. Now, I've had my say, now it is time for me to clear something up. I'm not blind to the fact that we all have our obvious differences, but I've never bought into the con that homosexuals are \\"born that way\\". So, while I choose not to hate, I also choose to be somewhat intolerant. Another thing that DIDN'T fail to peeve me off was when Anne referred to God, she said, \\"He or She\\". Now, if people consider me a Bible thumper for saying this, so be it. But my Bible speaks of a Heavenly Father, not either or. When Jesus prayed the Lord's prayer, He specifically said, \\"Our Father, who art in Heaven, hallowed be thy name.\\" Either you believe that, or you don't. You may consider this petty, but I see it as a big deal, and I take my God seriously.So, I dove head first into this, really hoping to LOVE this, page by page. But I survived the journey, just barely. I wish I could say that I'm searching the libraries to check out the rest of her stuff, but that won't be the case. The sincerity I can appreciate, but I don't agree with it all either. I will continue to ponder on the thoughts of this, and pray for the likes of the Anne LaMott's out there."},{"Title":"TRAVELING MERCIES.

SOME THOUGHTS ON FAITH.","review":"I read this book lovingly and then shared pieces of it with my students, since it displays such an unrelenting commitment to living (even when it leads to self-abusive behaviors) and to writing. Her life seems a downward spiral, but we learn that there is an ever-blowing upward current if only she will surrender to it. She knows this, too. Her writing is honest and courageous, chronicling her slow surrender to a life of faith, and detailing her devastating struggles to cease a life of drugs, alcohol, and sex.Her journey is our journey. Change the location. Change the choices. Change the reflections. Change the steps to grace. It doesn't matter. It is a journey we all must make.We feel this book deeply. We travel with Lamott and urge her on. We understand. We know the sustenance through challenge that raising a child involves; we know the healing balm of true friendship; we know the heavenly lift of Christian fellowship, and we know that torment of being authentic to oneself. Her unadorned, honest writing shines light on understanding and growth. Sometimes what we see is not pretty, but we know it's real."},{"Title":"TRAVELING MERCIES. SOME THOUGHTS ON FAITH.","review":"I had mixed feelings about this book. I appreciate her honesty and her humor, and the fact that she is not afraid to be real, warts and all. I appreciate how far she has come to arrive at a real faith in God, considering her background. However, I feel that in some areas she has merely put a spiritual veneer over some of the beliefs that were formed in her during her radical, drug- and alcohol-fueled past, and it is my belief she needs to re-examine some of those values in the light of biblical Christianity. As an evangelical Christian, I am open to learning from almost anyone as long as I exercise enough discernment to &quot;eat the meat and spit out the bones.&quot; Anne Lamott needs to use that same type of judgement, and to learn to seek guidance from other areas than the liberal wing of &quot;Christianity&quot;."},{"Title":"TRAVELING MERCIES. SOME THOUGHTS ON FAITH.","review":"While we read this book \\"Traveling Mercies,\\" without consciousness we find ourselves we give ourselves up to description of Anne Lamott reluctant but honest journey into faith. With sharp and bittersweet humor, Lamott reflects a past bad relationships with men, with drugs, with alcohol, and worst of all in all her life. This book has framework of a daily story about how she comes closer to God through her whole life from young girl to now: one of her best Catholic friend in young age, good memory of church, father's hatred to Christians, her English teacher Sue's born-again Christian, beginning to worship with her Jewish friends, especially learning Kierkegaard's Fear and Trembling, death of her beloved father and friend Pammy, shouting \\"help me\\" because of sickness, loving singing, conversion, and so on. All these stories give her to follow God while ups and downs.We also live following not our own way not God's way. We live for our pleasure. After reading this book, however, what I find that even though Lamott lives like this way, she tries to pray everything which seems even trivial. That is to say that she shows what faith is and how it can be grown through struggle between her everyday life and faith. We can reflect our life just as she did while reading this book.Quick read and helpful! Recommend."},{"Title":"TRAVELING MERCIES.

At the time, I dismissed it as a legitimate literary technique, like hyperbole. In Bird By Bird, at least, she communicated some important truths about writing. However, in Travelling Mercies, Lamott really cranks up the petulancy in her voice. After a while, her self-absorbed whining grated on my nerves so much that I couldn't finish the book. What did it for me was the chapter in which she despises the mother of one of her son's classmates essentially because she is competent at parenting her child. After listening to a litany of immature criticisms of this women's alleged faults, and giving testament to her own inadequacy as parent, she finally realizes at the end of the chapter that she's been a jerk. Well, I could have told her that after only the first few paragraphs! I didn't find the voice she used humorous or insightful at all. It was narcissistic and unenlightened, and was not a voice that I expected to find in a book that purports to have something relevant to say to me about faith or spirituality."},{"Title":"TRAVELING MERCIES.

The author writes much of history, urban & rural, architecture & locations, plagues & sewage, city limits & elastic boundaries. She quotes Darwin & Whitman, mayors & statisticians & the quiet, unassuming rescuers of the lost, beaten & bruised city wildlife.Consider the billions of migrating birds that rush over North America twice a year, seeking breeding grounds & winter homes ... you can stand on Wall Street in the wee hours & listen to the migrants calling, faint & high, as they stream above the sleeping city.Very, very well done - you should give yourself a treat & buy this one for your city nights will never be the same after you've spent a few hours with Anne Matthews on her walkabouts during her Wild Nights."},{"Title":"Wild Nights: Nature Returns to the City","review":"This is very rewarding nonfiction...it makes you laugh AND think. The writing is excellent: fact made poetry. Having sources at the end seems OK...especially since this is a book that gets better and better (though considerably darker) as it proceeds. The stories about animals in the city are charming, but what stays with you are the long-term implications of nature's return to our overconfident world."},{"Title":"Wild Nights: Nature Returns to the City","review":"People who may dislike this book, but should read it anyway:Real-estate developers. Self-satisfied urbanites, suburbanites, and exurbanites. Anyone who doesn't believe in global warming. Anyone who thinks nature is boring--or predictable.People who will truly enjoy &quot;Wild Nights&quot;:Anyone who appreciates literate, deft nonfiction. Anyone who loves nature--yet knows that nature may not necessarily love us. Anyone interested in seeing the world's greatest city through a new lens. Anyone fascinated by how the past and the present intertwine. Anyone who worries about what kind of world we may be leaving our children and grandchildren."},{"Title":"Wild Nights: Nature Returns to the City","review":"I found this book to be a wonderful introduction to an important issue--the inexorable return of nature to our comfortable and often clueless urbanized/suburbanized lives. Matthews uses New York as an example, and does so in ways that charm and alarm. Her accounts of towerkill on Wall Street, peregrine life in midtown, horseshoe crabs in Brooklyn, the uptown Feast of Saint Francis, the environmental history of New York City, and the quest to reclaim Penn Station from the Jersey swamps are particularly well-done.But I found the book as a whole both perceptive and fair, as well as being extremely well-written: for instance, she offers a number of predictions about city futures, but makes it clear that the actual future will almost certainly surprise us--and in perhaps unpleasant ways. &quot;Wild Nights&quot; manages to delight and instruct, but never preaches or gets self-righteous, simply lays out the current arguments and invites you to make up your own mind. Once you finish &quot;Wild Nights&quot; (IF you read it carefully, and with an open heart and mind) you will never look at a city, any city, the same way again. The author's funny, angry vision of what we have done to ourselves made me think of &quot;Silent Spring&quot;--another book that made a great many people with cherished agendas and preconceptions intensely angry and defensive, but proved, in the end, all too accurate."},{"Title":"Wild Nights: Nature Returns to the City","review":"Reader Kaplan is much mistaken. &quot;Wild Nights&quot; is not a tour book, not a field guide, but literary journalism of a very high order: original, scrupulous, informed, and moving, a skillful blend of environmental history, public policy, natural observation, and poetry. Anne Matthews' surface topic is the increasing presence of nature in greater New York and other cities, but her subtext, always, is the future of urban civilization. &quot;Wild Nights&quot; is a brilliant complement to her two previous books, &quot;Where the Buffalo Roam&quot; and &quot;Bright College Years,&quot; both also studies of American places undergoing rapid yet largely misunderstood change. I read Matthews with enormous pleasure, assign her books to my students, and put her on the same pedestal as John McPhee, Joan Didion, Tom Wolfe, Annie Dillard, and other great contemporary nonfiction writers."},{"Title":"Wild Nights: Nature Returns to the City","review":"This is definitely a book about nature for people who think they can't stand nature prose. Not at all sentimental, wonderfully written, full of startling facts, 'Wild Nights' is a lovely and terrifying portrait of the wild New York hiding in plain sight. The last chapter makes me want to move out of the city immediately--but where? As Matthews reminds us, nature was here first, we've pushed it much too hard, and now it's pushing back, globally, locally. Hard as it is for our species to accept, nature always wins."},{"Title":"Wild Nights: Nature Returns to the City","review":"The Boston Globe review of this book is posted at : http://www.dianamuir.com/default/BG062201.html"},{"Title":"Wild Nights: Nature Returns to the City","review":"I was engrossed with the facts and thrilled by the many directions of the witty style of Anne Matthews and found \\"Wild Nights\\" thoroughly entertaining and very informative. And, having lived in \\"Gotham\\", I can attest to the accuracy of much of the content. It's thought provoking how much is missed when we don't remember to reflect on the sequence of events. Anne Matthews has captured a linear progression of history, natural and other, and displayed it interestingly. One star omitted due to the last chapter's jaunt to Armageddon."},{"Title":"Wild Nights: Nature Returns to the City","review":"What I liked: There were many interesting stories about how human society and wildlife have interacted over time. There's the guy who catches falcons on New York sky-scrapers, in order to tag and track them, or the folks intrepidly searching for bits of an old railroad station where they've been dumped in the New Jersey Meadowlands.What annoyed me were the wild, almost hysterical visions of potential dystopian nightmares of what may happen to cities, particularly New York, and humankind at large, in the near future. While I personally found the claims plausible and interesting, I was frustrated at the utter lack of any annotation to back them up.After recently reading some hard-hitting, well-researched, and utterly fascinating commentaries on the modern world economy: Eric Schlosser's &quot;Fast Food Nation&quot; and Naomi Klein's &quot;No Logo,&quot; both of which present a well organized stream of thought-provoking claims, backed by footnotes, Anne Matthew's novel felt like listening to a well-read savant rambling on, at random, about how interesting her life's work is to her, at least. The sort of person you politely listen to rant away, take a few interesting scraps down to carry with you, and then politely disengage yourself from. In short, she's better heard in the occasional segment on NPR than in an entire novel.The book feels like the product of a researcher who has slapped together bits and pieces of personal notes as they came to her, with no thought towards editing them together or cross-referencing them with source material, in order to push through to the publisher to meet a deadline.... and yes, this book is totally New York-centric, to an annoyingly exlusionary degree; I'll be gifting mine to a cute NYU student as a gift."},{"Title":"Wild Nights: Nature Returns to the City","review":"From coast to coast with most of the concentration in New York, Anne takes us on a journey into the lives and habits of a more knowledgeable and sophisticated animal world within our cites. Just like humans, the urban animal in a lot of cases, has adapted to the helter-skelter urban enviornment; and in some cases better than humans have.A wonderful read in language most of us can understand, this book flows from man's early mistakes to the animal's amazing solutions.The next time we look out of the bus or elevated train window on our way to work, and see that Sparrow or crow fighting the family pet for the dog food, we'll know what an alternate food source means.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Wild Nights: Nature Returns to the City","review":"This book argues that changes in legislation and everyday life have enabled certain species to make a comeback, even in the ur-city, New York City. There is a mixture of tones here, from a celebration of the comeback to a sounding the alarm over other species. Both are justified, although it comes as somewhat of a surprise when the tone does switch, which it does the most in the apocalyptic last chapter. I was fine with the content of that chapter - I mean, I'd rather not it didn't happen, but I'm not in denial of climate change - but the tone was so different from the rest of the book that it was jarring.Overall, I enjoyed this book, although I found it to be like a series of articles that don't necessarily intersect with each other. They are very interesting articles, though, the kind you think about for quite a while afterwards.I am disturbed that, according to other reviewers, material was taken from other works without attribution. It seems that a section giving future readings or something of the sort would have been more fair. In particular, I must admit that the section on the search for Penn Station in the Meadowlands was the most interesting in the book, but then it cut off before we find out if they've found the main statutes they were looking for. It turns out that we were to read the search as a metaphor for loss and time. That was a bit frustrating.It was striking to me how much the World Trade Center came up in the book. There was something sad about her vision of it being the last to fall as the glaciers retook Manhattan.Overall, this is a book worth reading, but it doesn't need to be at the absolute top of your list."},{"Title":"Wild Nights: Nature Returns to the City","review":"As an avid reader of books focusing on the political, cultural and environmental life of New York City, I was excited at the prospect of purchasing &quot;Wild Nights.&quot;However, upon taking a brief read of the book, I got the distinct impression that I'd read it before! And as a matter of fact, I had four years ago: &quot;Wild New York&quot; by Margaret Mittlebach and Michael Crewdson.And just judging by a cursory reading of Ms. Matthew's book, I would imagine she's read it as well. Now, to be sure, I am not accusing her of plagarism. However, I do feel that her book is a rather artless, plodding retread of ground covered in Ms. Mittlebach's and Mr. Crewdson's lively and engaging exploration of the city's geographic history.Not to say that Ms. Matthew's book isn't comprehensive, it just isn't necessary."},{"Title":"Wild Nights: Nature Returns to the City","review":"[N]ature's agenda never changes. It will take over, if it can. -Anne Matthews, Wild NightsThis is an always fascinating, frequently funny, but ultimately somewhat disingenuous and hysterical look at the renewed interaction between Man and Nature in urban areas generally and in New York City in particular. From peregrine falcons making their aeries on skyscrapers to coyotes on the Major Deegan to West Nile Virus in mosquitos to zebra mussels in our waterways, Anne Matthews examines the various ways in which flora, fauna, viruses and climate are impacting the modern urban society in unexpected and frequently dangerous ways.Much of the pleasure in the book lies in just finding out the incredibly varied species which have returned to the Big Apple, and from the substantial proof this offers of Nature's fundamental resiliency. Less satisfactory is her analysis of why this resurgence of the wild world is occurring and her failure to recognize how easily it could be reversed. For the most part, Matthews falls back on such environmentalist stand-bys as limitations on pesticide use, disruption of natural habitat and the like. But the most likely cause goes unmentioned : Man has basically stopped killing these creatures, and so they are ever more prevalent and brazen. The DDT ban has of course had an impact, just not the one she's talking about. With the publication of Rachel Carson's scare-mongering bestseller, Silent Spring (see Orrin's review), government reacted by both limiting the use of chemicals to kill pests and by protecting &quot;endangered&quot; species. It can therefore come as no surprise that there are more bugs, many laden with disease, and more animals, than there were forty years ago. Even if we don't dismiss the possibility that there were beneficial effects from the pesticide limitations, ask yourself a simple question : if you let people hunt and trap peregrine falcons and coyotes again, how many would there be in New York City at the end of the month ?Though she never approaches this topic directly, Matthews periodically touches on it when she's tossing statistics around. For instance, the U.S. deer population is now over 20 million, higher than it was when Europeans got here. Or again, when Massachusetts banned the trapping of beavers, their numbers skyrocketed from 18,000 to 55,000. Gee, no kidding ? It can hardly be coincidental that the explosive growth of these populations has paralleled the restriction of hunting and trapping.For the most part, the return of American wildlife has been handled up until now as a feel good story in the national media. After all, it's pretty hard at first glance to feel anything but satisfaction at having &quot;saved&quot; Bambi, and it was easy for the, as Ms Matthews notes, predominantly urban citizenry to ignore the consequences when they were mostly being felt in rural areas. But now it's not just the yokels who are being killed in collisions with deer, elk and moose, nor just farmers who have to worry about the predations of wolves, bear, and coyotes. Now all of these critters are tying up city traffic, colliding with yuppies cars, damming up urban waterways, killing pigeons in front of office workers and housewives, and suddenly, we've got a &quot;crisis.&quot; It used to be said that a conservative was a liberal who'd been mugged. Today, a hunting advocate is an environmentalist who's had his car destroyed and his life nearly lost, when two hundred pounds of deer or a couple tons of moose came rocketing up his hood and through the windshield. That makes the problem personal in a hurry.Since Man crawled from the muck, he has had but one goal, to vanquish and control Nature. But in recent years, sentiment and political correctness have made Man a neutral in this battle, if not an actual collaborator with the enemy. Anne Matthews amply demonstrates the degree to which Nature has taken advantage of this one-sided truce. What's lacking here though is a realization that this state of affairs is unlikely to continue. Every Biff and Muffy in Westchester County may support the idea of reintroducing wolves out West, but when those deer in their backyards are carrying ticks with Lyme Disease and when those wolves start bringing down the family dogs, it seems extraordinarily unlikely that the Natural world will be able to maintain its current sacrosanct status. And when the local beaver turn the neighborhood into a government protected wetland, driving property values into the dumpster, government officials won't be able to repeal such regulations fast enough.Projecting endlessly burgeoning animal populations adds drama to the story she has to tell, but Matthews decision to do so seems rather shortsighted. Similarly, in her final chapter, she takes the most extreme global warming predictions and forecasts a future for New York, and the planet, that is so dire that it's just not believable, with continually rising temperatures and ocean levels and declining air quality standards. This overreach is too bad, because up until then she does a nice job of balancing the amusement provided by and the dread inspired by the renewed confrontation of Man and Nature. But, in these closing pages she goes way over the top, on the basis of fairly sketchy evidence.On balance, it's a very entertaining book. Matthews at least raises a number of issues which are destined to consume public attention in the coming years and does so with an observant eye and great good humor.GRADE : B"},{"Title":"Wild Nights: Nature Returns to the City","review":"Wild Night is a retread of previous work about nature in the metropolitan area, including The Meadowlands (Robert Sullivan) and Wild New York (Margaret Mittlebach and Michael Crewdson).

And she doesn't even credit Sullivan in the acknowledgements. She also never mentions Wild New York, which she obviously used as a source.

Nolan's sentence was to have his wish fulfilled. For fifty-five years he was kept at sea, being repeatedly transferred from ships that approached land to those that were headed out to sea. Although Nolan was not treated like a prisoner, a unique protocol was developed that kept him from hearing or seeing any news from home.Because of obscure references (especially early in the story) and some archaic wording, reading the story aloud is recommended. This provides an excellent opportunity to demonstrate that much can be gleaned from a story even when references are not completely understood. Pausing periodically to summarize the main points can help to keep students involved until you get to Hale's anecdotes that will truly captivate them.In addition to delineating the consequences of an impetuous act, &quot;The Man Without a Country&quot; provides a thought-provoking portrait of a patriot. In essays or debates students might consider Was Nolan's sentence fair? Should he have been pardoned?"},{"Title":"Man Without a Country (Regents readers)","review":"I can't believe the reader from Allentown didn't care for this book.

It makes you proud to be an American and live under the glory that our forefathers fought for.

The poignancy of this consequence through his long years of exile/imprisonment on U.S. ships crescendoes to the denoument, when the evidence of Nolan's encounter with what he had lost is described.

The book was just as I remembered it. However, with a greater understanding of the world, I have learned to appreciate this classic even more. While an American may not agree with that the United States does, a perfect country or government has yet to be created. Philip Nolan made a statement in which he disowned his country in his younger days. It was a statement that he would quitely regret for the rest of his life. Even in exile, Nolan reflects loyalty to his country in his behavior. On his death bed, Nolan only wants to learn of what has happened to the country since he was exiled. He was able to die a happy man knowing how the country he loved had prospered.The story is intended to made readers appreciate their country.

I wish I may never hear of the United States again!\\" The court sentenced him to what he wished for.(As the plot unfolds, some young readers -- future attorneys, perhaps -- focus on the irregularity and inhumanity of the sentence. Of course, there was no Philip Nolan, and the entire plot is fiction, a vehicle used by Hale to prompt reflection on the meaning of \\"country\\" in every person's life.)This story was read by every American high school student from the time it was published in 1863 to the 1960s. The availability of many old editions from used booksellers gives testimony to its enduring power over the years. It surely helped form the patriotic sense of the World War II and Vietnam generations.A few years ago, I was with a group of American missionaries in Bangladesh, and in a relaxed discussion about what we had read in high school, hardly anyone remembered \\"Thanatopsis\\" (by William Cullen Bryant), \\"Great Expectations\\" (Charles Dickens), \\" or \\"Evangeline\\" (Henry Wadsworth Longfellow) -- all staples of our generation's high school canon.

It is \\"accessible,\\" by which I mean that young minds can easily follow the plot and understand Hale's point.

It is one of the few books that were required reading that I never forgot. I am reading this book again for the first time since grade school. I feel that this book should once again become required reading for schools.

In the course of his wandering and through the many lonely years his longing for his country and his love for it becomes apparent. The great poem of Scott which he keeps in his heart and mind says it all for him ' Breathes there a man with soul so dead / who never to himself hath said/ this is my own , my native land/ Whose heart hath ne'er within him burned as home his footsteps he hath turned/ from wandering on a foreign strand/ If there such breeds / Mark him well/ For him no minstrel rapture swells/ High though his title/ Proud his name/ Boundless his wealth as wish could claim/ Despite these titles / power and pelf/ The wretch concentred all in self/ Living forfeit fair renown/ and Dying doubly shall go down/ To the vile dust/ From whence he sprung / Unwept, unhonored and unsung.Philip Nolan sings the song of his own ignominy , repents , and shows his great love for his country.As a child in school this book moved me very deeply. It is a true American classic. And it teaches the meaning and value of a patriotism which is not the refuge of scoundrels, but rather a genuine reflection of love of one's own native land and home."},{"Title":"Man Without a Country (Regents readers)","review":"Hale gives us a small but powerfull treatise on patriotism here.A reminder that as Americans we can't abandon our beautiful land.My father once mentioned this story during one of our conversations and it struck me funny that he would know of this since he was not a big reader and I couldn't help but think that for him to remember it, it must have left a lasting and powerful image on him.I never read it in school and I now find it odd that it is not required reading but should be.Yes I know all the current troubles we are having with the alleged war with Iraq and all the other never ending Middle East garbage we have had to contend with lately but trust me, this will pass.I can only hope that we turn inward and try to fix our own problems instead of trying to fix everyone else's.This book concerns one Phillip Nolan, who turns his back on America and who pays the price of living without her for the rest of his life via an intricate method devised to keep any and all reference or news about America from him.His misery is palpable and he realizes just what an error in judgement he brought down upon his being as he is not only viewed as an outcast to be shunned but as a traitor,a fate most unpleasant.Kept at sea,transfered from ship to ship before reaching sight of land permenently kept him isolated and imbedded the feeling of isolation to an almost unbearable degree.His last days of longing for any news about America no matter how small or insignificant brings a sympathetic mate to his side but even then information is not brought forth without disregard to the initial nature of the crime and is delivered in metered amounts.If your patriotism ever weakens, read this book. Its brief, but imparts a strong message to us.We must always stand together in times of war and peace.America is the best country in the world despite world opinion.The deep, psychological punishment inflicted on Nolan can only serve to remind us what life would be like without our country even with all her imperfections.She is still the best the world has to offer as far as freedom and opportunity are concerned.Why would everyone be trying to get in as opposed to out.This little gem of a story makes plain why we need to stand together as Americans, more now than ever and should be read by every American both old and new."},{"Title":"Living at Nature's Pace: Farming and the American Dream","review":"Gene Logsdon, The Contrary Farmer, is that rare prolific writer who continues to delight me with the breadth of his subject knowledge. He knows modern American farm life as it really is, not only its hard-wrought joy but its deep, dark underbelly. Here he exposes the sad facts of crop subsidies and their effect on people who before political propaganda and intervention had the common sense to farm on a family scale and enjoyed the satisfaction that derived therefrom. Tractors that cost more than a farm should cost. Soil death by toxic chemicals and erosion. The criminal collusion (my words, not Logsdon's) of land grant agriculture colleges, equipment companies, chemical companies and politicians. The stupidity of laws that put Amish minister Henry Hershberger in jail for building a superior house but without a permit because of his religious beliefs. Logsdon also shows what works. The Kemp farm of Jerusalem, Ohio, with only 140 acres but a carefully built herd of cows whose pedigree commands value nationwide. A Berkeley, California, \\"farm\\" of one-third acre that grosses more than $300,000. The Amish farmers, whose success embarrasses agribusiness practitioners. Logsdon cares about people and nature. He is mad as hell and speaks plainly. He also has vision. \\"If we want to remake an agriculture that is technically correct for sustainability, we must make sure it is also culturally correct, or the effort will not succeed.\\""},{"Title":"Living at Nature's Pace: Farming and the American Dream","review":"This book introduced me to Logsdon work. I've since read it over several times. He speaks what he thinks with no varnish of correctness. Incredibly refreshing these days. Covers apsects of rural society in the modern world. For an outsider that wishes to gain some perspective on the &quot;problem&quot; and the promise of rural America this is a great place to start and finish up."},{"Title":"Living at Nature's Pace: Farming and the American Dream","review":"The volume titled \\"At Nature's Pace\\" is an earlier edition of the better-known one released several years later, with a half-dozen or so additional essays, under the title \\"Living at Nature's Pace.\\" Not having read the latter yet, I can't comment on what the extra essays added to the ones originally collected. But I can say that I'm definitely looking forward to reading them.Gene Logsdon is, in his way, just as \\"revisionist\\" as many of the historians I've found myself reading lately. He challenges many of the orthodoxies of the \\"farm crisis\\" we city folk have been hearing about for decades, arguing that in fact most of the farms succumbing to economic pressure are large-scale \\"factory farms\\" that have been uneconomically overextended from the very beginning. Small, family-owned farms that resist the lure of going into debt to purchase more land, more chemicals, and more expensive machinery tend, he argues, to do just fine. Logsdon's prime example of this is the Amish farms of his native Ohio, whose owners have grown positively rich (especially by their own standards) by keeping their farms to manageable size.Another of Logsdon's key points, especially worth thinking about, concerns the misleading nature of economic calculation as it is frequently applied to farming. Is raising livestock, as well as crops, and using the manure to fertilize your fields a cost, or a cost-savings, relative to using expensive chemicals? What is the value of working with your family on a small farm versus hiring hands to work a larger one? Logsdon raises many questions about \\"cost\\" versus \\"value\\" that are worth contemplating, even by those of us in the suburbs.The book begins with contrary, sometimes (by his own admission) angry essays about the economics of farming and the general uselessness of university agricultural-education programs. But they soon transition into portrayals of farming life that are both idyllic (in the original sense) and subtly instructive. The three closing essays (\\"closing\\" in this edition; they're toward the middle in \\"Living at Nature's Pace\\"), \\"A Woodcutter's Pleasures,\\" \\"The Pond at the Center of the Universe,\\" and \\"My Wilderness,\\" are all deeply moving.This was my first exposure to Gene Logsdon's work, but it definitely won't be my last. I'm planning on tracking down his many other titles as well. As a third (or more) generation child of the suburbs, my connection to the farm is somewhat attenuated. But Logsdon's writing makes me feel closer to it nonetheless, and it's a feeling I find myself really appreciating."},{"Title":"Living at Nature's Pace: Farming and the American Dream","review":"Gene Logsdon, writing from anger and experience, has put together a collection of poignant, and persistent essays. His discomfort follows you long after you have envisioned a strip of grains from the midwest to Florida, the workings of dung beetles, and the mission of the &quot;contrary farmer.&quot; Logsdon gives insight into the weaknesses of industrial agriculture and how its woes are most painfully obvious in rural communities. Such a reasonable subject is rarely taken on so furiously and so well...Logsdon has become a spokesman worthy of friend Wendell Berry's praise as the finest of the farmer essayists."},{"Title":"Living at Nature's Pace: Farming and the American Dream","review":"If you've never read any of Gene Logsdon's work best not start with this book. However if you are familiar with the author then this book will become a frequent resource for anyone with an active interest in small scale agriculture."},{"Title":"Living at Nature's Pace: Farming and the American Dream","review":"I have to say that for the few weeks it took me to read the book (on and off) it really did help to pull me away from the day to day grind of life. I didnt agree with every syllable written, but it didnt stop me from enjoying the book. It seemed like I enjoyed this book a little better than \\"The Contrary farmer\\".Overall, I think the author is very talented and really knows how to bring his real life situations and scenarios to the page. I really do dream of the day I can make some his descriptions an every day reality for me and my family. So, thank you for that Mr. Logsdon. Its much appreciated."},{"Title":"Living at Nature's Pace: Farming and the American Dream","review":"This book compares modern farming practices with traditional Amish and sustainable farming methods. Due to the authors use of personal observation and interviews of both types of farmers, this is an interesting read. This book is as entertaining as it is educational, a top read."},{"Title":"Arctic Climate Impact Assessment - Scientific Report.","review":"This book combines scientific knowledge with the indigenous prospective/observations about climate change and the Arctic."},{"Title":"Histopathology Reporting: Guidelines for Surgical Cancer","review":"The Histopathology Reporting \\"Guidelines\\" by Derek C. Allen combines the sixth edition of the TNM classification with a very condensed \\"memory-aid\\" for the most common types of Surgical Malignancies.The latter is the main difference from the \\"AJCC Cancer Staging Atlas,\\" while the physical format of the book is similarly practical, most schematic drawings are the same.In contrast to other \\"desk references\\" used in daily surgical pathology practice (eg. Lester's Manual of Surgical Pathology), Allen's book provides essential bullet points by organ/site and explains, when necessary, why these are pertinent for the final report (by means of staging, treatment, and prognosis).The book includes the differential diagnosis and variants (by site) as well as an algorithm for immunostaining. The 470 pages are divided into an average of 15 pages per organ/site which can be easily managed during the work-up of a case or preview time.Non-neoplastic disease is not included in the book(let), even though correct and complete histopathology reporting is also necessary in benign diseases. Therefore this book alone cannot be used as the single resource at the microscope. This is however, not a problem, as the book is not meant to do so, and appears well rounded, focused and \\"complete\\".The paper quality is worth the price (by the way).If you write a book on histopathology reporting and use the word \\"cancer\\" in the subtitle, pathologists cringe. However this adds irony....If you are looking for a quick read on surgical malignancy, want to know how a report should be structured, and need a handy reference beside your scope for quick look-up, you need this book."},{"Title":"Draven's Defiance (Passages Series #5)","review":"This is a great retelling of the story of elijah and Elisha.

The story of a young man named Scott who found himself in the world you probably already know a little about, since you're looking up this book: Marus.Confused and bewildered, he joins company with Draven, an individual who bears the mark of one chosen by the Unseen One as His servant: eyes of two different colors.Scott eventually learns from Draven that, by the power of the Unseen One, judgment has been handed out on Marus in the form of time standing still. It is Perpetually Autumn, grass does not grow, people do not age. It is judgment against the apostate leader, Mobeck, and his wicked queen Skalaw. Scott finds himself headed, along with Draven, for a showdown with the corrupt leaders to vie for the hearts of the peoples of Marus. Will Scott join with Draven's Defiance?Another very enjoyable tale about the fictional world of Marus, weaved by Adventures in Odyssey's Paul McCusker. It tells the Biblical story of Elijah in a refreshing way, a new environment that makes the story come to life anew. There's a few new spins on this story (Draven escapes with Scott on a motorcycle, and the judgment handed out is different from the God's No-Rain judgment in the Bible. A famine, however is a consequence of time standing still)Another great read by the same great author, and I consider it worth the money.

It doesn't matter whether you have a big name publisher or are self-published, you need to promote and market your book. One of the biggest parts of my book proposal for Blogging for Business was on marketing/promotion and certainly a good part of why the publisher liked it.Also, a book is not a be all and end all. It won't make you rich. It probably won't even make you much money from book sales, but the \\"expert status\\" gained, sales of additional services (consulting, speaking, etc.), and related information products can make it very worthwhile. Guerrilla Marketing explains this all in a simple to comprehend and digest format.The \\"weapons\\" are really in two categories, at least in my mind. Things to do, such as press releases, webcasts, email signatures, surveys, strategic allegiances, media kits, and things to motivate and think about, such as your enthusiasm, your professionalism, etc. I found both categories useful. Obviously not everyone will find all the weapons appropriate for them, but certainly enough to make spending the time being amused while reading this book worthwhile.I finished this book a couple of weeks ago, and it's sitting on my nightstand.

The authors have very inaccurate assumptions about exactly how much a publisher is willing to work with a new writer and how little negotiation power the new writer has. They repeatedly suggest that you attempt to negotiate things which no publisher will negotiate with a new writer and therefore place you at risk of looking unprofessional. They suggest you ask the publisher to print your business cards or post cards (for free) on any \\"extra space\\" which they may have when printing your book cover, and if they don't go for that, offer to split the cost. They suggest purchasing Email lists for spamming, and even suggest wearing a sandwich board to advertise your book on the streets and then calling the local news to have yourself on TV.They constantly assume that you're a writer writing a fast buck type of non-fiction book or some sort of shoddy self-help book which can be peddled on TV and in junk mailings like snake oil. Many of the things they suggest are exactly the sort of things you see on TV at 3:00 AM during paid programming and should be avoided by serious writers with any sense of dignity. Never once do they assume you write for any other reason than simply making money and they seem to think every book can be tied into some sort of regime of seminars. They also love to cite undocumented statistics such as \\"76 percent of what appears in newspapers originates with publicists\\" and \\"The San Francisco Chronicle receives fifteen thousand books a year\\".

Apart from their status as European countrymen, it was the fortuitous confluence of guns, microbes and steel technology which all but ensured their success at colonizing regions occupied by peoples who lacked such historical fulcrums. It should be unsurprising, given this lethal mixture of offense, why invading states comprised of so few have been able to conquer, kill or otherwise displace indigenous societies comprised of so many. These asymmetrical collisions suffuse human history, and it's no secret that its retelling lends specific favor to Eurasian societies rather than those of other landmasses.In Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies, Jared Diamond, author of The Third Chimpanzee, seeks to answer why history unfolded so differently among the various continents. Not contented with the proximate explanations listed above, Diamond forages deeper to uncover the ultimate explanations of why some societies procured that fateful triumvirate of factors and why others did not. Explicitly then, why does history record Francisco Pizarro and his confederates storming the Incan Empire and capturing Emperor Atahuallpa in that momentous 1532 collision at Cajamarca instead of Atahuallpa and his band of warriors sailing east, assaulting the Spanish Empire and seizing King Charles I? Which initial conditions facilitated the depopulation of so much of the New World by so few of the Old World?Traditional solutions to these questions often involve genetic or innate differences in race and intelligence among disparate populations, and it is these traditional explanations which Diamond hopes to sweep away. With a starting point of the tail end of the last ice age circa 13,000 years ago, Diamond takes a holistic approach to deconstructing the broad patterns of history. This is no picnic of a task. As Diamond himself points out, compressing 13,000 years of nuanced history into roughly 400 pages works out to \\"an average of about one page per continent per 150 years, making brevity and simplification inevitable\\" (408).To Diamond's great credit, Guns, Germs, and Steel represents the metamorphosis of a topic of impenetrable scope into a cohesive, persuasive and not overly prolix piece of historical literature. He begins by surveying the natural differences among the continents, noting the variations in ecological and biological diversity as well as the orientations of the main axes of the continents, all of which had deep import for the evolution of complex human societies, namely the divergence of larger food-producing cultures from smaller bands of hunter-gatherers.As it turns out, the last ice age played a significant role in the course of this progression. Compared with all other natural disasters, ice ages tend to have the most severe and lasting effects on the planet, dramatically disrupting not only climate but the chain of animal and plant life struggling to survive there. The Pleistocene ice age drove countless of the planet's large mammals to extinction, especially those indigenous to North America and Australia. Europe and Asia, on the other hand, suffered fewer local extinction events of their large animal species. This outcome presented more options (a full thirteen of the major fourteen domestic mammals were confined to Eurasia) for animal domestication, defined as the regulation of an animal's breeding and food supply.\\"Thus, part of the explanation for Eurasia's having been the main site of big mammal domestication is that it was the continent with the most candidate species of wild mammals to start with, and lost the fewest candidates to extinction in the last 40,000 years.\\" (163).Of equal importance is the inequality of wild plant species distributed across the global landscape. Here again, Eurasia is lopsidedly advantaged in terms of ecological and topographical diversity. Home to the greatest seasonal variation as well as the largest zones of temperate Mediterranean climate, Eurasia is saturated with the most diverse plant life.\\"The Fertile Crescent and other parts of western Eurasia's Mediterranean zone offered a huge selection to incipient farmers: 32 of the world's 56 prize wild grasses. That fact alone goes a long way toward explaining the course of human history.\\" (139).Diamond discusses in detail the cultural shift from hunting and gathering to food-producing, emphasizing that it was a gradual process. In those environmentally amenable regions of the globe, crop farming and pastoralism offered several benefits over the hunter-gatherer lifestyle - primarily related to time, effort and payout - and precipitated an incremental transition from complete dependence on wild foods to a diet mainly supported by food production. Peoples inhabiting less fortunate regions of the globe either carried on as nomadic hunter-gatherers or were displaced by invading farmers. Australia is perhaps the best example: as the most infertile and biologically most impoverished of the continents, it contained the largest population of hunter-gatherers into the modern era.For all of its benefits, the advent of agriculture around 8500 BC sponsored the most pestilential of side effects: increased human exposure to deadly microbes living inside domesticated animals and plants. Food-producing societies evolved resistances to these pathogens over time, or they were wiped out. First contact with foreign germs can upset the balance of a society more than any other contributing factor, and this is exactly what happened when colonizing food-producing societies encountered natives who did not share their immunities. This was, in fact, the most important factor for each of the major collisions throughout history, including the fall of the millions-strong Aztec Empire by Cortes and his mere 600 men, as well as the greatest population shift in all of human history, the initial 20 million North American Indian peoples being reduced by 95% in a matter of a century as a result of European conquest. In terms of their contribution to human depopulation, germs should clearly precede guns and steel in the book's title.To illustrate the tangential benefits of food production, Diamond enlists the reader on a voyage of deductive reasoning to link the various positive feedback loops, as he calls them. In highly paraphrased form, it is laid out as follows. Whereas the hunter-gatherer existence was nomadic, food-producing gave rise to more sedentary societies. This, combined with the fact that farming created food surpluses, provided for denser human populations. With increases in human populations came greater variety of roles to be filled within the community, facilitating the appearance of social hierarchy and political structure. The more sedentary existence meant more time could be devoted to innovation, and the denser populations meant more people who could potentially craft new metal tools, invent writing systems, and pioneer other technological leaps. This low-res snapshot can hardly do justice to the detail with which Diamond presents the material.In this way, food production served as a springboard for human innovation, which then radiated out to surrounding populations. To Eurasia's benefit again, it is the landmass with the most navigable terrain, easing the spread of agricultural and technological developments.Diamond traces the patterns of history by connecting dominant cultures to the largest environmental palettes of domesticable biota and to the regions most congenial to technological diffusion. Thus while literacy, political organization, firearms, advanced ship technology, and infectious disease are the proximate causes of Pizarro's overthrow of the Incan Empire and Vasco da Gama's success in East Africa, Diamond insists it was their ancestors' enduring success in cultivating the local flora and fauna which sits at the bedrock of history's narrative.As is the case with any work of this breadth, any assumed monolithic pattern is fraught with qualification. Diamond is careful to mention caveats throughout, such as some of the exceptions involved with homogenizing Eurasia into a unified landmass. He notes that food production should not be synonymous with monotonic progression in any one category, referencing the Japanese injunction against firearms and China's decommission of its maritime fleet in past centuries. The many nuances cited throughout are a testament to Diamond's attention to detail and responsible professionalism.FINAL THOUGHTSOne of the most fascinating gifts of history is found in the interactions among past peoples and the ripple effects of those interactions. Guns, Germs, and Steel sits above the vault of human history, providing first-stage explanations to account for its winners and losers. To a great extent, it furnishes a new hermeneutical lens by which to view history, or at the very least a soak test for assessing historical anecdotes. While Diamond was not the first to connect environmental factors to ruling states, Guns, Germs, and Steel is one of the greatest syntheses of the encompassing subject matter compiled to date. He debunks with crack empiricism the alternative hypotheses for history's manifest imbalance of power, leaving a well-reasoned case in their stead.I can only add to the avalanche of praise that has been directed toward this book. It is an academic read, to be sure, but I found it optimally dense so as not to turn away readers less interested in every detail. Some have dispraised Diamond's repetition of common themes, but I personally found this helpful as it allowed the material to ossify more easily in my mind. The book also serves as a model of scientific rigor, as each chapter is fastidiously referenced in the ending bibliography. Guns, Germs, and Steel has forever changed the way I view history and even modern society. If I had my say, this would be standard high school reading across the country. This makes the short list of books which demand to be read at least once. Polymathic in scope, unwavering in its cogency, Diamond has penned a major contribution to our historical understanding which has stood the test of time. I only wished I had read it sooner."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"Wow! So much important and interesting information and so little time! This type of book helps the reader understand the world today, industrialzation, and civilization. J. Diamond did a fantastic job writing this book. - surprisingly easy to read, as it captures your attention and doesn't let go."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"Our ancestral hunter-gatherers had ventured long journey in pursuit of foods. Thinking of the fact our ancestors had created languages, religions, works and laws in the process of their settlement, we are struck with awe to them. Why had certain continents succeeded in establishing civilization earlier and economically outnumbered other areas would be an ultimate question when we looked back the human history. There would be some hidden hints for sustainability of our world and important factors for our future success, which would be also applicable to the modern business world. Jared Diamond views geographical superiority helped in great degree to their dominance and displacing original species. He reinforces his thoughts with various scientific investigations such as meteorology, geography, geology, ethnology, zoology, botany, molecular biology and genetic engineering etc. His field work experience in New Guinea soundly substantiated his theory.A Japanese translated version of this book has been a long-seller among incoming freshmen who want to go over the subject systematically. The number of countries where world history is incorporated into a curriculum is said to be not so many. Japan is one of few countries in which high school students can study this subject. However, average Japanese students think of world history course as secondly to English and mathematics. World history means piled facts of the rise and fall of old nations for them. They are obliged to memorize important events and great persons in charge mechanically to prepare for university entrance examinations of their choice. They are not accustomed to read a book of history written with a certain concept. May be by this background, this book together with \\"a world history\\" by W.H.Mcnill have popularities among university students.He explains domestication and innovation spread out differently in speed between the continents of the east-west axis and the north-south axis. This explanation seems to be unique at first however quite understandable. During the evolution we surely have lost traditional knowledge about biological characteristics, distribution and potential uses and have became mere supermarket shoppers fully dependent on domesticated plants and animals. His indication of week point to men of today stirs uneasiness about our survivability in the unsecured era. The optimal fragmentation principle introduced in this book would be receptive to the business world. Industries and companies are struggling to find suitable size in organization, sales and share for the spur of the innovation. This book certainly gives us a hint for this.The chapter attracted my interest mostly is naturally his consideration about the origin of Japanese people. Relations with Korea, China and Russia become strained recently. As he says, if we cannot find better way to settle the territory issue, it bodes ill for the future of not only East Asia but also the whole world. The other important fact we should not forget is Japan belongs to geographically advantaged areas, though we have scarce natural resources of our needs. We should not commit ecological suicide by destroying this gift on us."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"Guns, Germs and Steel is an engaging read with a provocative thesis.

Which is a shame, because this book is very, very good."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"I think I admire the intentions of this book more than the actual book itself. Diamond's injection of large amounts of scientific data and rationale into a historical consideration of civilizational rise and decline is a sincere effort to wrestle history away from both overt and nascent attempts to explain disperate civilzations' differences and perceived lack of 'equality' in terms of cultural/racial superiority. One of his intentions seems to be to try to use hard science as a way of getting at a deeper sort of humanism instead of merely doing away with humanistic history or letting it sit there and conjecture blindly without any recourse to any empirical evidence. More broadly speaking, his longitudnal approach is a genuine attempt to create a disciplinary synthesis between biology, ecology, anthropology, agronomy and history, which is exactly the sort of thing that people like E.O. Wilson have been envisioning for a while but have been too dull and tired to actually try. Good for him. That being said, the book can be kind of a slog. Of course, making the history of things like soy bean cultivation engaging is a challenge for any writer, so that isn't really Diamond's fault. But sometimes his reasoning seems a bit too brittle, too distant and unwilling to really dig in past quoting an impressive litany of information on crop development rates and animal domestication issues. He also tends to repeat himself. A lot. Granted I'm a humanities person through and through so any historical approach which ignores humanistic/cultural perspectives is sort of out of my domain, but I can certainly appreciate using actual science to demolish and dismiss cheaply racist thinking about cultural differences. Like I said, Diamond's intentions are smart and sincere, even if his writing is a bit wooden."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"This book is the long answer the question: Why did the Europeans developed so much technology and conquered the other continents and not the vice versa? Why was it that Europeans and their descendants become to dominate the world instead of native Africans, Americans, Australians, Chinese or New Guineans?The main conclusion was that societies developed differently because of differences in continental environments, not in human technology, centralized political organization, and other features emerge only in dense sedentary populations capable of accumulating --populations that depended for their food on the rise of agriculture B.C. But the domesticable wild plant and animal species essential were distributed very unevenly over the continents. The most species were concentrated in only nine small areas of the globe,homelands of agriculture. The original inhabitants of those homeland got a head start toward developing guns, germs, and steel. The languages inhabitants, as well as their livestock, crops, technologies, and dominant in the ancient and modern world.The main message of the book is that the most of the world's domesticable plants and animals were concentrated to Eurasia giving head start to Eurasia for developing food surplus required for development of complex societies able to support professional armies and inventors bringing technological Eurasia had additional huge advantage over America and Africa being East-West orientation without significant deserts or bottlenecs in between allowing fast spread of new plants and inventions by keeping societes connected.Why Europe, why not China is also answered. Argument is that early integration of whole China under single rule discouraged innovation. Single ruler could stop new invention of being applied (several examples were given), whereas situation in Europe with dozens of independent states virtually guaranteed that one of states implemented any useful invention and if new invention was giving them advantage (like firearms), it quickly spread to neighboring countries. Neighbors either implemented the invention or were promptly conquered by their neighbors.This book is a must read for anyone interested in human history."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"This book tries to explain why the world has come to be dominated by western cultures coming out of Europe. Thankfullly, the reason is not due to racial or genetic sueriority, as some experts have claimed in the past. In fact, according to Diamond, the reason beginins in the prehistory of humans. The most important factors are the physical environment and the availability of easily domesticated plants and animals. Also, Eurasian cultures benefited from an East-West axis, which promoted the spread of agriculture and crops, while other continents suffered from a North-South axis which retarded the spread of crops. Those cultures which had access to these crops and a good environment to grow them in could increase their food production and population which in turn led to the development of government, writing, and technology.Jared Diamond's background as an evolutionary biologist helps him to see the big picture. He's able to back away from the small details of history which often mislead other researchers. I'm particularly interested in his idea that opportunity, not race or culture, was the prime derterminant in the rise of western culture. My only complaint is that at times it seems that Diamond is repeating himself. Perhaps if the editing had been a little tighter, he could have cut this book by about 25 to 30 pages. Anyway, it's just a small complaint. Overall this is an excellent book with some great ideas."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"This book is very well written and presents quite a few interesting facts about different cultures around the world. It also presents some very good arguments as to how technology and society developed in different regions of the globe. However, the author did not completely convince me of his viewpoints. In any case it is an interesting book and well worth the time I took to read it."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"This book was a very interesting read; it attempts to explain what basic factors lead to the various ultimate factors which caused Western civilization to dominate the world. Much of what he said are things that is pretty much common knowledge, such as the role of disease in the destruction of Native American cultures. Diamond also takes it further, and further explains things that I didn't know, like the specific causes for the buildup of the Eurasian disease pools, and also things that I've never thought about, like which animals lent themselves to domestication (as an example, why Zebras were never turned into pack animals in Africa).The book has flaws though; while it does explain why the Aztecs did not have huge diseases for the Spaniards, and why New Guinea never developed large stratified societies, it doesn't solve the full problem. His explaination of why specifically Western Europe seemed to triumph (and not, say China) was not fully convincing, and almost seems like an afterthought.This book also seems preoccupied by trying to convince the reader that people around the world, say New Guineans, are no less smarter or naturally inventive than Westerners. That particular battle has been won decades ago; being born in the latter half of the 20th century, it simply wouldn't occur to me to think otherwise. As such, his constant reiteration of the obvious grew tiresome after a while."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"Diamond's approach is &quot;big history&quot;.

It is significant to get the overall picture in this important time. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"I have to admit I've never read any other book on this subject and I found it fascinating. Diamond ignores the ideas that certain cultures advanced because they are intellectually superior than others. In fact it is geograpy that in large part determined the course of history. Diamond attempts to answer questions such as why did Europe conquer the Americas instead of the Americas conquering Europe? And why didn't the Chinese colonize America since they were technologically superior to Europe until the 15th century? If you find either of these questions interesting, then you will find this book interesting. Some of the reviewers suggest this is a boring book.

Diamond analyzes several key elements affecting the development of societies, from the axis of the continent to the availability of plants that can be domesticated, and makes it all very interesting. One of the best-researched books on the topic, Diamond still doesn't pretend to have all the answers.Unfortunately, Diamond excessively downplays the role of culture and religeon influencing a society's development in the pursuit of avoiding offending anyone. The explanation of why the Fertile Crescent and China lost technological leads over Europe, a topic that should have been a key component of this book, is treated rather briefly in the final chapter with somewhat cursory analysis. Nevertheless, this book is highly recommended, particularly for laymen on the subject like myself."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"This book is an absolute necessity for any person who values education: science or the humanities.

Most of the detractors points have low merit (and I would think these same reveiwers have spent little time trying to forage for food in the wilderness considering one persons point that &quot;ideas&quot; have more meaning). One point that a reviewer made that I will agree with, is that luck plays a large part in how things turn out.Still, the book could be repetitive, and I don't think it is the final answer to the question set forward... only a very well thought out answer."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"I'm an anthropology major and this book was an amazing summation of everything (and much more) that I have learned about Anthropology and people in all my years at college.

It is the history of the continents, ecological, biological and anthropological. You will learn why the Native Americans didn't conquer Europe, why some people seemed to remain in the &quot;stone age,&quot; while others were experiencing the industrial revolution. Why did some people develope a system of writing, why did some stay in groups of 100, instead of cities of thousands? Was a male or a female the first farmer?

He brings the scientists logic and knowledge to answering the question, why do Eurasians represent the most prosperous, powerful elements of mankind if there is no genetic difference and indeed, as Diamond realizes, if there might actually be stronger genetics in some parts of the world that did not develop as rapidly. His answer is a sweeping review of the rise of agriculture, the nature of disease among large populations, the geographic range of domesticatable large mammals (none in sub-Saharan Africa, only the llama in the New World, none in Australia), and the ability of competitive large populations (made possible by the east-west spread of agricultural and cultural knowledge in Eurasia and blocked from moving north and south through different climate zones in Africa and the New World) to both develop more advanced technologies and to build resistance to communicable diseases. Humans outside Europe and Asia lacked the populations to acquire enough communicable diseases to develop resistance to them, lacked the agricultural knowledge to sustain large enough competitive populations to develop technologies (something which was beginning to be overcome in the New World but in isolated centers in the Andes and the Mexico-Central American centers). This is a book whose reasoning will stretch your mind and insights will lead you to knew thoughts. It is definitely worth reading."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"This is a real tour-de-force. Jared Diamond is one in a million, w/expertise in linguistics, New Guinea, anthropology, evolution and more. Drawing on all of these areas and others, he gives the only convincing explanation I've read of why Eurasian technology &amp; culture have come to dominate the world. For those like me who enjoy reading about natural history, this is a genuinely fascinating book."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"In his preface to the paperback edition, Jared Diamond boldly states, &quot;This book attempts to provide a short history of everybody for the last 13,000 years.&quot; Following this startling statement, he writes, &quot;The question motivating the book is: Why did history unfold differently on different continents?&quot; Keeping these two aims in mind is quite helpful while reading through the book, and I found that while Diamond certainly can't answer all the questions (he doesn't even attempt this), he does suggest many plausible explanations for why history has unfolded like it has (such as advantages of geography, fertility, agriculture vs. hunter-gathering societies, east-west vs. north-south spread of technology and crops etc.) For a different approach that emphasizes culture and economic explanations, try reading David Landes' The Wealth and Poverty of Nations in conjunction with this book.Among the many things I liked about this book were the following: it is extensively researched (as one might expect from a UCLA physiology professor), the style is easy to follow, it is full of photographs, tables, and maps (I'm a big believer that &quot;a picture is worth a thousand words&quot;), and his questions and search for answers are fair minded. Diamond himself would not insist that this book is the &quot;definitive&quot; explanation for our existence, but an attempt to help put pieces of the puzzle together in a coherent fashion (including the often ignored &quot;prehistorical&quot; period that really set the stage for how things turned out in the &quot;historical&quot; period.) This is a splendid book."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"In &quot;Guns, Germs and Steel,&quot; Jared Diamond argues that the Earth's geography has been the sole determining factor in the evolution and development of all the world's civilisations. In particular, Diamond argues that Europeans and Asians came to dominate the world politically and economically due to their favourable geographic circumstances. Diamond asserts that the people of Europe and Asia had the benefits of highly fertile land and animals that could be domesticated, while the native peoples of Africa, the Pacific and the Americas did not have these assets. As a result, Europeans had a &quot;head start&quot; in the development of their civilisation. Having overcome their agrarian problems by 1500, Europeans used their newly developed &quot;guns&quot; and &quot;steel&quot; along with &quot;germs&quot; to dominate the globe. Thus, issues of race and biology do not explain the course of world history. If African tribes had lived in Europe, says Diamond, it would be they, not Europeans, who would dominate the world today.Needless to say, a legion of grateful left-wing scholars and academics labeled Diamond's book a revelation, and a Pulitzer Prize soon followed. Alas. &quot;Guns, Germs and Steel&quot; testifies why nobody should allow literary awards to influence their book-buying habits. Although Diamond's basic thesis does have some validity, he ignores too many important issues that needed to be discussed.Firstly, Diamond's &quot;geographic&quot; theory is neither &quot;original&quot; nor &quot;revolutionary&quot; as so many have claimed. By arguing that all the world's civilisations were dependent on their geography, Diamond is following a line of reasoning that dates back to Marc Bloch and Lucien Febvre's &quot;Annales&quot; school of history. Environmental historians such as Donald Worster have also reiterated the ideas of the &quot;Annales&quot; school in recent times. Diamond certainly recycles these theories admirably enough, but if you are familiar with the work of the above historians, you will find little to appreciate here.Although Diamond's thesis seems coherent enough, much of it is theoretical, and suffers from a lack of concrete evidence to back up his arguments. Instead of material facts, we get highly theoretical &quot;chains of causation&quot; with words such as &quot;surely&quot; and &quot;must have&quot; to provide the connections. One might be able to see how metal implements might develop from fertile lands, but can Newton's theory of Gravitation or Shakespeare's plays be linked directly to the development of metal tools? It is a little difficult to believe.An examination of history also exposes the major flaws of Diamond's case. Between 1500 and 1750, for example, Europe was wracked by continual bouts of famine, disease and economic instability. (See David Fischer &quot;The Great Wave,&quot; Jan De Vries &quot;The Economy of Europe in an Age of Crisis.&quot;) But in spite of these titanic problems, European nations began an unprecedented wave of expansion. In addition, the philosophies that made up The Enlightenment also flourished in this period of economic uncertainty. According to Diamond's thesis, none of this could have happened as European farms at the time were in such a precarious state. The fact that these things did occur strongly suggests that there were other factors at work in the development of European civilisation.By contrast, civilisations in tropical regions had ready access to abundant foodstuffs that could grow easily in such a warm climate. Tribes of native North Americans ranged over land that is now considered the most fertile in the world - and yet, none of these civilisations, despite their favourable geography, progressed as European nations did.Diamond also overlooks important issues such as differing cultural prespectives. Between 1400 and 1600, the European depiction of nature underwent a fundamental change. (See Keith Thomas, &quot;Man and the Natural World,&quot; Michael Adas, &quot;Machines as the Measure of Men.&quot;) In this period, Europeans began to look upon nature as something that must be tamed. Europeans realised that technological innovations could overcome the obstacles of nature and improve lives. Thus, innovation and progress were encouraged by all. By contrast, until the arrival of Europeans, all the other civilisations of the world resigned themselves to the limitations of their environment. African and Pacific civilisations sought to harmonise themselves with nature, rather than try to change it. The people of New Guinea, where Diamond apparently grew up, were no exception to this rule, as Roy Rappaport's &quot;Pigs for the Ancestors&quot; so convincingly shows.Diamond also refuses to take the impact of religion seriously. And yet, the Christian faith, which demanded the &quot;spreading of the gospel&quot; encouraged Europeans to look far afield, while the doctrine of the &quot;civilising mission&quot; was a primary motive for Britain and France in their colonial expansion.Perhaps the overriding problem with &quot;Guns, Germs and Steel&quot; is its political correctness. Human variables such as culture, religion and environmental perspectives have played decisive roles in the development of the world's civilisations. This remains the case today, no matter how politically incorrect it might be to say so. Certainly, geography has played a role in the development of world history, but not to the extent asserted by Diamond. By ignoring the human variables, Diamond has greatly distorted the history of human progress"},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"I found this rather impenetrable book quite a disappointment. Firstly, it is not an easy read. I have never come across any other book making such extensive use of inverted commas. Terms such as &quot;civilisation&quot;, &quot;discovery&quot;, &quot;progress&quot;, &quot;barbarian&quot; and &quot;primitive&quot; are invariably given this syntactically diminishing treatment or are prefixed by &quot;so-called&quot;, whereas dubious and controversial terms such as &quot;racist&quot; and &quot;affirmative action&quot; do not, as if we're expected to take Diamond's assumptions about them at face value.Next, it doesn't live up to its sub-title &quot;A Short History of Everybody for the Last 13,000 Years&quot;. Diamond rather seems to have striven to compile as much political (and politically correct) evidence as possible to explain why European and Asian people had such an apparent head start in the human race. The fact that the Egyptians (Africa) and Olmecs (America) had achieved an astonishingly advanced level of &quot;civilisation&quot; when us Europeans were still &quot;barbarian&quot; hunter-gatherers (look - he's got me doing it now!) seems to be glossed over because it doesnt fit too comfortably with Diamond's theory. Diamond even conveniently lumps Nortern Africa in with Europe, when its demographics fit his theory better! Quite early on, Diamond scoffs openly at the idea that civilisation is a laudable goal in itself. His statement that he finds New Guineans tend to be more intelligent than Europeans or Americans rather sets the tone for the rest of the book. Indeed, one could be forgiven for believing that New Guinea was and is the cradle of civilisation.GG&amp;S does, in all fairness, contain much fascinating material. The culture clash between Pizarro and Atahuallpa and the chapter covering the invention and spread of writing are exceptionally interesting. Diamond's political motives are however always apparent. For example the fact that the Spanish worked in collaboration with some ethnic american peoples (Zatopec etc) to assist in subjugating others, is glossed over - presumably to demonise those nasty Europeans yet further. This tends to make the reader suspicious of the author's motives in presenting such selective evidence and in asking us to trust him in the many assumptions he makes. All things considered, I still feel GG&amp;S was worth reading (particularly if you're Eurasian and enjoy a guilt trip!), but you may find the author's hidden (and occasionally quite overt) agenda very irritating. Surely we are more than mere automata with our destiny pre-ordained by environmental constraint?"},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"The first 2/3 of this book was some of the most interesting reading I have done in a long time. As a plausible description of how primitive man might have socially evolved from small bands of hunter-gatherers, to farming communities raising crops and livestock, to highly-complex literate city states and nations, the first part of this book was fantastic. Alas, however, the last 1/3 of the book and the deeply flawed biases of the author were almost enough to destroy all that went before.First of all, do not think of this book as scientific research. Research begins with an unwavering commitment to discover facts as they are and then to articulate what conclusions can be formed based on them. This book is not research because the author admits that he begins with the politically-correct conclusion that there are no innate differences between socially advanced human populations and human populations that still live in a state of relative primitivity. He then spends his time trying to hammer together all of the facts that he can to fit his foreordained conclusion. In the end, his so-called research doesn't remotely support his conclusion. Moreover, at one point, he even contradicts his major premise by stating that he thought that members of a certain New Guinea tribe that he (revealingly) spent much time with were more intelligent than most people in more advanced societies. It seems that this book might be an example of the author \\"going native,\\" a modern day Margaret Mead. Additionally, the final third of the book is strangely disconnected from the first part, encumbered with monotonous chapters of abstruse East Asian and Polynesian linguistic history in stark contrast to the delightful readability of the first part. It's as if the author had some really nifty (in his eyes) linguistic research that he wanted to have published so he just stuffed it into the back of this book.Overall, where he spends his time describing how humans might have developed farming, animal husbandry, writing, and complex city-life, the author is at his best. Where he spends his time as an apologist for people who still live in a relatively primitive state he is at his worst. Read it for the former, disregard his conclusions about the latter; especially since, if there truly are absolutely no innate differences between groups of human beings (of whom scientists estimate there have been, throughout human history, some 45 billion), then humans would be the only species about which this is true. And if it is actually true, you wouldn't know it from reading this book, with it's through-the-looking-glass conclusion first, evidence later approach."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"This is the best general history of humanity I have ever read.

J. Diamond presents a clear argument for why certain societies are more advantaged than others. Although he is believable, his argument is flawed which makes for a great paper topic."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"I launched into this book with enthusiasm. The subject was close to my heart - why are some societies strong and others weak - and the author's basic proposition was sound - accidents of geography are to blame rather than racial factors. But then came the Prologue ... where we learn about the superior intelligence of New Guinea children because they don't sit around all day and watch TV like Western children. Later, the author also gives us a little holiday snap about running out of water in the Australian outback, which presumably demonstrates Europeans' low intelligence compared with Australian Aborigines. That's a bit like arguing that I am pretty smart because I know where all the pubs in Sydney are. Jared Diamond wants history to be taken seriously as a science, but he has done his cause no favours with this sort of stuff. What we get is a few good ideas - food production, literacy, disease, etc. - which support his thesis; what we don't get are the obvious - though not so palatable - cultural, religious, etc. factors. Why have Singapore, Malaysia and Thailand done better than Burma, Laos and India? Why have the Chinese prospered wherever they have gone? And how did a few Mongolian nomadic sheepherders manage to conquer most of Eurasia? The reasons given for Europe's dominance over China in the last 500 years - Columbus was able to shop around different nations for a sponsor, which he could not have done in a unified China, and (with maps to illustrate it) Europe's bumpier coastline - are a bit silly. And what about the United States pre-eminence during the twentieth century? One could put up with all of this if the book was a good read. It is not. It is wordy, ponderous, and sometimes patronising. The author has a few important points to make - especially concerning livestock raising and agriculture - and, just so we won't forget, he keeps repeating them. How many times do we read about the spread of food production from the Fertile Crescent? We even get at least one reminder about the smart New Guinea children. Some worth, but don't spend too much time on it."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"Without a doubt, this has got to be the worst book I have read in a long time. What would have been an interesting blurb in the sociology section of 'Time' magazine, becomes hundreds of pages of pure mindless dreck in the hands of Jared Diamond. Let me save you a few days of your life by summing up the book: The reason why white, western / European societies flourished and the rest of the of the non-white, non-western world did not was because the European climate and terrain favored domestication of plants and animals while the rest of the world's terrain and climate did not. Therefore, western man had more free time on his hands to invent stuff and put a man on the moon, while the rest of the world, to this day, is still screwed up. Wow. I am so annoyed I read this book and wasted so much time doing so."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"I've read some of the reviews of this book, and they in a large part prompted me to buy it. A regular theme in these reviews is how common sense or logical the book is. I found this to be quite the opposite. Several times in the book Diamond asks the reader to forget common sense, or debunks common sense with so-called &quot;scientific proof.&quot; While I have no doubt of Mr. Diamond's learned qualifications, I have serious doubts about his objectivity and scientific method. In fact, he freely admits he wrote the book for his friends, the backwards stone-age peoples of New Guinea. I wonder if in fact Mr. Diamond presented a series of arguments he KNOWS are weak, contradictory, and just plain wacko, in order to stimulate some thought and discussion on the matters at hand.Contradictions I found:Diamond states that technology could not drift across geographic barriers, and that some societies never adopted certain technologies not due to their unreceptiveness, but due to the fact that they were never exposed to said technology. In the same chapter, he states that certain crops DID in fact make it across these so-called barriers. But the receiving society never adopted EVERYTHING, just the easy stuff. So why now did they not accept all the technology again? This is a classic catch-22, it's psuedo-science at it's worst.He makes a case that invention is NOT due to particular geniuses, but due to process. Exactly, some societies take existing technology and make it better constantly. I mean, he's making his own argument AGAINST his premise.He states that ancient Mexicans did in fact invent the wheel and axle, but only used it for toys because a human-drawn cart had no advantage over a porter. What? Has this soft-fingered intellectual ever used a wheelbarrow, how about a hand cart to move his books around? Earlier in the book he does state that the wheelbarrow is one of the key inventions that allowed some societies to adopt irrigation. I've got to ask again, did he do this intentionally, (I hope he did,) or is his scientific method and argument really this shoddy?The list goes on. I gave the book 3 stars for it's breadth and well-written style. Mr. Diamond is certainly a well-learned and compelling author. However, the arguments he presents are incredibly weak. If racist groups had any intelligence at all, they could use the book as their premise for existance. This book represents a prejudicial selection of certain scientific facts, leaving others, indeed the bulk, out. If Mr. Diamond had an open mind, he would have changed his premise by the end of the book just by compiling and organizing the facts he presents. I wonder how many scientists are cringing about the Pulitzer Prize (none, since the PP is journalistic, not scientific.) This book is NOT science, it's journalism, written with the now-standard precept of proving a view, instead of presentation of facts. I wonder if Mr. Diamond is still lecturing, I'd love to be in his class and flunk because I tore his arguments to shreds in front of the auditorium.Whatever your view, buy the book and read it. It's definitely compelling, thought-provoking, and WRONG!"},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"Have you ever heard of \\"the Galileo Defense?\\" The phrase describes the phenomenon of honest, accurate science attempting to defend itself against ideology-driven accusations of those who are opposed to the implications of the scientist's work. A good example would be Darwin as he faced charges of atheism, satanism, etc. If the Galileo Defense has an opposite, it would certainly apply to this book. To save you the trouble, Guns, Germs, and Steel basically articulates the first moderately believable and (most importantly) politically correct attempt to explain why the West was able to enjoy a position of relative dominance during the past few hundred years. Unfortunately, his assertions rely on numerous glaring omissions and flawed assumptions that really undermine his credibility. The existence of peanuts is one notable example that will be easily understood by those who've read the book. Those who haven't should do themselves a favor and skip ahead to L.

I am a Christian; in fact, I am probably what most people would call a Christian Fundamentalist. I am not sure if that is a fair label or not, but it might be insofar as I believe God created the Earth and is intimately involved in its history. I point this out not to convince anyone of the validity of my faith (that would be an absurd undertaking over this medium, to be sure), but rather so that those reading this review can better understand the lens through which I read this book.With that bit of business out of the way, I thoroughly enjoyed this book. Some people might find that inconsistent with my faith since this book is very evolutionary in thought. Nevertheless, I do not find Diamond's arguments and evidence concerning the evolution of the world to be in contradiction to Christianity (though others no doubt disagree). In fact, I at times felt his \\"evolutionary\\" evidence boosted my faith. All of these mutant strains of vegetation that allowed civilizations to thrive; and all of these chance attributes of choice animals that also allowed civilizations to thrive; all of these \\"lucky chances\\" are just too much for me to not believe in God's providence. Diamond would certainly interpret his evidence in different ways than I have, not doubt, but that does not detract from the evidence itself. To each his own...Many people have criticized Diamond's book because it minimizes that \\"human\\" factor. I agree that Diamond's book does do this (although not to the extent that some have claimed), and I think this is a good thing. How are we Americans/Europeans to boast or be arrogant when we had nothing (or much less) to do with the advancement of our civilization. It turns out we are not smarter or more talented (Diamond argues that in fact we were often less smart and less talented), but just the lucky benefactors of \\"chance\\". If Diamond's work can have any effect in trimming the general arrogance and pride of Western Civilization then I think he has accomplished a good task.This book provides the historian with alternative explanations to the course of world history; enough with the importance or ingeniousness of European invention and Christopher Columbus. These explanations simply won't do. Diamond brings into the equation factors that are too often overlooked, namely geography, climate, and availability of easily cultivatable vegetation and adaptable livestock. I would give this book 4.5 stars if Amazon let me do such a thing. Those who say that this is a dry, slow read simply don't understand the magnitude of the argument being made (at least they make that mistake in my opinion). I think Diamond did a great job of making the material interesting, and his writing was very good. A great addition to anyone's library. Certainly a worthy recipient of the Pulitzer Prize."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"Jared Diamond has an ambitious goal: explain the history of mankind globally.His thesis is quite simple: different people had different histories because of geographical (environmental), not innate (racial) differences. He presents, develops and defends his point of view brilliantly and forcefully.Some people remained hunters-gatherers, while others became masters of the world.The crucial factor in human history is food. The availability of materials (plants, animals) for domestication leads to the production of food surpluses in some geographical fertile regions, which allowed the feeding of specialists outside agriculture (craftsmen, warriors, bureaucrats, priests, kings). Intensive food production, population size and societal complexity stimulated each other as fewer peasants were needed to feed the whole population. Craftsmen developed maritime, military and industrial technology and warriors conquered new territories.Population growth generated a centralized organization (a state structure) for decision making (politics) and conflict resolutions (law).Domestication provided other cardinal advantages. Infectious diseases evolve from animal diseases. Through intimacy with animals people became immune. But, when not immunized populations came in contact with immunized ones, they were wiped out. Also, animals could be used as power engines and warrior transport means.Other important historical factors were those related to transmission of acquired knowledge: migration and, cardinally, writing.While hunter-gatherer groups remained more or less egalitarian, states with centralized governments generated great differences of wealth. They became ruled by an elite which controlled nearly wholly (kleptocracy) or partially the manna of the state (the budget).But, how could the elite continue to control the masses?Jared Diamond sees 4 different solutions: arm the elite and disarm the masses, redistribution of wealth, impose public order and curb violence (police), construct ideology or religion to justify the kleptocracy.The author remarks judiciously that with the organization of the state the irrational beliefs of the population became institutionalized into an \`official' religion.All in all, Jared Diamond's book is a magisterial and very revealing Darwinian essay about power problems and survival of the human species.A must read for all those interested in the history of mankind."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"Like Diamond's other books, this makes for fascinating reading. The real strength of the book is not so much in the conclusions but in the reasoning behind them. This book should define a starting point - rather than an end point - for those interested in the development and, over time, decay of societies.Highly recommended.Jennifer Cameron-Smith"},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"A book exploring the concepts of why certain geographical areas foster trade more than others. This book offers many fascinating tidbits of scientific interest. I couldn't put this book down ! I disagree with the other reviewers about the author expressing bias. The author makes several clearly stated points throughout the course of the book, against racist, classist misconceptions in biology. I am told by a dear friend who is a psychology major that, \\"Guns, Germs, and Steel\\" was required reading (who felt the book was an important experience). The book is enjoyable and stimulating to read, I sincerely recommend it."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"For those people who know little about human history, or have been taught that the rise of the West is due to some innate superiority, I suppose this book could be enlightening. But for everyone else, Guns, Germs, and Steel presents nothing new, original, or controversial, except for Diamond's claim that aboriginal New Guineans are superior to Western peoples - this slip might be understandable given Diamond's long-term study and fondness for these people. This book could easily have been edited down by a third and it would have been better for it. Otherwise, it is a decent primer on human history, but how and why it won the Pulitzer is beyond me."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"Interesting except his explanations were just a little too pat. That and numerous special pleading made me wonder whether or not his theories are valid. I'm not an expert in the fields I'd need to be to judge his claims. I think I'll add \\"The Wealth and Poverty of Nations: Why Some Are So Rich and Some So Poor\\" to my reading list to get another point of view. Another problem I had with the book is the author repeats himself over and over as if the reader were too stupid to remember what he said in a previous chapter."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"Go out and read this book.

Good job."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"This is an excellent must-read, and ought to be a reading book assigned for classes in High School and/or college. It is more than just another anthropology book as it gives the real reasons why societies and civilizations came to be the way they are, by giving personal accounts of environmental and trade conditions that existed in majors societies throughout history. This book is not racist in anyway, on the contrary, it gives the history to how differences in class and standard of living between cultures came to be."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"Some of the views presented here seem maybe far-fetched, others a bit tooobvious, but they all provide a solid idea about the historical facts of human evolution."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"Well written, very enlightening concepts, and highly recommended. I later saw the PBS series, which was a treat after reading this."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"Diamond does an excellent job of identifying and analyzing some the forces that have shaped human development over the centuries. I found a number of new ideas in this book, for example: the notion that humans have modified plans through selective breeding to emphasize the characteristics we value most (e.g. almonds used to be poisonious, not anymore!) With regard to contemporary history (say, the last 500 years) it would be nice if Diamond spent some time discussing the cultural factors and how they interplay with the other two factors (biology and physical resources). Definitely recommended if you'd like to hear some interesting ideas about how we got where we are today."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"I believe Jared Diamond has made an excellent job explaining the rise of human civilizations, conquests, and diasporas. Although many of his point had previously been made, and accepted, by different authorities, nobody (at least as far as I'm concern) had ever integrated all that knowledge in one fine book. I've heard all kinds of opinions on this book, I believe the people that didn't like it are the ones that are not used to read science or philosophy, they are more used to novels and other styles of writing that are more light reading. This book certainly forces you to reflect a lot, and also to keep concentration throughout all of it. I recommend it if you are used to read science literature and want to reflect on human actual distribution and cultures."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"Mr Diamond asks us to follow him along some serious lines of questioning to consider that many fortituous accidents in their ecosystem, not some innate superiorities in their race, gave central and western Europeans advantages that they enjoy / exploit over the rest of the world even today.This is actually pretty obvious, but no scientist has yet tried to empirically analyze this. For instance, on a very high level, we know that environmental accidents have determined many things in our past: 65 million years ago a 2km-wide object crashed into the Yucatan and caused a world-wide forest fire, mile-high tidal waves and years of darkness, wiping out 70% of life on earth (including the Dinosaurs). Conversely, using the a-bomb on Hiroshima in WWII, (indeed all of WWII, our costliest war to date) while huge in destructive power in human-wrought terms, is trivial to the overall outcome of life on earth in comparison. The former event played a huge role in the development of our species. The latter, while foreboding great cataclysm in store, did not.A minority of Diamond's critics cite a small number of examples of faulty conclusions he has made in this book that I think he should look into. But many other critics pile a litany of absurd arguments against him that can be summed up as thinly veiled racism. I did, however, get a sense of some of the sweeping conclusions Diamond has made and wondered a bit whether he was going too far, but that does not reduce the value of this book as a compelling cross-examination of the history of the family of humankind.Those who are attacking Mr. Diamond as being too &#65533;Politically Correct&#65533;, all I can say is that a cohesive scientific theory is being put together in this book, and those readers are welcome to attack it on its own merits, whereas implying a hidden agenda is simply sneering, mudslinging innuendo: go ahead an prove it if you're so sure."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"In this treatise Jared Diamond tackles no lesser a question than how Eurasian civilizations outstripped the rest of the world in technological development, allowing them to achieve preeminence on the world stage. Everyone knows that the West employed guns, germs, and steel to annex the Americas, Africa, and the Far East, but this book tries to explain why these advantages arose in Eurasia first. Diamond traces each of these advantages to one common source: the origins of agriculture first in Mesopotamia and China, not in Mexico or the Sahara or Australia. He attributes Eurasia's head start to more easily domesticated flora and fauna, a lengthy east-west access allowing the rapid diffusion of civilization, and the absence of significant geological barriers to stop this spread.Needless to say, this two sentence summary doesn't do justice to Diamond's argument. His conclusions have the ring of truth, such as his assertion that the success of Western civilization has nothing to do with race and everything to do with an environment conducive to the growth of civilization. However, Diamond's authoritative tone throughout the book belies the ultimately circumstantial nature of his evidence. In addition, he made his essay less formidable at the cost of omitting entirely citations and footnotes documenting the evidence he does present. The only references he offers are in his appendix of suggested readings for each chapter.Better late than never, in the epilogue Diamond instills confidence in his rigor as a scientist by discussing the difficulties with his methodology. At the same time, he credibly argues for the applicability of science to history. The epilogue also briefly treats an important topic for Diamond's theory: why China failed to maintain the technological superiority it held over Europe until at least the sixteenth century.This review has been mostly critical, but only because this book is essential reading for anyone attempting to understand human history at this scale. Diamond's characterization of history cannot be proved correct by science, but we can ill afford to ignore it. This seminal work provides a coherent explanation for perhaps the broadest and most important trend in human history, and for that Diamond deserves credit and merits your attention."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"Guns, Germs and Steel is a well reasoned volume that presents its ideas clearly. It may get you to think for the first time about questions to which you thought the answers were obvious, but upon reflection, you find are not. In reading this book, you'll learn why it was so easy for a tiny Spanish force to conquer a comparatively huge Aztec empire, why Europeans ended up with all the resistance to common infections, and why having the right plants and large mammals on your continent makes all the difference. It turns out that dominating the world comes down to a geographical luck of the draw. The reason for knocking a star off of the rating of this book is its length. Towards the last quarter of the book, you begin to feel that the author has already made all of the points that he has to make and that continued reading is just subjecting you to repetiton of the same themes."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"I have two boys, ages 9 and 15. Although neither of them wanted to read Guns, Germs, and Steel, my reading of it has led to some interesting conversations in our family. The book gives a good background to history in many parts of the world that I was not as familiar with as I should have been. As I\`ve read the book, I've summarized his claims for my kids. It has led us to good discussions about the people that we have replaced on this continent, to question the concepts of race and intelligence, and to wonder just how white Europeans, who could certainly be savage and stupid themselves, came to conquer most of the world. Although I think that many of the author's claims are a bit too strong, it is still a thought-provoking book.For a more complete review of the book, I'd have to agree with the weaknesses mentioned by Christopher Smith in a review on this website posted on Jan. 24, 2001."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"An inspiring work with impressive knowledge of the developments challenging mankind for the past 13000 years.

Just overly/ unnecessarily long."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"Jared Diamond's Guns, Germs, and Steel is a highly interesting and informative book, which I found fascinating. The lengthy, somewhat wordy book covers a wide array of subjects, with a focus on the main premise of the book: societies developed differently on different continents because of differences in continental environments, not in human biology. Diamond examines the spread of plant and animal domestication on the different continents, and how that led to writing, diseases, and technological innovations. The main premise of environmental location, proximity to other evolving cultures, and biological factors like resistance or susceptibility to certain diseases is traced throughout human history.Diamond does a phenomenal job of synthesizing scientific data with historical information and making clear, concise connections between the two, as in the instance of his comparison of biological factors such as genetic predisposition to disease and cultural circumstances in explaining why Yali's culture was considered one of the \`have-nots.'The prose is engrossing, the argument is well-planned and executed, and Diamond does a complete and thorough analysis of his thesis. While lengthy, and as aforementioned, wordy, Diamond's Guns, Germs, and Steel is a book that would certainly be well worth the $17.00 spent. Academics and history buffs alike will find this discussion of 13,000 years of human history fascinating and enjoyable. I surely did."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"I have read this book three times which should say something about what I think of it. I purchased it for my children and had them read it also. It is an amazing book written to answer a simple question; \\"How did European derived societies dominate others?\\" This book is the clearest repudiation of any racial basis for this than anything I have ever read. In painstaking detail and fascinating prose Diamond goes through issues such as climate and continental orientation that have influenced the way cultures can flourish. His synthesis of such a large number of scientific disciplines, the rigor of his arguments, and the fluidity of his prose are just riveting. I found it laughable that some readers complained of cultural bias in his arguments. Nothing could be further from the truth. His arguments specifically repudiate cultural biases and look at climate, animal life, plant species, and geographical features to describe the evolutions of cultures. Diamond ties in the role of disease in societies and how specialization aided by improved farming methods led to improvements in weaponry and cultural domination. He is not just blowing hot air. He supports his arguments methodically and convincingly with research results and not empty opinions.This book is in the top 5 non-fiction books I have ever read and deserves all the accolades it has received."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"A great audio adaptation of a great book.

Jared Diamond, congratulations on the Pulitzer. Even so, Diamond's work is readable, informative, and makes excellent arguments that the world is the way it is today because of geography, specifically, that large land areas oriented east-west, like Euro-Asia, are more likely to expand their agricultural successes, and hence their population and influence, due to there being similar climates at similar latitudes, and the serendipity of high yield plants such as wheat and domesticable animals such as oxen, occurring in some regions and not others. And if the differences are from these environmental factors, than they certainly cannot be from race. Had the Aborigines wondered to the Fertile Crescent and the Caucasians to Australia a few thousand years ago, then today the Aborigines would be suffering the guilt of Western Civilization while the Caucasians live happily in the Outback. Diamond may be right, but he certainly doesn't hide the fact that, when it comes to race, he is anything but an unbiased researcher: \\"the objection to racial explanations is not just that they are loathsome\\". Unbiased researchers don't condemn a possible conclusion, or any conclusion, in the prologue as loathsome without tainting their objectivity and undermining their obligation to follow the facts wherever they may lead. Worse yet, while he asserts that all races are about equal, just subject to geography and serendipity, he can't help but to commit the same loathsome act he himself condemns by claiming New Guineans are of \\"superior intelligence.\\" This aside, Guns, Germs, and Steel offers a fascinating look at the last fifty thousand years of brutal conquests by the technologically superior societies over the less advanced with genuine insights into the underlying reasons that made it possible."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"I've read some of the negative reviews and would like to say something about a repeating assertion that the Incas only had two crops, potatos and maize (corn). The Incas cultivated around seventy crops, including grains, beans and fruits. More, in fact, than any other region in the world. Their conquerers were only interested in a few of them and those are the ones we know about. Among the better known crops are lima beans, peppers, peanuts, sweet potatos, squash, quinoa and tomatoes. Salsa is an Incan original. There are also reviewers who claim the natives of Mexico grew mostly maize. Their agriculture was pretty diverse too."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"If this book had been easier to read, I would have rated it much higher. I have had little exposure in my reading regarding theories as to why one culture developed ahead of another. Guns, Germs, and Steel takes a good run at it.

It is well thought out and the documentation is excellent. The writing style makes it an easy book to read. The major problem I have with the book is it should have been half as long. Page after page is devoted to sideline discussions and irrelevent facts that are not important to the main theory being presented.

It is a panoramic view of the history of humanity which is told in detailed, meticulous, and often fascinating fashion. Though it is difficult to understand at times, it is well worth the effort. Far more than most books, reading this book requires an open mind and a willingness to look at all aspects of a situation. For this reason, it has been criticized by some who lack the attention span required to understand the themes of this book and by others who subscribe to the &quot;whites superior and dark skinned people inferior&quot; &quot;theory&quot; of human nature. It proves the Bell Curve to be totally false. Guns, Germs, and Steel is must reading."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"Having read several of Diamond's previous books, I was pleasantly surprised by this one -- though largely for avoiding the obvious faults of those other works. Diamond's writings are remarkably repetitive, and he is conspicuously lacking in the 'ear' that makes the work of, for example, James Gleick so extraordinary. This book has been praised to the skies by two types of people: those knowing little of science (so that they think this is it), and those who know that Diamond has his science correct in broad outline and are glad to see even this velveetized version of it achieve popularity.As a substitute for closely-reasoned historical analysis or an impartial rendering of a difficult interdisciplinary scientific enterprise, this falls far short of what might be expected to garner a Pulitzer Prize (something denied the infinitely superior 'Feynman' of Gleick, or Kanigel's book on Ramanujan). As perfect fodder for condensation, one hopes Diamond could write a 16-page version of his thesis, which could be compressed to this extent and lose little in the way of completeness."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"It was brutal getting through it, but I am glad I read it. There were numerous pieces of information on the evolution of civilation that were revelations to me. His discussion on how plant domestication evolved was particularly helpful. How diseases evolve was also good."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"Guns, Germs, and Steel, starts with a great title, and an impressive premise in the form a compelling question. As posed by a native of New Guinea, a friend of the author who in some ways reminded me of Watson asking Holmes how he knew the man sitting in the parlor collected postage stamps and took the morning express from the Highlands... Hmmm,not so elementary,Watson...your question. Or maybe even closer to the mark, the scene where Crusoe meets Friday, the fellow who becomes Robinson Crusoe's man servant and friend when Crusoe is ship wrecked on the native island. You get the idea...The question posed is essentially, how come the Wests got so much cargo? i.e., stuff, and we New Guineans don't.The book details and examines the question in an academic's way of looking at things,and as a result,the book's greatest strength is also its weakness. ( In all fairness I must say that I didn't read the whole book, the reason being that the bookstore was closing soon, and I had come there to find a CD anyway...) Nevertheless, I got enough of the sense of it to say that,hey, Professor, nice try but you missed a kind of important point -- entirely. I don't mean to sound facetious, at least not entirely. All the factors that Diamond considers, the ones he gives weight to are in their own way very interesting, and I'm sure, valid points... Environment is crucial. Mountains make nice walls for people to peek over and see what the guys next door are doing to solve problem A, B, or C, and how can they copy or innovate their own answer to it. Or better yet, just take them over by force and steal it. That's always been a standard human approach to problem solving-- theft. However,environment aside for a moment,excuse me but didn't you leave something kind of important out of your analysis? Wasn't Religion a somewhat significant thing in the West? This incredibly potent force which has propelled Western history for two thousand years,this titanic need to, shall we say share our conception of God with our neighbors, whether or not they have invited us to the party, isn't that pretty much standard Western mentality and normal proceedure? Bring in more advanced technology, impose religious beliefs, crush obstacles or people who are crushable. Take what they have,in the name of religion and manefest destiny. Hasn't that been the because in answer to the West's global hegimony. Religion driven motives propelled by all the other factors and issues mentioned in the book,of course. But when you write a book attempting to shed light on this question of why the West (won or took depending on your vantage point) the West, and the World, by extention, it seems kind of important to mention this little thing called Religion...Having said this, and I apologize if I missed the chapter on religion, there are many wonderful nuggets in the book. It's definitely worth a read. I especially liked the photographs of the people. I do think we tend to forget what people living in other lands look like, innundated as we are with idealized images of ourselves. Though I consider myself to be almost completely egalitarian and free from predjudice, I was amazed to see in how many ways my own thinking is strongly biased. For example, I did think of the natives of New Guinea as some kind of stone age peoples lacking in some way in what we so confidently think of as intelligence. The book forced me to look at my own reactions to peoples, and made me realize just how biased I am in so many ways, consciously, and unconsciously.As for the future, well, I'm afraid Diamond's as much in dark as anyone in predicting where we are going... English has ascended to the preeminant language of the world, and we are the lucky recepients of this fate, or accident of history. But intelligence and geography, and human needs will shift. The Chinese, as we are learning lately in Washington have been vastly underated. Perhaps we'd be wise to begin reading more books about Chinese history, philosophy, and, ehem, religion."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"The author covers a lot of ground. I do question his theory whereby he discounts man's intelligence as a factor in a nation's development. Someone had to think of the \\"wheel\\" and someone had to think of expanded uses of the wheel. No doubt the availability of certain plants and animals and the lack thereof played a major role in man's progress in each area of his discussion. This seems somewhat obvious. Yet, I like to think that the human mind's ability to visualize new ideas and to implement these ideas brought us further down the road to civilization as most, but not all, know today. It would a an interesting exercise for the author to expand his theories and speculate what life might be like in the year 4000."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"I had a wonderful experience with this seller and since the item wasn't what I expected they did however offered a full refund or some % off (I decided to keep the item) ....

I didn't purchase this book when it first came out because I didn't think, based on the reviews, that it was going to say much of anything that was news to me. It doesn't but then I'm a data junkie and a history nut, etc. It's a decent book but it's saying things I already knew long before the book came out. I can recall reading about the Spanish conquest of what is now Peru in an old History book my parents had used in grade school about the time I was ten. I think I understood who had the advantages and what they were then. I picked up a lot from National Geographic, etc. through the years. Nothing is novel. I have a few nits to pick but basically I agree with most of what he wrote. To me the book is redundant. Your mileage may vary.If you don't already know what the advantages various early groups and locations had that foreshadowed much of their future gains or lack of same then the book does explain in simple easy to understand layman's language. If you think about what is said carefully and study what is going on around you, you can make some highly likely guesses about what is going to happen to various nations over the next hundred years or so. Prospects for Whites of European descent especially from France, England, and Germany along with the natives of same and the natives of Spain and Portugal stink. I leave it to you to figure out why but my data says these people are largely joining the Neanderthal. Like them we will no doubt leave a few stray genes around."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"I puchased this book online and I am pretty satisfied with what I got from the distributer.

I have absolutely no doubt that the author is an expert in his field and that the information provided in this book opens up a new paradigm on the balance of power that originated early in written history that resulted in the dominance of Eurasian culture across the globe. However, my main beef with this book as that the arguments he presented could have been put in a book about a 5th of this size.SPOILER ALERT!Diamonds main arguments for the predominance of Eurasian culture are as follows -1) Eurasia had the climate and natural resources to produce lots of food, domesticated animals, and the agricultural base that is a necessary step towards a society that allows for things like a formal government, a free-standing military, and technological advances. The Americas, Australia, and Africa does not.2) Because of Eurasia is laid out, food, technology, and ideas are quick to spread (east to west across relatively open areas with similar climates compared to the vast difference of climates of the more north/south aligned Americas/Africa). These things were shared between the cultures and instituted unified governments that were more of a match than the isolated tribes of the less-fortunate continents.3) Greater food production allowed for bigger populations, which gave more ample opportunity for diseases to develop (which also happen to generally come from domesticated animals, which the bigger populations of Eurasia had in abundance) - the populations developed resistance to said diseases, and thus had \\"outgunned\\" the smaller tribes when it came to germs, leading a massive advantage when it came to colonization.There are a few more details introduced in the book (the importance of writing being developed, allowing for the transfer of ideas - governments allowing for the development of religious systems/patriotism which caused soldiers to fight harder than tribal equivalents), but that's pretty much the summary of Diamonds arguments. Great points, really interesting, but believe me when I say that I just saved you a very long, repetitive read by giving away the meat of this book. Towards the end (I'd say the last 20% of the book not including epilogue/afterword), Diamond refers to these ideas over and over, to the point where it seems like he's really beating a dead horse and not introducing anything new to his arguments. This issue paired with the fact that he drowns his writing in statistics that would be better and more efficiently served in a footnote format, plus his long tirades on related but not necessarily essential topics, make it agonizing to pull the valuable insight that he presents in his arguments. How does the origin of language groups matter towards the essential argument of the book? That information would have been better suited in a more focused book on the different tribes of New Guinea and Indonesia, not in a book that is heralded as an argumentative thesis as to the nature of Eurasian dominance in the world.To give an example of a much better written book that argues a very controversial point, I'd refer the potential customer to Dawkin's \\"The Selfish Gene\\". Every chapter in that book demonstrates an argument to support his thesis, is very streamlined and to the point, and does not go off on long tirades of related yet irrelevant subject matter. It's pretty much the antithesis of how GGS is written.Again, valuable information in this book, very thought provoking, but just too damn long and rambling. My .02 ."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"If you have curiosity about how the big picture of civilizations emerged - for example, why it was the European civilizations dominating with ships and guns and not the American civilizations - you should really enjoy this book. Yes, Jared Diamond has biases (he clearly doesn't like people who believe whites are genetically superior to other races) but he weaves a fantastic story with scientific facts and elegant reasoning. Many facts (relating to plant and animal science) are clearly and concisely presented. Other facts are obvious once pointed out (the lack of domesticatable animals in sub-Saharan Africa, or how long it takes for domesticated plants to adjust to different climates) you have these great &quot;Aha&quot; moments while reading. I loved how his arguments came together.Are there cons? Well, certain chapters in the second half of the book do repeat parts of the first half. It adds to the clarity (showing how the same principles can apply to different parts of the world), but if you &quot;got it&quot; the first time, some parts of the book can get long. Given how this book can change the way you look at different peoples and cultures, I can forgive him for repeating himself.If you like science and are curious about how environment shaped, or better, limited civilizations, get this book."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"-----------------------------------------------------------How did the West grow rich and conquer the world? Itwasn't racial superiority, as the Victorians thought - indeed, Diamondgives evidence that the average New Guinean may well be smarterthan the average Westerner. His own one-sentence summary of thebook is: \\"History followed different courses for different peoplesbecause of differences among peoples' environments, not because ofbiological differences among the peoples themselves\\"[clunk]. Or, it's theenvironment, stupid. Or, the West got lucky.I'm uncomfortable with history-as-polemics, but Diamond (usually)keeps his facts and interpretations pretty well separated. And this is awonderful one-volume history of the human race. It is unusual, andrefreshing, to read a history written by a distinguished and literatebiological scientist. History isn't generally considered to be science -\\"it's just one damn thing after another.\\" But then, you could say thesame for large parts of astronomy, biology & geology.13,000 years ago, the most recent Ice Age was ending, and peopleeverywhere still made their living as hunter-gatherers. Diamond startshis story at the dawn of civilization. By Chapter 3, he's recountingPizarro's conquest of the Inca empire in 1532. In an afternoon, 168Spanish soldiers routed an army of 80,000, killed 7,000, and capturedthe Inca emperor. It's not surprising that the Spaniards would feelsuperior. But the conquistadores' invisible allies had been at worksince 1492 - smallpox from Spain had killed the previous Inca emperorand his heir, setting off a war of succession that fatally weakened theempire. Diseases from Europe would ultimately kill up to 95% of thenative peoples of the Americas, often before they saw their firstEuropean. The old American cultures were doomed from first contact,even if the Old World visitors had been peaceful explorers and traders.12,000 years of isolation had left native Americans with no resistance tothe lethal European microbes.Where did these diseases come from, and why didn't the Indiansreturn the favor by infecting Eurasia? Many came originally fromdomestic animals (for example, measles and smallpox from cattle), andrequired large, dense populations to evolve. The Indians had fewdomestic animals - one reason why they were poorer than Eurasians,and those (fortuitously) had no diseases that \\"made the jump\\" fromanimals to humans - good evidence for Diamond's \\"history as luck\\"hypothesis.Diamond's history is wonderful, full of new science, strange facts, andgreat anecdotes. The polemics get repetitious and a bit defensive attimes, but can be safely skimmed. This would have been a better bookhad it been written as straight history, letting the facts speak forthemselves - but it's still well worth reading.

His reconstruction of biological, geographical, and demographical factors is fascinating. I wish, however, that he had a more heavy-handed editor. The book is pedantic. He bombards the reader with evidence that often exceeds what is necessary to establish his case. Moreover, in playing to his personal strengths (biology and linguistics) he gives grossly inadequate attention to other perspectives, such as economics and general cultural factors. (For example, race advantaged no one, but this book also provides examples of how racism and zenophobia could both help and hinder.) His survey of the history of the forms of social organization is superficial. His theories about the nature of history are also issues for debate. He seems to think that history moves from something toward something with necessity and purpose. Can one speak meaningfully about the broad patterns of history? Professional historians argue about this. (Speaking of historiographical problems, if great men can't take the credit for innovation, per Diamond's position, why does he blame a single Chinese ruler for stopping innovation? Does the course of Chinese history really hang on a single cranky ruler?) To conclude, even while showing how central the domestication of plants and animals were for the evolution of human societies, Diamond acknowledges that these factors are fundamental but not deterministic. In the end, Diamond provides only part of an answer--albeit a stimulating one. I screamed and groaned often when reading, but I'm glad I read this book."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"\\"Guns, Germs, and Steel: the Fates of Human Societies\\" by Jared DiamondNormally, when I read an argumentative book I attempt to find holes and flaws in logic, in an attempt to sift through to the persuasive. As I read Diamond, perhaps that critical faculty ebbed - more likely, I just found myself ebullient at finding a book that so deftly unites history (and pre-history) with science. No major criticism comes to mind, though I'm sure with the amount of information packed into 425 pages, experts in their respective fields might have differing perspectives on the more contentious archaeological and historical issues that Diamond presents (e.g. dating of migrations like Clovis - though Diamond seems fairly careful to differentiate between his views and those having more consensus.).Abstracting Diamond, my only real analogy could be a computer program called SimCity, which allows a person to tinker with a city's fauna and geography and observe the results. It's a SimCivilization view of human history. Rather than looking primarily at isolated incidents, say, the assassination of Abe Lincoln, it is sort of a meta-history that looks at the trends of history and tries to correlate those trends with geographic variables. Diamond's explanations span continents, showing that Australia and Tasmania's until recent technological backwardness is linked to the nutrient-poor and metal limited environment, rather than as \\"explained\\" by the 19th century colonialist ethnocentric presuppositions (or to put it in a less biased manner the technology the Aborigines had met the need of different conditions, and had less resources to build upon) .The European conquest of the Americas, likewise had to do with the isolation of the complex societies of the Americas by latitude differentials (slowing the spread of agriculture from one place to another, versus the East West axis of Eurasia which promoted the spread of domesticated crops across a wide area) and natural boundaries, coupled most importantly with a relative lack of native domesticable species. The biological and scientific components of Diamond's theorizing come into the fore when he discusses the nature of epidemic diseases, and their spread from livestock to human hosts, which leads to human populations with greater immunity over many generations in areas so effected (if they aren't hit at one stroke with wave after wave of diseases with entirely no immunity as happened with most of the former inhabitants of North America.).I think one of the things that excited me the most about Diamond was the stark contrast in his method of history in comparison to my rather dismal experiences with some other \\"historians\\" (Diamond is a professor of physiology). Sure, Diamond has ideological views, but they aren't the whole interpretive lens, and don't bog down his prose. He brings observations to the table, and doesn't overtly bring a non-empirical ideological prism through which history must be explained (though of course there may be the turf-defending rote charge of scientism, in which case I await the postmodern attempt to deconstruct paleontology as successfully as Sokal (?) mockingly deconstructed physics. Why at 2500 B.C.E. do the humanities' explanations suddenly become omnipotent? So the humanities and history chairs at universities can feel like what they're doing is important, and equally so?)"},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"I am currently reading Guns, Germs, and Steel and having considered not buying it due to two reviews prior to mine, I bought it because in reading more reviews below them, I found that it seemed some bias on the part of the two reviews was at work. While refuting another review is really not my object, I can say this, if you read the book, you will find that to every point these two reviews make, the ideas the reviewers made were taken out of context; the personal experiences Diamond mentions are put in a framework much larger than is mentioned, and germs, guns, and steel are brought up as signposts, as take off points from which interesting discussions are brought up in analyzing the strengths in cultures which may or may not come to dominate others.I believe Diamond makes his points successfully, and further that this book is on par or higher with Robin Lane Fox's Pagans and Christians.

Those who can read with a more open mind will find the book an accessible, thought-provoking work that displays a broad (though not always deep) understanding of many factors which have played roles in humankind's development.It's interesting to read the reviews submitted by the former kind of reader, most of whom seem convinced that white northern peoples and societies are the product of superior genes.

The world is not that simple.

Why the great subsequent differences? Biology? Different genetic endowments? No, it is not a matter of racial differences - there is only one human race, as Diamond shows.Why did bronze tools appear early in parts of Eurasia, but late and only locally in the New World, and never in aboriginal Australia? Diamond answers that environmental geography lays down the conditions of economic and social development.Eurasia is the world's largest and most diverse landmass. Diamond shows how its larger stock of domestic plants and animals gave it the lead, starting in southwest Asia's Fertile Crescent. Big-seeded annual cereals, like wheats (emmer and einkorn) and barley, were easy to domesticate, and Eurasia's wheats have a higher protein content than East Asia's rice or the New World's corn.Eurasia also had the largest number of wild mammalian species, 72 candidates for domestication. There were 14 ancient species of big herbivorous domestic animals: 13 were confined to Eurasia, one to South America. There were none in North America, Australia or sub-Saharan Africa. Eurasia had the unique combination of domesticable animals - sheep, goats, cows, pigs and dogs. Also, Eurasia's east-west axis enabled a swifter spread of crops and livestock across its 10,000-mile band of temperate latitudes.The ultimate cause of progress - food production - led to the proximate causes - germs, literacy, technology and centralised government. Guns, germs and steel are power factors.But Diamond underestimates how empires seized their given advantages to attack, conquer and exploit other less fortunate peoples.

Very quickly, I was disappointed.First, it seems to me that Jared Diamond cannot write very well. This book lacks style, and demonstrates average writing at best. It would [should] earn just a \\"C\\" in any college English course, except Freshman English 101.Second, Diamond's goal seems to have been to present an antithetical approach to history, world social and political development. Fundamentally, he tried to convince his readers that history only occurred as it did, because of serious abuses by those who came out on top. He presents nearly all other societies as intellectual and sociological equals to those that obviously enjoyed much greater success through time.Of course some of what he postulates is valid, but none of it seems new: his scenes change, but old thoughts remain. What is revolutionary about this book is that it offers negative \\"justifications\\" for most western societal successes, contrasted to positive \\"excuses\\" for nearly all non-western societies that didn't attain vibrancy, success, and longevity. It seems that in the author's mind, unsuccessful societies cannot be blamed for their failures; but successful societies should be blamed for their successes.Diamond's book will appeal to young, nihilistic minds, and to others who long to justify the lack of what is generally termed \\"progress\\" (social, intellectual, industrial) by many minority societies around the world. As with many similar flawed presentations, all is not lost. At least this book stimulates the reader to reexamine old conclusions and values, but in the end Diamond's book lacks an intellectual and historical foundation that will stand. Mostly, I think Diamond's work supports pseudo-intellectual ramblings that are driven to elevate the low status of those who have not thrived and succeeded in the modern world. His repeated explanations and justifications for societal \\"failures\\" and their lack of \\"progress\\" amongst competitors, suggests that Diamond has a general antipathy towards the successful societies in our world and a bleeding heart for those that haven't made it.In sum: this book is somewhat interesting; too long; pretty sophomoric; and, not well written. Those who long for a \\"politically correct\\" approach to history, wherein the vanquished become heroes, will love it. I was disappointed and made to wonder how Jared Diamond won a Pulitzer Prize for this effort.

Sub-Saharan Africans live in richest area of the planet, from minerals to fauna! The entire region is teaming with multitudes of plants and animals that would be easily domesticated: sorghum, millet, yams, and rice; guinea fowl, elephants, buffalo, giraffes, zebras, and wildebeests.On the plus side, though, I must admit the book makes a great coaster."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"I made myself read the book because I paid for it.

Those factors are geographic, how the contienents are structured, the types of animals and the types of plants at our disposal.So this book represents a way out for those who are embarrased by our cultural and mateiral success. Its not our fault. In fact Diamond starts by saying that people from primitive societies are probably smarter and more clever than we are. That certainly may be true, but it is an indirect way of relieving us from responsibilities as global citizens.Much of Diamonds book is repetitive with the same root causes leading to deep and percieved irreversable trends that determine the fate of societies.

But this answer does not satisfy Jared Diamond, because he cannot fathom that a culture could simply not be interested in conquest and genocide. He cannot fathom that a culture might not want to be an empire, that a culture might not want to be European. He is looking outward from a European culture and asking why other cultures are different from his own.It quickly becomes clear that he is unaware of this bias, as it does not occur to him to even consider whether the answer to his question lies in culture. Rather he frames our potential answers for us as follows: geography, or overt racism. Jared Diamond dismantles the argument of the overtly racist position (\\"Non-whites failed to wage genocide and conquest against the rest of the world because they are too stupid\\") in favor of the covertly racist position (\\"Non-whites failed to wage genocide and conquest against the world because they didn't have the geographic advantages that Europe and Asia did\\"). By comparing all societies against a European model, the author is inclined to see all other societies as \\"failed Europes\\" that \\"lack\\" certain attributes. That there is absolutely no evidence that non-Eurasian indigenous people had any interest in conquering, subjugating, or exterminating the rest of the world is apparently a moot point. Again and again he talks about how non-Europeans \\"failed\\" to match some European 'achievement', without bothering to provide evidence that they ever even had any interest in it. To get a sense of the absurdity of this, imagine that he had chosen African hunter-gatherer societies as his model instead. Would it then make sense to talk about how Europeans \\"failed\\" to achieve a communal society, an autarkic foraging-based economy, and a total absence of war? It would only make sense if Europe had a clear cultural interest in making these achievements. Otherwise, this is a textbook example of ethnocentrism, or the evaluation of another culture by the standards of one's own.Within another hundred pages or so, it becomes clear that Diamond is fundamentally an amateur in many of the subjects he professes knowledge in. His background is in geography, biophysics, and physiology, and yet has written a book built heavily dependent on the fields of anthropology, archaeology, ecology, and history. He argues, for instance, that Clovis peoples hunted megafauna such as mammoths to extinction, in spite of the clear impossibility of such a feat. (Indeed, a much more plausible theory now suggests that a comet impact was largely responsible.) He also gives a retelling of the old myth that native people reached America by following a land bridge and an \\"ice free corridor\\", despite current evidence that areas as far south as Chile were populated before the land bridge supposedly opened up. (The idea of a land bridge crossing and ice free corridor were never strongly supported by anthropological evidence, they were simply conjectured on the racist assumption that native people were incapable of sea travel.)Another example of incompetency is when he makes the claim that most 'chiefdoms' are \\"kleptomaniac\\" societies in which the elites steal from the common members of the society, without actually using examples from the \\"chiefdom\\" societies he mentions. Instead he speaks of \\"chiefdoms\\" in a mythical sort of way, as if they were all fundamentally the same, and then tells us a story about this generalized, unnamed chiefdom. In this way he can advance his theory of cultural evolution without providing any factual evidence to support it. And in fact the societies he does claim to be chiefdoms are often very different from his idealized portrait of \\"the chiefdom\\". For instance one of the \\"chiefdoms\\" he describes in the book are the \\"Kwakiutl\\" (who are actually the Kwak'waka'wakw; 'Kwakiutl' was the name of a single Kwak'waka'wakw band that was mistaken by early anthropologists for the name of the larger group). But rather than being a \\"kleptomaniac\\" society in which the top members steal from the bottom, Kwak'waka'wakw society is based politically on potlatching, a system in which leaders are ranked not for how much they accumulate from the commoners, but how much wealth they can give away to them. Only by continuously giving can a leader show that he is worthy of the community's respect and maintain his status. A situation completely 180 from Jared Diamond's simple system for caricaturing diverse societies, which comes us to us incidentally from antiquated works of anthropology, such as Peter Farb's \\"Man's Rise to Civilization As Shown by the Indians of North America\\", first published in 1968).These are just a few of the more striking examples. He often reveals his lack of a hand in more subtle ways, as for instance when he describes the 9% annual death rate of First Nations people in Saskatchewan from European germs as \\"incredible\\". But this rate is hardly so incredible. Where I live, just to give an example, 90% of the local population (the Kalapuya) died over a period of three years when malaria was introduced to the area. If he had researched the subject in any depth he would have found that the death rate in Saskatchewan was actually fairly typical.It also becomes clear that Diamond did not research his question to find an answer, but rather answered his question and then handpicked evidence to support that answer. Even still, much of his evidence is flaky at best and lends itself better to other explanations. For instance, he tries to explain that the apparent naivete of American Indian leaders in the face of psychopathic conquistadors was due to a lack of history books. Even if we ignore Diamond's ignorance of the complex oral histories in these societies, this argument seems rather impoverished. A much more likely answer is that these cultures had simply never come into contact with behavior so callous, arrogant, and mythomanic as that presented by the conquistadors, and thus were unable to prepare themselves against it. If this reasoning occurred to Diamond, he was careful to ignore it, as it directly contradicts his thesis. Indeed, Diamond took great care not to present any explanations that discouraged his overall conclusion, gambling that exhibiting unwavering confidence in a carefully constructed story would prevent people from noticing his academic shortcomings.Considering his book was a bestseller and won him both a Pulitzer Prize and a documentary series, it appears that his gamble paid off quite handsomely."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"I define &quot;liberal science&quot; as the prostitution of science to the service of political bias. Diamond's book is the most edifying example I've found to date of this form of junk science. Diamond crafts a tight argument by what he doesn't include as well as by what he packs into 500 pages. He picks and chooses carefully among disciplines only for data that supports his premise: that Earth's varied environment had, over millenia, privleged whites and asians, but left all others holding dead tickets. He goes to great pains to emphasize that environment had no evolutionary impact on intelligence (his underlying theme) and &quot;proves&quot; it with the most specious arm-waving anecdote imaginable. He doesn't return to this subject after that, and crucially,he ignores psychometric science entirely. He must. He ends many of his chapters with a self-congratulatory florish on how they explode &quot;white racist's&quot; beliefs. (In this book, a racist is anyone who believes that environment may have had an effect on the evolutionary rate of intelligence increase.) Diamond struts out geographic determinism as the sole cause for the way world history turned out-a bare-faced crime against open-minded science. But it is his masterful manipulation of data from disperate sources that has given his book so many positive reviews. I have been convinced by his argument that geography has a hand in the development of civilization. But he demands that you believe it is the only hand: that 50,000 years in northern climes only gave W&amp;A better farm products but imposed exactly the same evolutionary pressure on the traits called intelligence and temperment as did the tropics, even though color and bone structure diverged; that civilization, itself a radically new environment we've been undergoing seletion in for 300 generations, hasn't placed even a smidgen of differing selection pressure on intelligence and temperment than did the forest. And if the reader doesn't swallow these remarkable coincidences,so amply supported by Diamond's adroitly culled data, this book, not too subtly, calls him a racist. This book is well worth a careful read. From it one can learn many fascinating points from prehistory-I loved the explanation of the origin of the Samoans (but why was Diamond so lenient on them for destroying his favorite people-the New Guinea negritics). But remember that Diamond is on a political mission, and he is selectively using his extensive scientific background to make you believe that half of the story is the whole story. What is needed, after this book, is a for a real scientist to write a critique pointing out all the data, the literature, the disciplines that Diamond saw fit to ignore in his quest for the Liberal grail."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"Cuando empece a leerlo, no dejaba de sorprenderme por la obviedad de algunos de sus postulados, en los que sin embargo, nunca me habia detenido a pensar, y es exactamente eso lo que este se&ntilde;or hacer DETENERSE A PENSAR.

Lo recomiendo ampliamente."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"Pulitzer prize winner or not, physiology professor or not, I have serious problems with the logical processes and conclusions of Doctor Diamond.The book starts with Diamond walking along a beach in New Guinea, where he happens on a &quot;remarkable local politician named Yali.&quot; The chapter is titled &quot;Yali's Question.&quot; Yali's question was, &quot;Why is it that you white people developed so much cargo and brought it to New Guinea, but we black people had little cargo of our own?&quot; &quot;He and I,&quot; Diamond explains, &quot;both knew perfectly well that New Guineans are on the average at least as smart as Europeans.&quot;Cargo, Diamond interpreted, was the colloquial expression for &quot;steel axes, matches, and medicines to clothing, soft drinks and umbrellas.&quot; Apparently, this politician of superior intelligence was of necessity reduced to pidgin English to express his profound question.Diamond gives a one sentence summary of the book: &quot;History followed different courses for different peoples because of differences among peoples' environments, not because of biological differences among peoples themselves.&quot;In other words, all races are equal when it comes to intellectual vigor. We must not question that! Like we are all equal physically: blacks do not, on average, have longer limbs; the Japanese are not, on average, shorter in stature. It's all only skin deep. Is it okay if some of us have blond hair and blue eyes? Is that where the racial differences begin and end?It's the diet that makes the percheron bigger and stronger, the green pastures it's raised in that makes the thoroughbred fast--but, it is certainly not its genetic inheritance! All that effort to breed for speed is wasted.Professor Diamond ascribes it all to guns, germs and steel, and to the luck of the draw.&quot;The peoples of Northern Europe contributed nothing of fundamental importance to Eurasian civilization until the last thousand years; they simply had the good luck to live at a geographic location where they were likely to receive advances (such as agriculture, wheels, writing, and metallurgy) developed in warmer parts of Eurasia.&quot;Warmth apparently, according to Dr. Diamond, was an important factor:&quot;The sole North American societies to develop writing arose in Mexico south of the tropic of cancer.&quot;So, why did the sub-Saharan Africans not develop writing, or the wheel, or metal weapons and utensils on their own, while the ice-bound Scandinavians did? They certainly are from a warmer climate.He says &quot;the proximate explanations are clear: some peoples developed guns, germs and steel, and other factors conferring political and economic power before others did; and some peoples never developed these power factors at all.&quot;In that, of course, he is right. Where he is wrong, I submit, is in his conclusion that individual racial characteristics had nothing at all to do with it.The fact is that the original inhabitants of sub-Saharan Africa, even after a couple hundred years of intimate familiarization with modern machinery and European colonization in, for example, the Belgian Congo, when they achieved their &quot;freedom&quot; and took over the established infrastructure, defecated in and made campfires in the halls of plush hotels, and sold human body parts in their marketplaces. When the machinery ran out of gas, they simply left it where it stopped, unable or unwilling to maintain it.After ten or eleven generations in the United States, people of black African extraction still, on average, test out 15 points below European Americans on the Stanford-Binet IQ scale. In Africa, where there is little or no infusion of Caucasian genes, they test a full 30 points lower--on average. Asians test higher than Caucasians.Of course, intelligence is only one characteristic that varies from race to race: athleticism is another. Is it sheer coincidence that black athletes dominate many sports in the United States? Or is it because they are genetically superior to Caucasians in athletic prowess? Why do Asians, although a minority, attain more PhDs in physics and math? Is it unreasonable to grant that they are mentally superior in those areas, as a race?Racism is one thing. (The term was coined in the mid-twentieth century.) Denial of the obvious, and exercising convoluted reasoning and indulging in unreasonable, unsustainable theorizing in an attempt to avoid facing the truth in the name of Political Correctness is idiocy.This book is well-written and nicely edited, but the arguments presented are so full of holes that any freshman can see through them, without putting on his rose-colored glasses.Joseph Pierre"},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"This book dropped into my lap at exactly the right time and place, and it inspired in me a fascination for global history that has remained with me ever since.Prior to reading this brilliant book, I knew that I was supposed to believe that the hugely varying positions of different peoples in the world was nothing to do with race and genetics. But for all I knew, this was just the result of modern PC ideology, and I had yet to encounter convincing arguments supporting this view.Diamond's book was epic, and I will never forget it. Certainly, I can now see why a continent such as Australia - where to this day only the cashew nut has been successfully cultivated or domesticated of all its flora and fauna - provided little opportunity for Australian aborigines to embark on an era of dramatic population increase, technological achievement, and advanced civilisation. The point is fairly simple and obvious at heart: Give one group of people little and another group plenty, and - unless there is some way for those with little to take from those with plenty (as has happened frequently) - you can fairly much expect that those with plenty will move ahead.In 'Guns, Germs, and Steel' this logical truth is explained so thoroughly and convincingly that upon finishing this compulsive read I felt myself to be quite comfortable on the subject. It is one of those reads from which you learn an incredible amount and yet retain an incredible amount also. I cannot say enough for this book. I have known it to satisfy both laymen and academics alike and I recommend it to all."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"The author makes a compelling argument for why geography led toEuropeans getting the \\"cargo\\" as one of his friends from a lessfortunate part of the world put it.Along the way I learned some fascinating things abouthuman migrations, for example why indigenous people inFiji resemble indigenous people from sub-saharan Africainstead of Polynesians. I learned why Europeans and Asiansdomesticated horses, but Africans never domesticated zebras.I also liked that while the author clearly has deep sympathiesfor the plight of the indigenous folks across the world thatlived in areas colonized by the Europeans, the book neverdevolves into an anti-white, anti-Europe crusade. Keeping trueto his thesis, the author maintains that not only wouldthe indigenous people in the Americas, Africa, and Australiahave (eventually reached the technological levels thatEurasia did if they been isolated long enough) but ifgeographical advantages had been granted to the those threecontinents, they would have overrun Eurasia, asmercilessly as Europeans did unto America, Africam and Australia.The author also debunks the myth of indigenous peoples beingbetter stewards of the land. He points out that indigenouspeoples wiped out many of the huge mammals in the Americas thatmight have been domesticated later on. Again,it was the geographic advantages of Eurasia that allowed moremega-fauna to survive the slaughter by stone age manthan in the Americas.At the end of the book I was left with a big picture view ofhuman history that I never had before.The only defect in this book is the author's explanation forwhy China (with its higher technology duringEurope's dark ages) didn't triumph over Europe as opposed to theother way around. He offers two weak hypotheses. One is thatwe can't discount the impact of the decisions of absolutedictators, which in thecase of China, led to China destroying its Navy, and thuspreventing Asia from colonizing Europe and the Americasrather than the other way around. Another is that we haven'tquite seen final results; China may yet rise above the restof the world. The former seems like a cop out,because the thesis of the book is that geography, and geographyalone accounts for how history unfolded. As for the latter,while it is undoutably true that China has risen, this thesisis about the post-industrial age we are in now, andnot the pre-industrial and industrial ages, which was thesubject of the book.However, in the newer edition I read, the author updated itwith an epilogue with ideas from colleagues.The new thesis satisfactorily explained how geographyallowed China to turn inward, whereas geography forcedEurope to turn outward.

One interesting thing from the book is Diamond's comparison of China's technological developments to Europe's. China undertook sea exploration early in the 15th century yet desisted not long after because of an imperial edict. In Europe, Columbus was able to gain support from Spain for his voyage after first trying in a few other countries. Generally, China's unity enabled it to innovate earlier than the West, but this same unity also quelled innovation. Just one edict and innovation stopped. In Europe, however, if one country gave up on a technology, another one was likely to pick it up. There was enough communication for sharing of ideas, but not enough centralization to completely kill an idea. We'd do well to learn from this dichotomy in the current age of increased centralization of media, government, and culture."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"I found this book tremendously interesting. It tries to answer the question of why, when different cultures come into contact, one will usually take the other. For example, it asks why the Europeans defeated the Native Americans instead of the the Aztecs sailing across the ocean and colonizing Spain.I think the reason that I am so excited about this book is that I actually *learned stuff*. I never knew how or why certain animals or plants were domesticated. I never knew why the &quot;Fertile Crescent&quot; is now just a big desert. I certainly never knew that Madagascar was colonized by people from Indonesia, as opposed to people from Africa. And so on.

Geographical contingencies, then, have everything to do with early development.

While GGS can't provide a blanket answer to such questions, it does a wonderful job of explaining factors that make some civilizations work and others to fail. The majority of which I'd never even considered but Diamond lays out his reasoning in a way that is simple but effective.The berth of this book makes going into details difficult. But I did feel that Diamond did a wonderful job in presenting a lot of big ideas in such a way that any intelligent layperson could understand them and his reasoning. He only uses charts and graphs when they're really the most effective way to show what he's talking about. Too much of that sort of thing can make a book seem dusty and drive off normal readers.I don't think I can really add all that much to the praise that has been given this book already.

It begins with a black New Guinean named Yali asking the author why it is that the whites have all the \\"cargo\\" (material goods). Since it is apparent to both Yali and J. Diamond that New Guineans are at least as intelligent as whites, the author looks for environmental factors that could have shaped history in that direction.He finds quite a few: better and more numerous farmable plants in Eurasia, as well as more species of domesticable animals than elsewhere. Beginning farming leads to some kind of records for taxes, the beginnings of chiefs and government. This in turn leads to further developments.If Eurasia began with better prospective foodstuffs in the first place, it also had advantages of a larger landmass for more people and a more sophisticated government and society, more people for inventions like spears or crossbows.Germs come from domestic animals, and Eurasians had more of those. So whites' ancestors died by the millions, and those now alive have resistance to things like colds and influenza. Those germs had their first crack at native Americans in the 1490's to 1500s and wiped out many societies or their leaders (such as the Inca. The one Pizarro captured was a younger brother).Knowing where we have come from and how we got here is essential citizenship knowledge in an increasingly global society. From here, we can decide how to share existing wealth more equitably, how to educate \\"backward\\" races, and, hopefully, how to preserve the lore of aboriginal peoples. After all, if large numbers and varieties of people were so beneficial for Eurasian culture, then preserving all our global heritage will make a stronger future for everyone."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"A real reviewer once wrote: \\"Jared Diamond is suspected to be a pseudonym for a committee of experts\\". He (or she) had a point. Jared Diamond's book \\"Guns, germs and steel\\" could very well be re-titled The Book About Everything. It's a very ambitious undertaking. Essentially, the author wants to explain the main lines of human history for the past 15,000 years!The book is very interesting, and I don't doubt that Diamond is right on many points. However, I also suspect that he is just as wrong on many others. Indeed, I found myself agreeing with the author all the way until the epilogue, where he fell flat to his face. Diamond became charcoal, as it were. Still, Jared Diamond should be commended for at least trying to analyze the big issues of human history and prehistory. In that sense, \\"Guns, germs and steel\\" is a must read. (Incidentally, I know that Jared Diamond is a high-ranking professor. That just makes it more fun disagreeing with him, don't you think?)[THE QUESTIONS ADRESSED BY THE BOOK]\\"Guns, germs and steel\\" addresses the following questions. First, why did most high cultures appear in Eurasia and North Africa? Indeed, why did the first high cultures appear in these regions? Second, why where the Eurasian and North African high cultures more technologically advanced, and developed faster, than the high cultures that did appear in sub-Saharan Africa and the Americas? Third, why did no high culture ever appear in pre-colonial Australia? (I'm using the term \\"high culture\\" in a neutral sense. It's simply a culture with cities, an advanced division of labour, technology, etc.)Diamond believes that the reasons are geographical and environmental, rather than genetic or \\"racial\\". He often explicitly argues against racist arguments. This may strike a sophisticated European reader as somewhat strange, until one remembers that the racist work \\"The Bell Curve\\" was a best seller in the United States only a few years before \\"Guns, germs and steel\\" was published. Diamond doesn't like to be called an environmental determinist, but it's hard to resist the temptation to call him precisely that. At the very least, he is strongly influenced by such ideas.[THE ROLE OF DOMESTICATED ANIMALS AND PLANTS]Diamond points out that many species of animals and plants in Eurasia could be domesticated. This was not true in America, Africa and Australia. There were no large mammals in America and Australia at all. Africa is teeming with large mammals but, by a curious accident, virtually none can be domesticated. Attempts to domesticate zebras or antelopes have all failed. This means that Eurasia got a head start in developing agriculture and the kind of massive food production necessary to sustain a high culture.Eurasia also got the better deal in terms of technology. Large domesticated animals are needed to pull wagons. The wheel was therefore invented in Eurasia. The Aztec empire didn't have such animals (none were available), so naturally they never used wheels. In the same way, domestication of animals also paved the way for military success. Europeans and Asians had a cavalry. The Aztecs and Incas had none, and where thus quickly overwhelmed by the Spanish. Diamond points out, somewhat sarcastically, that if rhinos could be domesticated, Africans would have conquered the world!Another factor is germs. Many epidemic diseases originally comes from \\"our\\" animals. Europeans therefore had a certain immunity against diseases such as smallpox, whereas American Indians had none. The Aztecs and the Incas were defeated in part because of smallpox epidemics, to which the Spaniards had a higher immunity. (Conversely, one of the reasons why it took Europeans so long to conquer Africa or reach the interior of New Guinea, was European non-resistance to malaria.)[GEOGRAPHICAL FACTORS FAVOURING DIFFUSION, etc]Another factor favouring Eurasia is the east-west orientation of the vast Eurasian landmass. This made it easy for domesticated plants from the Middle East to be introduced into southern Europe, India or China. All these areas have basically the same climate. It's also (relatively) easy to travel between Europe and Asia, facilitating cultural diffusion. America, by contrast, has a north-south orientation. Also, the various parts of the Americas used to be more isolated from each other due to various geographical factors. This made cultural diffusion more difficult. When the Spanish landed in Peru and attacked the Inca empire, the Incas apparently had no idea that Mexico had already been conquered by Spain! The Inca ruler Atahuallpa naively assumed that Pizarro was just a raider who could be bought off with gold. He never realized that the conquistadors were there to stay.Diamond also points out that Australia and some parts of North America were unsuitable for agriculture, or at least for advanced agriculture. This explains why the Aborigines never developed a high culture. The hunter-gatherer lifestyle was the only feasible one under Australian conditions. Unless, of course, you have *already* developed a high culture, which could then simply be transplanted to Australia, as the English eventually did. But even with such a culture, surviving in Australia wasn't easy. The White explorers who attempted to cross Australia's hinterland fared less well than the Aborigines, since Western technology didn't do much good in the outback. As for the Tasmanians, their extremely low level of technology is due to Tasmania's isolation from the rest of the world. Other isolated cultures also regressed technologically. The Chapham Islands is another example.But what about cultural factors? Diamond believes that some cultures are indeed more conservative, while others are more innovative. Here, he strays from \\"environmental determinism\\", since he attributes these factors to local idiosyncrasies. However, the sheer number of cultures that can be reached by cultural diffusion was higher in Eurasia than in America or Australia. Therefore, cultural innovation nevertheless became more likely in the Eurasian context.[A PROBLEMATIC EPILOGUE]So far, I think Diamond has made an eloquent case. The problem comes in the epilogue, where he tries to wrap up his theory, and connect the broad geographic-environmental perspective with questions about contingency, the role of individuals in world history, etc. He never really succeeds in this. In this last section of the book, Diamond also attempts to answer a fourth question: Why did the western part of the Eurasian landmass, the backwater known as Europe, eventually overtake not only America, Africa and Australia, but also Asia? After all, China, India and the Muslim world had an enormous head start compared to Europe. Then, something happened, around AD 1500.To Diamond, Europe's eventual dominance over Asia can also be explained by environmental and geographic factors. This is not convincing at all. Diamond is right to point out that the decentralized character of 15th century Europe actually worked in Columbus' favour, since the Italian adventurer could lobby a large amount of kings and princes with his proposal for a westward voyage to \\"India\\". In China, by contrast, the centralized form of government proved disadvantageous to Chinese expansionism - when the emperor ordered that China shouldn't expand, that was it. The problem is that Diamond explains the centralization of China and the decentralization of Europe as inevitable consequences of geography. I beg to disagree. I consider it a contingent fact.Europe was united for centuries by the Romans. Diamond writes that \\"only\\" half of Europe was under Roman control. True, but surely it was the better half! What if the Muslims had defeated Charles Martell or (much later) conquered Vienna? Then, large parts of Europe would once again have become \\"united\\". Diamond also writes that Napoleon and Hitler never united Europe. I don't know much about the Napoleonic wars, but Hitler *did* come very close to winning World War Two. There simply aren't any major geographical obstacles to uniting the important parts of Europe. Conversely, there have been periods in Chinese history when China was divided in many small states. That decentralization worked in Colombus' favour was also a contingent fact. After all, the Catholic monarchs of Spain almost rejected him as well. And what if the Europeans had decided to appease the Ottomans instead of fighting them? Then, Europe would have lost interest in westward journeys. Another curious argument put forward by the author is that deforestation in the Middle East made the centre of power move westward, to Greece and Rome, and then to northern Europe. This is a blatantly Euro-centric argument: in reality, Persia was just as strong as the Roman Empire, the Arabs were stronger than the \\"empires\\" of medieval Europe, and the Ottoman Empire was strongest during the 16th century, and it was still quite powerful two centuries later, i.e. during the same time as the European powers expanded internationally.Thus, I can't see how \\"macroevolutionary\\" factors of geography or environment can explain why Europe managed to get ahead of the Muslims, Indians and Chinese.Finally, there seems to be a curious tendency in Jared Diamond's later book \\"Collapse\\" to reverse environmental determinism in favour of a different perspective, zooming in on various idiosyncratic cultural factors.Still, I regard Professor Diamond (or should I call him Jared?) as a highly erudite and stimulating author, and recommend his books to everyone interested in world history."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"Simply stated: This book is a must read.

Yes. But, that topic only covers about one or two pages and in no way damages the overall theme of his book (so I would suggest ignoring that point).

I love how he shows that some societies \\"progessed\\" from the \\"stone age\\" etc. but then \\"reverted\\" when they found themselves in new terrain. Many stories like this demonstrate the fragility of the old argument that \\"nation building\\" and movement from \\"hunting/gathering\\" to \\"industrial society\\" were the true measures of a given people's innate abilities.So, while I feel humanity is in Mr. Diamond's debt for this invaluable service, I have to say this book is so densely written that it was not a pleasure to read. If you are reading this, Jared, or if your publishers are, consider rewriting the book to not hurt so much. I'm not one who finds most books difficult at all-I almost never struggle to get through any sort of book, but this book was so dry in places, which was sad considering the power and import of its argument.It gave me a headache, and that's just not acceptable for a book with a thesis so important. That's all I can say. I want people to read this book: college students, scientists, historians, average Joes and Janes. That will not happen if you don't attempt a rewrite of your central thesis in a more accessible style-I'm a grad student and certainly read more dense stuff than the average reader, so you can trust me when I say this book has to be fixed in terms of literary style.If you truly care about making your views available to the public at large you will take that advice.But for its overall value to humanity I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"Diamond's contributions to the understanding of the forces of geology and food production are important, but he seems to completely miss the point regarding other patterns which shape the direction of history. &quot;Nonzero : The Logic of Human Destiny&quot; by Robert Wright is a much more enjoyable and enlightening read."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"An interesting analysis of history. A little repetative at times. The question that came to me as I finished this book: Just how relavant this is today? Is geography and food production still an important factor in cultural dominance or has Technology - especially Telecommunication and Transportation technologies - negated or replaced these factors so important to our past."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"Jared Diamond is the most fascinating public intellectual out there, even though he comes from disciplines that I as an arrogant physicist never regarded as remotely interesting, such as botany or geography. I'd much rather attend a lecture by Diamond than, say Steven Hawking or Edward Witten.What he does in this landmark book is weave together knowledge from a diverse set of seemingly unrelated disciplines, and form a lucid and scientifically compelling thesis as to why civilizations arising on the Eurasian landmass got a crucial early developmental leg up on those in Africa, the Americas or Australia.To think that the fate of civilizations would depend on things as mundane as the types of native grains available and diseases incubated in domestic animals was to me quite revelatory and to others, apparently quite disturbing, as evidenced by the number of nitpicking and irrational negative reviews this book has attracted. I guess for some people it's more important to feel they are special than to learn something about how the world works.Diamond's analysis does become somewhat less compelling when he attempts to explain comparative differences in more advanced societies (i.e. China vs. Europe), though it's still worth reading.In other words, I liked this book."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"A satisfying read for anyone interested in history, anthropology, or the origins of man. Mr. Diamond treats historical analysis as a scientific journey, while adding personal perspective derived from spending significant time in rather diverse cultures.There is some focus on the author's life experiences (as the many reviews mentioning New Guinea point out). But these are anecdotes used to strengthen theories put forth based on reasonable evidence. On the theory side, the author's varied life experiences and academic cross-training allow the creation of a work with unusally broad perspective.Subjects are treated in a reasoned and balanced manner. From my reading, reviewers' concerns of political bias are largely unfounded. For example, regarding the book's statements about \\"the potential for superior natural selection of raw intelligence in New Guinea\\" -- if the author wanted to glorify New Guinean societies as the pinnacle of human achievement, he probably wouldn't have spent so much time discussing their tendencies cannibalism.This is not an exhaustive treatment on the origins of man, the rise of societies, or anything else; the author says many times that he's painting with a broad brush to illuminate patterns. He does a good job of maintaining a high-altitude view that avoids getting lost in the details, but some may feel that important details are glossed over.The book won't change your life, but it is an interesting read that may give you a new perspective on some aspects of it."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"The reviews of this seem to jump around from really positive to downright nasty. This strikes me as being more a measure of the reviewers' agendas then reasonable measures of the book. I come at it from the standpoint of a lay person, with no real knowledge about this topic but with the interest of a fairly intelligent person. As such, I find the book really compelling, thoughtful, interesting. Many of Diamond's theories make sense to me and I'm glad to have had them explained. He touches on so many things that there's something of interest for everyone. I bet that even the people who think this was \\"boring, boring, boring\\" have left it with ideas in their head that they wouldn't have had otherwise. This is the sort of book that you can't help mentioning again and again in casual conversation. That's what I love about it. It activates and spurs thoughts and makes one excited about knowledge.The things I'm critical of aren't that big a deal. I don't always find Diamond easily readable. This book is somewhere between a popular book and a text book, but it's not exactly either. There are a lot of \\"as I mentioned in the previous chapter and will cover in more depth in chapter eight\\" sort of moments, and this can feel a bit repetive. Also, time and again he poses questions, talks about possible answers, then heads off on to the next thing. There's very little feeling of closure, except in the way he comes back again and again to his fundamental theories.But anyway, if this topic interests you this book will not disappoint. I thank the author for writing it, and after I've let my mind drain a bit I'll probably pick up his new book, Collapse."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"Guns, Germs, and Steel has an ambitious goal-to explain why the world is the way it is (and, importantly, why it isn't remarkably different), in less than 500 pages. Thirteen thousand years of human history, written by a biologist/molecular physiologist rather than a historian. It's an amazingly dense piece of work; it's intelligent and interesting to read yet not so easy to &quot;get into.&quot; I love these types of books-yet this one took me over a month to finish.Jared Diamond seeks to explain why Eurasians conquered most of the world-why the winners won instead of the other way around. His thesis is spelled out pretty completely in the title: the winners won not because of genetics as much as opportunity: they won because they had seeds (agriculture), resistance to germs, guns, and steel. Each of these intercepted with the others-for example, immunity to germs, such as smallpox, was obtained by working with domestic and farm animals; animals that weren't around the inhabitants of the New World.Diamond also tackles race head-on (yes, in a politically correct sort of way). He points out that genetics definitely helps confer an advantage to some groups (West African's resistance to malaria, for example), and that these advantages 'overuled' the military advantage of the Europeans in some cases. Aside from these examples, Diamond is leery to talk about neuro-biodiversity. I'm not, by any stretch of the imagination, claiming any race holds genetic *superiority* over another, but the *differences* in ethnic diversity are important to consider. Biologists, in particular, should be able to do this without fear of being labeled a racist, despite the abominable history of eugenics.In the end, we have to remember that Diamond is not a historian. What he offers us here is a remarkable look at where the human race has been, and a plausible theory as to our routes through history. He did miss the boat on the FATES of society though--the future has yet to be written. Although the book was difficult to wade through, it was worth reading, and deserving of its Pulitzer Prize."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"Jared Diamond does not explain why everything in the world is the way it is today, but he does a very good job explaining how a few basic environmental factors broadly shaped the distribution of power among peoples from the earliest dates in human civilization. The powers that he mentions (in Part 3 of the book) are those of advanced weaponry, writing systems that made communication more efficient, immunity to disease, and complex political organization. What makes this book so interesting, though, is his discussion of the role of agriculture, animal domestication, and geographic location in creating a setting that favored or hindered the development and proliferation of &quot;guns, germs, and steel.&quot; The first part of the book introduces the reader to this idea, but it is he second part of the book, &quot;The Rise and Spread of Food Production,&quot; that explains it and thus encompasses most of the premise upon which the book builds.The fourth part of the book is a series of quick case studies where Diamond shows his thesis in action. It is not without value since it is empirical evidence for his theory, but it becomes a little repetitive and the joy of discovering new knowledge fades. And I agree with others who thought Diamond's political correctness a little distracting. Nonetheless, it is enlightening and fun to read and what more can one ask for than that?"},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"I wish this book had been around 30 years ago when I sat through an unsatisfying course known as \\"World History\\" (it was actually just a history of Western Eurasia!). Since I was very impressed by Jared Diamond's earlier work \\"The Third Chimpanzee\\" I hoped this work would equal it. It surpasses it! (In scope, clarity of thought and expression, and overarching unity it reminds me of Darwin's \\"Origin of Species.\\") This book examines the last 13,000 years of human history, and seeks to explain the rise of civilizations -- analyzing the environmental and ecological engines driving the process. One way to capture Diamond's investigative method (and his charming writing style) is to read his chapter titles and/or subtitles. Some examples: \\"Why the Inca emperor Atahuallpa did not capture King Charles I of Spain\\"; \\"Lethal Gift of Livestock: The evolution of germs\\"; \\"How China Became Chinese\\"; \\"How Africa Became Black\\"; \\"How to Make An Almond: The unconscious development of ancient crops\\"; \\"From Egalitarianism to Kleptocracy: The evolution of government and religion\\". If these give a macro view of this book, let's take some excerpts to see it in microscopic detail: (p. 260) \\"Our adoption of food production, which required us to remain close to our crops, orchards, and stored food surpluses [was linked to] sedentary living [which] was decisive for the history of technology, because it enabled people to accumulate non-portable possessions. Nomadic hunter-gatherers are limited to technology that can be carried. If you move often and lack vehicles or draft animals, you confine your possessions to babies, weapons, and a bare minimum of other absolute necessities small enough to carry. You can't be burdened with pottery and printing presses.... \\" Yes, Diamond's uses his subtle wit to make points succinctly and tellingly! He also uses 21 maps, 13 figures and tables, and 39 photographs to illustrate complex information simply. The photographs depict the splendorous variety of human types, giving lie to the inadequate standard racial categories of Caucasian, Black, Asiatic, and Aborigine. The maps depict the spread not only of wave after waves of human populations and languages, but also of their cultivated crops and livestock. This book is a splendid synthesis. Bring a highlighter (or pencil to underline) and travel through a fascinating voyage in \\"World History\\" -- as I wished I had studied it 30 years ago!"},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"After reading the first chapter, I had a feeling that this would be a very interesting book, and I was right.

The book is absolutely worth a read and while not a radical departure from other works on the subject (McNiel sp?), it is much more readable."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"I have some concerns with respect to the credibility of the book: \\"Guns, Germs and Steel\\" by Jared Diamond. I felt that I had to \\"second guess\\" most of his evidence, because it was ambiguous, incomplete or false.Firstly, Diamond uses the term \\"Eurasian\\" to describe cultures and societies, when the term is usually used to describe a geographical landmass or tectonic plates. Throughout the book, he uses the term \\"Eurasian\\" when it supports his hypothesis and replaces the term with European or western Eurasian to support another part of his thesis. He doesn't separate Europe and Asia to explain societies and cultures, even though Europe and Asia contain different religions, cultures and languages but separates \\"North Africa\\" from \\"Sub-Saharan Africa\\" even though they are part of the same continental landmass and have more commonalties. On pg. 161, Diamond attempts to explain his reasoning behind using the broad and vague term \\"Eurasian\\", when he states that: \\"my use of the term \\"Eurasia\\" includes in several cases North Africa, which biogeographically and in many aspects of human culture is more closely related to Eurasia than to sub-Saharan Africa\\". I believe Diamond confuses contemporary North African culture with the cultures that inhabited Northern Africa from 10,000 BC to 8th century AD. For example, from pre-dynastic to the mid-late stages of the Ancient Egyptian civilization, the ancient Egyptians had contact and traded with cultures in Ethiopia (sub-Saharan Africa). The Ancient Egyptian and Amharic language (Ethiopia) belong to the same language group which is Afro-Asiatic, and also belong to the same sub language group, which is Semitic. Diamond makes vague generalities in supporting his thesis and fails to engage significant evidence that challenges his thesis.When studying the development of different cultures and the spread of food production and technology, he alters the definition of different terms to fit his hypothesis. Any hypothesis can be supported if you constantly change the variables you are testing. I found that part the most distracting. He does this with the terms \\"North African\\" and \\"Sub-Saharan African\\", terms that carried little meaning between 13,000 BC until the 7th century, but are used to separate the significant accomplishments of Ancient Egyptians (Africans) with other Africans. On p. 92, he states that: \\"the availability of domestic plants and animals ultimately explains why empires, literacy, and steel weapons developed earliest in Eurasia and later, or not at all, on other continents.\\" That statement is false, since written records of the Ancient Egyptian (African) language have been dated from about 3200 BC, making it the oldest and longest documented language. The Sumerian language, as Diamond claims is the oldest language, developed around 3000 BC. Furthermore, a recent archeological discovery has suggested that some Gerzean pottery with early hieroglyphics located in Egypt could have originated since 4000 BC.Ancient Egyptians were also the first to develop mathematic concepts (ie. Decimal system) and science (ie. astronomy, medicine) during that time period as well, and significantly influenced Greek science and mathematics. Diamond does not mention any of this and I believe that he leaves out significant achievements by non-Europeans to support his thesis.Throughout the book, Diamond also poses the following question in the background: \\"Why were Eurasians, rather than Native Americans or sub-Saharan Africans, the ones to invent firearms, oceangoing ships, and steel equipment?\\" But Diamond doesn't engage the most basic question relating to the motives of these cultures: Did Native Americans or Sub-Saharan Africans have a need for firearms/oceangoing ships? More to the point, did the Native Americans, sub-Saharan Africans, and other so-called non-Eurasians, want firearms/oceangoing ships? The answer would have forced Diamond to research the cultures and religions of Native Americans and Sub-Saharan Africans in more detail, rather than explaining it with geography and/or food production.Also, he does not include the significant accomplishments of Ancient Egypt, including papyrus, an early form of paper, that originated in Africa not Europe or Asia. On pg. 190, Diamond states that: \\"Continental differences in axis orientation affected the diffusion not only of food production but also of other technologies and inventions.\\" It is known that Ancient Egyptian technology including scientific/medical discoveries traveled along the north/south axis towards the Middle-east and eventually to ancient Greece. Diamond doesn't mention any of this, which further questions the credibility of the book.Another problem with Diamond's style is that he seems to negate the influences of Non-Europeans, specifically Africa and China, to the current Western hegemony, ie.) gunpowder from China, natural resources from Africa, by either not mentioning them at all or underemphasizing their importance. It is quite likely that without the influences from non-European civilizations that current Western hegemony would not exist today. He also makes outright false statements such as in p.247 when he states that: \\"Delivered in grenades, rockets, and torpedoes, those incendiaries played a key role in Islam's eventual defeat of the Crusaders.\\" According to historical records, there is no evidence to suggest that grenades, rockets and torpedoes were used during the Crusades.I agree that the domestication of plants and animals could predispose agriculturalists to further development, however geography and domestication of animals and plants alone is insufficient to support his thesis without explaining the role of the people and societies occupying the geography. Geography might be a factor to explain how Western Civilization became the dominant civilization in the world today, however European civilization did not arise in a vacuum. Regardless of the probable geographic advantage of Europe and Asia, factors such as political intentions, morals, ethics, religion and culture all served to explain why some civilizations were determined to expand and build empires through conquest, while others did not.Jared Diamond is an evolutionary biologist and biogeographer by training, however he deals with subjects that he is not qualified to address, such as history, anthropology, archeology, and sociology to name a few. Diamond claims that his theories offer an alternative explanation to traditional racist dogma, however I believe his theories do just the opposite. By stating that Europeans developed into the dominant civilization by \\"chance\\" or \\"luck\\" with respect to geography, strengthens racist theories that European civilization was \\"destined\\" to become the most powerful.My criticisms have nothing to do with \\"political correctness\\", but rather I take issue with Diamond's style of revisionist history that does not emphasize the influence and significance of non-European civilizations towards current Western civilization. While reading the book, I was constantly second guessing the facts of Jared Diamond because they were either inaccurate or ambiguous."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"Diamond begins by describing a question asked of him by a friend, who wondered from whence come economic disparities among the nations of the world. This book is Diamond's attempt to answer his friend's question.Jared Diamond's thesis is that the technological and economic status of societies today is a function of their geographical history, and not the result of differences between various peoples with regard to innate ability or intelligence. According to Diamond the major points are:1. Technologically advanced civilizations could not form in hunter-gatherer societies for the simple reason that innovation requires a certain amount of free time, which is made available (at least to a privileged class) in agrarian cultures, and is rare to non-existent among hunter-gatherers.2. The ability to form an agrarian culture depends largely upon the availability of animals and plants suitable for domestication. There are great differences among geological areas with regard to the available plants and animals that are suitable for domestication, with the Fertile Crescent being among the most endowed. Other characteristics making the Fertile Crescent ideal include a long east-west axis and a Mediterranean climate.The availability of plants and animals suitable for domestication provided the launching pad for civilizations to grow, and their advantages multiplied. The agrarian culture gave rise to a privileged class that had the time and resources to spend intellectual capital inventing new machines and technologies. These societies also led to dense populations, which led to the evolution of diseases that were fatal to hunter-gatherers when they made their first contact with Europeans (witness the deaths of millions of Native Americans due to smallpox and other diseases brought over from Europe). The twin benefits of technologies such as guns and steel, along with germs proved to be an insurmountable advantage over which hunter-gatherer societies across the world crumbled.Diamond's motivation is clearly driven (at least in part) by a desire to refute racists who argue that differences in wealth and technology among various peoples is a consequence of differences in intelligence. Diamond argues that effects attributable to natural surroundings alone are sufficient to account for such disparities, and he considers racist explanations offensive. For example, on page 19 Diamond says:\\"The objection to such racist explanations is not just that they are loathsome, but also that they are wrong. Sound evidence for the existence of human differences in intelligence that parallel human differences in technology is lacking.\\"Diamond is an enthusiastic contributor in the war against racism, but this revolution, like all others, has its excesses. While the current revolution eschews racism against people of color, it has no compunction against making negative racist generalizations regarding whites, and white men in particular. Consider the fact that, just after making his assertion that racist explanations are \\"loathsome,\\" Diamond utters this absurdity\\"\\"In fact, as I shall explain in a moment, modern \\"Stone Age\\" peoples are on the average probably more intelligent, not less intelligent, than industrialized peoples.\\" [page 19]Diamond's racism is both morally disappointing and factually incorrect. He justifies his assertion about less intelligent industrialized peoples with arguments to the effect that watching too much television (among other things) lowers the IQ of youth in industrialized societies. His argument is ad hoc to the core and factually incorrect. Using Diamond's line of reasoning, IQ trends in industrialized countries should be declining, but they are, fact, increasing. Scientists even have a name for this trend, it's called the Flynn effect, and it amounts to an increase in IQ of about 3 points per decade.Though the cause of the Flynn effect is not fully understood, and many explanations are controversial, Diamond's explanation for why the trend should be going the opposite direction is unpersuasive and incomplete at best. Making matters worse is the fact that Diamond's display of racism comes at the very beginning of the book - leaving the reader wondering what other persuasive-sounding arguments in the book are as fatally flawed.Over all I believe that Diamond has provided a convincing argument explaining why civilizations arose at different times in different places across the globe. But there are times when his exclusive focus on geographical issues seemed overbearing. For example, he barely mentions possible influences caused by different types of governments. Are some better than others? Similarly, he largely ignores cultural effects, but is it possible that some cultures foster inquiry, thrift, industriousness, and curiosity more than others? Religion is yet another unexplored dimension. Are some religions (or none at all) more conducive to the development of advanced civilizations that others?Diamond seems to be aware of these missing dimensions, as he touches on them briefly in the epilog and afterword. But these comments seem half hearted and designed mostly to broaden his readership by convincing business leaders that \\"Guns, Germs, and Steel\\" describes broad principles that can be used to run a successful company.I should be cautious with my criticism, though. This is a long book about a complex subject that, no doubt, excites a lot of emotional responses. While Diamond clearly brings his biases, don't we all? Diamond, at least, has made a concerted, logical, and in-depth attempt at explaining some very important aspects of the development of human civilizations. The book is full of fascinating insights into the seemingly minor differences that undoubtedly contributed significantly to the disparate trajectories of various societies, resulting in the gulfs that separate them today. Hats off for a wonderful book that was a pleasure to read, and really made me sit up and think."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"While the premise for Guns, Germs and Steel is interesting and certainly intrigued me enough to buy the book, I found the author pedantic, repetitive and generally uninteresting in his presentation. I was turned off by Diamond's assumption that his reader was not only naive enough to think that the current social/economic position held by Whites represents the pinnacle of modern society (suggesting, in fact, that no one else can usurp this distinction) but that the only way he could effectively convey his theory is through the condescending, over-enunciated manner he chose to use.Had this book been written in a previous time period, Diamond's theory would be useless-- reference the eras dominated by the Huns, Ottomans and even Illyrians of Alexander the Great. Further, every indication of present society leans towards the fact that the changing, integrating face of the world leaves even more doubt that whites will remain the supreme race from which Diamond basis his premise.My main objection to this work, however, remains his tone which is far too supercilious for the product of thought he actually produces. I was turned off by his attempt at being overly academic in his explanations of his theory while at the same time continuously repeating what he was going to tell me. I felt as though I were reading someone's poorly written thesis about a topic no one was really interested in instead of a work that won a Pulitzer Prize. How disappointing. Don't buy this book. If you feel you must read it, save your money and borrow it from the library."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"Fascinating topic, unbelievably rambling writing style. Author does an OK job following his various lines of argument, to the point you believe him, but I was very bothered by two things in his writing (aside from the incessant rambling). The first was the absence of a recognition that chance must have played a big role in where we ended up ... but the author seems convinced that the reader needs a rational, pattern-based explanation for everything. That is tantamount to biological determinism. There couldn't be an explanation for EVERYTHING. The second &quot;bother&quot; is that the author never, never ever, has an alternative explanation for anything. It would help alot if we had an idea of what the realm of &quot;scholarly debate&quot; on some of these topics is. Yet the book is written as if nobody else ever investigated these issues, and came up with an equally compelling argument contrary to this author's. The author seems intellectually honest enough to recognize that there are other explanations for things, but he spends no time exploring those other explanations in his rush to come up with a believable explanation of his own. Alot of the foregoing could be forgiven if only the book was well written."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"About the most anti-scientific and anti-historic thing you can do when writing a book is to make up theories and philosophies that you think would be nice and then \\"fill in the blanks\\" by using selective evidence and interpreting it in your own way to suit your assumptions. Selecting the arguments to fit the theory. Unfortunately, this is what it seems Jared Diamond is doing the whole way through this book.The entire book is for me a dramatic crusade by Jared Diamond to prove that he's not prejudiced against non-white people and trying to show how genes didn't play an influence AT ALL on civilisation and farming. He says that people from New Guinea are much smarter than europeans and he even goes so far as to put pictures of his friends from New Guinea in the book and dedicating the book to them (he does have pictures of people from other races as well). Many pages in this book could just as well be huge print of: \\"Look at me! I'm not a racist. I'm saying the non-whites are there by environment alone.\\"But his propensity for arguing like this reveals a more insidious presumption on his part. He presumes that people who would choose to be hunter-gatherers simply because they wanted to, would be inferior. He is blatantly heavily prejudiced against the hunter-gatherer way of life, and for the farming way of life. Even more so is he against people who are less intelligent than others by continually talking about the \\"ingenuity\\" of farming and continually implying that to paraphrase: \\"farming the land shows superiority if it were the same environment, but the environment is very different throughout the world\\".So unfortunately at every opportunity, Diamond lets his emotions get in the way of real science and critical thinking. His arguments are pretty pathetic in my view. There could be any number of reasons why farming took off in, as he continually calls it \\"eurasia\\", and a lot less in other places. Who really cares why it took off there? Nobody is going around saying \\"civilisation started in eurasia first therefore we're more intelligent and somehow deserve more\\".I picked up this book hoping it would do as the cover stated, give me \\"a short history of everybody for the past 13,000 years\\". I didn't realise it was simply a crusade using (in my view) highly spurious and unfalsifiable arguments with one single goal in mind: to convince readers that genes don't make any difference at all.This is what a typical argument in the book goes like: \\"such and such people near eurasia discovered the Superior farming method of living 6,000 years ago, while these other people near them only developed it 2,500 years ago. The lands appear similar, everything appears similar, so what happened?\\" Here nearly any prudent person would shrug and simply say \\"I don't know, it could be for any reason\\", but not Diamond. He then adds something like: \\"The answer lies not in that they're not as ingenius a race at all, it's because locusts would eat all their crops\\". Sometimes he even adds: \\"I know this sounds surprising/bizarre\\".I simply cannot put any confidence in a man who for instance claims that the reason for the QWERTY take-over was to try to slow down typists. It's a well-known fact that it was to prevent jamming of the keys, that's why keys that were often used weren't placed close together. Jared Diamond also claims this to be \\"funny\\", but I found nothing funny about his made-up reasoning. He also said that a new keyboard layout has been developed that allows typists to type TWICE AS FAST as with 95% less effort!!! Imagine that, at least 120 words per minute with 95% less effort. How can anyone take a man who makes these sort of incredulous and arbitrary and just plain wrong claims on such simple things that we're all familiar with seriously on anything?! There are a number of examples throughout the book where I happened to have extra knowledge on the subject and was startled at some of his assertions. I cannot put any credibility in such a man.So for conclusions such as that hunter-gatherer tribes are exceptionally egalatarian, and that the more densely populated a region is the less egalatarian it is: I simply can not afford a bone in my body to trusting this man's conclusion on anything, especially something political like that, given the rest of the book. Perhaps they aren't egalatarian at all (chimpanzees aren't), but Diamond just didn't see the rankings and relations within the tribes properly or didn't want to see them. There is nothing good or bad about rankings/egalatarianism, they both have a purpose. If Diamond wasn't so set on demonizing and politicising things I might have a reasonable amount of faith in his conclusion.I did learn a few things from it and I like reading real history about this type of stuff, that's why I give it a 2 rather than a 1. But leave the pseudorational arguments out of it.I'll leave you with this example quotation: \\"In short, Europe's colonization of Africa had nothing to do with differences between European and African peoples themselves, as white racists assume.\\" Charming!"},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"Diamond has created a theory in which the reasons for the rise of Western European society and its world dominance are explained.

However, other chapters are brutally slow, and you can't help but let you mind wander.Religon is virtually ignored for any of his analysis, except that certain religons helped to provide a social framework, which allowed for more structured societies. I guess from an anthroplogist perspective the views of religon are irrelevant in the rise and fall of societies.Don't get me wrong... this is a thought provoking book. And I feel important in having a basic understanding of why we are what we are. Does it mean everything is completely factually correct? No.... I'd be willing to bet there are some errors (although it is far beyond my ability to point individual flaws). My best guess at an &quot;Error&quot; is his analysis that geography as the main predictor of technological break throughs(as other reviewers have pointed out). However, I think that the Catholic Church proved to be pretty adept at bottling up technology (at least that was the case about 600 years ago!)And yes, it does seem like Mr. Diamond has a bit of an agenda. However, despite what agenda he made of had (what author writes without ANY agenda?) I feel that he tried to be sincere. Through his effort we have a very realistic analysis of how we may have gotten from the Garden of Eden (my words and not his) to New York City.So there you have it! All tied up into four stars (not 5 because of the occassional dullness factor). Certainly not a read for everyone, but one that history buffs may enjoy!"},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"This was a loooong book, and I would not reccomend reading all of it.

Jared Diamond argues, in effect, that the giant Eurasian continent (Europe and Asia combined) was predestined to take over the world. Everything conspired in its favor: climate, vegetation, population distribution, mineral resources and even bacteria. Compare Eurasia and Australia, for example, and you find that when humans evolved to the point of beginning agriculture, Eurasia had dozens of varieties of natural grains that could feed humans and a dozen potential draft and food animals. Australia had only two puny proto-grains and no potential draft animals. No contest. Eurasia developed settled agriculture, food surpluses, dense populations, cities and complex social organizations. Due to climate and landform zones, Eurasian civilizations were then able to share inventions and culture with each other by trade or conquest, whereas complex civilizations that developed elsewhere, such as those of the Aztecs and Incas, remained relatively isolated. Even the types of germs conspired to \\"favor\\" European and Asian expansion. The virulent types of bacteria that developed among dense human populations in interaction with animal populations wiped out low-density indigenous societies on other continents when Europeans explored and settled new lands. On the other hand, non-Eurasian germs brought back from Africa and the New World had little impact in Eurasia. Even if you don't agree with the hypothesis, Diamond has given us a fact-crammed, yet very readable book that won a Pulitzer Prize."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"After reading GGS, everything about ancient history makes sense and most of the pieces fall into place.

Also, I wish the role of religions in ancient societies, in particular how some religions fulfilled a necessary role to put some kind of order and introduce \\"moral values\\". How were religions born? But then, this would certainly deserve another book in itself.I actually started with a borrowed printed copy, but found out my handling through the days was damaging the book and I might not be able to finish it before having to return it.

He helps us understand why some of us have been luckier to evolve to modern health, safety, and comforts than others. No wonder he's a Pulizer Prize winner. I've enjoyed Collapse and this book, and find myself reading parts of them over and over. Certainly our future as a civilization is helped by better understanding why previous cultures/civilizations failed. But we do need to listen, learn, and seek (nonpartisan/mutually beneficial) solutions as to how to correct our path before we can succeed in assuring our collective future."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"If you like to ask \\"why\\" questions, this book is for you. Jared Diamond answers why some societies succeeded and why some, like the Mayans or Aztecs, didn't. I don't want to give away the book, but here are some examples that he uses:* Agricultural societies could store food. Storing food enabled them to have people who specialized in something besides food gathering, like writing or medicine or fighting.* Storing food allowed them to conquer other societies because they could take their food along and so they didn't need to stop fighting to gather food.* Keeping animals brought a lot of diseases. The people that kept the animals eventually became immune to most of the diseases but they would bring those diseases (like smallpox) to other societies and it would wipe them out.Jared Diamond also spends time explaining that he doesn't think industrialized societies are necessarily any better than hunter-gather societies - hunter-gatherers might have actually been healthier, taller, stronger - but he is just explaining why some succeed and others die out.It's a very interesting book and worth reading if you like knowing why things happened the way they did."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"Considering that the \\"Great Leap Forward\\" - when modern day human beings became fully physically and mentally equipped and developed language - occurred some 50,000 years ago in East Africa, and that all of those descendants spread from one origin, it is not unreasonable to consider environmental reasons as being the sole contributor to subsequent differences. Otherwise, what else would be the cause? Divine intervention? But the European colonists of the New World and other places such as Africa and the Far East had their own views. They assumed that differences in culture and technology were more than anything attributable to innate ability. The philosophy of survival of the fittest tended to promote that notion.The author notes that we do not know for sure that there was one origin for modern humans. There could have been a parallel developments. That possibility as well as consideration for the speed of evolutionary changes leaves room for a case that biological differences could be a factor in explaining why some people in one region in one time period developed technology at a faster rate than other people in other regions. The author acknowledges that it is an open question as to how much of an effect geography or environment has had on human development. One very persuasive element for him concerns his considerable experience with primitive type people in New Guinea. His work with the natives there leads him to believe that those people have a practical intelligence which is as high or higher as other more advanced people.As an excellent example of an incident of common origination in human history, the author cites the Polynesian people and their settlement of a wide expanse of Pacific islands before any other external influence. Here we can see the strong influence of environment within a smaller geographic scale than the entire world. The Polynesians, who settled on the largest and richest islands, developed the most advanced societies.The book compels the reader to think about how the geography of the largest land masses -the Americas, Euroasia, Africa, and Australia - influenced technological development and spread of power and influence. The fact that the Fertile Crescent was a home to an extravagant number of big-seeded wild grains was a big reason why it became the locus for the first known food production. Other places in the world well suited to farming, such as Central Valley in California, did not have the same wealth of wild, domesticable plants, and therefore were not farmed until much later. The rise of farming allowed specialization, and the geography of Euroasia allowed a east-west spread along a favorable climate zone. Also, Eurasia contained more domesticable animals, much than on the other land masses. All of these favorable factors allowed Eurasia a huge head start in the ability to invent new technologies and thus spread its influence.Beyond controversy, this book has a wealth of information concerning geography, climate, linguistics, archeology, evolution, and technology; and it has fascinating facts concerning the history of human adaptation to the environment. For example, there are only two places in the history of the world - Mesopotamia sometime before 3000 B.C and the Mexicans sometime before 600 B.C - where writing is known for certain to have originated. A number of interesting questions are answered at least in part: such as, why were oak trees never domesticated for their acorns, whereas almonds, which are toxic in their natural environment, were?"},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"Though there are many comments already published on this site that will help you decided about this fabulous creation, of which I may have difficulty to shine much more light onto subject; except, that it will educate you and make you think.

This lesser known book and its many subject matters provided (for me) a more educational value of the concepts which Mr. Diamond goes into further and more defined details with the publications of Guns, Germs & Steel.Either case, Guns, Germs & Steel or The 3rd Chimpanzee or both books are worth one's time if you want to learn about how and why things are as they are.

Sorry Jared."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"Speculative fiction audiences--particularly those involving fantasy--are concerned with world-building. Inevitably, this pinpoints the rise and status of civilizations. By speculative fiction we can really include any speculative-minded person who indulges in historical fiction or even historical non-fiction in dramatic form where the mind is freed to imagine possibilities, realities, and the curious interplay of chance and fate.How exciting it is to read a non-fiction book that addresses exactly this idea of chance and fate as it relates to the most important of all terrestrial questions, viz.: why do civilizations rise and what determines their advance?Jared Diamond is a thoroughly engaging author--a crucial component when dealing with history--and in this Pulitzer prize-winning book, he manages to infect us with his interest in everything: geology, climate, group psychology, farming, animal husbandry... every facet of a civilization that can affect its rise is addressed.The original premise of the book was one with racial overtones: why did predominately white Europeans come to such an industrial advantage that they came to economically dominate the globe? Why is it that \\"red\\" American Indians, \\"black\\" Africans, or \\"yellow\\" Asians come to such a state as to be largely subdued by \\"white\\" Europe?The answer, as Diamond goes about proving, is everything but racial. And that answer--replete with all those interconnected facets of geology, geography and biology--is so much more tremendously exciting and instructive.It turns out that advanced civilization is much more fragile than the notional abundancy of Gaia-theory would have us believe. Domesticable, nutritious grains are not common. Domesticable animals are not common. Open lines of latitude as transmission points of information turn out to be extremely important where open lines of longitude are not terribly useful. That information--composed of technical knowledge, economic trade, and biological germs--become in turn very important in allowing the rise of cities and their ability to cope or cooperate with competition.Most intellectually curious people ponder the rise of civilization. To them, reading Guns is like seeing a great lot of puzzle pieces come together with audible clicks. The resulting portrait of civil evolution is compelling and rewarding by itself.As satisfying as this book is for the intellectually curious, there is a very peculiar appeal to those imaginatively curious people who imagine alternative lines of history or the future expansion of humanity in to space. Readers enthralled with alternative history will find out why evolution had to occur in certain cases and where it could have gone in different directions. Readers of fictional history will find their experience better informed and more deeply appreciated. Readers of world-building fantasy will find what a stunningly complex notion that is (and find themselves more appreciative of Tolkien). Finally, readers of space colonization and terra-forming will appreciate what a delicate proposition that is.Guns is a stunning scholarly achievement widely accessible by most readers of any kind. For our readers, especially, this is not to be missed.READ MORE AT INCHOATUS.COM"},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"Certain folks are offended by this book. They say that Diamond's insightful explorations about geography, flora, fauna, and history deny the simple cultural superiority of European culture. Some folks even insist that it's superior genetics that led to superior culture. Part of the fun of this book is watching people's reaction to it. To think, I'd thought racism wasn't in vogue this century!But genetics and culture are not the focus of this book. Whatever role they might play, Diamond simply doesn't get into it. So, extrapolating from some people's reactions, if you're going to get defensive about being white and from the dominant culture on the planet, this isn't the book for you. But if you're not likely to get offended by someone pointing out that some areas might have been better for developing civilizations in ways you wouldn't expect, then pick up a copy and give it a read. Fans of Sid Meier's computer game Civilization will recognize and appreciate how the effects of continent shape (to name one factor) play a surprisingly large role in history.BTW the book is vastly superior to the NPR series. I think the series must be intended for a young audience.

Europe and Asia, Jared maintains, have a geographical edge over civilizations that developed elsewhere because these continents have a &quot;horizontal orientaiton of axes&quot; - that is to say long, broad stretches of land in various climates rather than thin, narrow axes of climates as are found in the Americas and Africa. These axes, Diamond argues created &quot;proximate factors&quot; (more domesticable animals, greater variety of food sources for example) that in turn allowed civilizations to conquor other peoples - and eventually conquor the civilizations on other continents in turn. A final critical contributing factor resulting from the orientation of axes is the susceptability and ease of the spread of disease, a factor that was undeniably a factor in the conquest of the New World.At first glance, Diamond's argument seems unrefutable. In fact when I was reading this book I was reminded of Darwin's Orgins of Species. Indeed, he makes a good case for his position. However, further examination raises questions. For example, what of cultural influences? I find it interesting that the eventual &quot;conquest&quot; of the world is almost exclusivley the result of European efforts - including the subjugation of Asia, which acording to Diamond shares the same developmental axis of Europe. Why is it that only Europe &quot;conquored&quot; the globe and not both Europe and Asia? Or why was it not Asia who eventually conquored and subjugated the Americas and Africa? What about the role of religion? Certainly a driving factor in the explosive European colonization of the world was Christianity. What of other cultural factors like competition? In many cultures cooperation and group cohesiveness and unity is stressed rather than personal gain (in Asia as well as in the Americas.) Yet none of these cultural mores are even mentioned in the book.Diamond's argument has its merits - certainly geography has played a role in the eventual conquest of one civilization over others. However, I believe the impact of culture, religion and weltanschauuing - one's world view - play a larger role than is given credit for. Guns, Germs and Steel is certainly an intriguing book, and is not without its strengths. However I cannot help but feel that the development of mankind is greater than mere geographic happenstance."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"The author is on firm ground when he develops his case for the ultimate reasons of the differences in technological and structured societies in pre-history. But as he approaches modern times, he walks on thin ice. He argues that a given society's receptivity and drive for innovation is dependent on so many diverse factors that we should consider it a random variable. That's disappointing. His work tries to build an explanation for the difference to counter the thesis of white people's genetic superiority. But he is ready to admit, with very weak arguments, that hunters-gatherers possibly have superior intelligence to whites. So, after all, a few thousand years may be enough for natural selection to improve the intelligence in human beings! If that were true, the opposite could also be true. I think that hard to believe, but I have no scientific evidence to discard it.I fear that Diammond dares to propose the superior intelligence of hunter-gatherers because it is safe to do so in our politically correct times."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"There are sections in this book which are thought provoking and interesting to listen to. There are other sections in this book which are far far too drawn out.

If only Jared Diamond would condense his fascinating information, without needlessly listing out every single detail for hours on end on things like Asiatic languages and what types of crops can be found where, this book would be outstanding. As is, it is very difficult to pay attention and that is because some areas are so terrible boring, you wouldn't want to.

They are all by definition reductive and fail to grasp the actual complexities of the development of humanity. But, that being said, Guns Germs and Steel is among the best.I can boil down Diamond's argument into a couple sentences: Why has the west been the dominate power for the last couple centuries? Because the West had access to (you guessed it) guns, germs and steel. Why did they have access to guns germs and steel before everyone else? Accidents of geography and evolution.That's pretty much it. If all you care about is the thesis, I have just saved you hours of reading time. If you're interested in how he got there, or want to feel humbled (as I did) because your range of knowledge is no where near Diamond's, then read the book for its brilliant explanation for why things are the way they are. You don't have to agree with everything Diamond argues to enjoy this one. Even at five hundred pages, it is reductive with too much of a reliance on technology as the explanation for the way the world has turned out, but it is still a magnificent read and guide for how to develop and explain an argument."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"The plainly stated premise for this book is that there must be some reason provided, other than race, for the disparities we continue to see in the standard of living of various human populations. And we learn that it is guns, germs and steel that allowed some people to conquer others and not the other way around. Said guns, germs and steel having come into their possession first through having been luckier in where their ancestors happened to be living. Sounds reasonable at first.But having been conquered is not reason enough to give up on a good standard of living, and possession of guns, germs and steel is apparently not enough to guarantee a good standard of living either. Since everyone has guns, germs and steel now, do they not? And the French have been conquered at least every hundred years or so and continue to live like, well, western Europeans, so it is not merely being conquered that is enough explanation either.So just what is it? And I'll agree that it is not race. Perhaps it is that some people simply won't accept the personal responsibility that would be required to get their act together, en masse, and well, quite frankly we can't force them to. First of all it wouldn't work, this forcing them to. Second of all, it would take too much time, this forcing them to. What we are left with is, of course, their own personal responsibility to do it themselves or suffer the consequences.Once we get past the fact that Jared Diamond tells us that watching TV causes brain damage and makes western children stupider then New Guineans, rather than TV being an ideal medium for enhanced learning. Well, he's just mad because someone insulted his race and wants revenge on the matter, that's all, right?Because if we take him on his word, we must look at our children with wonder because of how well they can function despite the \\"irreversible mental stunting associated with reduced childhood stimulation\\" caused by their TV watching. We also must feel very sorry for how more backwards the New Guineans might become should they ever get TV's. But we hope that in this part of the book only, he's not a complete idiot but still just rightfully infuriated at racists and that since this is just the introduction, that this must be only the editorial portion of the book and not an indication of a similarly biased book to follow.He makes a lot out of plants that are domesticatable and those that are wild. By definition the difference between domestic and wild implies that someone spent some time doing the domesticating.While it is an appealing idea that some ancient primitives just happened to live near perfectly good grains such as in western Europe, well what about the Neanderthals? Their fossil evidence now clearly indicates that they did not ingest any grains. Were they blind?And one must immediately ask, is the same wild relative of the grain plant ever found in America as western Europe? A question he does not even address, taking it as a given.But the whole idea is absurd! All over the world, plants were domesticated, corn, wheat, rice, ad infinitum. Are we to believe that domesticating wheat is so much easier than domesticating rice or corn that a 10,000 year advantage was gained?Or the fact that wheat is now grown in Africa is proof that you cannot domesticate any African plants rather than that it was simply easier to bring some wheat seed with you, rather than start all over again from scratch? Not because there are no plants that couldn't be domesticated, something different then corn, wheat or rice, but that rather that once their neighbors had already done it that it simply wasn't necessary to reinvent the wheel?But what difference does it make anyway? Europeans are not white because they are of a different species, they are white because of the perpetual lack of sunlight in the northern climes, particularly during the winter months and not only that but they have cloud covered springs, falls and summers too.If two brothers, who both had the same mother, but each had different fathers of the same race, and one turned out to have invented a gun, and the other turned out to have been a shifty though intelligent bum. Then perhaps by Jared Diamond's example, the shifty one should write a book why his excuse for being a shifty bum is not in any way genetic, and at the same time smear his brother's reputation at every possible opportunity.I will admit that this book is fascinating in that he puts everything in terms of race. So you can see not only which civilizations prevailed but also whose race bred with whose. Unfortunately, he compiled these parts of the book from other people's historical works, although his one saving grace is that this was done rather well, since it makes an interesting read when compiled by virtue of race.His facts then should be read with interest, but his opinions and conclusions with a grain of salt.If you simply replaced every occurrence of contempt for eurocentrics with praise, and every occurrence of praise for New Guineans with contempt, and every instance of \\"luckier\\" with \\"smarter\\", then you would have the perfect book for the Reich mark to distribute to all newly married German couples along with their mandatory copies of Mein Kampf!In regards to your theories, why do you even care, Herr Diamond?"},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"Well, I have to admit I skipped over the bit about all the food stuff, makes no sence theres Macdonalds everywhere, but the steel, now THERE ya go with some common sence.

I agree that race plays no part in the rise of cultures, but I also contend that culture plays a part in the rise of races.Imagine if Diamond had lived in the realm of the founders of Western culture-- the ancient Greeks and Romans. He would have praised the pale, yet primitive Europeans to the north as somehow superior than his own swarthy people of the Mediterranean. Truly a racist ahead of his time!Yet the whiter people of northern Europe would eventually come to exert more influence on the rest of the world than the Greeks or Romans ever did, apparently losing the mantle of unbridled intellectual capacity.Apparently, Diamond hates the West. He resents its success at the expense of indigenous people throughout the world. But remember, Gauls, Iberians, and Germans were once indigenous people too. And don't think for a moment that New Guinea natives would never have hesitated to oppress white people if given the means.If Europeans developed guns, better methods of treating disease, and steel, it's because of a history of the Western notions of rational inquiry and the dissemination of knowledge.Determinists might love his book because it makes an easy argument supported by conventional wisdom.

If true then affirmative action can be considered likely to succeed, but if it is based on exraordinary assumptions then failure is to be expected. These assumptions are that man arriving in the various continents had no impact on the survival or extinction of the various edible and otherwise useful plants and animals to be found in his area. Man, in each case, Diamond assumes worked optimally with what was there. Since in Australia for example there are very few indigenous edible plants today, the macadamia nut, he simply assumes despite the paleobiological evidence that this has always been the case, that men simply didn't send some useful species into extinction in some places and not in others as he overused that commodity, whereas elsewhere as in Eurasia and MesoAmerica, it was deemed useful to save some to regenerate more later. Perhaps Neolothic Eurasians reacting to IceAge conditions, evolved- see Meme Machine, Blackmore - the ability to plan ahead, noticing the connection between seed and future food. Australians by contrast- see Descent of Man, Darwin - burnt the green forests for the short term gain of catching edible kangaroos escaping, so changeing the forest to desert or to fire tolerant eucalpytus.

Another possible explanation, and one that is far simpler, is that some groups of people, on average, innately possess abilities that others don't. In today's day and age, this is very politically incorrect. Nonetheless, it should be addressed.The author does address this latter theory. It takes him about a page and half to dismiss it based not on science, not on any sort of study, but on his personal observation that certain aboriginal people, who belong to cultures we might not find advanced, are in fact more intelligent, on average, than caucasians.

However while one still is rubbing his hands, that China was taken off since the 14th century (Arabia since 15th), the tide can oppose nevertheless soon. At present, the technology and trade development of the Asian countries is enormously positive and the oil-possessing dominance of the Arabian states just increases her demand to a global (also ideological) con-design right. The threat factors \\"weapons, viruses and metal equipment,\\" -- represented always into actor pose nicely by president George W. Bush, impressed with fight bomber pilot jacket, with legs apart and broad grinning on the deck of an US-aircraft-carrier -- this success conception perhaps really could gradually oppose her inventors: State armies get for example increasingly powerless against the guerilla unit tactics of the present global suicidal terrorism. Jared Diamond perhaps looks a little confused for the stability guarantee of the European-American success concept. The geographical situation alone is not a guarantor. As an advantage factor it does not suffice eternally. Jared Diamond looks to make believe for us that the capability to make innovations, the courage to accept competition, the openness for intermixing (causes biologically seen virus resistance, hello, bird flu) -- that these factors will safeguard the further dominance of the European-American concept. He does not like to argue racialistly, religion critically or militaristically, although: The Indians of North- and South-America felt actually quite good without the missionaries and swords, railways and colts of the white ones; in addition, we do not see Diamond's remarks on drunken and lazy workers of non-white skin color (but some Afro-American reviewers do).

The year is now 1955 and Dr. Gajdusek is about to receive the Nobel prize for discovering mad cow disease in humans for the first time. The New Guinea people call the disease 'kuru'.His co-researcher Dr. Zigas states, \\"Oh, blinded and made halt of mind! By the cruel doctrine of racial prejudice!\\" For he had been told that the New Guinea natives were savage cannibals.He found instead, however, that they were remarkably friendly and charmingly free of the inhibitions that afflicted the Europeans. Their customary greeting was considerably more intimate than a handshake: a standing embrace in which both men and women handled each other's genitals.\\"Even in the villages, among people who saw one another every day, hands were continually reaching out to caress a thigh, arms, and searching mouths hung over a child's lips or nuzzled a baby's peewee.\\"But back to Dr. Gajdusek. As he moved about in the eastern Highlands of New Guinea, which comprised several thousand square miles of largely uncharted, mountainous terrain inhabited by warring tribes of cannibals, he discovered that the people believed that sorcerers could cast spells by stealing items intimately associated with their intended victims - their excrement or leftover scraps of food - binding it up in a 'magic bundle' with special pieces of bark, twigs and leaves, and burying it to the accompaniment of a chanted curse. They punished suspected sorcerers with a ritual revenge called 'tukabu' - brutal murderous beatings, bashing in heads and crushing genitals with stones and wooden clubs. Since the disease kuru was taking so many lives, suspicions were causing even more deaths unfortunately by ritual murder.Since more women and children came down with kuru than men, eventually it was realized that there were important differences in the way men and women practiced cannibalism. Although older widows often attended the funerals of people to whom they were only distantly related, joining in the mourning rituals so they could catch a bite of the deceased afterwards, men rarely joined in the feast and when they did, they ate all the good parts, leaving the women and children only with the brains and other internal organs.These discoveries, of course, led to the recognition of the first cases of mad cow disease in humans and the Nobel prize."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"Diamond's Guns, Germs, and Steel may be one of the most overrated and uninformed books in the social sciences ever written. Diamond's historical analysis is considerable in regard to the differences in human development over time and place; however, his explanations as to why these vast differences occured is superficial at best. It is obvious that the author is searching for causes that fit into his theory, yet are nothing more than loosely related correlations. Clearly, the author has set out to explain away the differences in human development as a result of anything but intelligence. His ideology of and unspoken belief in equality of races will not allow him to assert anything that suggests that intelligence plays any role in the monumental differences in human development that span centuries and even millenia across the globe. He rests his arguments on many claims that are absurd. He does not even address the work of other accomplished academics that contradict his entire theory, such as Richard Lynn's IQ and Global Inequality or Herrnstein's The Bell Curve. Challenging the work of other academics is critical to establishing credibility of any scientific work and this proves that Diamond is a pseudo-scientist afraid of criticism.In the first few chapters, Diamond dismisses IQ tests as outside the realm of science without any explanation whatsoever. Nevermind that no evidence exists to disprove the validity of IQ tests, that IQ tests have consistently shown comparable results across time, countries, cultures, and methods, even when adjusting for cultural differences. I guess his liberal philosophies place him too far up the righteous tower to bother countering the one thing that undermines the entire foundation of his work. Instead, he makes the outrageous claim that indigenous cultures are superior to European cultures, given that they are more 'aware of their surroundings', whatever that means. I hardly think that peoples who had no written languages, no paper or printing press, no means to disseminate or accumulate knowledge, no methods of exploration or discovery, and no understanding of science or technology are much aware of their surroundings in any respect. Typical of leftist social scientists, these kinds of unproven claims make Diamond come across as 'worshipping the other', putting the cultures of the indigenous on an untouchable pedestal while at the same time despising the cultures that made the knowledge and publication of this book even possible.Most of Diamond's claims are easily disproven by anyone with a rudimentary background in history and social science or even a basic notion of logic and reason. Diamond asserts that differences in geography and climate mostly accounted for the divergences in development. It was these conditions, he argues, that allowed for fertile soil, harvesting of crops which necessitated the arrival of domesticated animals, and the creation of technologies that facilitated these functions, the most obvious being the wheel. Apparently, those cultures that evolved out of hot, arrid climates such as the Middle East, Africa, parts of South America, and Australia had no means to develop agricultural practices which was largely a foundation for building more complex, political societies. This is all an interesting correlation but hardly causation. Here Diamond shines in his depiction of how societies diverged, but his failure to comprehend obvious outstanding examples is where he comes up short. For one, white Europeans have adapted to all hostile environments known to man. From the deserts of Nevada and Southwestern United States to the Australian outback to Antarctica and the North Pole, Europeans have mastered these geographies and produced some of the richest societies on Earth there where the indigenous populations had produced absolutely nothing. Why the limitations of environment and geography were easily overcome by Europeans but not others is not adequately explained by Diamond. He only delves into the applications of technologies as a mechanism for adapting to various terrains, while never getting to the real origin of why those technologies and tools were discovered and applied in the first place: intelligence.The other obvious counterargument to Diamond's pseudo-science is the lack of development of Native Americans despite occupying some of the most arable land on Earth for thousands of years. North America is bursting with resources, metals, and indigenous domestic animals of all kinds, and yet the natives never even invented the wheel. This completely contradicts Diamond's theory, which if held up to any serious academic scrutiny by credible scientists, would never even approach the authority of publication. The obvious conclusion is that the environment is not an obstacle to an intelligent race. Searching for 'a better way of doing things' is not universal among races. Had the different races been equally intelligent, there would not be a gap in human development that spans hundreds of years, especially now during an age of globalism.One of my favorite examples from the book, which Diamond regards as illustrative of how the application of technology influenced European expansion, comes from his analysis of the Battle of Cajamarca in 1532. Here Diamond attempts to show that the application of various metals resulting in swords and shields, combined with the domestication of the horse, allowed 169 Spaniards to vanquish an army of 80,000 natives in South America. To be sure, the superior technology and advantage of horses aided in their victory. Which all came about because of European's fertile soil and access to trade, etc. the author claims. Yet there have been numerous cases throughout history where less advanced armies have defeated superior enemies, such as the Picts defeat of the Romans or the Russian defeat of Germany. In the case of the Spaniards being outnumbered nearly 500 to 1, superior technology was certainly not the cause of their victory. Rather, superior intelligence combined with tactics, strategy, and organization were more important factors.Like most social scientists in the unapproachable high towers of academics, Diamond subscribes to the underlying philosophy that all things being equal, the same results would have occured no matter what race or cultures had possession of greater means which is completely false. An England full of Africans is still England. A Mexico full of Guatemalans is still Mexico. The world's population is just interchangable. Had Africans or Australian aborigines the proper conditions, it would have been they who sailed to Europe and exported their cultures rather than the other way around. Yet Diamond can't even see the obvious: all over the world, where Europeans settled in large numbers, prosperity and quality of life followed, along with continous progress in technology and economic growth. Today, wherever large numbers of those from developing nations congregate, the opposite occurs in nearly every single case in every developed country despite equal opportunity. Clearly, it is intelligence that results in these differences in development, not some accident of origin in geographic relation to resources. The question should be why did Europeans develop the advantages in the first place despite similar geographic obstacles, not why did those advantages contribute to developmental differences.If you're looking for a good history of human development, industry, and technology, this book may be for you. If you're looking for credible, solid science proving how the differences in prosperity and development across the globe came to exist - why Africans live in mud huts while Europeans fly to the moon - then you are in for serious disappointment."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"The author is a physiologist by trade. He is an amatuer historian, and fairly average at deductions and his scope of knowledge.His knowledge of biology is very good, but his history knowledge is suspect. He asks all the right questions, but his answers prove to be that of a biology major attempting to answer historical dilemma's. None of his speculations are original - they are all things I have read before. He makes some odd conclusions that are suspect at best, and presents them as facts.He also claims that the biggest event in world history is Pizzaro's capture of the Inca ruler.

One of the most difficult tasks is to try to make statistics, facts, and concepts such as discussed in this text interesting.This book neither compels the reader to continue to research this subject, nor come up with their own ideas. It is what it is, a text which provides facts but little by the way of enjoyment."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"The author mainly argues that societies developed differently on different continents because of advantages in geography, not advantages in human biology. In the book, we can conclude that there are four reasons to account for all historical development. Firstly, it is the number of the crops and animals to be domesticated. The second reason is the speed of agriculture development in the continents. The next reason is the knowledge communication between different continents. The forth reason is the size of population. Diamond argues that all of four factors have convincing evidences. And Diamond was able to explain geographical factors integrating knowledge from a wide range of subjects, including molecular biology, epidemiology, human genetics, linguistics, and archaeology. The book demonstrates the depth of the author's technical, linguistic, political, historical research. To the author's credit, when reading this book, I find myself accepting the term \`geographical determinism' almost unconsciously. The theory Diamond sets forth is convincing enough, but the reality is more complex than simple geographical determinism--there are other factors at work, like culture and human decision, especially after the Neolithic Revolution.This is an impressive book. On the one hand, Diamond answers the complex question, \\"why did Eurasians conquer, displace or decimate Native Americans, Australians, and Africans, instead of the reverse?\\" using only three tiny objects: guns, germs and steel. Guns influence the course of political development. Germs are an additional thread of this transfer of power. Steel gives us a clue into technical advancement. The author does not get lost in complicated and trivial factors; on the contrary, he dismantles racially-based theory through analyzing environmental factors in the human history. On the other hand, Diamond brings to the book a great breadth of knowledge. When he began quoting writers from the Zhou Dynasty (first millennium BC), describing history many Chinese aren't even aware of, I was convinced of his credibility. As a scientist, I was able to appreciate Diamond's ability to express intricate and often inaccessible microbiological concepts in a clear way, to convey the magic of the microbial world to readers with a more general background. Take, for example, his description of the microbe's side of the spread of disease:\\"Many of our \`symptoms' of disease actually represent ways in which some damned clever microbe modifies our bodies or our behavior such that we become enlisted to spread microbes... the strategy practiced by the influenza, common cold, and pertussis (whooping cough) microbes, which induce the victim to cough or sneeze, thereby launching a cloud of microbes toward prospective new hosts.\\"As well-researched and thorough as it was, when you leave the book, you will have a suspicion that the author intentionally ignored the adverse evidences to support his opinions. In James Blaut's article, \\"Environmentalism and Eurocentrism\\", \\"he pointed out examples of North-South diffusion of crops, notably the cultivation of maize in both Peru and North America (1999)\\". But the book did not mention that several important crops that grow outside the temperate parts of Europe. And as a Chinese reader, I cannot eliminate a feeling that the writer always is looking for the evidence to support genetic racial equality while perhaps ignoring evidence that might suggest otherwise.In the book, Wealth and Poverty of Nations, author David Landes said \\"China's conscious decision in the 1400's to isolate itself from other nations was the key event that caused it to lose its technological advantage and fall behind Europe\\". Diamond also addresses this point from a geographical view. His argument: China was able to become a monolithic, autocratic country because of geographical factors, most importantly, its geographic connectedness. However, I think it is too simple to explain why China fell behind Europe. More explanation can be drawn from a cultural basis, such as political freedom, capitalism and open debate. The thoughts of Confucius were embedded deeply into the people of China for almost 5,000 years, and Chinese people innately believed agriculture was more important than commerce and industry. Although the commerce made a progress to some extent, they did not pay enough attention to it thus advanced industry could not be developed quickly. Also, the prevailing notion that people should stay loyal to the emperor and never resist, allowed the Chinese people to blindly accept they were the so-called super-country the emperor claimed. Actually they had ability to explore new lands, but their culture told them they were strongest and they did not need to do so.According to the statistics outlined in Andre Frank's, Reorient: Global Economy in the Asian Age, during the Ming Dynasty, China had a much stronger economy than Europe. Thus the Chinese found no need to conquer other countries for economic gain, instead focusing on the inner economical. The book did not address this point.Cultural elements do work in the human history development. But there is a question why different countries have different cultural thoughts. Now that genetic biology is not the reason, geographical environment shaped the basic ring of human history. But Diamond could not clearly answer why Confucius thoughts emerged in China, not other places, so did Socrates in Europe. The complexity of the issue may, in itself, explain why this was not addressed in this book.In summary, this book exhibits us a new picture of human history from a specific view of selecting three representative objects. In the book, you can view the fate of human societies from new vantage points. But you should have a bit of skepticism, because while Diamond convincingly argues that geographical elements play a vital role in the human history, culture and human decisions are also important."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"One of the best works of non-fiction I have read.

A plausible, scientifically-based explanation of issues I have contemplated for years, which simultaneously deconstructs the commonly held theory that genetics had a role in the advancement (or not) of peoples. The author explains why native Tasmanians never left the stone age (and indeed reverted to so-called inferior technologies), how Great Britain became a world power, why the native cultures in pre-Colonial North America were technologically moribund and not only illiterate but making no progress towards the development of written language, and how that same North American continent then came to house the most advanced civilization in the history of human kind (my assessment of America, not his).

Jared Diamond's hypothesis is diligently supported by extensive research and background material.Following Diamond's logic and thought processes, this book offers tremendous explanatory power in terms of why the societies and cultures of the world are as they are today. There are few publications that set forth such an ambitious goal (explain why some societies and cultures flourish), achieve said goal, and do so in an accessible and relatively concise manner.On the whole, this is a wonderful book. The writing, however, is unbalanced. I found the focus on items such as plant biology and New Guinea to be tedious and too heavily weighted, especially given the wide canvas of man's evolution across the world.The book's unbalanced nature risks drawing readers away from the powerful central messages and the support of Diamond's hypothesis. Assuming readers can keep this book's grand and sweeping backdrop in mind, Diamond offers deep insights for his audience.I recommend this book to readers with a deep interest in the development of our world. The caveat for all readers is to avoid being pulled into the minutiae of topics such as plant biology and New Guinean politics.

The opening discussion of the battle at Cajamarca between the Spaniards and Incas, including translated first-hand accounts, is both riveting and thought-provoking.The book suffers from two main defects. First, the author spent most of his career working in New Guinea and too frequently uses this direct and narrow experience to add credibility to a more general assertions about other societies. These provincial interruptions sometimes interrupt the flow of an otherwise fine exposition.Second, the author seems intent to refute the idea that the current state of human society - with widely varying adoption of technology and social standards i different geographical areas - is the consequence of mathematically closed-form natural laws which can be employed to predict not only history from first principles, but future societal trends. This may be a commonly held belief in some backwards social science departments, but has already been widely discredited. The authors tilting at this windmill is sometimes tedious.It's worth mentioning the contrast between this book and Darwin's Origin of Species.

The changes and shifts of technology (beyond the very basic ones he mentions) are crucial too, along with patterns of human thought and even some specific individual action. (The books listing 100 influential people in world history, for example, focus to a considerable degree on religious, philosophical and scientific innovators as major levers in human history.)But if Guns, Germs overreaches somewhat, it still isolates and highlights such useful trendlines for the sweep of human history that is more than just useful - it can be mind-altering. A lot of human history has been a growth from what has come before, and some groups of people and certain places have had advantages others haven't. The reasons behind that do come back, surprisingly often, to the factors Diamond cites.One of the best pieces of evidence for this is Diamond's successor book, Collapse, which is about societies around the world (mainly but not exclusively isolated from others). Collapse isn't as sweeping or compelling, but its case studies provide an ample set of backdrop evidence for supporting many of Guns' core ideas.Not a be-all, but a fine place to consider the sweep of human development."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"Guns, Germs and Steel is a scientific historical treatment on the rise and fall of civilizations and the reasons why the western world is considered successful. In many ways Jared Diamond has built a city with one stone. He has established the necessity for the scientific method in history, reversed the problem of a western biased orientation of the analysis and identified several challenges to a racist explanation for western success.The book comes about as a result of a fundamental question raised by the friend of the authors from New Guinea. Yali asked in a roundabout way why whites have been more successful than blacks. Diamond felt that human genetic diversity in the form of racism did not answer this question and proceeded to produce this deep treatise which looks more at environmental factors as the causal agent of success or failure.Chapter 1: Up to the Starting LineThis chapter does a brief synopsis of the evolution of humans and deals with the Great Leap Forward, extinctions and the Clovis culture in Americas in 11,000 BC.Chapter 2: A Natural Experiment of HistoryDiamond shows that common stocks can produce very diverse cultures based on the environment. He cites the case of the Maoris victory over the Morioris on the Chatham islands in 1835. Both are Polynesian decedents.Chapter 3: Collision at CajamarcaFrancisco Pizarro conquers the Inca emperor Atahuallpa in Cajamarca Peru in 1532. Guns, germs, steel and horses decide the victory as well as the Inca making serious mistakes many times over. It is this situation that requires an explanation as to how things got to this point and is what this book is about.Chapter 4: Farmer PowerFood production is a huge part of this book and occurs frequently throughout. The book might well have been called 'farming' there is so much of it. This is an extensive fact based chapter that deals with food production. A lot of it is raw data and tables. Crops and animal domestication get the full treatment. There is an important link between animals and human germs brought up.Chapter 5: History's Haves and Have-NotsThis chapter deals with carbon dating and is an extension of the last chapter verifying the types of crops and animals various civilizations had or didn't and why.Chapter 6: To Farm or Not to FarmDiamond explains the slow progress of farming and why hunter gatherers simply had more than early farmers but farming eventually outgrew hunter-gathering. He explains why some civilizations didn't adopt it based on lack of domesticated crops and animals and or inappropriate environments.Chapter 7: How to Make an AlmondBecause wild almonds are poisonous Diamond explains how mutations and breeding selection produces edible crops. More importantly he discusses why some crops are not edible and how this effects civilizations depending on their environment. Some civilizations had it easier than others.Chapter 8: Apples or IndiansHere the Fertile Crescent richness is compared with places of sparse productivity. It becomes clear that a very low percentage of biological life can be domesticated for human consumption.Chapter 9: Zebras, Unhappy Marriages, and the Anna Karenina PrincipleSome animals cannot be domesticated and thus domesticated animals must be imported. This chapter is about the failure to domesticate certain animals and why. It is also about the spread of domesticated animals.Chapter 10: Spacious Skies and Tilted AxesGeography plays an important part in how wide a naturally occurring or bred species can spread. East to west is much easier than north to south because of climate. This explains why species spreading across Europe and Asia is easier than up and down North and South America.Chapter 11: Lethal Gift of LivestockAnimals are responsible for a lot of human diseases and plagues. Diamond links animal husbandry and large populations with developing immunity against epidemics.Chapter 12: Blueprints and Borrowed LettersThe evolution of writing. This chapter may be worth the book alone. Diamond covers the evolution of writing and is one of the reasons why this book (containing writing!) has a nice twist in its tale. Writing is important because it became a method of communication over long distances and record keeping for farmers and supplies.Chapter 13: Necessity's MotherThis deals with the Cretan Minoan Phaistos disk of 1700 BC and is a continuation of the previous chapter but deals more with why technologies develop. Diamond correctly identifies that technologies don't spring out of nowhere. They evolve.Chapter 14: From Egalitarianism to KleptocracyThe evolution of governments. This is a heavy data and fact laden account of the evolution of governments from small bands to tribes to cities. It is all about how societies get organized.Chapter 15: Yali's PeopleHere Diamond applies everything we have learned to the conquest of New Guinea by Europeans. He shows how essentially they are the victims of their own environment. The conquest of Australia is also examined in the same way.Chapter 16: How China Became ChineseThis is about how China's many inter-civilizations interacted and the Austronesian migration of people to the Far East and Australia.Chapter 17: Speedboat to PolynesiaMoving on from the previous chapter Diamond explores the colonization of Polynesia and the evolution of the double-canoe.Chapter 18: Hemisphere's CollidingRevising everything, Diamond goes back to Chapter 3: Collision at Cajamarca and attempts to explain how things led up to that point. Food production, domestication, metallurgy, weapons, cavalry, transport, writing and political organization lead the way. The environment is given a reason behind the slower development of these points by the Inca. Diamond then reveals that the Norse, not Columbus, were the first Europeans to visit the Americas through Greenland.Chapter 19: How Africa Became BlackThis examines how Africa evolved internally, the various tribes involved and their long battles that have lasted centuries as well as the slow movement of technologies and discoveries from the north to the south.Epilogue: The Future of Human History as a ScienceDiamond puts forward his case for scientific history, dispenses with the idiosyncratic Great Man theory, points out that there are social factors involved and possibly even chaotic ones before calling on the use of the scientific historical method to predict future outcomes for humanity.There is no arguing the point that Diamond is making and he has established it very scientifically. Environmental conditions have an impact on how a civilization will appear and act. This is Darwinian in every sense. Using the examples of the same genetic stock from the same culture developing into two opposite lifestyles in short spaces of time because of island separation and geological differences is a good argument. You can't help but note the degree of luck and opportunity involved in success and as Diamond so aptly puts it, this is much more about the quality of real estate than the quality of a race. This is not to say that slight genetic variations don't make a difference, they do and Diamond doesn't challenge that as some have wrongly accused of him of saying (as a note the evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins often cites Diamond's work). What Diamond does is to challenge that genetic variations within a species are a sufficient explanation for the success of white man. He may be riding a wave of political correctness with this book but he does dispute justifications for racism scientifically. He also breaks down absolutism by showing that success is relative when it comes to doing one's best in the environment they are in. As he points out, Aborigines conquered some of the harshest lands in the world.Diamond himself knows the problem with his oversimplification. His findings when applied to all civilizations throughout history will turn up contradictions that fly in the face of his reasoning but he has explained the big picture of social conquest and doesn't need to shuffle genes to do it.There are a few more problems with Guns, Germs and Steel though. His overall reasoning touches on environmental determinism. Diamond does deal with this serious predicament by elaborating on the social conditions and cultural qualities at play. He believes and states often that human choices influence things. Diamond does his best to cover these in the political organisation sections and throughout but a type of environmental determinism does emerge as the overall message even if it is caricatured by his critics to mean geological determinism without human influence. Diamond is not saying that. What is really the problem here is not that Diamond says the environment plays a major role in the forces at play but that he doesn't do enough to challenge the view that environmental determinism is the sufficient explanation for the success of white man. Diamond doesn't say it is sufficient but it is his conclusion that amounts to most of what he is writing. So he leaves himself open and quite frankly gets intellectually decked quite easily because a lot of people leave this book thinking as environmental determinists. Environmental determinism is just as false as racism. We go from prejudice based on skin color to prejudice based on country. He really deals with this problem in the space of just a paragraph in the epilogue and that just doesn't cut it.The other problems are that sometimes the picture plates are not linked to anything in the text and this book is such a torrent of facts that casual readers may find themselves skipping huge sections about which part of which country developed wheat or camels first and in which quantities just to get to his overall point. Guns, germs and steel can be taxing at the best of times because of this. There is also an expectation that maybe you would find more about evolutionary biology or important battles along with at least some case made for genes. Instead the evolution is minimal, important battles limited and no genetic defence appears. This is all about how much corn Europe can produce, how many horses Asia can tame and how much politics does the Zulu need.There are other weaknesses here but he does have a huge task set for himself into 400 pages. It is doubtful that the truth is the complete opposite of what Diamond is suggesting but more of a deeper elaboration of what is being said while attributing more socio-economic reasons for success along with his geographical ones. You can also just play the probability card by saying 80% of humans lived in Eurasia but the improbable does happen and has happened and the geological explanation needs to be covered anyway.Experts in world history may view this work as being too simple and even go as far as to call it wrong, but Diamond's task is to show the importance of environmental factors not just genetic ones when it comes to the progress of modern humans. Experts want to make that environment plus socio-economic but both are on the same side when it comes to criticizing those who argue solely the race card.The main point behind reading Guns, germs and steel is that it changes how we think about ourselves and the conditions leading to how we got here. At the very least your horizons will be broadened and at the very most you will be hitting the environmental determinism socio-economic debate and both are a far cry from discrimination ideologies based on Ethnic identities.(As an end note it is my understanding that Diamond is aware of these criticism and answered it by... writing another book that includes more of a socio-economic dynamic, called 'Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed'. So see you there for a follow up review)."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"Diamond's final analysis proves a good point. Many dominant countries today are not only in Europe and East Asia, but are also ones that have been largely repopulated by the descendants of those peoples, like the U.S., Brazil, Canada, Australia, South Africa, Taiwan, and Singapore. Other countries rising to power today, like Southeast Asia's \\"Little Tiger\\" economies (Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand, and the Philippines), also contain descendants of invading conquerors nearly 10,000 years ago. China and India are now back in power to their historical positions. The Eurasian continent is the only one with a advanced history since the beginning of the Neolithic or Agricultural Revolution. Look at South America, and you'll find that the Newly Industrialized Countries (NICs) are ones with mostly European-descended populations like Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay, and Chile, and the poorest ones are the ones with the largest indigenous, native populations like Peru, Bolivia, and Guatemala. Diamond is so right in this regard."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"Ever wonder how the Europeans managed to conquor the Americas, and not the other way around? Well, if you're unfortunate enough to have that much time on your hands, there's now a book tailor-made for you! Jared Diamond details how some civilizations have come to conquor others, and not vice versa. Obviously, they do this by utilizing guns, germs, and steel (gee, wonder where he gets the title from?)...but the underlying question, of course, is HOW certain societies got those advances, and how others did not?I'm not a professional historian, biologist, anthropologist, or what-have-you, so I can't state boldly that Diamond's evidence holds up. But his argument does have a certain logic about it. Not saying there aren't other factors that he should consider (environment can't be the only reason people do what they do), but he does present a convincing argument, at least to this layman (and the fact that we're still reading this book 10 years later suggests professionals have found it food for thought as well).A note to casual readers, as many of you probably are. There are sections of this book that become a bit monotonous; the three chapters detailing the rise of food production in various world societies is a bit mind-numbing (blame our violence-soaked media), and there's a lot of information that gets tossed around here without thorough explanation. Never fear, though--this book is well-worth the read, and is largely entertaining. Diamond's prose would make for a good textbook (there are questions in the back accompanying this volume; not sure what class you could read this in, but I would reccommend it for anyone interesting in trying it); he places a bit too much emphasis upon New Guinea (where he has performed years of field research), but we can't blame him for writing about what he loves, can we? \\"Guns, Germs, and Steel\\" is an interesting, thought-provoking book about the rise and fall of society throughout the ages. Highly reccommended for anyone with even a passing interest on the subject."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"This book is a must read for anyone interested in human history. The ideas in the book are innovative and thought provoking -- a look at human history that gives new perspective. Also very important is the suggestion in the Epilogue that a science of human history should be developed to study the issues raised in the book in more detail. A great idea.The book is very well written -- well organized and easily understandable. The author uses many contractions that don't often appear in formal writing, but in the context of this book, that less formal style works.The author incorporates many disciplines into the discussion -- anthropology, biology, history. The concept of available native food groups and available domesticable animals is well presented, with historical examples from all human civilizations. Whether you ultimately agree with the author's perspective (and I personally think he mostly got it right), the book raises so many interesting issues that it is required reading."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"Guns, Germs and Steel is one of the most enlightening books I have ever read . It talks about a major factor on the development of human societies, which is the environment. Alas this important factor has been neglected by historians and archaeologists in their findings of how human societies have developed during the ages."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"Actually, I enjoyed this book quite a bit up to a point, but at 400 pages its just a little too long for the central thesis to support. Basically, Diamond is saying that Eurasians got a head start due to domesticable animals, the best wild grains to cultivate and an east-west axis to promote widespread adoption of these things.All well and true, esp liked the charts of domesticable animals and best grains - interesting stuff.But, only in the last few pages does he discuss why it is that it was the West ( European/Christian ) civilization that ended up winning the race for global dominence. The Chinese were part of the Eurasian landmass, and the Arabs had a head start on everyone, so why do the Europeans conquer all?Mr Diamond seems at pains not to ascribe any of the success of Western culture to an interest in learning or a religious attitude different from the rest of the world.An open mind is needed here - and an editor to trim this down to the 150 pages such a thesis should properly fill."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"Jared Diamond is no genius, but his argument is coherent, convincing, and timely. He brings scientific expertise and outside perspectives from the realms of botany, zoology, geography, and anthropology to the field of history. The theory of environmental determinism which he generally supports is nothing new, and many have elaborated on it before, but his global scope and willingness to reach back into prehistory for evidence is commendable. A very readable and important book, but with a mediocre writing style and a somewhat sloppy and unfocused structure, I don't believe it deserved the Pulitzer prize. Read it anyway if you have little background in history."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"Jared Diamond, a physiology professor at UCLA, is a strict follower of the Stephen Jay Gould school of environmentalism. In this, his Pulitzer Prize reducing &quot;Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies,&quot; he attributes European technology, influence, and efficiency, not to European ingenuity or genetics, but to plants, wildlife, and geography. Diamond also asserts (with a straight face) that all racial groups are of identical average intelligence--except for New Guineans fresh from the stone age who &quot;in mental ability...are probably genetically innately superior to Westerners.&quot; (It's highly questionable to this reader whether Diamond actually believes a word of what he wrote in this book.)Prof. Diamond is no doubt right that a large industrial society cannot form without plentiful food, compliant animals and contact with outside areas. The descendants of a band of Europeans stranded on a Pacific atoll 5,000 years ago would not be building moon rockets today; a potential Newton would be too busy gathering coconuts to wonder why they fall. But it does not follow from this near-truism that just any human group with crops, animals and outside contacts will rise as high as European man--that, given these factors, civilization is automatic. It certainly does not follow that any two human groups will exploit these resources to precisely the same extent.In fact, different groups as they now exist plainly do not respond identically to identical inputs. The Japanese played no part in the creation of modern science, but once exposed to it they embraced it, and now lead the world in making cars, computers and other high-tech gadgets. Africans have been aware of European technology for just as long, but microchip firms have not sprung up in Kenya.Prof. Diamond replies that unlike Kenya, Japan can build on &quot;a long history of literacy, metal machinery, and centralized government,&quot; ultimately traceable to flora, fauna and stimulatinmg ideas imported earlier. However, the &quot;history&quot; of any individual begins at birth, so Diamond's theory predicts that Kenyans reared in the west should be just as adept at technology as the average westerner. But we do not find this.Descendants of Africans have lived in the US for ten generations, and have been immersed in its culture (and unconnected with Africa) for at least five. Yet black contributions to technology remain negligible. As is well known, American blacks reared from infancy in middle-class white households show adult levels of IQ and scholastic achievement barely above the American black mean. Current members of different groups do not exploit resources, including knowledge, with equal efficiency, and there is no reason to lie to ourselves (unless we're former Republican Majority Leaders--in which case, the habit is unbreakable), thinking they did so in the past."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"Plenty of positive reviews have been written, look at them for a good description of the book. I'm gonna clear up some of the statements that have been made by the negative reviwers.Racial answers for world disparity are quite clearly racist. Just about all the negative reviews for this book here are racist, ranging from transparently covered to nakedly blatant racism. Much reference has been made to the \\"bell curve\\" study made in the US about IQ score differences between the declared racial groups of \\"White, Asian, Hispanic, Black.\\" It supposedly shows a bell curve increment of Asians, Whites, Hispanics, and Blacks. Many white supremacists here will probably switch Whites and Asians. The problem with this study is that it reflects factors in America other than absolute regional race. For one, \\"Blacks\\" in America are of varying African/European ancestry, whereas \\"Hispanics\\" ranges from people of purely European Spanish ancestry to mostly indigenous American ancestry. This clearly reflects factors of linguistic bias, nutrition, and education rather than racial differences. In addition, how can you explain the contradition of Mongoloid Asians being 1 step above Whites, yet Hispanics, who range from various European/Mongoloid Native American ancestry being 1 step below Whites? Only an idiot would believe that this reflects any issue of inherent racial intelligence superiority.I also want to clear up Diamond's statement of New Guineans probably being smarter on average than Europeans. Obviously he does not say this conclusively, as it cannot be proven. Understand that he points out the issue that in hunter-gatherer New Guinean societies, intelligence is naturally selected-- people with the ability to build effective structures, create effective trails, and other intelligence-related skills are favored. In urban European societies, however, rampant disease due to close proximity and poor santitation in cities selected differently. The ability to be \\"machiavellian\\" is not selected by nature; peasants or common people have just as good an opportunity to REPRODUCE and pass on their genetic material. Therefore, European socities selected more for disease resistance rather than intelligence. Of course, due to the brief time period, the effect is probably minimal, but made a lasting impact as disease-resistant Whites could wipe out millions of Native Americans and other indigenous peoples just by their presence."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"I sensed from the begining that there was something wrong with this book. The author was making his objective quite clear and it was not to search for the truth. It was to fight racism, which is certainly a worthy goal. Unfortunately, his weapon in this fight is to present some fascinating facts and then in a most unscientific manner reach a conclusion that is merely a possiblity but that is not proven. The key technique of argument is repetition and the demonization of Eurepeans. In a most bigoted way the author lumps all Europeans as one group. No attempt is made to explain why there are significant differences between various European groups. Why Norway is so different than Albania despite the fact that both had domesticated animals and practiced farming."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"I finished Jared Diamond's \\"Guns, Germs and Steel. I did so only by skimming a lotof the later chapters. Did you read every line? It is an awfully large book and I just didn't feel likeplugging along through every portion. As to the depth of material, I had two thoughts.1) I was most impressed by how much material he brought together. One example washis lengthy description of the populating and the populations of the islands in thesoutheast Asia (e.g., Australia, New Guinea). Another was his almost-as-lengthydescription of the various peoples of China. Although I skimmed a lot of this, I nowknow where I can go to get a lot of historical information on peoples of the world(Europeans, Asians, Americans). I know from my attempts at writing my book that ittakes an enormous effort to find and bring together this much material.2) On the negative side, the mass of information made it hard to follow his main points - thatelements other than genetic differences caused some areas of the world to progress fasterthan others. Out of all of his material, however, I understood:a) Europe had more large animals (pigs, horses, cattle) to domesticate;b) Europe had more high-value plants (wheat, barley, peas) to domesticate;c) Europe is laid out along lines of latitude so that plants and animals domesticatedin one part can be then transplanted to other parts (North and South Americaare laid out along lines of longitude - plants and animals viable in one partmay not be viable in another; andd) because Europeans developed in long contact with a lot of domesticated animals, theywere exposed to many diseases (small pox) and had a degree of immunity thatwas lacking in other areas such as the Americas.3) a-d are important points but I think it would have been easier to have absorbed them if thebook was 1/2 as big - it was awfully hard to dig out these points because most of the timeyou are slogging through other matters.4) Diamond made it quite obvious that he felt these points where why Europe developed fasterthan other areas and he made it equally obvious that he rejected the notion that it had anythingto do with intelligence or adaptability.On the last point, I'm not convinced. As I understand it, he feels that New Guineans, American Indiansor Australian Aborigines could have done the same as Europeans had they had a-d as did the Europeans. However,I think it is pretty obvious that people of American Indian descent have, to this day, failed to mould into modernsociety - they are missing in the Universities, missing in high-tech businesses - they tend to stick to reservations.From what I know, the same it true of Australian Aborigines and, the last I looked, not much modern productionor innovation comes from New Guinea. On the other side of the coin, I believe it apparent that orientals (e.g., Chinese)have notable aptitude in the sciences and engineering. So although one does not like to believe that some peoplesare more capable in the modern technological world than others, I believe it is a fact.I do believe that what has given America its prominent position in the world, is a lot of land to developin, separation from older countries, and a substantial mix of peoples."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"I was very excited to read this book and then very disappointed. It captured my attention for about half the book. The author makes several points that he supports with some evidence and then retells them over and over and over.

I read a lot and I will not finish this book."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"By writing Guns, Germs, and Steel, Jared Diamond set out to do the impossible. He attempts to explain the entire span of human history in 425 pages. However, Diamond manages to offer a logical argument to why the world has evolved into what it is today. Diamond takes into account all the important factors for the creation of civilization: domesticable animals, geography, native agriculture, factors for trade, etc... Then, Diamond goes on to show why the Eurasian continent managed to achieve supremacy over the others, and it was because of any particular competence of Caucasians over any other peoples. Rather, as Diamond explains, it was the fact that crucial natural resources, including plant and animal species, are native to Eurasia. The fact that the other continents lacked such resources is the driving reason why Eurasians could so easily over-power other peoples, especially in the Americas and Africa.Guns, Germs, and Steel is a must read for anyone who wishes to better understand the world around them. I read Guns, Germs, and Steel because of an assignment from my World History class, but I thoroughly enjoyed reading the book. Diamond does a phenomenal job of presenting facts in a manner that makes this book separate from many others in the non-fiction category. Rather than being a textbook and spitting out facts, Guns, Germs, and Steel draws the reader in to examine Diamond's theories and does so in a manner that makes the novel enjoyable. By reading this book one obtains a far better understanding of the world around one's self, and allows one to look through an objective looking-glass into the past and better understand why the world works the way it does. Perhaps the best way to explain this book is with a quote from Bill Gates's review, \\"[Guns, Germs, and Steel] Lays a foundation for understanding human history.\\"I enjoyed this book and its inward look at humanity. Guns, Germs, and Steel, has simply been an incredible read, and its explanatory powers are incredible. This book has influenced my state of mind, and has permanently altered my view of history.

I am particularly impressed with those who take offense at what is perceived to be a &quot;PC&quot; perspective on world history. Many Western readers appear to bridle at the author's statments in which he portrays the intelligence of aboriginal peoples as superior to those descended from white Europeans. Given the subject matter I guess it should not be surprising that politics cannot be left out. If anything, perhaps Diamond should have been more diplomatic. But I do appreciate his perspective which, in the general run of history books available, is still rather new. I find that I do not view the food on my table the same way after reading the book. I believe this is Diamond's greatest contribution -- that he brings the eye of an avid birdwatcher and evolutionary biologist to the canvas of human history. I do not recommend reading it because of political inclinations. I recommend it because it makes one think. Thinking in this manner is (dare I say it?) fun."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"I thought this was a simply amazing book. Diamond's singular talent is to bring knowledge from a disparate array of natural and social sciences into a meaningful, coherent whole. Diamond examines the world and its peoples throught the lenses of linguistics, geography, botany, zoology, sociology, and epidemiology and somehow combines them all to create a theory of human history. This book addresses many fascinating questions most of us have probably never really thought about, but which can explain a lot about history. How come when Europeans, mounted on horseback, colonized Africa, they weren't met by Arficans mounted on Zebras and Rhinos? How come Europeans decimated indegenous Americans with their diseases, instead of vice versa? Diamond marshalls compelling evidence to show that a populations' intitial advantages in terms of readily domesticatible plants and animals, more than anything else, explains the ultimate fates of human societies. In terms of sheer knowledge, I learned more from this book than any I have ever read"},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"My friend Roger recommended this book to me some time ago. I had added it to my wish list but never seemed to get around to ordering it, because I had such a tremendous pile to read already! He thoughtfully sent me a copy as a Christmas gift, and all I can say is, &quot;Boy, Roger, this a wonderful book! Thanks so much for sending it.&quot; Never have I encountered such lucid reflection regarding a topic about which I thought I knew considerable already and such an innovative approach to a familiar subject within the confines of a single written work. I am definitely impressed.Diamond starts with the quarry, why did some national groups overcome others in their quest for space and the wherewithal of nature; why for instance did the Spaniards conquer the Inca and the Aztec, and not the Inca and/or the Aztec the Spaniards? It would appear self evident to most people, but when Diamond presents some of the rationales suggested by previous investigators (superior intelligence, superior culture, etc.) it rapidly becomes obvious that it isn't quite so clear cut after all. He knocks these theories over one by one like so many paper tigers.The author looks at the earliest evidence for human achievements in different areas, examines the potential of the environment for that achievement, then looks at other like environments where similar innovations did not arise to identify what was lacking. Agriculture, which appears to have arisen first in the area of the Fertile Crescent, seems to have arisen in an environment wherein useable plants occurred in abundance in a climate conducive to their growth and domestication. Furthermore, the simple stone technology and the capacity to undertake a settled existence in the area long enough for these advances to arise occurred at the same time. In looking at each area where agriculture arose independently this appears to have been the case. It did however require considerable time, and where ever conditions were slightly sub optimal but the region was not confined by geographical barriers, diffusion of the concept or of the actual agrarians themselves brought about the change before the indigenous population was able to create their own alternatives. This provided advantages for one group vise a vie another.Nor is agriculture the only innovation that arose and spread on similar principles. Pottery, writing, the wheel, draught animals, metallurgy, group structures, etc, all seem to have arisen in response to local conditions and spread from their point of origin to surrounding areas, providing similar advantages to migrating groups. Even crowd diseases, though hardly what one would classify an &quot;advance,&quot; arose among people who lived in close proximity to domesticated animals, becoming immune to or at least more tolerant of diseases arising from these animals. Naive groups were therefore at risk of near total annihilation when these diseases were introduced suddenly, as native Americans, native Australians and Polynesian populations among others discovered to their great disadvantage. In areas where non-crowd diseases occurred to which local inhabitants might be immune, the technologically &quot;superior&quot; groups often found it difficult to make headway, as for instance against malaria by Europeans attempting to take control of New Guinea.One of the more interesting of Diamond's concepts (at least to me) was his examination of the barriers that might prevent dispersal of cultural traits: especially geography, past practice, utility and ideology. I was most impressed by his discussion of the simple concept of latitude as a promoter or inhibitor of disbursal. Limiting factors arose due to the human tolerance of ultraviolet light, a need for or toxicity from vitamin D, the ability of plants to adjust to different temperature, light intensity or daylight duration, or to the seasonal fluxuation in temperature, and so forth. His examination of the east-west verses north-south axis of orientation among the continents as a factor effecting numbers of species of plants and animals available for domestication was also informative. Another key point, certainly one crucial to our own age of environmental mismanagement, is the importance of starting conditions and of the effects of decisions made by early people on the state of affairs of their descendants. Large mammals that might have been used as domesticates by early Australians, New Zealanders or native Americans may have been, in fact almost certainly were in some circumstances, hunted to extinction or displaced by non-native animals introduced by early people arriving on islands and continents previously uninhabited by humans. Their initial decisions reduced the options of their descendants in serious ways.Probably one of the most important points in Diamond's discussion is that much of what we see as &quot;primitive&quot; or &quot;backward&quot; about the indigenous cultures of some of the losers in the colonialization confrontations of the 19th and early 20th centuries were in fact a reflection of the skill, adaptiveness and creativity of earlier settlers in dealing with difficult terrains with a limited technology. Furthermore, much of what we consider the &quot;progressive&quot; and &quot;superior&quot; characteristics of the winners' cultures were in fact shearly the luck of the draw.In my opinion this book would make a terrific text for a course in anthropology, history, sociology, or political science. Because it presents the information in a clear and simple manner, it might also be a welcome addition to a high school social science course. I know there are several people with a variety of backgrounds who have qued up at home and at work to read my copy.

These factors allowed some crops to grow, but not others, and allowed for trading of ideas and technology or resulted in isolation. A main object of the book is to refute the racist view of history, namely that some groups of people are inferior and thus unable to develop technology. This is only the briefest summary of an almost 500 page book, so the reader is directed there for a more detailed presentation of these ideas.While I agree with most of Professor Diamond's thesis, I believe that he has not given sufficient weight to some social aspects of the problem. As Professor David Landes points out in \\"The Wealth and Poverty of Nations\\", the evolution of good government and the rule of law play pivotal roles in determining how societies evolve and how successful they are. There is also some benefit (at least insofar as the evolution of technology is concerned) in living in a battleground as opposed to an isolated and peaceful society. Conflict speeds the evolution of technology, although at a steep price. The isolated society may not develop the technology of gun making, but is that so bad?"},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"Jared Diamond's \\"Guns, Germs and Steel\\" concentrates on an era of history that was, at least for me, largely ignored in school. This is the prehistoric era, when human beings discovered agriculture and domesticated animals. The development of these foundations of civilization, which occupied most of human history, is unjustly passed over in history courses in favor of the past few millenia of Western society.I loved \\"Guns, Germs and Steel\\" because it filled this gap in my knowledge. Diamond's thesis, that the West's rise was due to attributes of its fauna, animals and location, is well argued, and written in a way that is accessible to the everyman. According to my research on the internet, most of Diamond's claims, although written almost a decade ago, are still widely accepted. Diamond also throws in many fascinating tidbits about African, Asian, and ancient American history, also unfortunately ignored in many American schools.\\"Guns, Germs and Steel\\" does what history should do: it explains why the world is the way it is today. I recommend this fascinating and informative book to everyone."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"I'll leave Diamond's arguments for other reviewers (though I will say that I think his ideas make sense in light of the evidence he presents.) As far as the book itself goes I'll say that I really tried to like it but struggled to do so. I usually love books like this that tackle these big questions but found \\"Guns\\" to be a bit boring and long-winded. The writing didn't flow well and his point was sometimes hazy. I won't argue with the Pulitzer Prize award - the book is certainly exhaustive in its breadth and depth but it just left me a bit cold. I would recommend it to anyone interested in the topic but for a good read I'd look elsewhere."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"Overall, this is a brilliant piece of work that provides a convincing explanation of an important, if not sole, factor in explaining certain aspects of the modern geopolitical situation. He discusses fascinating historical theories. Most important, he does this within a scientific framework, explaining the rise of states through evidence rather than bizzare philosophical theories or ideology.My one fault with this book is its lack of scope. For the most part, Diamond seems content to explain prehistory and 1492. He spends far too much about Polynesian societies relative to his discussion on other civilizations, including China, India, and Southeast Asia. He does not go too much further beyond that in detail. For example, he spends little time on China and its failure to become a greater power during the 1400s. This had much to do with China's geography (a secure border against southern incursions but an open northern one), making it relevant to Diamond's thesis, yet it is ignored. This leaves gaping holes in his thesis about human development.One last comment: I think Diamond took more care in his recent book Collapse to emphasize that human choice and policy decisions do matter.A definite must-read for all history students, any age, any continent."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"Jared Diamond's astounding thesis on the developement of human civilizations is one that is thought provoking at the least. The book provides sound and abundant evidence to a geographical explanation of why certain societies come to be superior over others.Diamond is able to provide a plethora of historical and climatical evidence far above the realms of mere coincidence, striking down the age-old assumption of race superiority as a practical means for explaning modern dominance. Do not heed over-zealous rebuttals and objections all too commonly given to this work - after all, one must establish a personal perception before making the yea/neh decision. Criticism, after all, is the number one method for killing un-popular opinion, as one might notice through the example of Zora-Neale Hurston caught in the rush tide of the Harlem Rennaisance.The work is not for the adventure seeker either, its romantic sounding title should not give any allusions to action or controversy. It is based in the interest of science, not popular entertainment.Two minor flaws persist throughout the book: an inevitable brevity in describing the culture of some societies, and a rather discouraging bias counter-productive to the book's task at hand. Diamond occasionally flies off the handle to allude a matter-of-fact superiority of the societies whose short-falls he sets out to explain. He provides excellent evidence to support equality of race which is often marred by over-reactionist commentary. The reader gets the sense that Diamond would rather envoke a racial flamewar than appeal to the silent objectionalist.Bias aside, the book is an excellent read and provides a roadmap to understanding human societies through causation and historical truth rather than the high-flung insecurities of modern supremists."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"It seems as though the placement of rocks and trees must have prevented many cultures from having their Leonardo, Smith, de Tocqueville, Jefferson, Michaelangelo, Shakespeare, Aristotle, Madison, Raphael, van Mises, Hayek, Einstein, and van der Rohe. I suppose the civilization-altering ideas of these men are not the products of genius, but, rather, the inevitable product of the earth. As if springing up from a volacano, the ideas that transformed the world (observation and reality over fantasy, capitalism, etc.) and gave some cultures clear and indisputable superiority over other cultures had little to do with the people, but only in their placement on the earth. A neat argument for someone who needs a &quot;white Europeans just got lucky&quot; speech."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"The book came as promised in good condition of the binding and pages, no bad edges, etc. I was pleased with the purchase."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"In this Pulitzer Prize winning book, Diamond covers the history of the modern human over the last 13,000 years in a concise, eye-opening exploration of the ultimate causes of European domination of the planet from 1492 onward. This is a must read for any serious student of history. Diamond outlines convincing and easy to understand reasons why the racist view of history is baseless and shows how the environmental factors of the various continents profoundly impacted the course of human history. He ends the book arguing well that history must be considered every bit the science as epidemiology and paleontology are. Also, if you missed reading Tino Georgiou's masterpiece--The Fates, go and read it. While I'm near the end, I'm reading it at a rapid pace because it's so addictive. There is something about his books that bring you in and get you hooked. I'm loving this one and with only 40 pages to go until the end. Very impressive."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"Where does inequality between human beings comes from? Is it natural, or an artifact of ours institutions? May we blame it on capitalism, or on the evilness of human nature? For Jared Diamond, we should blame geography on the first place. As reductionist and deterministic as it sounds, his thesis proves to be both comprehensive and well founded. The great basic inequality we have in the world today are between Eurasians (and their descendents) and non-Eurasians (and their descendents), but the reason has nothing to with race or genetics, so this casts a light on the future of mankind. On the other hand, Diamond points out obstacles that have grow on centuries of separation. The reason the book seems repetitive to some is because it is packed with data and detailed in its analysis. He exposes his basic thesis on the first chapters, and details it for each continent in the rest of the book. A must read for anyone interested in history, humanity, poverty, politics, anthropology or sociology. Very eye opening, informative and well written. I have read the Brazilian Portuguese translation of it."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"Very very interesting...

I got to the epilogue conclusion, and summed it up in the second paragraph: nature, or rather where groups are on the earth, not nurture (intelligence). Interesting reading otherwise, but the author's causal connections between events tend to be tenuous and some research aspects could have used some deeper work to better build his case. Keeping this in mind, worth the money in my opinion."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"I liked the book but it took to broad of an approach to looking at the role disease, location and food on society.

I hope someone can translate it into Chinese. Though the title could be changed for better to &quot;Guns, Germs, Steel and Bible: The Fates of Human Societies&quot;.

The explanations given for the premise of this book, i.e. 'it's not their fault they're like that and it's not our fault we're like this,' are self-defeating. Well-chosen historical incidents to bring topic into foreground. Good read, but keep focusing on the question and you won't find a convincing answer.Also recommended: Road to Serfdom by Hayek Leadership Secrets of Attila the Hun by Roberts Johnson White House Tapes by Beschloss"},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"I found this book very interesting. I especially enjoyed how he explained each term in the subject. Guns: you can have the best technology in the world but without the philosophy to use it--like the Chinese in the 14th century, you will not succeed. At that time, the Chinese were trading as far as the coast of Africa in ships they mastered. Unfortunately, a change in leadership, and that was the problem, decided trade was bad, burned the ships and the shipyards, and closed off China to the world. Germs: most of our germs come from animals we domesticated. Civilization exists because men first tamed goats, then cows and oxen and finally horses. Horses became more useful than oxen once we discovered the proper harness in the so-called dark ages. Horse are faster than oxen and can plow more land. This also meant that as farming replaced hunter-gathers, disease followed. It was not that the Incas were powerless, they had great leadership, it was that the conquistidors were dealing with a third-stringer--- the creame of the leadership died in the waves of disease that swept ahead of the west in the conquest of the new world. Farming replaced hunters simply because the same area of land can support 5 farmers and 1 hunter--no wonder the Indians of the west lost. The author explains why civilization seems crowded on the Eurasian continent: because that's where the best food, adaptable for human development is, that's where animals amenable to domestication exists. Africans never domesticated the zebra because it could not be done. American Indians never established wide-spread farming because corn is not a stable grain like wheat.My only problem with the text is that the best summary of what he is passing on is in the last 20 pages. He then explains why previous civilizations failed--like how the Greeks depleated their soil. Also, as I said in the title, the author rambles some. Still, it was interesting reading.This is a facinating book. It should be required reading at the university level.Please, if you like my review--vote!"},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"This book altered the way I think about history. It synthesizes a wide variety of information, some of which was familiar to me but was presented in a new light, into a coherent vision of how the world works.Furthermore, in those areas where I have some knowledge, such as linguistics and the history of writing, Diamond does well--I am therefore inclined to trust him on matters closer to his field of expertise as a biologist.So yes, some reviewers are in a spilkas because he concentrates on some factors at the expense of others (though several argue against strawmen instead of the actual book). You show me a book where every statement is guarded and balanced with qualifications and hedges, and I'll show you a dull-as-ditchwater textbook."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"Diamond really does a good job at presenting his ideas clearly in such a way that the layman can appreciate them. I can read and understand anthropological and archaeological mumbojumbo pretty well but its nice to be able to read something in non-technical terms that has not watered down the science.A few people seem to have had problems with this book because they think it is biased in some way. I think one reviewer called it 'PC' because it failed to account for cultural difference as a mechanism, therefore it's 'liberal' and 'PC'. The thing is that these reviewers aren't seeing the underlying assumption behind the thesis of the book. Diamond is taking an environmental view of culture, basically saying that culture is a non-biological adaptation that forms in response to environmental pressure. So, yes, culture has something to do with the spread of Eurasians around the globe, what he is arguing is that the root of the culture and it's spread stems from the environments that they developed in. I'm not sure why or how that is liberal. He's pretty non-judgemental about the entire process."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"As a survey of the last 13,000 years of human history, this is very well-done. Surprisingly detailed, it covers many different aspects of history- specific events, general trends, environmental factors. Not to mention I learned a lot about agriculture and where our familiar domestic plants and animals come from. His environmental explanations are convincingly argued, and the information he uses is up to date. Well worth it."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"This is one of the most thoughtful and provocative books I have ever read. It provides new insights into the nature of mankind, and brilliantly interweaves an extremely powerful and comprehensive theory of human development with a wealth of fascinating details. A lot of the debate in these reviews is whether Diamond's theory is correct; I would suggest that a perspective this radical and comprehensive could hard be a complete explanation. But it's impossible to consider any theory of human development that ignores Diamond's powerful and brilliantly argued thesis. Plus, this book was a pure joy to read. A brilliant, thrilling work of history and anthropology."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"Jared Diamond attempts to explain why certain societies evolved faster then others and then conquered those civilizations that were less advanced then their own. This in and of itself is enough to make most people gasp, not only at his audacity for tackling such a complex subject but also for taking on one that is so sensitive. Diamond handles both areas of his subject very well. Guns, Germs and Steel is a great read start to finish and one that does not fail to disappoint. Diamond examines all human societies and attempts to remove racial arguements and stereotypes in explaining why some societies grew more \\"civilized\\" then others and then conquered others. Diamonds evidence is compelling and he does a good job of presenting some complicated anthropoligical concepts in a very readable fashion. I would recommend this one!"},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"In Guns, Germs &amp; Steel, Jared Diamond presents a compelling explanation for the divergence in technological development between Eurasian societies and those of Africa, Oceania and the Americas. His central thesis is that environmental factors were the primary driving force in social evolution. This thesis is developed through the examination of a slew of ecological factors such as the various availability of plant and animal species suitable for domestication, as well as geographical factors such as continental size and orientation, and ease of migration.Diamond's motivation is to debunk a racist explanation of history. For that it seems sufficient to cite the different races within Eurasia that have at one point or another &quot;led&quot; in technological and political development within a time frame too short for genetic change to be the explanation. Diamond does not extend his thesis to within Eurasia, but rather gives a brief and rather weak explanation in the epilogue that poor land use caused southwestern Asian societies to lag and accidents of politics did the same for China.Diamond is not the best writer. While necessary, the application of his thesis to each continent comes off as overly repetitious. While this book could not have been written in the 50 pages cited in other reviews, a more compact exposition would have been welcome and perhaps would have left room for a more thorough examination of the differences in societal development within Eurasia. None the less, Guns, Germs &amp; Steel adds greatly to the popular literature on social evolution."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"Diamond probably should have named this book &quot;Domesticatable Plants and Animals, Germs, and Migrations&quot;. Even so, it is one of the best histories of world I have ever read. He builds a convincing case for geographical determinism as the source of cultural and technological differences between the peoples of the world.Diamond describes the widely different inheritances of edible plants and domesticatable animals in geographic regions. The inevitable force of human ingenuity led to a package of food crops, farm animals, and epidemic diseases posessed by the inhabitants of these areas. This inheritance enabled inundation and replacement of peoples who were less fortunate in what the earth offered them. If you have ever wondered why Europeans conquered the world in the 1800's, why China is relatively homogenous, why indigenous Australians were technologically backwards, why the Americas' indigenous people were virtually exterminated, and why Africans were not given the same treatment, this book is for you. A great rebuttal to racialist theories of cultural variation."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"I thought customers may want to know that this book received the Pulitzer in 1998. It won for non-fiction -- I didn't see any reviews that mentioned this!!"},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"This book was awarded the Pulitzer Prize, and, to let you know where I'm coming from, I think that this is in large part due to the generally Left leaning politics that I believe the author adheres to, and with which I mostly agree. The author's premise is that environmental differences and NOT innate genetic differences explain the varing &quot;success&quot; and &quot;failures&quot; of native peoples to expand their geographical reach. (i.e. Europeans came to dominate the world, not due to genetic superiority, but for reasons having ultimate cause in environment). If the reader is aware of the author's bias, then he or she will get a lot out of it.That said, if you want to understand how civilizations arose over the course of the past 10,000 years... how human societies progressed from hunter gatherers, to agricultural societies, to the current state of the world, this book is a great place to start.This is definitely a &quot;popular science&quot; book, and as such, suffers from an unfortunate amount of repetition. Yet, this does give the reader the opportunity to mull over the author's propositions, rather than simply be introduced to them and not have time to reflect.These ideas are chiefly that geological happenstance and coincidence, along with ecological factors played a substantial role in the development of the world's different societies. Some of the most important factors include geological features that facilitated or impeded the diffusion of inventions/ideas and the relative abundance of native plant and animal species suitable for domestication.To cite one typical example from the book, Diamond argues that the America's smaller land mass coupled with the narrow isthmus of panama and the arid/semi-arid region separating southern mexico from the eastern United States effective fragmented the New World into several mini-continents. By contrast, the relative connectedness of the mediterranean, fertile crescent, India and even (occasionally) China, fostered an exchange of ideas, domesticates, and technology that gave Old World societies significant advantages in terms of technological innovation and increasing cultural complexity.Despite the book's verbosity and occasional dogma, it is still very much worth reading. I learned a lot about the rise of civilizations and the spread of humans throughout the globe. Hopefully others will similarly be rewarded for reading this book. Happy reading!"},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"A little knowledge is a dangerous thing, but a little knowledge and a lot of bias is a very dangerous thing. Mr Diamond takes some solid scientific facts and some intuitive analysis and then extrapolates this to ridiculous lengths to reach a politiclly correct view of history. His basic premise is that the natural availability of both high protein cereals and herd and draft animals gave certain societies a competitive advantage. Jared extrapolates this to explain every feature of human history. His consistent message is that all peoples everywhere in history were not just equal, but identical, and that the European settlers of the western hemisphere were the evil and undeserving benefactors of a natural bounty of grain and goats. In his fervor to be anti-Western and anti-European, he completely neglects to apply his theory to such civilizations as the ancient Chinese, the Zulus, and the marvel of the Islamic empire at its' height. His views on epidemics, invention and other areas are interesting but they move steadily away from the facts and his comments become more editorial than analytical. The closing, in which he contradicts his own theory that we are all identical by extolling the natural virtues and implied superiority of the people of New Guinea, is a fitting end to this jaundiced view of human history."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"Diamond goes out of his way to not involve culture at all. This blatant omission forces him to only talk about facts that support his thesis. Of course, geography, resources, and population density are going to play a role in how successful a people are. But so does how they are governed, what role religion and science play in their civilization, are they accepting of foreign technology, in other words their culture.This book is very politically correct. The fact is that some cultures/civilizations are superior to others. Some of that advantage comes from luck in the beginning, but a large part comes from the choices a civilization makes as it develops."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"Diamond's clearly stated thesis is that geography is the great determiner of human destiny, though, weirdly, it is left out of the title of the book. The book actually has little to say about the three items of the title, but rather focuses on the natural resources available to different regions of the world, the animals that could be domesticated, and the possibilities for communicating with other adjacent cultures. In line with the current passion for multiculturalism, he argues that the people involved are pretty much all equivalent, and that there are no important racial differences that need to be considered.He dismisses the work of the psychometricians whose data, in spite of the taboos of our current state, reveal in hundreds of studies that people's intelligence vary by racial group. He throws out this data, incredibly, based on his own assessments of personal experience with different peoples. In fact, he baldly states his belief that stone age peoples such as New Guineans (whom he knows something about) are actually on average more intelligent than white Europeans. One more example of introspective speculation and personal, anecdotal experience being being mistaken for hard data that can be replicated, graphed, statistically analyzed, and added to by studies with improved methodologies.His attack on such an important question as IQ and the &quot;wealth of nations&quot; is weak, unconvincing, unscholarly, colored by political correctness, and short.In order to see the importance of geography and race, Diamond might have considered comparing the development over the last few hundred years of the peoples on the islands of Hispaniola and Iceland. Try spending a couple of hours with your browser aimed at the CIA fact book, Google's pictures, and a few other readily available sources, then tell me why you think geography is the prime mover in the fate of nations!His hopes of helping to see history become more scientific, argued in his last chapter, though, certainly is meritorious. Really important questions about the history and destiny of man can and should be attacked by scientific methods, and perhaps Diamond's accretion of observations and speculations do serve as a sort of start, something like how alchemy started chemistry."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"Aside from all the logical, scientific and historical convolutions, which have been exhaustively noted by other reviewers, little is said about Diamond's writing style. He has a terrible command of the English language; he is repetitive and academically dishonest and inauthentic. I cannot really determine the reason this book made all the fuss that it did. What's worse is that this book gives people a sense that they learned something or that Diamond proved something when all he has done is poorly synthesized others' works without citing them, or made things up in a heap of dreadful language. Do not waste your time."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"First I will agree with many reviewers that Diamond makes a compelling argument for the relative starting points of different human societies. It was fascinating to read about the availability of potential food crops and domesticated animals and to see how this had repercussions in a society's development. I was a bit put off by the straw man Diamond continually was knocking down: the argument that some societies succeeded due to inherent genetic advantages (is anyone actually making that argument these days?), but I figured surely he was going to get around to addressing the role of culture. I was mistaken.The two big blind spots in his argument are:1) Why do so many of the great men of history arise from the Judeo-Christian cultural tradition?2) Why China, with its relative advantages on the \\"starting line\\" of history has not been more influential in the past two centuries?I was disappointed to find that Diamond ascribed no role whatsoever to the different cultures, their tolerance for risk, their governmental choices, in the ultimate success of those societies. Apparently the great men of history just happened to get born disproportionately in Europe and the U.S. Luck of the draw and all that. His answer for China was almost as unsatisfying. Apparently the homogeneity of China, its coastline, and its lack of war (relative to Europe) were the reasons for its initially surging ahead, then eventually lagging behind. Very little evidence was marshaled (unlike the earlier better-documented chapters). It was like Diamond realized China was going to require explanation and simply picked the ways it was most different from Europe. Now, the explanations he chose may be the actual reasons for the differences, but I think one could equally argue that cultural and religious differences played a critical role.Anyway, a very interesting read, especially the first half. And that's about right. I think Diamond has laid out a convincing case for the role of \\"nature\\" in societal development. Unfortunately, he seems to have decided that the other half, \\"nurture\\", is so trivial as to require no discussion."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"I just love this book. It's not something you can't put down but when you read it, you constantly find yourself fascinated with the information gathered. It is delivered with great intellectual passion which translates into a very readable analysis of 'mankind'. I have worked in development and developing countries for over 10 years and this book answers so many of the questions regarding the hierachy of power and knowledge. It answers many of the questions that I have asked regarding how we have the conflcits and social unrest that we are experiencing today. I would highly recommend this book for anyone who wishes to understand the human condition from an historical and sociological perspective. It gives legitimacy to idea of community rather than that of the individual which appears to have dominated out collective thinking of late."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"First of all, read Christopher A. Smith's review of this book. It is phenomenal.Anyway, this is an ambitious book with a noble objective. History, as we know, is written by the \\"winners\\". And the winners are seldom content to write an objective history, free from editorializing.The winners want you to believe that they \\"won\\" because god was on their side, or somehow, racially, they are superior to the \\"losers\\".This book takes on that assumption head-on, and I couldn't be happier about that.That does leave the question: why have white Europeans done so well in the world (and more recently Chinese and East Asians), while so many of the world's people have fared so poorly?How is it that western-civ dominated cultures have put men on the moon, yet \\"primitive\\" cultures throughout the world have barely risen above the stone age?This book presents several key ideas that, frankly, never occurred to me. I hate to admit it, but until this book, I was more inclined to say that perhaps the peoples of Western Civ were more advanced due to some inherent advantage that might have been conveyed genetically.Not all of these \\"advantages\\" are positive traits. For instance, a very warlike and hostile people will tend to dominate a more passive, peaceloving people.Could it be that?I believe that there are different types of intelligence, and that intelligence is highly correlated to genetics. Is it possible that people with mechanical aptitudes tended to make better weapons than people who, say, were more intelligent in harmonious human relations?The book throws that all out the window.Why did Western Civ dominate? Because it had the largest supply of potential crops, the largest supply of domesticable animals, and a large east-west axis from which this could spread.Because of this, the populations on this east-west axis (stretching all the way to China), were able to have more people. More people = more innovation.The domesticated animals gave these folks more germs, and subsequently, more germ resistance.The book goes into some detail about these things, but as previous reviewers said, there are basically four macro-factors listed.It makes very, very good sense.I found the theory to be very believable and more in concert with my world-view. (Or at least the world-view that I want to believe.)So, why only 3 stars? I felt the book read like a textbook (in terms of enjoyability), but instead of being terse and compact, the prose was rambling and repetitious.I started the book eagerly and enthusiastically, but after 2 or 3 hundred pages, I felt like I was simply reading the same things over and over.It managed to strike a bad chord of longwinded and rambling, but decidedly academic in tone.In other words: it was a chore to read.As a result of reading this book, I ordered a copy of the now-villified \\"the bell curve\\" to see if any of the arguments in there are/were pursuasive, especially in light of the evidence in Guns, Germs and Steel.I would say this book should be required reading for any person who insists that racial superemicy or divine right are the reason why western civ dominates the world today.At the very least, it is extremely compelling and gives a great, great, solid theory to counter the predestination crowd."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"This excellent whirwind tour of world history gives the reader a whole new perspective on the world. By analyzing different historical trajectories of different peoples thousands of years past, Jared Diamond seeks to explain current inequalities in our political and geographic distributions.The main cohesive argument tying this book together is that current social differences throughout the world are mainly due to historic developments of food production. Food production is the essential element which gave rise to large, dense societies, which in turn support writing, technology, religion and other elements of society that enabled the food producing peoples to displace hunter gatherer peoples.Jared Diamond asserts that the differing rates and times of food production was due to differences in environmental and geographic factors and does not illustrate any differences in human abilities. Through this explanation, he seeks to discredit the racist explanations of world history.Some of the most interesting points of this book was that of the importance of domesticated animals. I had no idea that our historic relationship with animals was so important to our current prosperity. There were more available local animals for domestication, which essentially enabled ancient peoples of the Eurasian continent to become the most powerful peoples around the globe. This was because it enhanced their ability to produce food and provided them with lethal germs.Another interesting discussion point is why the Fertile Crescent was able to serve as the birthplace of agriculture but the people from this region were not the ones to sail to the Americas. The main reason is that this is a fragile environment that was logged and irrigated to the point of ecological failure. This can serve as a very important lesson that even though an area and a group of people may prove to be the most successful and powerful for a period of time, that is really just a snapshot in space and can change. It also illustrates the importance of protecting the environment and working within given environmental constraints.The discussion as to why Europe was the one to send explorers to conquer the New World rather than China was also a fascinating one. Jared Diamond points out that China has been tightly unified for such a long time, that it has actually worked against it at times. The decision of one ruler to stop ship building and exploration can stop the whole of China from that practice. Europe on the other hand, is driven by competition among neighboring states, which allowed Columbus to set sail after many failed attempts. Europe was successful because it was geographically separated enough to remain as several competing states, yet connected enough to allow for the easy exchange of ideas and technology.In sum, this is a fascinating book that will expand and alter the way that you view the world. We should read this book in high school classes. Jared Diamond has given us a way to understand the current political and social divisions in our world without resorting to racist views. Everyone should read this to understand how intricately connected human society is to environmental and geographic influences."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"I always have a high expectation when reading a book that has won the Pulitzer Prize. For better or worse, I am expecting a stay up all night, can't put down type of book. Well I have to admit that this book did not fulfill this expectation. To put my review in context I have an interest in general history but not so much in science. That probably explains why at times I felt this book dragged or just buried me is too much detail. The author was making a case for his theory, therefore, he had to spell out the many examples for his work to be accepted. It is just that for a general reader it was a bit much.I must say that the book is full of interesting historical facts and stories. I found my self saying, \\"so that's what happened\\" a number of times. The author also lays out his theory very well and I found myself agreeing with it. The author does write in a user-friendly way. My one complaint with the history is that I felt he was a little too kind to the European explores and following armies that decimated the populations of the Americas. It was just that for me, this subject has a marginal interest therefore, the massive amounts of detail slowed me down.

His rhetorical outline is straight out of Composition 101: first he tells ya what he's gonna tell ya, then he tells ya, then he tells ya what he's told you. If you found the previous sentence tedious and unoriginal, imagine it writ large over 440 pages. He follows this rhetorical pattern not just in every chapter, but in every subunit of every chapter.

It would be foolish to spend much looking at the points where his thesis may fail instead of spending more time marveling at the mighty achievement he did accomplish. Of course, taking such a large chunk of history and creating a theory to explain all of its shifts will not always be a perfect but it is wonderful to see just how much of history can be explained by his wonderfully all-encompassing ideas. With the soul of a scientist, Jared Diamond has created a wonderful synthesis to explain the development of writing, agriculture, conquest, disease and many, many other factors. Historians may balk at the largeness of such ideas, not seen Karl Marx found a convenient explanation for all human history, but it is a wonderful book to read, whether it is delighting or frustrating. It gives the reader much to think about and hopefully allows a new perspective to blossom among all of one's older, inherited ideas.

Traditionally, it was the Church who fulfilled this role, fighting against one heretical \\"natural philosopher\\" after the next--people such as Kepler, Galileo, Giordano Bruno, Descartes--until, by the turn of the eighteenth century, with hordes of experimental data giving confirmation to scientific theories, it became clear which worldview was out of date, and which current. Nowadays, it is the university system which--with its race, class, gender concerns, and its materialistic assumptions about the nature of the cosmos and the way it works--has become obsolete, and will go on defending its stiffening Image of the universe until the Western Mind simply outgrows it.But in the meantime, along comes Jared Diamond, credentialed UCLA professor of geography, to lay out this university-stamped and approved vision of history for the rest of us idiots who just aren't savvy enough to keep up with the latest the university has to offer. One thing Diamond--along with his university colleagues--assures us of, is that all peoples are the same. Fundamentally. No one is any smarter, harder-working, more pragmatic, more dreamy and idealistic than any other. Every culture begins, apparently, on every continent, with the same batch of tabula rasa rubes who then set to work to see who can produce the first civilization. The only problem is, they don't have equal access to equal resources. The Australians hunted all their candidates for animal domestication to extinction early on, and so would never have access to draft animals, and along with them, wheeled vehicles to be pulled by such animals. Same thing with the New World, whose aboriginal peoples hunted all their large mammals to extinction just after the end of the last Ice Age. No draft animals, no civilization. Sorry. You guys lose. Oh, and writing? According to Diamond, only those societies with food production can produce writing, since they are the only ones who can afford to support a non-food producing elite of specialists; so hunting societies who do not have writing cannot keep records and therefore cannot keep tabs on who owes what to whom. (In Diamondworld, inventions only emerge for pragmatic reasons, never symbolic or ritualistic). Nevermind those examples of writing that Alexander Marshack pointed out on Paleolithic bone and ivory carvings, or for that matter, those geometrical figures that no one can decipher on the walls of Paleolithic caves. And don't trouble me with Marija Gimbutas and her insistence that writing began as coded geometries inscribed on pottery during the Neolithic. (She's one of those heretics).Hmm. So let's get this straight. All those scholars who remarked on the temperamental differences between cultures, like say, between India as dreamy and idealistic vs. the West as mechanically inclined, are really just bogus. The only reason India ever specialized in metaphysics was because it didn't have access to certain goods and services on its continent, although I have no idea what Diamond thinks those natural resources might be, since India apparently has them all, including the cattle which are so sacred that they cannot be eaten even when people are starving (so much for Diamond's economics). There is no such thing as a lazy tribe in Africa vs. an industrious one. We just imagined those things because we were bigotted white men. And the only reason the West is so Imperialistic is because it originated on a continent and in a place teeming with natural resources and other such geographical advantages that those poor Native Americans or Australian aborigines never had. Hmm.In Diamondworld, history is entirely determined by environmental forces, not human ones, and so human beings are just there like checkers waiting to be pushed about by natural forces. You know, just like Darwin said about evolution, \\"adapt or die!\\" So, his model is essentially a modernized version of an outdated Victorian model of Progress in which only those societies which accept sensible innovations like food production and animal domestication go on to become big Chiefs of Empire.One of the major, major failings of this book is that Diamond has no undertanding of the true forces which shape cultures, i.e. ritual, symbol and mythology, or the way in which human consciousness has evolved in different societies to produce different mythologies which envision different ways of what being human is all about. And that sometimes those mythic visions can act as hindrances toward societies adapting this or that technology. But Diamond is a materialist, not a cultural theoretician. He's a good old all American pragmatist with a vision of history which is basically that of a white, middle class suburban man's in which a trip to Albertson's or Safeway is the high point of a day's events.It's nice to know that the Establishment still awards Pulitzers to those who see in history only economic and materialistic forces. God forbid that they should ever reward someone who sees things like myth and symbol and vision and spiritual agony as the motivating forces. That would be closer to the Truth, and as Nietzsche was fond of saying, the Lie must be protected at all costs, particularly by rewarding those who reinforce our cherished illusions about life, rather than challenging them.--John David Ebert"},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"Although Diamond's thesis is the central role that geography plays in the development of societies, he has another intention: to undermine any racist ideas that try to explain the varied development of these societies. Unfortunately, he often strains to push forward this laudable claim at the expense of balanced reason.Guns, Germs, and Steel consistently suffers from poor or inconsistent argumentation. In the prologue he states that he has the \\"impression that New Guineans are smarter than Westerners\\" (p. 20) because, \\"modern European and American children spend so much of their time being passively entertained by television, radio and movies\\" (p. 21). Yet he consistently repeats that at least 13,000 years of history is needed to assess peoples and cultures; to do otherwise would lead to racist conclusions. How can he then make inference about a people's intelligence based on 100 years of history? In Chapter 15, he recounts how two British men died on an expedition from North to South Australia, unable to cope with the hot Australian climate and difficult terrain: \\"Robert Burke and William Wills were smart enough to write, but not smart enough to survive in Australian desert regions\\" (p. 321). He makes a similar case about him and his wife's difficult trek in Australia. But, repeatedly he states that one of the conditions of long-term success for any people is population size. No doubt, a large population facilitates specialization and adaptation. So how can he draw race-based inferences about intelligence based on a sample size of four? In other arguments, he begs the question. For example, he points to today's undomesticated animals and uses that assessment as evidence that they were not domesticable 13,000 years ago (and are not domesticated today) (p. 162-175).On other occasions he invokes various political philosophies - and does a disservice to them. Diamond provides an incorrect summation of the ideas of Aristotle and Rousseau in order to compare their ideas about the foundations of societies with his own. Aristotle does not argue that \\"states [are] the natural condition of human society\\" (p. 282). Rather, Aristotle is not even interested to discuss communities other than the city-state (polis) because he wants to discuss a partnership of free and inter-relating human beings. Moreover he considers man a political animal because he is driven to live in a community - whether it is a state, chiefdom, tribe or band is irrelevant. Only in a human society can man fulfill his true nature - this is Aristotle's line of reasoning. Rousseau did not \\"speculate that states are formed by a social contract, a rational decision reached when people calculated their self-interest\\" (p. 283). Instead, Rousseau argued that society should be organized as a contract between free individuals. A social contract is not a description of how society is or has been, but how it should be. Equality is the natural human state; while society had been used to impose artificial restraints. Rousseau's social contract is prescriptive, not descriptive. He also offers a superficial Marxist interpretation of the role of religion. It is meant to placate the masses in accordance with the wishes of the ruling class (pp. 277-278). I don't know why Diamond does not consider the multitude of other anthropological explanations for the development of religion: it offers consolation; it provides meaning and makes sense of man's role in the universe; it gives conceptual coherence to many disparate and confusing phenomena, etc. Wouldn't an anthropological approach be more commensurate with his methodology?I don't deny Diamond's thesis that geography has played and continues to play a vital role in the development of mankind. Indeed, I agree with it, although there are other factors at play, such as culture, values, commerce and warfare which can and have trumped geography. It is a perspective that historians and philosophers have long considered. At least as far back as the 17th century, Montesquieu argued, in The Spirit of the Laws, that climate and geography shape the character of peoples.Ultimately this book is a hodge-podge of unconvincing arguments, inappropriate summaries, and recent anthropological scholarship. It is the last feature which is the book's only worthwhile feature: it provides a consolidation of various interesting research on agriculture, language, and tools."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"Reading this book I wasn't able to buy into his arguments.

Surely the geographic and biogeographic factors he cites would affect human evolution as well. And he _says_ that they do, but, fortunately, only in ways that make New Guineans mentally superior to Europeans. He suggests that the qualities favored by evolution in highland New Guinea have been those that help in inter-human competition, while in Europe resistance to infectious diseases has been more important. If he believes his own argument, parts of the world that have had far higher levels of infectious disease than Europe should be even slower than Europeans; there are such regions, of course.

It's an interesting read that includes a some biology, some anthropology, some geography, some other sciences, some history and some interesting theories about why Europe conquered the world (i.e. the Americas and Africa) while the Incas and other groups never pursued conquering other nations across the seas.Diamond focuses on various issues including hunters/gatherers versus sedentary societies which spring up as domestication of animals and plants occur. Of course, with sedentary groups comes hierarchy and governments and disease as the group settles into one place living closer to one another and with animals. These groups eventually gain immunities to various diseases and with their resources obtained thru trade and knowledge they explore and being to conquer other nations.Granted, Diamond is using theory to explain why some cultures and societies have made so much progress while others are still lagging far behind, but his theories are interesting and when you finish the book it will have you thinking about the world we live in and the \\"luck\\" that some societies have had over other societies based purely on geography."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"In \`Guns, Germs and Steel' Diamond explains why human societies have evolved the way they have. Drawing from his impressive knowledge of the natural sciences, Diamond develops a scientific basis for why Europe was able to develop ahead of the rest of the world, and in so doing he dispels racist and nationalistic myths that claim superiority of one class or race of human over another. The bottom line is that humans are humans, regardless of race or time period. If given the same environmental factors, any given human society is likely to progress at the same rate as any other human society. The reason that Europe industrialized before any other society is that it had access to a unique set of environmental/geographic variables. African or Native American societies would have industrialized on their own if given enough time, but as it happened, they didn't have the same level of resources and connections as Europe, and thus they progressed at a much slower rate. When European cultures eventually collided with cultures evolving more slowly, the European cultures tended to suppress the slower culture through its evolved technology, and more alarmingly, through a host of germs that the European societies had grown immune to.So the question that Diamond sets out to answer is why it was that Europeans conquered so much of the world, and not the other way around. The answer lies mostly in Europe's proximity to the Fertile Crescent, which was blessed with a rare combination of ideal location and a disproportionate percentage of the world's plants and animals capable of being domesticated. By location, Diamond means having both access to numerous Eurasian societies for trade and being located on an \`east/west' axis. The east/west Eurasian axis is key because it meant that domesticated food plants could be transplanted anywhere along the axis and remain in the same climate. This is opposed to the north/south axis of the Americas and Africa where transplanted food plants would have to adapt to different climates at different latitudes before becoming productive. Besides location, the other key factor for development is having access to both plants and animals that can be domesticated. Surprisingly, there's only around 12 large mammal species with all the traits required to be useful to humans as livestock, and most of them originated in the Fertile Crescent region. With the combination of crops and livestock, the Fertile Crescent was able to develop \`farmer power' ahead of the rest of the world. Farmer power allowed for development of ever increasingly complex societies with specialist who could focus on improving technology. Western Europe and China then were able to cherry pick the Fertile Crescent's crops, livestock and technology by virtue of their proximity and the fact that they shared a common latitude for easy transplant of plants/livestock - Africa, the Americas and Australia were not so lucky. The Fertile Crescent societies would then fall behind Europe and China due to overloading and collapse of the delicate Fertile Crescent eco-sphere. China would eventually fall behind Europe due to a unique European geography that allowed for numerous political states to survive and compete for dominance through push-pull cycles of technology development.One of the most striking points that Diamond makes is how the germs of the Old World eviscerated the peoples of the New World. Beyond providing the ability to develop complex societies and technology, Eurasia's farmer power also had a more insidious aspect - it provided the densities of humans and animals required for animal germs to jump to humans. In this way, the influenza, measles, small pox, typhoid germs would rise, but the Eurasian population densities had the advantage that their peoples were able to evolve at the same time that the germs were evolving - allowing the Eurasian societies to develop immunities. Unfortunately, when Pizarro and the other conquistadors arrived in the New World, they introduced lethal germs into Mayan and Inca populations without any form of immunities, which resulted in whole sale decimation of their populations. Though European technology was a factor, Diamond argues that it was weakening caused by these rampant new diseases that made the Mayan, Inca and Native American empires so easy for the Europeans to conquer.The strong point of Guns, Germs and Steel is Diamond's cogent explanation of the environmental/geographic factors that control how quickly human societies evolve from hunter/gatherers to farmers. The weak point of the book is that Diamond tends to get mired down in pedantic explanations of why all the third world countries didn't progress as fast as Europe. He spends a lot of time explaining why New Guinea society didn't have the unique combination of environmental variables require to evolve, and then he repeats the same argument for numerous African, Australian and American societies. Diamond was obviously trying to give equal time to all parts of the world and therefore not show any bias, but the result is large patches of the book that are very dry and somewhat difficult to read. Really, I think he could have made his case by first describing the unique set of variables that enabled the development of the Fertile Crescent, and then just arguing that the rest of the world didn't posses these same variables and therefore fell behind. But, never the less, I recommend Guns, Germs and Steel because it provides amazing insight into why the world has developed the way it has, something we all need to know if we really want to understand the world we live in."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"Why humans developed differently? Why Europe, not China, has more wealth? Why whites, not blacks, dominate the modern world? To answer those perennials questions, Diamond searched our 13,000 years history. He found clues in food production, domesticated animals, disease dispersal, migration trends, and language history. He concluded the primary reason for human inequality is the environment, not innate differences in people.Diamond presents broad historical patterns. He starts with farmer power, how more wild plants and animals available for domestication allowed a more dense population, and how the spread of innovative techniques was uneven as movement across continents was easier East-West than North-South. More agriculture allowed denser populations. And more people lead to diseases (and immunization), technology (weapons and writing), and centralized decision-making (religions and governments).Criticism of Diamond's theory revolves around the human factor. But the pundits ignore the subtleties of his theory: interaction with the environment, not geography or biology alone, is responsible for human development. It stems from the conjectures that knowledge is cumulative and complexity creates innovation. Brushing across history and science, Diamond suggests that different environments caused the diversity of human progress and that the past serves as a guide to the future."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"What an amazing book!When I started this, someone from a mail list I'm on said that it should be required reading for anyone interested in creating a world. I heartily agree. In a short 425 pages, Mr. Diamond shows us how mankind stopped being nothing more than roving bands of &quot;primative&quot; hunter-gatherers and grew into complicated societies. He also shows us how some cultures advanced more quickly than others. Along the way, he explains how history works. What drives massive migration? What allows someone to invent? Why would we need to develop writing and what advantage does it give over people who can't?All those questions, and more, are answered in a very logical, easy-to-understand way that was a pleasure to read. In fact, it was a challenge to read during the holidays because each page is so densely packed with relavent information that I felt I needed to devote my entire attention to the page. I'm sure there were important ideas that I missed, so I'll eventually re-read this one, and I say that about very few books.As a writer, I found numerous ideas for how a culture might develop in this book. And, along with those ideas, I found a lot of motivations for created people, as well. At many times in history, life has been an adventure, no matter who you were or what you wanted life to be. Mr. Diamond highlights several of those times in Guns, Germs and Steel. For instance, imagine what it must have been like to be some of the first people to colonize New Guinea or Australia using only primative stone and bone tools. Now, imagine what it might have been like with a few differences, like steel. Start writing about those imaginings and, viola, you're off and running.No matter how you slice it, Guns, Germs and Steel is a great book that I'd reccomend to almost anyone with an interest in ancient history."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"As all scientific inquiries do, this one began with a question.

To paraphrase, both the question and the thesis of Guns, Germs, and Steel (GGS), \\"How come Western societies developed the means to conquer and exploit non-Western societies?\\" And why wasn't it the reverse -- why didn't the Americas conquer Europe, for instance?Thus begins what Diamond calls \\"13,000 years of history on all continents [compressed] into a 400-page book.\\" The breadth of what GGS covers is breathtaking, and the conclusions, surprisingly, not at all counterintuitive. In fact, every time Diamond pointed out a conclusion based on his researches, it wasn't so much a door opened on a new room as a door opened on an old room I couldn't quite construct in my mind until I was shown how. I think that's how teachers teach best: not by showing you something entirely new, but by showing you how to fit together the jagged edges of pieces of the old you already know.To risk even further compression, here is what Diamond proposes. The necessary conditions for cultural triumph, in no particular order, are: population density, large animal domestication, food production (agriculture), resistance to diseases passed from animals and plants to humans, technological inventiveness and acceptance of change and improvement, literacy (at least among the elites), and centralized government. Add to that mix of accident and planning the good fortune of an east-west continental orientation -- and the consequent east-west spread of population, domestic animals, disease, technology, writing and government -- and you have the necessary conditions for a dominant society.However, as Diamond takes pains to point out, these are not sufficient conditions for success. A lot depends on chance, some of it on inventiveness in individual societies, some to forward-looking government, and some even to individual vision and initiative. It's as if, as I paraphrase from what he says at the beginning of chapter nine, which is Diamond's own paraphrase of Anna Karenina, \\"successful societies are all alike; every unsuccessful society is unsuccessful in its own way\\":&lt;> If a society's population is not sufficiently dense, or has an unfavorable climate, or poor raw materials, it will never graduate from the hunter-gatherer stage;&lt;> If a society has no crops at hand that are suitable for domestication, they will never develop sufficient population density to overcome weaker societies;&lt;> If a society has no large animals at hand that are suitable for domestication, they will never develop sources of meat, transportation, beasts of burden and so forth;&lt;> If a society fails to develop dense populations of crops, animals and humans, they will never develop the germs, and resistance to those germs, that allow them to kill off (usually unintentionally) less dense, less resistant populations;&lt;> If a society fails to develop a population sufficiently dense to support specialist classes and a strong central government, it will never become organized enough to overcome or absorb its enemies in war.And so on. Diamond appears to agree with Hobbes that war is the natural state of humankind, and his examples demonstrate that depressing assertion. Likewise, he asserts that all centralized governments evolve into a \\"kleptocracy,\\" which justifies feeding the rich off of the labor of the poor, either through fear of its power or through religion (which is another form of fear). In writing this book, Diamond at once provides a convincing explanation for the differing developments of human societies on different continents throughout human history, and explodes myths of innate racial superiority. The recurring theme that I glean from GGS is that the success of a society rests in equal parts on accident and on human intervention -- and not all of that human intervention is entirely conscious.Some of the author's detractors may say that his assertion that the east-west continental orientation of the Old World, versus the north-south orientation of the New World, is a strained explanation of societal success -- a geographical determinism -- but I must point out that Diamond stresses that there are no single causes: there are many causes of failure to develop \\"cargo,\\" as the Guinean Yali put it. And there are many causes for societies who once had cargo -- like the medieval Islamic and the ancient Chinese, not to mention the ancient Mediterranean -- to lose their cargo and their superiority. But, as Diamond so excellently points out in Guns, Germs, and Steel, one of the causes was not race."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"Don't read this book for the lyricism of Diamond's writing. Parts of the book, especially the late-middle portion, sound like an over-worked graduate student stayed up for a week in order to finish the text. A smoother delivery style would have made the ideas in this book easier to digest. (I found the writing style in &quot;The Third Chimpanzee&quot; to be more &quot;readable.&quot;)However, what ideas! I feel my knowledge and understanding of world history -- geology, physiology, human history, and human behavior -- was greatly enhanced by this book. I have been thinking about human history much differently after reading the book, and you will, too.I don't usually read non-fiction or natural history, but I really enjoyed this book. Recommended for curious and open-minded readers, because your understanding will be challanged and expanded."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"In the introduction to this Pulitzer Prize winning book, author Jared Diamond recounts a 1972 conversation with a Papau New Guinean leader who asked why Europeans came with all their technology to &quot;discover&quot; New Guinea, instead of the other way around. This was a question Diamond had already considered, because to his mind native New Guineans were at least as intelligent as Europeans. Twenty-five years later, Diamond had an answer for that question, and it is a good one. According to Diamond, the domination of the world by European culture since 1500 (and the US is culturally an extension of Europe) is the result of three proximate factors: military and political developments up to and particularly since 1500; the ravages of European based disease on newly-met peoples; and the development of technology. He summarizes these three factors in the three words of his title. He explains how these proximate causes developed from root causes in a review of biological, climatological, geographical and other trends and events in the 13,000 or so years since the end of the last ice age. In his review, he specifically addresses the so-called &quot;genetic advantages&quot; which have been cited by some to claim &quot;racial superiority&quot; as a root cause for &quot;white&quot; domination of world events, and gives a plausible explanation of why there is no such thing. Unfortunately, people who would espouse that reasoning are not likely to work through this book to discover why they are wrong. Readers will have to work to finish this book, but they will be rewarded when they do. It is dry reading, and very repetitive. It is, however, well worth the effort. Diamond looks at why, if Africa is the source location of humanity as we know it, Africa has continued to be the least developed continent, and perhaps the one with the most human problems today. He provides explanation of why the &quot;Fertile Crescent&quot; was the source of western civilization, but became the far-from-fertile political problem area it is now; why development moved westward from the middle- and near-east into Europe; why China, with a highly developed culture thousands of years ago, stultified and only recently entered the modern age; and why European-based diseases wiped out other cultures but their diseases seldom (but not always) had little effect on Europeans. This book does not give us any indications how cultural and economic differences can be addressed today, but perhaps if we better understand how they came to exist if the first place, then maybe we can come up with a way that they can be addressed. This book does help us with that better understanding."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"I could not put this book down. I have read some great thrillers by Greisham and others, that were less compelling than this brilliant examination of 13,000 years of human interaction over the world and the impact of this interaction on the environment, world history and the various species populating the earth, past and present. I must say that it has added a dimension to my perspective of the history/evolution of the human species. Jared Diamond's scholarship meets, in my humble opinion, the very highest standards. The breadth and depth of his research is staggering. This is certainly one of the best books I have read in many, many years."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"Diamond explores how and why our human societies evolved so differently as they did. What makes this book an interesting read is that Diamond tries hard to keep the arguments as objective as possible. He usually starts a new thought with some relevant and often provoking questions. Not only does this make the text stimulating to read, but it helps the reader compare his thoughts with the extensive answers that Diamond provides. If you are ready to take a &quot;walk&quot; through 13000 years of history you will discover lots of new ways to look at the world we live in."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"I already know this book is interesting and I'm looking forward to read it, but I give it just 2 stars because this is a very poor kindle edition. I'm pro e-book reading all the way, that's I'm a bit disappointed to see an edition done with no care at all, without the maps and illustrations that you can find on the paper edition. These maps, figures, diagrams are vital to the full comprehension and enjoyment of the book; they must be in the kindle edition also! I hope they will release a new kindle edition soon and that we can download it again for free, because this one doesn't favour at all the pleasure of reading on a e-ink device."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"I think some of the reviewers here didn't read the book closely enough to understand the context of some of Diamond's arguments. He never says that biogeographical effects are the ONLY causes history. His main purpose is the search for the ultimate, extremely general causes for the broadest of trends in human history and prehistory.By the time the Mongols roared across Asia, or the Moguls invaded India, many cultures around the world already changed so much that bioregional factors, though seminal in the creation of these broadest trends, weren't nearly as important as the political, religious and economic ones. He is not ignoring religion and so on but, he states plainly several times that isn't his focus. He is looking for ultimate causes--before humans had extremely advanced mental concepts like religion.He also wanted to point out the devastating influence of disease on history. It was surely the European germs that did most of the conquering of Native Americans. The guns and horses were almost incidental. Later on, once Europeans had established themselves, then we can focus on economic and political systems. But we can't ignore the effects of the diseases unleashed on the Americas. These plagues gave the Europeans a very lucky boost that catapulted them beyond the wealth and power of China, India or the Middle East--long before the Industrial Revolution made this gap obvious.Another thing that some people seem to be having trouble with is his assertions about the native intelligence of tribal peoples around the world. (If you read the book, you notice that he is not just saying this about the New Guineans.)He takes pains to point out what he means by this. He not talking about some mysterious genetic superiority of tribal peoples. It's all straight up culture. Tribal culture forces people to be better generalists than they'd have to be in literate civilizations. They can't rely on embedded support structures like books for memory or experts for obscure fields. They have to be pretty good at a lot things. Otherwise they die. They have to be better at memorizing things because they can't count on computers or books to remember things for them. Living in a dangerous, wild environment makes them cautious and aware of all that is going on around them. That was all he meant. The circumstance of tribal peoples force them, only in very broad ways and only on an individual basis, to be smarter and more curious than civilized people.And in the end it does them no good. Because civilized societies are SMARTER than tribal societies. That is why tribal society has been steadily disappearing over the millenia. They just can't compete.Finally, of course the book is repetitive. In fact he sums up his argument in the preface of the book. You needn't even read the rest if you don't want to. The rest of the book consists of him reiterating his points from different angles to point out the objections he has managed to answer and the many questions that still remain. He is just following scholarly practice and exposition--just to make things clear that he has thought about this.He knows that his theory can't explain everything. In the epilog he points out that China, India and the Middle East are good counter examples to his idea. They each had an expansionist rise to great power--a time when they were unafraid to try new ideas and explore new ways of doing things. If the highly complex forces of economics, politics, religion had arrayed themselves differently. We might all be speaking Arabic now. Or Cantonese. Europe was just lucky to be in the right place at the right time for things to come together as they did."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"In one compelling volume, the famous biologist Jared Diamond tackles the most important question of global history: Why did Europeans come to dominate the New World?This question has been answered by others before; Diamond's idea that Europe's geography is the cause (&quot;geographical determinism&quot;) has also been proposed before. Any student of history can drag up a case or two of this thesis. Baron Montaigne, for example, proposed that Europe's primacy stemmed from its superior government, which could be derived directly from the coolness of its climate.The deep significance of this book is that Diamond's thesis is not simply idle speculation. He proves that the Eurasian land mass had by far the best biological resources with which to develop agricultural societies, and was thus more able to form large, coherent, and powerful social entities.To support this idea, Diamond introduces thorough set of well-researched data on what kinds of plants and animals are necessary to support a farming society. He investigates the biological resources available to potential farmers in all parts of the world. The people of Eurasia had access to a suite of plants and animals that provided for their needs. Potential farmers in other parts of the world didn't-- and so their fertile soil went untilled.After establishing this strong foundation, Diamond falls into repeating ideas about the formation of large-scale societies. These ideas, while unoriginal, are still compelling, and Diamond presents them in a very clear and well-written way.His other major original contribution comes when he discusses the diseases that helped the Old World conquer the New. Building on his earlier chapters dealing with Old-World domesticated animals, he shows that these very animals were the sources of the major plagues (such as smallpox) which virtually annihilated New World populations. The fact that Old Worlders had immunities to these diseases was a direct result of their agricultural head-start.Along with these monumental contributions to History, this book has its drawbacks. If you're looking for a narrative explaining Great People, Great Events, or Modern Ideas, you will be sadly disappointed. Diamond's thesis offhandedly assumes that it is difficult to believe Shakespeare's plays or Newton's laws could have been written by hunter-gatherers.If you are looking for reasons why Europe came to dominate the world, rather than, say, China, Diamond presents mixed results. He mentions the 14th century self-isolation of China, but does not analyze it. He also brings up the odd theory about the relationship between the coastline lengths of Europe and China and trade potential; this idea is provably wrong.If you are looking for a book that explains the world's history of the past 500 years, look elsewhere. Guns, Germs and Steel exhausts itself by effectively, coherently, fundamentally, definitively, and entertainingly explaining the preceeding 15,000.I do not hesitate to recommend this book to anyone with an interest in world history. The scholarship is first-rate, and the thesis is incredibly significant. The technical details, while complete, are presented in a very easy to understand way, and Diamond's writing style is fun and engaging. It fully deserved the Pulitzer prize."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"According to Diamond, four factors are responsible for all historical developments: 1) availability of potential crops and domestic animals, 2) the orientation of continental axis to facilitate the spread of agriculture, 3) transfer of knowledge between continents, and 4) population size.Diamond states that \\"those four sets of factors constitute big environmental differences that can be quantified objectively and that are not subject to dispute.\\" Fair enough, but what *is* subject to dispute is that there might be some other factors at work. Thomas Sowell in Race and Culture does a good job of developing the thesis that the exchange of information among European cultures, facilitated by Europe's plentiful navigable rivers, was the key to Europe's technological and economic rise. David Landes in the Wealth and Poverty of Nations attributes China's conscious decision in the 1400's to isolate itself form other nations as the key event (decision) that caused it to lose it's technological advantage and fall behind Europe. (Diamond briefly touches on 15th Century China in the final chapter, but manages to boil this as well down to an accident of geography.)This is unfortunate, because the book contains a wealth of excellent material which is excellently explained. Many of the core causes which Diamond explores ring very true, and his points are persuasively argued. The connection between the development of agriculture and the subsequent unequal rise of military capability worldwide is very convincing. But convincing though they may be, reading these theories one can't shake the sneaking suspicion that Diamond is selectively presenting evidence which he's has found to support his previously drawn conclusion, and neglecting evidence which runs counter.Diamond plants these doubts through his sometimes-careless prose. Consider the following statement, which he includes in the introduction to his chapter on the rise of food production:\\"My fellow farmhands were, for the most part, tough whites whose normal speech featured strings of curses, and who spent their weekdays working so that they could devote their weekends to squandering their weeks' wages in the local saloon. Among the farmhands, though, was a member of the Blackfoot Indian tribe named Levi, who behaved very differently from the coarse miners - being polite, gentle, responsible, sober, and well spoken\\"I thought for a moment that I'd wandered into the script for \\"Dances With Wolves.\\" Note that had this statement been turned on its head - had he, for example, recounted an unflattering anecdote about Native Americans or Hispanics -my instincts would immediately warn me that the author's biases might be influencing how he chooses to present the evidence. I myself am a Black American, I'm all too painfully aware that we've had to wade through some pretty grim stuff penned by authors clutching at straws to support their racist white supremacist views of the world. In this case Diamond does the reverse by aiming his negative bias towards Caucasians, but if I'm truly interested in unbiased science then my skepticism should remain the same.That I lead with these criticisms is evidence of my disappointment in what could have been an excellent book, and indeed much of it *is* indeed excellent. This is a book that taught me much and has indeed changed my view of world history in many ways. I do recommend this book - the details are good and many of the theories ring true, but in the same breath I would warn against accepting Diamond's conclusions in their entirety without a bit of skepticism.In summary, Guns, Germs, and Steel contains an important feature which David Landes's Wealth and Poverty of Nations so conspicuously lacks: a grand unifying theory which links the disparate growth rates of diverse societies worldwide. But Diamond's tidy conclusion that world history is simply a deterministic result of geography and nothing else is not entirely satisfying, especially in that it might cause us to be complacent about the future. I accept that accidents of geography have had a huge effect on mankind, and Diamond convincingly argues this. But culture and human decisions do matter. Diamond argues that human ingenuity is simply the result of the accident of having a larger population from which to draw innovations - but societies that internalize this philosophy do so at their considerable peril."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"GUNS, GERMS, AND STEEL is a persuasive discourse of competitive plausibility regarding the challenging question why population groups on different continents experienced widely divergent paths of development. Contrary to the voluminous objections cited in the many of the reviews below, Professor Jared Diamond, clearly an enthusiastic proponent of environmental determinism, presents a set of premises consistent with evidence provided from a wide range of disciplines, but he does not attempt to answer the question of genetic diversity, including differentiated intelligence, among racial groups as many reviewers have inferred. If anything, implicitly, the author appears to support promulgations of differentiated intelligences; he sets out to demonstrate intelligence was not the root cause to Eurasian dominance.On at least two occasions Diamond, without equivocation, stated he found on average the New Guinean to be more intelligent than the average European or American. He was prompted to undertake this investigation as a result of a question posed by a New Guinean friend - Why white people developed so much cargo (material goods) and brought it to New Guinea while the indigenous had so little. Diamond summarized his findings as follows: &quot;History followed different courses for different peoples because of differences among peoples environments, not because of biological differences among people themselves.&quot;Beginning 13,000 years ago, the author illuminated the conditions or circumstances that may have facilitated growth for some groups and inhibited the same for others. Diamond accepts the out of Africa theory for the dispersion of Homosapiens to the other continents (for purposes of his treatise Europe and Asia are indivisible), and like the old axiom of real estate, the importance of location, location, location becomes readily apparent. For Diamond, food production is the ultimate cause of variable rates of development for different peoples. He illustrates how the abundance of wild plants subject to domestication and availability of large mammals served as immediate factors to transition from hunter/gatherer bands and tribes to sedentary agriculturally based chiefdoms and states.Diamond lists what he proposes as proximate causes to European dominance:1) Germs - based on close proximity to domesticated animals, immunities were developed infectious strains Europeans would carry to other areas, resulting in the decimation of non-immunized populations. In turn, those groups had few autochthonous diseases that would affect the invaders.2) Invention of writing- relatively sedentary lifestyles facilitated devotion of more time and effort to the creation of methodologies to control and coordinate commerce. These systems eased transfer of information among society members, and had further implications to the establishment of hierarchical political organization.3) Axial orientation of the different continents - east/ west orientation was conducive to transmigration of people, products, and technologies. Plants best suited to specific climatic conditions were readily transferable; geographic encumbrances were less severe and population isolation was not as significant.4) Establishment of hierarchical organizations - food production instigated the growth of artisan classes focused on technological improvement, leisure classes devoted to functions unrelated to subsistence, organization of massive armies comprised of professional soldiers, and religion, which allowed individual groupings to live together under codification without killing one another.5) Continental Isolation - Landmasses that were separated by geographic or ecological boundaries were under less pressure to develop or adopt new ideas, products or technologies from competing civilizations.Some of the author's theories were not defended as successfully as others. His explanation why Sub-Saharan Africans were unable to identify species (the water buffalo and Zebra are two prime examples) that may have been used in farming and commerce seemed rather weak. Capture, taming and subsequent selective breeding for temperament seems as viable here as he indicates was the case on the Eurasian plains for other species. Similarly, he does not offer a convincing argument regarding the American Indian's failure to domesticate the Bison, although the inference seems to be the lack of cultivatible plant life was certainly a factor.Overall, Diamond provides a compelling theory of the differences in development rates among different peoples, linking a wide set of factors that are not generally considered in parallel in the historical record. For anyone with even peripheral interest in the evolution of different societies, this is an enthralling book."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"As an avid reader with absolutely no previous contact with the field of anthropology, I found this book to be mesmerizing. Jared Diamond has achieved great success with \\"Guns, Germs and Steel\\" (national best-seller, Pulitzer Prize), but it has also made him the target of strident, often venomous criticism...Diamond's general thesis is that the West conquered the world rather than vice versa because of a fluke of nature. In short, Eurasia was home to an important number of crops and animals that readily lent themselves to successful domestication. This domestication resulted in mass food production, which the author claims is the \\"ultimate\\" cause of Western dominance. Food production, in turn, led to a number of \\"proximate\\" causes related to the rise of the West: farms and animal herds led to stationary populations and excess food to support a specialized class of bureaucrats and soldiers; it also increased population density, which, along with close contact with animals, led to germs and the subsequent genetic resistance of Westerners to those diseases. Finally, Diamond concludes, the unique East-West axis of Eurasia and the absence of any impenetrable geographic barriers fostered the spread of new crops, technologies, etc., which gave rise to many competing communities, whose competition further increased the western lead over the rest of the world.Diamond's arguments are persuasive on the surface, and even the biggest skeptic will have reason for pause after reading his book. However, the final chapter reveals that he can't really resolve a fundamental question: why did Europe, rather than the Middle East, India or China come to conquer the world? Almost the entire book is dedicated to explaining why the Eurasian landmass was blessed with the prerequisites for large civilizations rather than the Americas, Africa and Australia. His terse explanation for why Europe in particular dominated leaves much to be desired and explained.In this reviewer's opinion, the recent book by classicist Victor Davis Hanson (\\"Carnage and Culture\\") provides a plausible epilogue for Diamond's piece. Hanson completely and explicitly rejects Diamond's geographic determinism, but I don't think the two theses are incompatible or in any way mutually exclusive. In fact, it seems to me that Diamond and Hanson support one another, as the latter's assertion that the war-making efficiency of liberal democracies beginning in the Hellenistic period explains Europe's ultimate triumph.In closing, as an introduction to anthropology and a cogent depiction of one school of thought on the rise of the West this book is marvelous. Approach it with an open-mind, reflect on the thesis and the supporting evidence, and then draw your own conclusions. Love it or hate it, you owe it to yourself to read this book."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"Food. Plants. Animals. Geography. Climate. Politics. Technology. These are the seven key areas that the author attempts to tie together in his quest to explain the unequal development of civilizations in different areas of the world from the beginning of mankind to the present.Diamond starts at the epicenter of human origins, and then proceeds to show how human populations spread over the globe, and then how one civilization advanced, spread, and subsequently conquered or extinguished a lesser civilization in another geographical area in order to absorb it. There are a vast number of interesting facts of human history interspersed in this chronology. Near the end, it will become evident why the author presented his sequence of hypothesized events in such a manner.When the book was written, Jared Diamond was a professor of physiology at UCLA School of Medicine. He was trained as a geographer and has spent much of his research time studying the most primitive, present day humans, the natives of New Guinea. In this book, he wears many hats, among them being that of a botanist, animal husbandrist, military strategist, epidemiologist, and cultural and physical anthropologist.There are a lot of fascinating questions about early human civilizations that are answered in this treatise. Here are several: When did human history begin? Which country has the most languages? Which geographical axis is most conducive to the advancement of a civilization? How did climate changes affect civilizations? What is the relationship of food, population stability, and political leadership in the advancement of a civilization? Why was 95% of the Native American population of 20,000,000 decimated in 1492? Why did 80% of the big, wild mammals in North America become extinct 13,000 years ago? How did Africa become black, and why is Africa the most diverse human continent?Any reader of this book will come away with a plethora of knowledge about human history and an appreciation of which forces drove its destiny. In order to gain this understanding, the reader will have to plod through a very long treatise by the author, which at times the reader will undoubtedly feel is laden with unnecessary technical knowledge. Some of these topics would include plant and animal species, nutrition, and language development.This is an excellent and well elucidated account of the history of human development. In the epilogue and 2003 update of the original book, the author attempts to correlate his conclusion of which forces are responsible for the inequalities of human development with the present inequalities in the global, business climate. Diamond also reveals at the end his conclusion whether environmental or human biological differences make one group of people superior to another. In that conclusion, he is bound to encounter a lot of resistance."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"Many years ago a New Guinea native asked Jared Diamond a simple question: \\"Why is it that you white people developed so much cargo and brought it to New Guinea, but we black people had little cargo of our own?\\" Only slightly rephrased, Diamond devotes this book to answering the question why, from the depths of the primeval forests of Africa, mankind emerged at different rates, some achieving the heights of civilization and technology while others remained virtually in the Stone Age? And why did people on some continental landmasses prosper while people on others lagged behind, especially because some locations, like the California Coast, are mild and desirable while others, like Northern Europe are harsh and forbidding?Diamond's thesis is that some populations got a head start over others in the development of civilization. But the head start resulted from favorable geography and natural resources, not from any innate superiority. Given the same location and advantages, any group of people over time would have reached the same result. The first beneficiary of geography happened to be the Fertile Crescent. The \\"cradle of civilization\\" not only had all five major large mammals (sheep, goats, cattle, pigs, and horses) available for domestication, but they also possessed the major wild seed groups that would become domesticated grain and cereals. Not all areas are so favorably endowed.Once hunting and gathering gave way to food production, population density took hold, which in turn made possible civic development and technology. The head start then spread roughly along the same parallel east to Asia and west to Europe. Diamond contrasts Eurasia's wide girth and similar climates with America's and Africa's narrow waist and elongated longitude. Technology and culture can shuttle back and forth vast distances between east and west, but climatic zone differences as well as mountain ranges and deserts inhibit flows north and south.I have two criticisms of the book. One, it has no footnotes so that one can source out the author's materials. For example, on page 108 Diamond asserts that early man, because of his ego, would rather hunt giraffes than gather nuts. Is that theory his, or someone else's? The very nature of a book such as \\"Guns, Germs, and Steel\\" requires that it pile theory upon theory to make a picture puzzle of a distant and hidden past. If key pieces don't fit, the picture may take a decidedly Cubist theme. A few footnotes would help the reader who wants to delve deeper into a topic.The second criticism is the author's failure to address the role of human intelligence in the development of civilization. Considering the grief Charles Murray took into for writing \\"The Bell Curve,\\" which held that certain populations have actually raised their intelligence level through centuries of using their brains to solve problems, one understands why Diamond steers clear of the topic - no academic can afford to be tinged with even a hint of racism or euro centrism. Plenty of professors on the leftist fringe stand ready to point the accusing finger any anybody who deviates from the acceptable norm. But surely scholars can deal with the role human intelligence in a non-racist way; after all, the physiology of the human brain is the same in all Homo sapiens. Diamond owes it to his readers to complete the mosaic he has created."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"As the saying goes, when you have a hammer, everything looks like nails. I found Diamond's basic hypothesis that the march to civilization is accelerated (if not determined) by availability of useful, domesticable plants and animals and a geography suited for the transmission of the plants and animals (and later ideas) over a large distance very compelling.The two places he fails in what would otherwise be one of the best books I've read is he seems to be working toward a personal agenda, and he applies his theories to inappropriate situations. His personal agenda is not hidden, with his discussion of New Guinea's tribesmen fairly glowing. I guess it's better to have it out in the open than hidden, but it makes the work seem like a justification for his preconceptions rather than an unbiased research into the broad strokes of history.His very compelling basic point is that when numerous small groups (tribes, etc) compete, the rate of adoption, modification, and usage of available resources will be fairly constant across any group of people. The rate is only modified by the quality of those resources and the number of people with access to them, because if one society fails to use its resources at the best rate of human invention, a competing society will force the adoption either through competition or conquest.The problem is, and he acknowledges it in one sentence and ignores it in another, is that when societies (especially dictatorial ones) no longer feel competitive pressure, they can behave in largely unpredictable ways governed only by happenstance and psychology. He tries to explain the failures of the Aztecs and (especially) the Incas to use the wheel by describing them as \\"Island Cultures\\" since they did not have competing societies nearby. He later uses the same argument about China.The problem is that there is a range between small tribes and enormous islands where his theory only partially applies, and where much of written history has occurred. His arguments to explain why Europe was not one big island (meaning politically unified) were not very compelling, but given the fact that Europe wasn't unified his theory does explain why the West outpaced China in the past 600 years. His troubling assertion that the fertile crescent couldn't compete with Europe in modern times merely due to resource depletion (since it had been civilized for so long) was only in passing and lacked much backing in statistics or research.Unlike some other reviewers, I don't feel he was too hard on the West's modern conquest of the native peoples of the Pacific, the Americas, and Africa. He points out that disease made the lands empty, and that much of the pushing out of the natives was inadvertent due to the actions of people behaving just as our prehistoric ancestors did (and every other continent's ancestors did) for thousands of years. And when he chooses the words \\"exterminated\\" (in modern colonization) over \\"displaced\\" (in prehistoric colonization) he does it because he has the historical facts to back him up in one case, and only conjecture in the other, and he acknowledges the difference at least a few times.I definitely recommend this book if you are unfamiliar with the geographical element of the prehistoric move to civilization. Just keep in mind this is a theory that by nature no longer applies, and stopped applying somewhere between 100-600 years ago as modern communication destroyed geographic separation."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"In July 1972, Author Jared Diamond, was walking alonga beach on a tropic island of New Guinea, where as abiologist he studied bird evolution. By chance, heran into a local politician, named Yali, who wasworking to liberate what was then Papa New Guinea fromthe Australia government. After hours ofconversation, Yali posed the question, \\"Why is it thatyou white people developed so much cargo (technology)and brought it to New Guinea, but we black people hadlittle cargo of our own?\\" Why did wealth and powerbecome distributed as they are now, rather than insome other way? Diamond was troubled that he did nothave an adequate response to Yali's Question. Fastforward 25 years -- Diamond writes a 425 page answer.The most common explanation to this question involvesimplicit or explicit assumptions based on biologicalinequalities. Usually these racial explanations arecast in some sort of Darwinian argument wherecausality is often left in question. Diamond thesisattempts to refute these theories with an alternatetheory. Relying on a combination of history,archeology, and microbiology, and genetics, Diamondsuggests that the most striking differences betweenthe long-term histories of different cultures havebeen due not to innate differences in peoplesthemselves but to differences in their environments.These environmental factors include: continentaldifferences in the wild plant and animal speciesavailable as starting materials for domestication;environmental factors affecting rates of diffusion andmigration; and continental differences in area ortotal population sizes. Diamond believes that thesegeographical inequalities set different civilizationson pre-determined trajectories to develop politicalorganization, technological advancements, and immunityto disease that allowed them to encounter and conquerother civilizations.A cultural historian in a past life, I get all excitedabout this sort of thing.As one can imagine, trying to explain the history ofcivilization in one volume is an arduous task.Diamond chooses to explain his theory in broad strokesthen uses natural experiments at distinct points inhistory to demonstrate how his ideas play out. Thisis a general problem with all meta-histories.Historical methods teach us that it is virtuallyimpossible to forge a bulletproof argument withoutdelving into the minutia. But when focusing on the\\"big picture\\" issues, there is just too muchinformation to cover. Diamond does a very good jobmanaging this balance. He begins by outlining hismethods and follows through on his explanation withdedication and accomplishment. He goes into justabout the right amount of detail on every subject andinfuses the traditional historical approach with ahealthy dose of scientific discovery. The chaptersconcerning the domestication of plants and largeanimals are a joy to read. While speaking on thefamiliar new world conquest, Diamond is balanced inthe application of his detailed examples to forwardhis theories. Notably, Diamond uses Australia and thesouth pacific to demonstrate the dissemination oftechnology and China to discuss the application ofunified language and political entities. In fact,with my American History background, I was morepartial to the Euro centric examples.So what's bad about the book? One of my pet peevesinvolves arguing by anecdotal evidence and I cringedevery time Diamond brought up some story about abushman to illustrate his point. But this was a minorannoyance. Another problem is Diamond's paucity offootnotes. There were several portions of prose thatI felt should have been annotated with furtherdiscussion and evidence. I should also warn you thatthis book is a little dense. Be prepared for a 20page discussion about the cross pollination oflanguage. It's a good idea to remember that I've gota degree in this stuff. Back when I was younger,smarter, and more exciting, I used to pour throughthousands of pages of this garbage every week. Beateninto submission by a desk job and dearth of ...pitchers of beer, I found the last 100 pages of Guns,Germs, and Steel difficult to get throughSo if you are up for the challenge, \\"Guns, Germs, andSteel\\" is a insightful and rewarding book. For me, itwas probably a good substitute for chasing women andthe cultural/political theories almost kept me warm atnight. All joking aside, I guarantee that this bookwill change the way you think about European conquest."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"Prof. Diamond has produced a fluently-written account of a popular theory -- that contemporary differences in human cultures and societies are the result solely of starting conditions with respect to geography and environment. However, the book holds numerous flaws.There can be no doubt that Prof. Diamond is the master of a vast amount of data, biological and historical, and he marshals those data to good effect in support of his theories. However, there are many troubling omissions and contradictions contained in the book, which indicate that either there are important holes in Prof. Diamond's knowledge, or that he has been somewhat too selective in his use of data. For example, in discussing the native cereals available to various local groups for purposes of cultivation, he consistently speaks as if corn were the only grain available in Mesoamerica for domestication, and, indeed, that it was the only grain so domesticated. In fact, amaranth was also available, and domesticated. It further lacks many of the deficiencies which Diamond asserts made corn an imperfect domesticate. His failure to deal with this contradictory fact calls his more general arguments into question.Diamond also ignores facts which are uncomfortable or unexplainable under the terms of his theory. For example, he points out that certain grasses native to the Eastern U.S. produce &quot;dream&quot; grains -- the example he offers is sumpweed. Yet the reason he offers that it was not domesticated is weak; it causes hay-fever, and has an objectionable smell. As Diamond should be aware, the question of whether a smell is objectionable is often culturally determined, as are many aesthetic notions. So the fact that we may find it objectionable now does not mean that contemporary consumers of it did, and does not explain why they failed fully to domesticate it. He also offers that other grains had seeds that were too small; but at the same time offers the example of corn being engineered over many years from teosinte, which had even more drawbacks. Why could these plants not have been bred for larger seeds, over time? Why did mesoamericans engineer corn in this way, while north-eastern inhabitants failed to do the same with the plants available to them? He argues that the fact that eastern US farmers abandoned their own crops when offered mesoamerican replacements indicates they were less worthwhile; but all that proves is that the mesoamericans had done a better job of engineering their crops for human consumption, not that those crops were better. Diamond also fails to provide an answer to the question of why mesoamericans failed to adopt the wheel. While arguing that the lack of large draft animals made their use unlikely, he acknowledges that the wheel was, in fact, first used as an adjunct to human labor, in the form of wheelbarrows. The reader is left to wonder why mesoamericans failed to adopt this practical use for the wheel, while leaving them on toys.The book is irksome in its continual reliance on loose arguments, consistently indicated by the use of such terms as &quot;surely&quot;, &quot;clearly&quot; or &quot;it must therefore follow,&quot; etc. Those words indicate a weakness of proof, not clarity of proof, and encourage the reader to disagree with his conclusions. The book needs a good edit.Finally, Prof. Diamond proves too little. It is unsurprising, and probably not subject to serious debate, that the earlier occupation of the old world by humans means those societies would have a head start over societies arising on a continent populated only tens of thousands of years later. Furthermore, it is intuitively acceptable that isolated societies (such as his precious New Guinea) are less likely to innovate, based on a lack of intellectual cross-currents and the inability to take advantage of new discoveries. But his book cannot explain the peculiar phenomenon of the rise of the West. His geographical and environmental advantages are spread over the whole Eurasian continent, from Spain to China, and are centered in the Fertile Crescent, and these areas have indubitably been linked by trade and war for millenia. Why, then, was America not colonized by Chinese explorers? Why was China invaded by Europeans during the eighteenth centuries and forward, and not the reverse. The fertile crescent was indeed the center of civilization for many years, while Europe was a back-water suffering invasion until the mid-seventeenth century. Why was that trend reversed so suddenly and dramatically, so that by the nineteenth century Britain, France and Russia could vie for protectorates from Palestine east to Indochina? The answer, I would argue, is that the Industrial Revolution occurred in Europe -- indeed it began at the very time that China, the giant in terms of industrial production at the time, was turning in on itself. Why, then, did the IR, which is what made possible the enormous European expansion of the 18-19 centuries, occur in Europe and not China, Safavid Persia or the Ottoman Empire? That is the key question which Diamond's book leaves unanswered, and which, I believe, cannot be answered based on geography and climate alone. Better technological innovation is said to be a product of larger population sizes and densities; thus Eurasia's population is compared with Australia's to in support of that theory. But why did densely populated China fall behind in technological innovation versus the less crowded, less populated countries of Europe from about 1500 on?So, while this is an interesting book, full of valuable tid-bits of information, it fails because the facts offered to support the theories are inconsistent and incomplete and because it ultmately fails to do what its author set out to do -- explain the rise to predominance of one set of cultures or civilizations over all others. Ultimately, it appears more as an opportunity for Prof. Diamond to show off his extensive knowledge than the marshalling of that knowledge in service of a larger argument"},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"Mr. Diamond provides a thorough and enjoyable account of the origins of human society and the factors that determined the locations and natures of these societies.Although at points theoretical (as any work of this scope is destined to always be) I found the evidence presented both entirely compelling and interesting. While there are those who would readily question the author's reliance on geographical factors as the sole influence on the development of human societies, I personally find the theory quite applaudable and impressive.This timely work should play a great part in putting to rest the racist views long held by many who speculated on the factors influencing the development of human societies.Very, very well done. The only reason I have not given the full five stars was I would have liked to see the section on linguistics elaborated on a little more (although it is more likely than not my bias alone, being interested in the topic)."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"In this stunning book Jared Diamond convincingly argues that geographical and environmental factors was the one and only reason for the Europeans to dominate the new worldJared Diamond starts his book at around 11,000 B.C when all human beings were hunter gatherers. Eventually, over few thousand years' human beings in different parts of the world become farmers during different times in the ages of history. However, not all societies adopted farming. In the rest of the 400 pages Diamond convincingly argues that those societies that adopted farming had a considerable head start in food production, - the sole reason those societies marched into the Iron Age, while the rest were left behind.In the back ground of his arguments lie his 30 years of research in New Guinea, a small Island about the size of Texas that lie near Australia and Indonesia. Most of the societies in New Guinea still predominantly consist of hunter gatherers. Decades of research in New Guinea has convinced Diamond that if appropriate geographical and environmental factors prevailed in New Guinea over thousands of years, New Guinean's could have been the masters of the new worldThe four major areas in the world compared by Diamond include Eurasia, Americas, Australia/New Guinea and Africa. The abundant presence of wild plants and animals that can be domesticated contributed to the growth of farming in Eurasia. Farming as opposed to hunting gathering led to sedentary life style that aided population growth at more rapid rates. The population growth in localized areas and the domestication of animals in those areas led to the growth of germs, which helped the farming community to build resistance at an early stage. Also, farming in turn gave birth to large volume trade, writing, invention of wheels and technical innovation, formation of chiefdom, states and religion.In conclusion, the presence of suitable geographical and environmental factors led to the development of Eurasia, while the deprivation of same factors kept the others behind. Along the same lines, Diamond persuades that all the other factors such as human factors, physical factors, cultural factors etc directly or indirectly depend on the sustenance of suitable environmental factors over thousands of years."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"It seems odd that the second largest economy in the world today was largely ignored. Except for the one example of Japan riding themselves of guns after the civil war period, the author never mentions Japan again. The entire book is built on this idea that civilizations are built on the amount of resources with which they were endowed. Part of the Japanese rise to power was fueled on the fact that they were poor in natural resources. Although this is recent history, I would have liked the author to address this issue that runs opposite his theme. This would make it clearer how his model of history would be a better indicator of future behavior than the current model."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"Here's a synopsis of what the other 600+ review of this book say:1) The book is revolutionary, important, compelling. Mr. Diamond really makes you think about why the countries of Europe dominated the contest when continents came into contact rather than the other way around. READ IT.2) His point of view is not the only one that exists. The sweep of his thesis is huge, and other commentators have taken different approaches. For example, Mr. Diamond disclaims any racial or cultural explanations for the broad sweep of history.3) The book could have been shorter. This is a book that you can &quot;gut&quot; fast if you want to. Speed read. Skip paragraphs or whole pages. Mr. Diamond seems to anticipate that students will be assigned chapters of his book, so he repeats himself in order to make each chapter stand alone reasonably well. Each chapter makes new points, but it also restates old ones.

For Diamond, the conquest of the Americas, Africa, and the South Pacific territories, should be traced to historical developments taking place from 11,000 B.C. to 1500 A.D. (p.16). These conquests, which were monopolized by European states, received their impetus from the diffusion of crops, livestock, technology, and writing systems, developed within the pre-modern Fertile Crescent (p.411).Possessing the advantages of 1) a high diversity of plant and animal species, 2) a large climactic variation, 3) a wide range of latitudes, 4) a wealth in big mammals, and 5) a disposition towards an agricultural-sedentary lifestyle, the Fertile Crescent promoted food surpluses and high population densities, which gave rise to crowd diseases, a governmental bureaucracy dependent on an emerging writing system, and a technological advancement predicated on a culmination of previous invention and geographic reception to neighboring expertise and application (p.138-42, 205, 236, 245-46, 256). Diamond persuasively argues that the transmission and reception of technologically-advancing techniques of certain farming and writing systems could not overcome the tropical conditions of sub-Saharan Africa, the hot intervening lowlands of Central America, the inhospitable Saharan desert, and the arid Chihuahuan highlands (p.186-87,238).In my opinion, Jared Diamond does a fantastic job of constituting a groundbreaking and nuanced interpretation of world history. Taking the Braudelian view of history a step further, Diamond brings a scientific methodology to the study of the inter-relation between geography and history. Although Diamond does dismiss the role of individuality in world history, he does not ignore its position. Rather to understand the function of men like Edison and Hitler in shaping certain historical eras, you must first place these individuals within the broad pattern of a historical synthesis (p.420). Finally, Diamond's greatest contribution to a world-historical perspective could be the nail he drives into the coffin of European preeminence and innate superiority. Through lucid reasoning, Diamond explains that the European conquest of the New World, which in his cited example is the Incan Empire of the sixteenth century, should not be interpreted as a result of unique European biology and ideology, but a culmination of an autocatalytic process resulting from technology, agricultural crops, and a writing system transmitted from Eurasia. Through these historical acquisitions, the Spanish conquistadores easily conquered Atahuallapa's regime thanks to a devastating European-imported small pox epidemic that preceded Pizarro's fateful landing, a lack of information concerning the gold-seeking intentions of the united Spanish Crown, and the horse-warfare techniques honed through centuries of Asiatic steppe warfare and now an indispensable asset to these disheveled Iberians (p.76-79). The treachery of Pizarro does not make a difference to Diamond, since even the nineteenth century Maori exhibited the same tendency (p.53). Rather, what matters is the geographical-loaded dice which dealt Pizarro a winning roll."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"I really liked the way this book was set up. It was clearly structured and Diamond carefully addresses each of the questions that are brought up.Diamond draws information several different fields of studies and inventively combines the information in order to address the issue of why some societies quickly developed 'civilization' while others developed more slowly or not at all. This book is easily accessible to people of all levels of education and the arguments Diamond makes seem very practical and down to earth.I greatly enjoyed this book. It was entertaining and interesting, and I think it is a must read for anyone interested in the development of societies."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"Loved this book. Very interesting and beleivable theory.

For the majority of the book he uses New Guineans in his examples, and he, strangely, refers to New Guinea as a mini-continent on a frequent basis, which is strange to me, since it is quite small, and, in both economic and political terms, unimportant on a world-wide basis. His infatuation with the culture and the island, I think, hurts the book.In other places, he makes references to certain facts, I don't recall what they are off-hand, that are not true, most especially having to do with disease etiology and origins. Actually, I do remember one, where he cites influenza as having origins in swine, where it really comes from fowl, and it is amplified and altered by genetic recombination in swine. This also undermines his credibility, and these factors hurt the ability of the author to make persuasive arguments, making it difficult to accept them.I would recommend reading it to people, but only with caution. Like everything else, think about it when you read it, but take more caution than normal, as the author is very intelligent and quite persuasive, but potentially fundamentally flawed.Harkius"},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"This book was originally recommened to me by a colleague - a PhD in environmental toxicology and statistics - who said she was intrigued by Diamond's thesis but found the reading &quot;too heavy going&quot; for her. I'm so glad that I kept with it past the first few chapters, because it's a book that rewards the diligent reader with remarkable and provocative answers to the question: &quot;Why are we modern humans one way and not another?&quot;Remarkable and Provocative. It is remarkable how Diamond wields competence in technical fields as diverse and widely separated one from another as linguistics and agriculture, or sociology and animal husbandry. He draws from what appears (to this layman, anyway) to be a sizable swath of modern academic thought in the fields of history, anthropology, horticulture, genetics, lingusitics, sociology, and archeology to make his points. Even more remarkable, in my opinion, is the extent to which Diamond never swerves in guiding the narrative of the book as if he secretly needed to grind one side or another of some particular dogmatic &quot;axe.&quot; Diamond may be the most refershingly honest and starightforward academician writing today; particularly because he doesn't appear to have much of a covert agenda.Provocative and Remarkable. In the end, what is more provocative even than Diamond's thesis is the underlying simplicity of the concepts themselves: continental geogrpahy is the dominant determinant of long-term societal development; original genetic diveristy (both plants and animals) at the continental level outweighs most human efforts to engineer lasting changes to societies. I had the feeling after reading Diamond's book that, &quot;Yeah, I could have figured that out myself if I'd thought about it a lot.&quot; Of course that's silly; I couldn't have even scratched the surface of the puzzle that Diamond tries to crack. But that's the simple beauty of Diamond's thought: after being lead on an enormoulsy entertaining journey through man's history on virtually every continent, one is left with the sense that: &quot;Hey, things do fit toegether after all and they really do make pretty good sense. It's for good reason that we moderns are where we are today.&quot; Maybe equally provocative is the fact that Diamond resists the urge to climb onto a soapbox (or behind a pulpit) and interpret his conclusions in terms of what modern man should do with them to solve modern problems. Spare me! ... and there you go, Diamond does just that."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"I found Guns, Germs &amp; Steel full of profound insight into human prehistory and history. Diamond's overriding thesis is that accidents of geography are among the chief root causes in why civilizations in different parts of the world achieved varying levels in different factors important for societal survival and competitiveness - factors such as guns, germs and steel. This gets much more involved and convincing than I had thought of on first impression. For instance, one of the first factors enabling greater population growth was the domestication of cereals, which depended on having access to wild cereal plants predisposed for successful domestication and nutritive value. That access in turn depended largely on how great a contiguous area of similar climate was available. In that regard, Eurasia had a vast advantage over sub-Saharan Africa and the Americas. The domestication of cereals is thought to have taken place independently in the Fertile Crescent, with wheat and barley, and in China, with millet on the Yellow River and rice on the Yangtze River. Meanwhile, the Americas were so lacking in a decent cereal that the natives around southern Mexico domesticated corn, which had to change a great deal more than its wild ancestor, and which even then remains nutritively inferior to wheat, with its significant protein content. Meanwhile New Guinea is thought to have developed agriculture on its own as well, and domesticated sugarcane, but simply had no option of a cereal or good plant protein source to cultivate.On it goes, into domesticable animals, developing epidemic germs that evolved from germs affecting the those domesticated animals, and simply having the great contiguous stage of Eurasia in which inventions and ideas could disseminate from a vast pool of experience.Diamond emphasizes the falsehood of the common rationale of racism, that historical differences in hallmarks of civilization are due to differences in inate ability between different ethnic groups. Instead, any redistribution of our ancestors ten thousand years ago among the different parts of the Earth would likely have led to the inhabitants of the same areas developing similarly more sophisticated civilizations and similar competitive advantages, based on geography, rather than on the remarkably little genetic diversity there is between different human populations.He also emphasizes the historical universality, if tragedy, of tilted competitive readiness between interacting societies leading to epidemic, subjugation, and sometimes annihilation of the less competitive group. Far from the sort of view expressed by George Carlin's tirade against blue-eyed invaders, ethnic displacement is not a sin unique to Europeans, but also took place in the invasion of the Chatham Islands by the Maori of New Zealand, by repeated invasions of southeast Asia and the Pacific islands by natives of southern China, of southern China by northern China, of the Congo and Kalahari areas of Africa by Bantu Africans originating from what is now eastern Nigeria and Cameroon, and even of the ancient Middle East by Ethiopians, in the origin of the Semites - both Jews and Arabs included. Tragic aspects of human history are easier to remedy when their reality is better understood.Diamond seems ambivalent on the &quot;progress&quot; of civilization - as he insists on putting in quotation marks. He sets forth convincingly how large-scale societal structure is an absolutely inevitable consequence of high population density, and frequently characterizes it as the rise of a parasite class of leaders, bureaucrats, and priests who leach off the productive capacity of the food producers and make large-scale war possible. On the other hand, he characterizes - again, convincingly - stone age cultures, including the few remaining today and the ones that included all of humanity in prehistory, as being dominated by violence between and within the tribe, claiming that the two most prevalent causes of death in pre-civilized cultures are tribal warfare and homicide. With that perspective, he indicates organized society's greatest strength as its ability to deter war and violence through military strength and effective law enforcement and administration of justice.Diamond's quest is to make history a true historical science, on par with geology and astronomy. Unfortunately, he detracts from his proclamation of this agenda in the last chapter by launching an ill-informed denigration of the physical sciences as uninterested in purpose and function or in root causes, which was enough to break the appearance of omniscience created by his earlier mastery of so many disparate fields - he is apparently an active researcher in both physiology and evolutionary biology - and indicate that there are after all some scholarly fields about which he is ignorant. He also admits that his emphasis on geography as the prime driver of human civilizations has no power to explain some historical quirks, such as the historical voluntary abandonment by entire societies of fantastic competitive advantages, including the abandonment of pottery by the Polynesians, of guns by the Japanese, and of ocean-circumnavigating fleets by the Chinese. But despite these shortcomings, this book could represent another example of Edward O. Wilson's Consilience in making dramatic new progress in a field by synthesizing learning from disparate fields together. I tend to see the hand of Wilson everywhere, but the connection is too appropriate not to point out. For that is the program that Diamond follows, drawing on advances in archaeology, linguistics, and especially genetics, subjected to new applications of analysis and logic, in synthesizing a study of history based on analytical patterns of causation. This study provides wonderful dividends of insight into the grand sweep of human affairs.Finally of course, I have to pose the question: if the ultimate success or failure of any human society throughout history is consistently decided on the geographical resources available to it, more than any other factor: what does that have to say about the first-ever opportunity of our own civilization to colonize other worlds away from Earth?"},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"Guns, Germs, and Steel is a wonderful book.

I especially like how Diamond turns conventional explanations around to demonstrate the fallacy of that explanations as well as wondering why history did not go in a different directions. Upon reading many of the negative reviews of this book I wonder how many of them read the whole thing (or even most of it). Most criticism they bring up are addressed in the book."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"If I made a online purchase my concern would be the shipping.I have some worst exp with shipping but this surprised me.It came to me like shipped from next door and the book was in perfect condition."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"When Guns, Germs and Steel was released several years ago I dismissed it as a pop history book.

In their conversation, Yali asked Diamond why it was that Europeans had become so developed, when his people had not.

I bought this book for a friend."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"I am recommending this book; however, I found it quite the chore to get through.The premise of the book is a 400-page walk through human history to try to determine factors that led to some cultures dominating others, rather than the reverse, for example, the Europeans decimating the Native Americans rather than Native Americans traveling to Europe and dominating those people. The proximate causes are easy to see, but the ultimate causes are the subject of this book.The author looks at many factors in all parts of the world: food production (why it was developed in some places and not in others), aggregation of populations, centralization of governments, development of technology, and so forth. His basic thesis is that development in the cultures of the world was subject to the various climatic, geographical, and ecological properties of the places they lived. He expands on this thesis and provides many compelling examples.And then he beats all his points to death, using many examples over and over and over and over again. He repeats statements he made earlier, not as a review, but as though he were writing them for the first time. He condescends to us readers (for example, feeling like he has to tell us that honeybees give honey and silkworms silk). And he has made some sloppy errors (having carbon-14 decay to nitrogen-14 and carbon-12 in the same paragraph; mixing up aardwolves and aardvarks). His writing style is often clunky and stilted.Nonetheless, I fought my way through the book to the end. And despite the obstacles thrown in my path to Page 420-something, I found the experience very interesting. Because the events he talks about happened in the distant past, it's hard to know whether he's right or not, but he does make a compelling argument for these physical factors making the difference in the development of different cultures.So if you decide to read this book, skim when you get bored, but try to read it to the end."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"Where I'd have to disagree with Mr. Meiner above is that Diamond isn't actually referring so much to the suitability of an area for agriculture; what's he's referring to is the suitability of crops and animals for domestication to agriculture, a matter of genetic diversity, really. Instead of approaching anthropology as an anthropologist, he approaches it as an evolutionary behaviorist. What's around you? How would it influence what actions are available to you?Diamond attempts in this book to draw a correlation between the plants available to natural population of humans and the likelihood of that population developing an agricultural civilization. Observing the plant life either natively available to a region or available by east-west transfer (as those plants would be mostly likely to succeed in the transplanted area), Diamond assessed the energy profit in calories of farming those plants versus hunting and gathering and then tried to link that to which strategy succeeded in that area.He also assays the animals that were available for domestication and tries to assay them not only as food but as trainable tools. By assessing the inherent 'domesticability' of the animals around a culture, he again tries to relate that to their likelihood of developing some sort of ranching or animal husbandry versus relying on wild animals as prey.Unlike most Homo sapiens, biologists aren't so used to separating humans categorically from the rest of the residents of the earth and are used to thinking of organismal behavior in terms of caloric profit - what maximizes my available energy and nutrients? How do I go about it? So, while this might seem like an off-the-wall nutjob approach to a problem to a historian, say, to a biologist it reads like a tried-and-true method.The only assumption he makes that I would maybe question is the notion that all higher civilization then ensues from the development of an agricultural society. Being a scientist from an industrial society myself, I am inclined to agree that technology is a good rough indicator of the \\"height\\" of a civilization. My friend the poet or the philosopher might be less inclined to agree. That's a question of criteria, though, not a critique of the whole approach.As far as his standard goes, I think he makes a pretty good case. He draws on several direct examples and cases as well, largely from the southern Pacific and Australian regions, to illustrate his point. Is it perfect? No. But it's hard to be perfect when you're the only one doing something. I think that even if you don't think you're going to agree with this book, it's worth reading, if only because of its freshness."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"It's been a long time since I've read a history with such explanatory power and such well-written prose. Diamond undertakes to survey all of human history from the last ice age on down, and chart the rise of civilizations--and specifically, to explain why cities and complex societies arose in some areas more quickly than others, and why in still other areas they never arose at all. His thesis is that ultimately a combination of environmental factors in particular areas nudged the inhabitants of those areas in the direction of intensive food production, which led to increased populations, complex societies, better technology, and in the end the displacement and even eradication of peoples and societies who were less fortunate.Diamond does not restrict his focus to a particular region, civilization, or people. Rather, his text is replete with examples and case studies from around the world. We learn why horses were domesticated but zebras were not; we learn why agriculture arose first in southwest Asia, only later in Mexico and the Andes, and not at all in ancient Australia and California even though the latter two areas contain regions which seem perfectly suitable for it. Best of all, though Diamond is greatly interested in explaining the causes of the European expansion in recent centuries, he time and again illustrates his thesis with examples from -other- encounters between peoples of different environmental and technological backgrounds. The breadth of his examples, and the common sense appeal of his arguments, lends great credibility to his thesis.My own degree is in history, and I have worked professionally as a designer of computer games intended to tell the story of human history. So I've read quite a few books on this sort of subject and this is by far the best written and has one of the most interesting (and useful) theses. I recommend the book without hesitation for both casual and serious students of history."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"When I bought this book, I was looking for a popular science book that would explain a new subject, and maybe broaden my mind a bit. As such, Guns Germs and Steel is a great success.Firstly, it's a fascinating subject. I mean, the question he's answering is how come Europeans ended up colonising the world, and not the other way round? Secondly, it's well researched. To answer the question, he compares the histories of human development on all the different continents over the last 13,000 years. By the end of it, you end up knowing a bit about the history of every continent. (eg, did you know that people on the island of Madagascar, off the coast of Africa, are actually the descendants of Polynesians?)But the main reason it's so good is the way he structured the book. I've always thought that the best part of following a sports team is the pre-season, when you sit around comparing the strengths &amp; weaknesses of the various teams in the comp and having endless debates about who's going to win. Guns Germs and Steel is a bit like a form guide for the sport called &quot;human development&quot;. It starts by looking at the state of human development in each continent 13,000 years ago (in the &quot;pre-season&quot;) so that you might make predictions about which continent should have ended up dominating the world. And then it traces human history in each continent to show why Europe ended up winning, which continents came close, and which were the non-contenders, and why.Along the way, you learn a little history about every continent. You're also challenged by brilliant questions like how come horses were domesticated but zebras weren't? Or why weren't acorns ever domesticated as a food source when some acorns can be edible? Or how come when Europeans met Americans for the first time, European germs killed many Americans, but American germs didn't affect Europeans?The general writing style the author uses is that he poses a question, then spends time answering it. But this leads to another question, which when answered leads to another question... and so on. It ends up that you can't put the book down, because at any given time, you've only just heard the question and haven't heard the answer yet! And if you did just hear the answer, you've got another question! I found that this really drew me into the whole subject. By the end of it, I wanted to study some more anthropology!I was surprised that some other reviewers didn't rate this book highly. But many base their bad reviews on the fact that Diamond debunks the &quot;White Race Is Superior&quot; theory, which they subscribe to. But that shouldn't detract from the fact that this is a well-researched, well-written, deeply interesting book about a deeply interesting subject."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"Christopher Smith is incorrect in his description of Diamond's work. First, Diamond does NOT reject the influence of culture and human decisions on the fates of societies. This is discussed at length in the Epilogue.Second, and worse, is that clearly Smith either did not read the book carefully, or perhaps is overlaying his own preconceived notions on Diamond's theses. To wit, the example quoted regarding Sowell's work misses Diamond's point completely: trying to determine ultimate causes, not proximate ones. Why did the Europeans have interesting technology and ideas to exchange with each other in the first place? Simply put, you need an agrarian society with sufficient food surplus to promote specialization. Without that the mere presence of rivers is not magically going to result in technological innovation - and there are enough river systems in the Americas, for example, to counter such a hypothesis.Diamond's thesis might seem simplistic to some - to this reader, a scientist by persuasion, on the contrary it is a relief to finally see Occam's Razor being wielded with such precision on a topic much muddied by the social \\"scientists\\". The objections raised regarding \\"other factors\\" sound similar to those always raised whenever a clean, self-contained and coherent scientific theory has been presented - and not surprisingly it is usually the non-scientists who tend to disagree with such theories, pecking away at them with irrelevant \\"counter-examples\\". (Witness the whole evolution \\"controversy\\".)What is perhaps most surprising about the negative reviews is the claim that Diamond's book is discounting the achievements of European civilisations - this misses the whole raison d'etre for the book: Why did European societies become and achieve what they did? What was the ULTIMATE cause since at one point in time clearly no particular group had much of an intrinsic advantage over the other? One explanation of course is genetics which seems to becoming more and more laughable as most of the West's universities, research institutes, and tech companies are being more and more manned by non-whites. (Maybe all the Chinese, Indians and other groups mutated in the last 30 years?)My suggestion to readers reading these reviews is simple: keep asking WHY? For each of the putative refutations of Diamond's book, the question \\"but why?\\" can be rather illuminating. That is precisely what this book does."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"Why was the Spaniard Pizarro with his ragtag band of 168 soldiers able to brazenly attack and capture the Inca Emperor Atahuallpa in the midst of 80,000 of his soldiers? Why, instead, didn't Atahuallpa show up in Spain and go on to sack Madrid and invade Italy? For that matter, why didn't Aborigines from Australia invade China and go sweeping west towards Europe instead of the Mongols? Why do modern societies today communicate using satellites while hunter/gatherers like the Bushmen of the Kalahari continue to use Stone Age tools? This book attempts to answer such questions without resorting to what Jared Diamond refers to as racist arguments.Geography, unequal distributions of flora and fauna, and the advantages gained through early food production, population density, and dissemination of ideas and germs gave some cultures huge advantages over others. This, as opposed to differences in racial characteristics, resulted in some societies thriving and conquering while others got conquered or failed altogether. Diamond argues that Eurasia, with its east/west axis and size, gave its inhabitants a distinct advantage over those dwelling in Africa and North and South America, with their north/south axes meaning that peoples, innovations, useful crops and domesticated animals would have to travel not only across significant physical barriers such as desert, jungle and mountains, but also have to traverse different climates. Therefore Eurasian societies benefited significantly more from cross-pollination of ideas and innovations than did societies of other continents. Parts of Asia, especially the Fertile Crescent and China were also blessed with more than their share of wild plants suitable for domestication -wheat, barley, peas, and lentils in the Fertile Crescent and rice, millet, soybeans and mung beans in China. In contrast Mesoamerica had only corn -inferior in nutritional value to the Eurasian crops. Likewise, Eurasia had the luck to have domesticable animal species like the cow, pig, chicken, goat. In contrast Mesoamerica had only the turkey. The Andes had the llama and the guinea pig. Africa with numerous large mammals (elephants, rhinoceros, zebra, antelope, giraffe) would seem to have had enormous opportunity to benefit by raising these animals for food and harnessing them for power. Diamond shows that these animals and others on other continents failed to be domesticated not because of any short-comings of the human inhabitants, but because these animals failed to satisfy one of the five requirements of a domesticable animal -diet, growth rate (an elephant takes 15 years to reach adult size, as opposed to about a year for a cow), problems of captive breeding (some animals, like cheetahs, just don't feel comfortable mating in a pen or cage), nasty disposition (grizzly bear ranching has never taken off for obvious reasons), tendency to panic (gazelles tend to jump 30 feet when startled), and social structure (some animals herd much better than others -remember the cat herding commercial of a few years ago? We all know what the reality would be. ) Here is what the author has to say about Zebras - 'Zebras have the unpleasant habit of biting a person and not letting go. They thereby injure more American zookeepers each year than do tigers! Zebras are also virtually impossible to lasso with a rope, even for cowboys who win rodeo championships by lassoing horses, because of their unfailing ability to watch the rope noose come towards them and then duck their heads out of the way.'Areas with the climate and the plants and animals suitable for domestication inevitably gave rise to increased populations and towns, with attendant technology advances and the development of diseases, both of which were then passed on to adjacent areas. In Eurasia this happened more easily than in Africa and the Americas, areas which were deficient in useful plants and animals to start with, leading to lower populations and fewer cities. Disease was a huge factor in the conquering of the America's indigenous peoples by Europeans. Diseases introduced by Europeans eventually killed 95 per cent of the pre-Columbian Native American population. The Europeans, of course, largely had immunity to their own diseases and just didn't encounter anything nearly as virulent coming from the other side.This book is well written, easy to read, and stuffed with amazing facts that are a delight to encounter on their own, in addition to strengthening the author's thesis:-Native Australians kept captive dingoes as company, watchdogs, and even as living blankets, giving rise to the expression 'five dog night' to mean a very cold night.-Of the world's 148 big wild herbivore mammals, only 14 could be domesticated, the majority in Eurasia.-The major killer diseases of humanity -smallpox, influenza, tuberculosis, malaria, plague, measles, cholera -all evolved from diseases of animals.-kuru (laughing sickness) was transmitted by New Guinea highland babies licking their fingers after playing with the raw brains that their mothers had just cut out of murdered enemies that happened to have kuru.-When the Canadian Pacific railroad was being built through Saskatchewan in the 1880's, that province's Native Americans, who had previously had little exposure to whites and their germs, died of tuberculosis at the incredible rate of 9 per cent per year.-When syphilis was first recorded in Europe (1495) it was much more virulent, causing pustules that covered the body from head to the knees, causing flesh to fall off people's faces, and causing death within a few months. By 1546 syphilis had evolved into the disease with the symptoms so well known to us today. The disease had adapted, so that by keeping its victims alive longer, it could spread its spirochete offspring into more victims."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"According to Diamond, four factors are responsible for the historical trajectories of peoples and cultures: 1) availability of developed crops and domesticable animals; 2) the orientation of continental axis to facilitate the spread of agriculture and available knowledge transfers; 3) transfer of knowledge on continents and between continents, and; (as a consquence of 1,2 and 3) 4) population size which induce disease immunity upon the larger and more successful populations.On the surface this seems like both a seductively simple and old-fashioned deterministic explanation for differences between cultures. But I was pleasantly surprised that Diamond ploughs new ground in his thesis and puts it together in a succinct and cogent package for the reader. My initial prejudice was that Diamond would engage in some kind of right-wing truth politics (the tendancy to draw mathematical-like conclusions to support unpopular ideas with the flimsiest evidence) or else engage in some kind of nobel savage fallacy so often associated with those of the weak-minded left.In fact Diamond almost wholly rescues the American intellectual tradition, but writing in a common sense fashion in cogent and topical ways keeping his politics on a short leash and sticking wholly to the facts where he knows them, indicating what he does not know and extemporising only from clearly logical suppositions supported by the archeological, sociological, anthropological and physical data.He has a great way of posing in simple prose big questions: Why did the Spanish conquer the Incas? Why was it not the case that the Incas develop a culture that could have colonised Europe. It is really owing to the success Europe had -- in geographical advantage -- of the above four factors.There was never anything in terms of culture or race that neither obviated the succcess of Aboriginals in Australia or North America, nor influence white and Asiatic cultures to be more \\"superior.\\" It was the luck of the geographic draw.Diamond backs up his thesis with good and wide-ranging research. He spins a good yarn from time to time and just when you are getting a little tired of animal domestication he switches to the development of written languages. He has a way of making one appreciate momentous events that all of us take for granted. For example the development of written language is a something well studied, but there are few who mention that the development has only taken place in less than a small number or societies: the vast amount of written languages merely leveraged off of these previous developments to piggy-back their own written language. As such there are less than ten societies the developed written languages with no previous exposure to written text. That such developments were easier to travel along the Euro-Asiatic, East-West Axis is a simple, yet far reaching in its implications -- the development of the European and Asiatic cultures that eventually dominated the world.I would not agree with the review who stated that Diamond needs a better editor. He is concise and covers a lot of ground. Although I was trying very hard to find fault with this book, I found very little. That is not to say that all of this true -- none of it may be true -- but the way he marshalls his thoughts and pleasing presentation in an almost non-polemical way has made me a fan.There is only one part in the very beginning where Diamond asserts that because Papaun New Guinean tribes must live in adverse circumstances they must be under inherently more selective forces to breed smarter people in evolutionary terms than people living our western cities nowadays. As a scholar or natural selection he must know that the dweller in the cities is also equally suited for their environment as well -- and that is the entire story of natural selection -- adaptation to the environment through natural selection, and that effects people in the city equally as well as those who live in the jungle.A good read."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"Jared Diamond has catapulted himself to the status of America's most well-known contemporary popular scientist, and this was the book that is responsible for it. Much has been written and discussed on Diamond's theory/thesis in Guns, Germs, and Steel so I will only briefly recap.According to Diamond, the nature of global wealth and poverty, inequality, and conquest came about as both direct and indirect result of the geography upon which societies rested. Certain areas of the world, such as the Fertile Crescent and most of Europe, eastern China, and Central America, simply have greater value for crop cultivation than other parts of the world, such as Australia and Siberia. Following the domestication of certain crops in various parts of the world (such as rice in Asia, wheat and barley in the Middle East, and corn and squash in the Americas), humans began domesticating animals - as animals proved extremely useful by providing humans with additional sources of food (meat and milk) as well as useful products such as leather or wool, and (most important of all) a vital source of labor. Beasts of burden such as horses and oxen were used to till the land and as a means of transportation. Animal excrement yielded greater crops by serving as fertilizer.The domino effect continues...More food led to a growing population. A growing population led to establishment of larger and larger towns, and eventually cities. Such a massive amount of people living in close proximity to one another and animals led to epidemic disease outbreaks (a la chicken pox, measels, mumps, and the bubonic plague) - although humans gradually built up a resistance to these diseases through the biological principle of natural selection. Larger populations of people led to increased social chaos, hence a need for social control - which brings about the rise of formal governments to keep tabs on the population and to raise armies to protect the society from both internal and external threats. Also, because agriculture became quite intensive, only a portion of the population was now needed as farmers; freed from the burden of growing and harvesting crops, the rest of the people had ample time to explore other avenues and accumulate growing amounts of information about the world (leading to development of science). Science then takes off, enhancing virtually all aspects of human life (military weapons and technology, navigation, calendar, environmental knowledge, etc.) At this time, societies have become full-fledged states, which faced no significant resistance or challenge from the hunting-gathering and chiefdom societies that lacked damn near everthing I have pointed out in this paragraph.Thus, Diamond accounts for the social/historical/geographical differences that have distinguished the world's haves (Western Europe, China, ancient Egypt, the Azetcs) from the have-nots. Amazingly, Diamond has encountered emotional backlash from both conservatives and liberals for this thesis. Conservatives bemoan the fact that Diamond does not take \\"culture\\" into account (essentially arguing that it was the \\"cultural superiority\\" of Western Europeans that enabled them to conquer the world, not geography). Funny thing is, the last time I checked, food production and cultivation ARE, INDEED, aspects and dimensions of culture. (Right wingers are incorrect to claim that Diamond does not attribute culture enough credit; what they really mean to say is that Diamond doesn't credit certain ASPECTS of culture, like religion or government). Liberals, on the other hand, have blasted Diamond as a simple Eco-determinist who pays no attention to human agency and innovation (at times issuing arguments that parallel those of conservatives).Many have questioned or dimissed Diamond's idea as simplistic, but I think his central thesis is important and has many more strengths than weaknesses. Critics point out that some of the world's most fertile and productive land today failed to produce great and powerful civilizations in the past (the most often-cited example of this is the Plains Indians of the midwest and the Indians of present-day California). However, this criticism reveals that the readers did not pay attention to detail in what Diamond is arguing.Diamond NEVER stated that land is SOLELY responsible for the rise and fall of civilizations. He points out that land is a starting point, but is never an end point (an important designation that the Diamond haters fail to acknowledge). Equally important is the availability of domesticated animals, particularly beasts of burden, and the contributions they give to society. The Plains Indians and the California Indians, for example, had no domesticated beasts of burden to facilitate the intensification of agriculture. The horse was not introduced until European arrival.This is definitely a must-read book. Take a look at it and judge for yourself. Guns, Germs, and Steel is one of the most important and influential books written in the past decade."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"Diamond's book is both an ambitious look at 5 million years of human history (in only about 430 pages)(plus copious notes), and an extended and elegant plea for history to come into consideration as a science and not merely a &quot;humanities&quot; area of study. Not being an historian or an anthropologist, I came to this book a complete layman, and I must say I learned a lot. Diamond has a clear style that makes even some of his more far-reaching theories accessible. I was frustrated by the way he &quot;glossed over&quot; opposing theories, but it makes complete sense as (a) if he didn't, his book would be MUCH longer, and (b) that's what all the bibliographies and notes in the back are for. There are plenty of paths left for the curious mind to follow other avenues of research. Diamond's basic premise is that Western European societies eventually came to colonize and establish dominant cultures across a vast swath of the planet due to geographic and agricultural factors, not due to any inherent superiority of Europeans. It is one of those hypothoses that most people will listen to and say, &quot;Well, DUH.&quot; It makes sense - but how well can we explain WHY it makes sense? This book does that. It is a good study in how to apply critical thinking even to things that seem self-explanatory. He does tend to repeat himself a lot, but boy howdy does it get those ideas stuck in your head. He makes a point, demonstrates why it is so, makes it again. It's a good, solid book and a fascinating perspective on the whole of human history. I recommend it."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"I started this book interested in the scientific foundation of the development of human societies. Jared Diamond does an excellent job of distilling the vast complexity of development into a few manageable trends. He uses a compelling mix of data from around the world to illustrate that these major themes are responsible for much of the variety we see today.In contrast to the statements by some reviewers, he does not arbitrarily ignore the role of other individual factors; instead, he suggests that these factors represent small variations in the larger trends. It is possible for an individual to accelerate or slow the development of technology (or any other major trend), but an individual alone cannot reverse the overall trend of technological development.In a more specific example that has occasionally been attacked, Diamond suggests (I believe correctly) that the unification of China, by limiting the potential for competition among individual states, was the aggregate trend responsible for slowing China's technical progress. The fact that a single Chinese Emperor disallowed a particular technology did not make that individual the critical factor; other kings tried to do the same thing in a fragmented Europe and failed. Instead, the failure of an edict by the European King to slow technological progress was due to the fragmented and competing nations in Europe, not the particular virtues (or lack thereof) of the individual. In this sense, individuals may be the proximate cause of many events, but it is the macro-circumstances which are largely responsible for their success and the fact that their actions have been recorded in the annals of history.While the science was interesting and compelling, I found the history of the migration and displacement of human populations the real eye-opener. Our modern history records, with much moral fervor, the subjugation of Native American, South African, and Australian populations by European conquerors. This book reminds us that these are only the most recent chapters in a human history full of such displacements. South Chinese into the islands of the south pacific, North Chinese into south China, Black Western Africans into the southern half of Africa, and only more recently the better known European conquests. More amazingly, the book does not make a moral judgment on any of these events; instead, it unemotionally tells the story of human history. Indeed it even helps us understand why the Europeans were so successful in the regions where they are now the dominant population and so unsuccessful in other regions.This book is not light reading, but I believe it successfully rises above modern racism and politically correct debate to address the major trends which have shaped the human populations of our planet. Do not read this book for solutions, it has none. Read the book so that you will understand the problems which you wish to understand or solve."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"Guns Germs and Steel deserves a place of honor in any History wonks bookshelf next to the \\"Discoverers.\\" Diamonds arguments on why the west rose to power in the 1500s through 2000 meshes almost perfectly with William McNeil's Pursuit of Power."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"This book was recommended by a friend when I recommended Emergence: The Connected Lives of Ants, Brains, Cities, and Software. I can see why he suggested this book- it was very interesting and did present a historical, sociological and economic perspective to emergence. Meg Wheatley would be proud. Diamond does a great job of walking through the complex set of variables- including guns, germs, and steel- that led to larger masses of people to emerge and proposes a number of possible reasons why the Native Americans and other civilizations ended up in tiny reservations, rather than the Eurasians. The book covers a fascinating topic and provides a great review of history and asks some great questions. I think Diamond does a great job of making the connections between the elements presented in the book and making it real and relevant for his audience- and it does it in an engaging way.

The author, Diamond, is obviously very knowledgeable in his field of study, but it seems that he has attempted to simply write something that hasn't quite been said before. The result is the opposite of what so many have said regarding European supremacy throughout history, mostly recent history.Without going any further, I will just allude to Mr. Christopher A. Smith's review. I don't think it could be said any better. I am a white American, and I'm not sure I would be able to critique the work as effectively as Mr. Smith, since he notes his race and the fact that he still has a problem with Diamond's approach. Mr. Diamond's approach is indeed biased. I'm not faulting the author; I'm sure it would be next to impossible to tackle this subject matter without leaning one way or the other. At any rate, well said, Mr. Smith."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"The critiques of Guns, Germs, and Steel show it is a very controversial book: many reviews, very long, very incisive.The main idea of the book that history on the largest scale is determined by geography and biology I have never seen presented so thoroughly. Diamond analyzes suites of plant and animal species available for domestication, and shows how the combinations gave some cultures inestimable advantages over those less endowed, which allowed them to abandon the wandering life-style of the hunter-gatherer, and use the food surplus to support indirect contributors who could build social and political structures, warfare organizations, alphabets, and technologies. A tremendous headstart over others.He also shows how the orientation of the continents (Eurasia east-west, across a narrow batch of climates, the Americas and Africa north-south across a wide batch of climates) made it easy for agricultural discoveries to pass between Asia and Europe, but almost impossible for them to be disseminated on the other continents. And of course, it was agricultural advances that made all the others possible. Fascinating idea.But so many faults.Diamond combines Europe and Asia into \\"Eurasia\\", which may be acceptable as geography but not as history. The fact is that the Fertile Crescent (source of European culture) and China (Asian culture) are two very separate fonts of civilization, that led in very different directions, and combining them is unrealistic.Several times he says the last Ice Age ended 13000 years ago. Now an Ice Age takes 100,000 years to build up, as icecaps advance south, and about 50,000 to melt back, and they are still melting. I don't think any geologist can say to within a millennium or so when the last ended or next will start, but it is clearly simplistic to insist on 13,000 years ago as the cusp between two Ice Ages. If it were, the Earth would have been detectably cooling over historical time, not warming.The \\"Germs\\" part of GG&S; is another oversimplification. If the settled peoples of the world gave the others animal-derived diseases like smallpox and influenza, the hunter-gatherers gave back anthrax, plague, and siphylis. The fact is that microbe transmission took a tremendous leap, in both directions, after the discovery of navigation, and all peoples were equally affected; but the civilized peoples were in a better position to study and confine disease. Diamond's text leaves the impression that Europeans deliberately used disease as a weapon, which he doesn't document.Then there is the circular reasoning about domestication of animal and plant species. Certainly, the peoples of the crescent had a fortunate suite of plants and animals available to them, and this gave them a headstart (not a new idea), but other peoples had other groups available. But (Diamond says) the other groups were \\"undomesticable\\". Why undomesticable? Well, obviously, because they weren't domesticated! Diamond blames the plants and animals as \\"undomesticable\\", instead of blaming the people who failed to domesticate them. A case in point (which Diamond claims to address but never does) is the bison: the European bison (\\"wizent\\") was domesticated to give our cattle, but North Americans never domesticated the American version.But the worst of GG&S; is the bias. Apparently all historians and anthropologists are racist - except, of course, Diamond. In the nineteenth century, some European thinkers concluded that other races were intellectually inferior to Caucasians, but no one has thought that in the twentieth, which is when almost all of modern anthropology was worked out. Diamond's racist historians never existed - they are straw men, invented only to be maligned. I was particularly affronted by his view that examiners of intelligence tests, following WW II, \\"tried to show\\" that US blacks were less intelligent than whites. With thousands of test results pouring in over decades, they naturally analyzed them for whatever stats they could get. The tiny, but statistically-significant, difference between blacks and whites was discovered, but quickly attributed to flaws in the test structure, differences in education opportunities, and problems with administering the tests. It is obvious that racial differences in intelligence (if any) are infinitesimal in comparison with the range of differences within any one race. And now, so many people of all backgrounds have been thrown together into the modern work pool that it is quite obvious that anyone can do anything. There are winners and losers, still, of course, but not because of race. Everyone has known this for half a century, but Diamond tries to make it racist, to make something offensive out of it.If Diamond had ignored his predjudices and focussed on his technical material, GG&S; would be a better book."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"Great book!

But if Mr. Diamond didn't feel he had to create a mythical monster racist race then his book wouldn't even have a reason to exist. He creates both the monster and the dreaded answer to the monster - neither of which even exist except for purposes of his own secret agenda, which is the clear favoratism he shows towards non-white races.This book is a complete work of fiction by a sick and perverted mind and has no relationship to actuality. Isn't the veiled accusations he makes in regards to the opinions of one certain race, the exact definition of racism? No, if you want to see the opinions of racism, you need look no further than this book.He is correct that intelligence had nothing to do with the rise of the west - the best minds on earth fleeing savagery and ignorance to come live in the west is what had to do with it, not his childlike idiocy in regards to animal and plant life and trade routes.

I was never so insulted in my life."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"OK Diamond has thought out his innovative theory and produced a rather serious book. But it is very clear to me that he completely fails in explaning &quot;the fate of human societies&quot;. Many previous reviewers have already mentionned many important factors (culture, religion, etc.) he did not (or hardly) bother to consider, so I do not need to rehash this. I will however mention a very important factor that has not been so much mentionned in other reviews: the genetic, racial factor. For this I refer to Levin's book Why Race Matters (and alternatively to Duke's My Awakening. Duke is less scientific, but is book is cheaper and easier.)Another aspect of the book, and the most disturbing for me, is that he chides the West and praises the alleged superiority of the aboriginal people (which Darwin used to call a &quot;savage race.&quot;) But I will simply expose the falsity of his beliefs on this issue by pointing at Diamond's own life and at the migration flows. If the aboriginal civilization is superior, why didn't Diamond stay with them, why did he move back to the West? Because the West is far more superior. How is it that no westerners wants to emigrate to underdevelopped countries, but that the contrary is true? I think it clear that Diamond is wrong, but if he was right I know a nice job for him: let him work for the anti-immigration administration, and convince all those who came from the third world to go back to their countries, and let him preach to the people in the third world that they are better off than we are, and should not try to emigrate. But I doubt he would have much success."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"The premise of \\"Guns, Germs, and Steel\\" is flawed, as anyone truly familiar with world history will immediately recognize.

It is provocative and perhaps controversial to some. What I find missing in the book is any consideration of the role of gender in society and of religion apart from its role in nation building in more &quot;civilized&quot; societies.To give just two examples, many anthropologists and archeologists think that early Neolithic Cretan culture was in some respects matrifocal; it was &quot;advanced&quot; in terms of architecture and art but not warlike. Some scientists believe that there were a number of such cultures, yet how matrifocality and nonaggression may have played a role in Eurasian history is not touched upon here.Similarly, the author goes to great pains to show how Aboriginal Australians were prevented by environmental factors from developing agriculture. Yet he does not even mention their often breathtaking telepathic and locational abilities, unsurpassed anywhere else in the world, nor does he touch upon their highly original art or their eco-friendly religion.In sum, the book tries not to privilege Eurasian societies but it cannot help privileging normative eurasian culture."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"Diamond writes from the perspective of the victor. This compromises the integrity and content. Obvious clues stare him in the face, but he refuses to see them. He admits hunter-gatherer worked less hard to survive than the farming counterparts. He admits humans are included in the category &quot;animal&quot;. But the explanation as to the slow acceptance of farming and civilization are still attributed to a flaw, or problem within the people themselves. The idea these people chose to remain hunter-gatherer over farmer is outside his realm of possibility. This is why he claims there are still many questions unanswered.

The cause and effect statements as put forth in this fiction novel are dangerous, unscientific, and completely uninteresting to anyone remotely logical.

To hear him tell it -- endlessly, I might add -- Western Civilization owes it ascent and dominance purely through nature's circumstance. He discounts religion and culture as drivers in the development of nations. A ridiculous notion, indeed!For example, the Black Plague nearly wiped out Western Europe, but the Europeans rose from this period to begin the Renaissance era: a period of unequalled creativity and increased liberties for the average citizen, leading to the end of serfdom.

I was pretty disappointed. The first thing the author does is go overboard to establish is liberal and open minded bona fides, doing this by assuring the reading audience hes going to base his finding on reasoned and balanced treatment; devoid of racial bias or supposition. He then sets up classic straw man arguments promising his theories are more advanced then those numerous evolutionary psychologists and evil anthropologists that dare to foolishly use race as a criteria for judging human societal development. Diamond, then guiltily, bemoaning these ills and the numerous bogeyman that fill academia (preaching racial differences as if anyone looking to retain their career or University job would dear, i.e \\"The Bell Curve\\").After all this and more pretense Diamond then goes on to say he finds primitive tribesman more intelligent on average then whites. Its hard at this point to determine which is more ridiculous: that the author just spent 20 pages bemoaning the insufferable inference that some racist fools may make against racial intelligence difference and its relation to societal development and then the author hypocritically doing exactly that himself. Or Diamonds specious and vapid analysis of why the primitive island natives are smarter then western whites. Appearantly inteligence counts for nothing in evolutionary biology in developed western societes compared to primitive ones, and putatively it takes more brain power to survive dieases in a primitive culture then a developed one. O'Really? I wouldnt be adversie to his premise if it wasnt based on the most feeble of analysis. He also throws out the old lib standard country natural resource argument which I thought was beyond mentioning since they have been so thoroughly discredited.All this nonsense occured within the first 30 pages which proved two things for me:1. The author is a huge liberal with the typical white guilty conscious and any analysis will be the poisoned pathological fruit of his inner guilt.2. Diamonds analysis skills are suspect even if you accepted his premise.Given these two points the statistical chance of this book being worth finishing when I had a full list of more thoughtful and well reasoned reads was greatly diminished.

Making no effort to lure the casual or lay reader to the history and anthropology within, this scholarly work is inaccessible to anyone not already intimately interested in the subject matter. Where it is not inaccessible, it suffers an even worse fate, it is uninterestingly told.The author compounds these problems by restating his points once they have been firmly made. For example, he builds the case that the domestication of large animals was responsible to a large degree for the propagation of disease (the \\"germs\\" of the title). He then makes a connection to the devastating effect these diseases had on unsuspecting Native Americans, who by the way, had not domesticated animals, and therefore had not developed any diseases of their own. Okay so far, but he retells these causal points every way imaginable, and misses no opportunity to do so.

This 1997 book won several awards, most notably the Pulitzer in 1998. I was given this book by a grad student acquaintance in the Boston area, read it a half a dozen years ago. At the time, I was also studying the book of Daniel reading about how the world's first empires came to be so by conquest, in Daniel's case, conquering the tribes of Israel and deporting some of the vanquished to Babylon. This secular book added another dimension to my understanding of world history's dynamics in addition to a spiritual/prophetic one. I loved this book because it helped explain a lot of things, made me think.I've always loved anthropology and this book builds on one of its tenets that societies' key to becoming complex ones was the development of agriculture. With a permanent food supply, population numbers increased, societies increasingly diversified their occupations one of which was waging war. In societies like Papua New Guinea, a small island near Australia, where Yali was a tribal chieftain, most of the inhabitants subsisted as hunter-gatherers not advancing to the next stage of developing agriculture. So knowing that already, I was given a grander view of the advancement of societies by reading this book. Although it's been years since I've read it, I still have the book, and learned many new things from Diamond's creative thinking. As to where he got all of his intellectual cargo, he was born in Boston, probably the most book-buying state of the Union, to a physician father, linguistics teacher mother, and went to school at Harvard and Cambridge.

Unfortunately, Diamond has a tendency to repeat himself from chapter to chapter, so that something he talked about in depth two chapters before he finds the need to mention again in the current chapter. I have also read &quot;The Third Chimpanzee,&quot; and overall I found that to be a better read. Having read &quot;Guns&quot; before, though, I was able to follow the arguments in &quot;Chimpanzee&quot; a bit more easily, since he made references to people and places there that he did not elaborate on. Overall I find him to be a very interesting writer and for anyone interested in human evolution and history I would certainly recommend his books as an introduction."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"Yali's question: why indeed do the Europeans have more cargo then the Papuans? The author asserts that the answer lies in the proximate causes--Guns, Germs and Steel. He goes on to explore why history transpired as it did: what were the ultimate causes that enabled the Europeans to possess those three proximate causes of victory when the collision between civilizations came about?It is a compelling book. The idea may be old, themes trite, but the author looks affresh at the evidence thus far, and weaves a fine piece of work.Some readers may feel that the author has overlooked the role played by culture (religion, language, tradition, etc.) and chance. One may legitimately wonder why the Fertile Cresent, despite possessing the most conducive environement for the growth of civilization is not leading the race now. I don't think the criticism is fair. The author, I believe, have discounted those aspects simply because their lack of importance to what he sets out to prove: why the Europeans possessed the proximate causes of victory that other civilizations lacked?

I have not read one history book besides this one since leaving highschool and can say that it was certainly interesting and has intrigued me enough that I will add history as a subject to my reading list. I find Mr. Diamond's style of writing very smooth, this book almost reads like a novel. As I have said, I know nothing of history and so cannot say whether his theories are correct, but they are certainly convincing. This book has made me realize that reading a history book doesn't have to be &quot;homework&quot; (AKA - torture)."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"This is simply a great book. It looks at all the reasons why the world is dominated by a culture that originated among Caucasians in Europe, rather than one from Africa (where humans first developed) or China (which had a much advanced culture for a couple thousand years but lost ground in more recent times...)It provides significant ammunition against classic white supremacist claims (e.g., whites are superior since they got in the game late and yet culturally dominate the world now.)

The author is a physiology professor at a medical school--essentially an amateur popular science writer.

The chapters are disconnected essays, weakly attempting to explain why world culture and human history were predetermined without being racist or otherwise politically incorrect."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"An interesting read that misses, in my opinion, one of the more fundamental reasons for the rise of Europe versus the other cultures - THE PRINTED WORD! Ironic that a \\"book\\" is written that overlooks the value of \\"books\\" in cultural development. There was a good reason why \\"Time\\" magazine, in naming the most influential people in the last millenium named Guttenberg as #1. China, the Middle East, and South Asia all had well defined advanced cultures to Europe. One can trace the beginning of the divergence to the establishment of the printing press and the mechanical reproduction of words. Through this process alone came an explosion in scientific inquiry and discovery, as well as the development of an educated ruling class. China, Middle East, and South Asia societies remained dynastic based on the monopoly of the written word in the hands of these dynasts. Africa, Asia, and the the Americas remained for the most part agrarian and tribal where experience was based by word of mouth with all that interpretation and memory flaws have still to offer mankind.There is certainly much in what Diamond has to say, but one must look at the issue of \\"conquest\\" when one thinks of \\"divergence\\". Was - or is? - man fundamentally different between Asians, Africans and Europeans? To quote Shylock: \\"If you prick them, do they not bleed? If you tickle them, do they not laugh?\\" What, then, suddenly happened to provide Europeans with the means to conquest? Advance in technology over both the Middle Eastern and Chinese cultures were only attained by the spread of knowledge, and this through the invention of movable type that provided for the exponential expansion of knowledge. And this is where Diamond is wrong on the comparison of the people of New Guinea and America; America is based on a learned society through the printed word. That is why America landed on the moon and New Guinea still hasn't gotten off the ground.The books is, nonetheless, fascinating in drawing many themes together in a coherent whole. Indeed, without the skill Diamond has shown in doing this, none of the rest of we reviewers would have been able to come up with the criticism we have in pointing out deficiencies. It, too, is a function of the intellectual development of the West - as is this internet - that has provided for the core cause of the dominance of the West. As we've seen from just the 20th Century - esp. in China and India today! - when knowledge is disseminated in the form of the printed word, cultural gaps narrow to nothing. Nothing is more indicative of this than the history of Japan since Commodore Perry \\"opened\\" them up in 1854 to where they are today. This, truly, is the power of the press that Diamond overlooked."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"The thesis is quite interesting, but Diamond uses ten words when he could use one, and of those ten words five of them are either &quot;I&quot;, &quot;me&quot;, &quot;mine&quot;.I can't believe this book won a Pulitzer. I was under the impression that the *actual words* counted, not the actual *word count*."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"Such an interesting opening question - &quot;Why do white people have all the cargo?&quot; and such a disappointing result. Diamond says early on that he intends to creat a non-racist explanation for European dominance, constructs a series of variables (see above reviews) required for success, isolates three or four places in the world where these variablies intersect, and then proceeds to find reasons why only the Europeans could have succeeded. My favorite naked cop-out: China could not develop an advance society because its coastline is smooth, see, and so dissenters had no place to hide from a centralized government that suppressed innovation.(Um, why?) Europe's coastline, by contrast, is crinkly. Bettcha didn't know that!"},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"\\"Guns, Germs, and Steel\\" certainly makes for good reading. I was turned off however by Diamond's relentless attack on the notion that one race may be intellectually superior to another. Sure enough, to my knowledge, there has never been any serious research that has conclusively come down on one side or the other. But because of that, I believe we are entitled to opinions on the subject, but Diamond would want only one opinion, and that is: all the races are equal in their intellect. This dogmatism lowers somewhat the stature of the book."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"\\"As you will see, the answers [to the question of why civilizations differ] don't involve human racial differences at all.\\" (Pg. 9.)\\"Europe's colonization of Africa had nothing to do with differences between European and African peoples themselves, as white racists assume.\\" (Pg. 400.)\\"[Differences between civilizations] have been due not to innate differences in the peoples themselves, but to differences in their environments.\\" (Pg. 405.)The quotes above from 'Guns, Germs, & Steel' show the book's stated thesis and, accordingly, the notion runs through the entire book: every chapter, paragraph, and sentence seeks to discredit genetics as the basis (or even the consequence of) variations in civilizations. The author goes beyond merely ignoring and dismissing genetics as an explanation for differences between societies, and he in fact repeatedly calls white people \\"racists\\" for any curiosity they might have in genetics.If the author preemptively rejects evidence (genetics) for his hypothesis (differences in civilizations), then his conclusions are incomplete. Well, they're incomplete at BEST, at worst, he's just a straight-up fraud.So this deliberate rejection of genetics - and, in fact, the author's routine name-calling of white people as \\"racist\\" - is my biggest problem with the book, by far. As noted before, it permeates the entire book. However, it's far from the only problem I had with the book.First off, the writing is regularly boring and dull. Maybe there was a good reason to have dozens and dozens (hundreds?) of pages devoted to long-forgotten cultures in the South Pacific (of which the author is clearly speculating about a great deal), but I usually couldn't figure out what those reasons were. Some of the topics and factoids were interesting (for instance, the sparse population of Australian Aboriginals causing their technological development to plateau), but much of it was a mixture of tedious, pointless, or too speculative.Another problem comes from the author's attempt to essentially bully readers into believing everything he says by stating speculations and vague theories as absolute fact and piling one on top of another. And when the topics are very obscure (dead civilizations in remote areas) and he's carrying on, readers have to defer to his judgment and presume he's an expert. In fact, when considered seriously, much of his reasoning is just hilariously stupid, but he tries to sneak by with this. For instance, in one of his anti-white (gentile) diatribes, he declares that whites were inferior horse riders to the Native Americans - this is his way of proving that, even though the Native Americans had few domesticated animals, they could have domesticated large animals if they had had access to more of them. So, how does he demonstrate that Indians were better horse riders than cowboys? He references the supposed ideal of a horse-mounted Indian that \\"now figure prominently in white Americans' image of American Indians.\\" (Pg. 356.) So now he's referencing Hollywood movie shots to prove his theory. That's New York Times-approved science, people!On the plus side, the book does have some interesting anecdotes (most especially the well-relayed story of Spanish Conquistadors defeating the Incas - which was largely told through primary sources), many interesting factoids (the vitally important fact that diseases wiped out 90% of the indigenous population on North America when Europeans arrives), and then there are broad concepts that are interesting, as well (such as the east-west geographical axis of Eurasia allowing for greater diffusion of crops and animals because of similar climates along the same longitude).However, those considerable attributes do not even come close to overriding the author's disingenuous and prima facie rejection of genetics as the cause of anything, the long portions of it that are plain boring, nor the faulty logic in many of the pillars of his various arguments.The fact that the mainstream media praised this book so breathlessly is just more proof that I should continue to give them no credibility."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"well writen for the most part. A little too meticulous at some points,and repetitive. The author fails to address or at least answer to my satisfaction some questions regarding scientific discovery. The author devoted more pages to putting the natives of New Guinea on a pedestal than to the european exploitation of steel and implementation of firearms. You can judge which has had more impact on world history. I would have rather read more about guns and steel than about The native new guinea culture."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"i bought this just for school because i had to write a paper on it but i did not like or agree with this book at all. WE DID NOT COME FROM MONKEYS!!!!!"},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"I have to agree with the reviewer who judged the book \\"fascinating, and yet so tedious\\". I found the main argument of Mr Diamond rather convincing. The reasons why humanity strived in certain geographical areas and not in others are also to be found in the way our planet, and life on it, are organized. The possibilities for agriculture and animal husbandry and the different epidemiological situations that different locations offered to our ancestors surely had a powerful impact in determining which societies could evolve better, and sooner. For this the author deserves 5 stars. This vision is completely consistent with my materialistic ideas about how we ended up being what we are, and where we are. However, I am surprising to find that so many reviewers (professionals and amateurs alike) find Mr Diamond a brilliant writer. Of course I do think he writes well, but I also think he is in a different league with respect to someone like, say, the late Stephen J Gould (at least the \\"first\\" Gould, before he started loving himself and his ideas so much to become unnecessarily pompous and self-referential). Mr Diamond writes clearly and convincingly, but he does it in a very dull and very very very etc. repetitive way. This is one of those really insighful books for which intellectual joy only comes from reading the introduction. After that, the rest of the book is just repetition of the main argument, and filling the blanks. This is not to say that details are unimportant. Quite the contrary. But they are often not that exiciting. I have only read a few chapters of this book, and then I gave up, rather bored by the lack of additional knowledge provided by later chapters. I had an even worse experience with one of his previous books (The third Chimapanzee). Mr Diamond is very creative and I really like his ideas, but I just don't like his books...."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"I originally learned about Guns, Germs, and Steel on the RPG.net forums. It sounded like an excellent book to ground a Game Master or an author on world-building. So I put it on my wish list and last Christmas I received it as a gift. It took me this long to finish reading it, and I'm the better for it.But I put it down after reading one chapter into it. The author, Jared Diamond, explains on page 19 that racist explanations are &quot;loathsome, but also...wrong. Sound evidence for the existence of human differences in intelligence that parallel human differences in technology is lacking.&quot; Then he turns around and states, &quot;...modern &quot;Stone Age&quot; peoples are on the average probably more intelligent, not less intelligent, than industrialized peoples. Displaying his bias up front, Diamond states on page 21, &quot;in mental ability New Guineans are probably genetically superior to Westerners, and they surely are superior in escaping the devastating developmental disadvantages under which most children in industrialized societies now grow up.&quot;There's a few problems with Diamond's arguments, not the least of which is that he spends two pages arguing a point that he has no means of scientifically proving. This is ironic, given his last chapter that talks about a scientific approach to history. It's also telling that Diamond has but one source mentioned in his notes for his argument that New Guineans are smarter than Westerners.On its surface, I don't object to Diamond's bias. It does however, taint his entire argument. It's difficult to take Diamond seriously when he devotes an entire book proving that one society's domination of another is not inherently racist but determined by a wide variety of other factors - but oh yeah, New Guineans are genetically superior. It's like listening to a priest and a die-hard atheist argue - the two are so diametrically polarized, it's difficult to consider either argument as objective.So I put the book down and it sat on my shelf for two months. Then I decided to give Diamond another chance, because some of what he said was intriguing. To whit, Diamond provides evidence that societies excel because of a combination of geographic and societal factors.For example, farming societies can produce more food per square foot than hunting societies. Hunters have to expend energy to carry their children, so too many hinders the tribe. Farmers can stay put and reproduce as well as feed more mouths. As time goes on, farming societies can support politicians. Politicians are better at waging war and organizing peoples than hunters, who will often leave the area and move on to a less dangerous location.Farmers also coexist with domesticated animals. Of particular relevant for world builders are the attributes that make an animal useful for domestication, including diet (food must be easily available), growth rate (they must grow quickly enough to be productive), breed in captivity, benign disposition, not prone to panic, and social structure (herd or pack mentalities allow humans to take roles in the domesticated animals' structure). Animals are important for another reason - by coexisting with them, humans are exposed to a wider variety of diseases earlier than hunters. This is how Europeans ended up plaguing North and South Americans.Geographically, he east-west axis of a continent allows cultures to travel easier across similar terrain as opposed to a north-south continent, which will have a wider variety of climates. This in turn makes it easier to carry foodstuffs and farming.On the opposite extreme, unified societies can be a hindrance. China fell behind modern societies even though it led the world in chemistry, clockworks, exploration, and warfare - all because the ruling classes passed laws to prohibit their development. Conversely, Europe's fragmentation was ripe enough in its diversity to allow good ideas to eventually flourish.Diamond's overview is breathtaking in its breadth and a critical part of our education system. It should be in every child's school texts. It helps dispel, once and for all, the racist notions that pervade common views of history - if only Diamond could keep his own biases out of the book."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"Unlike many, I found Jared Diamond's theory very easy to accept. My thought while reading the book was \\"It's about time!\\". While I was somewhat prepared for his assumptions because I had recently read \\"Ecological Imperialism\\", about how Europeans exported their diseases and biota along with themselves, to my delight Mr. Diamond managed to take the theory farther. If you have an open mind, you can easily accept how humans developed through history from a biological point of view. Those who are tied to the assumption that racial grouping determined who \\"won\\", however, will have the most difficulty with this tome.What really fascinated me was how we humans came to grow and eat what we do, a question that has always intrigued me. After reading Guns, Germs and Steel, I no longer have to wonder. He also answered the question of wheeled transport (Mexicans had knowledge of the wheel, but not the draft animals to pull a vehicle of any useful size).I recommend this book highly to anyone who will listen. Yes, Mr. Diamond did take a risk by claiming New Guinea natives are smarter than westerners, and critics have taken him to task for doing so. I wonder though whether they do so because he has touched a nerve. I was happy to see a person of European descent who did not need to prove that Europeans are superior to those from other cultures.Lastly, I would like to comment Mr. Diamond on his writing style. Obviously, explaining history biologically is a task that could prove confusing to the lay reader. No matter how you feel about his theories, you must admit that the author handled the subject so that the reader can easily understand his points. It ranks, in my eyes, as one of the best written books I have ever read. It won a Pulitzer for a reason!"},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"Recorded history began about 10,000 years ago, but the human species has been around for several million years. This book covers it ALL, starting seven million years ago, when a population of African apes divided into three populations, leading respectively to gorillas, chimpanzees, and humans. In a paragraph, Diamond takes us three million years to homo erectus---full-size, walking upright, but with only a half-size brain.Homo erectus was the first pre-human to spread beyond Africa, about one or two million years ago, and fossils have been found in Europe that date to a half-million years ago. Fossils from that time indicate larger brains, and looking more like homo sapiens. About a hundred thousand years ago was the age of Neanderthals, still less than fully human.Human history at last took off about fifty thousand years ago, with the advent of Cro-Magnons, who used tools, weapons, houses, sewn clothing, jewelry, burial rites, and sophisticated art work. Diamond calls this period the \\"Great Leap Forward.\\" He is not so sure whether this leap occurred in one \\"Garden of Eden\\" or many places around the world concurrently. In Europe the evidence is that Cro-Magnons displaced Neanderthals some 40,000 years ago, with no interbreeding. (Cro-Magnons are so different from Neanderthals that it strikes me as something of a mystery how they actually originated, or whether they were really descendants of Neanderthals---hmmmmm----)By 20,000 years ago there were humans throughout Europe and Asia, and by 12,000 years ago they crossed the Bering Straits to Alaska, and a thousand years later had reached much of South America. Diamond touches on many ambiguities in this scientific account of our origins.The above is a summary of twenty pages devoted to this period, which sets the stage for Diamond's subsequent attempt to answer the question of why some parts of the world developed literate industrial societies, others nonliterate farming societies, and still others remained hunter-gatherers using stone tools.Diamond takes us through the domestication of plants and animals, where and when it occurred with his explanations of why it first occurred in the Fertile Crescent starting about 11,000 years ago, thousands of years later in other places. He shows that environmental and geographic factors can fully account for the differences in how and when food production capability developed in different places, and the profound impact that had on subsequent development.We then learn how the domestication of animals led to diseases and germs, to steel and weapons, and to some peoples having the capability to conquer or even exterminate other peoples. Major factors are the geographical axis of the continents (east-west versus north-south) and differences in the natural availability of plant and animal species suitable for domestication. These factors favored the Fertile Crescent, where the agricultural revolution had it's origins as well as the later spread of agricultural technology throughout Europe and Asia, and later in the Americas. Germs and diseases developed with origins in domesticated animals that affected humans, who then developed a degree of immunity or resistance to diseases like smallpox. Populations that lagged in animal domestication were lacking this immunity. Those with a head start were then able to conquer and sometimes eliminate more primitive cultures, often through the accidental or even intentional spread of diseases.Diamond provides a compelling explanation for the differences in present day modern and primitive societies based totally on factors other than race or genetics. Some may say it is an elaborate and scholarly rationalization for a politically correct world view, or that many other important factors are neglected. Diamond discusses a few of these issues in an Epilogue.Maybe it is presumptuous to comment on such a superb, scholarly work that has won a Pulitzer Prize as well as critical acclaim and LOTS of readers---but, for what it's worth, I found it intensely interesting. The most ambitious account of the history of mankind and human societies I've encountered, and a compelling case against racist views of the differences between cultures. Highly recommended!!"},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"Diamond's subject and his lucid if plodding prose kept me going despite this books nearly fatal flaw: it is numbingly repetitive. Maybe Diamond expected a few thousand undergraduates to be assigned this or that chapter in isolation and so felt compelled to provide ample context from the rest of the book at every point in each argument he makes. Nevertheless the material covered is so compelling that the book made it onto my Christmas giving list."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"How can a book pretend to be scientific, while its arguments are constructed from fallacies and hand picked examples?How can a book that is supposedly set to combat racist statements about advanced groups show hatred towards some of them?Here is a list of a few aspects of this book:1) The author does not seem to have done intensive research on each of the topics that he aims at. Instead, he ping pongs on many social sciences and \\"assumes\\" the rest of the drivers. In fact, I wrote the word in inverted commas because he uses it exceedingly in his speech.For instance, he concludes that small bands or tribes don't fight in wars with willingness to give up their lives proudly and that the erection of States is necessary for this to happen, for fighters to be willing to die for the group they belong to. This is not necessarily the case, as many available examples show, such as the Mapuches in Patagonia. Still today this group, which gave headaches in the XVI century to the Spanish to the point that the latter could not get past the center of Chile in their conquest, is claiming its rights. Mapuches didn't have an organized State, were nomads and hunter-gatherers, exactly the opposite of the author's assertion. Most importantly, the Mapuches are and were one of the most influential tribes in South America.Another example: he misses completely the terrible state of the Inca people at the time of Spanish arrival, which has been well documented. The Incas had a terrible state of affairs socially, as they were enslaved by the Emperor, starved to death and mistreated. This factor is crucial in their resignation to belong to the Spanish as slaves. Having dedicated a few chapters to the Incas, Diamond never makes mention of this important feature. Furthermore, the author cites only one letter, which is thought by historians to be extremely biased so as to show Spanish prowess and to justify the killings. However, the author never warns against this. (You can read Todorov's major work to obtain an idea of how wrong the author is on the Spanish conquest of America).Another example: it is obvious that the author either did not read Rousseau's \\"The Social Contract\\", or else he missed the point completely, which could have been the case had he read Hobbes and Locke. Besides, isn't it strange to dedicate a full chapter to the question of the State and to never mention Locke? Rousseau, or Locke or Hobbes for that matter, didn't refer to the beginnings of civilization. Their metaphors portray theoretical cases that are placed in Europe's (mainly the western part's) state of affairs at the time at which they were writing. They made the point that democracy was a necessary attainment, a direct democracy form from Rousseau's perspective, an indirect one from Locke's, and under a ruler from Hobbes' standpoint. In fact, this is one of the theories on which the French Revolution based its movement, Rousseau's call to make a State for the people, where the people could make decisions. I can't see what link this can have to the erection of the Roman or Inca Empires, as Rousseau did not write for that audience. Diamond's criticism on Rousseau would be pretty similar to taking down Marx or Nietzsche for their theories on the productive phases and the genealogy of morals, respectively.One more example: what the author calls \\"The Anna Karenina Principle\\" is completely wrong. The first lines by Tolstoy are not related to the number of aspects that a marriage needs to succeed (or fail) on, but to how families differ from each other when they are unhappy and how more interesting they become when they are so, whereas happy families are always the same (presumably a few of us would only pay attention to happy families as it's all the same what reason they are happy for, whereas unhappy families give room to gossip and to an interesting story that could give birth to a book such as Tolstoy's).2) The author chooses to use his personal life experience in his fieldwork (working with birds presumably). He also elects to speak about diversity in California based on how many nationalities his children's friends belong to, or he talks about malaria and other deceases based on his European and American friends who had to leave New Guinea because of tropical illnesses. There are many of these cases throughout the book. Isn't science supposed to fight this commonsensical approach? Where are the statistics of illnesses and fatal deceases, or the diversity numbers from the State of California?3) He seems to have a grudge of some kind against Japanese, given the repeatedly derogatory comments that the author writes about its language and culture. He labels Japanese language as \\"horrendously cumbersome\\" that should be replaced for \\"efficient alphabets\\" (a pity he never says the same about Chinese, which he acknowledges uses the same system that the Japanese inherited from China. This is a major reflection of the author's predisposition towards Japanese culture).I don't think that Japanese and those of us who love the beauty and detail of Japanese language think that Japan should send its national language to the dogs anytime soon. Language is a manifestation of identity and history for a country, how can an author who claims to be attempting to fight racist approaches write such down comments on national identity?Additionally, he is wrong about the use of kana, which is not only a nice set of writings for \\"telegrams\\" as Diamond states. Hiragana is absolutely necessary for particles and grammar, such as verb terminations, and many words don't have the equivalent Chinese symbol, for which they can only be written in hiragana. Also katakana is used for foreign words. Japanese are a model of incorporation of foreign elements without overriding their own culture. Information about the use of kana can easily be found by doing a search on Wikipedia or any encyclopedia (or Japanese kanji dictionary).4) Circular arguments, fallacies and out of the blue assumptions are the general rule. For instance, from page 284 (paperback) the result is: Why are societies complex? --> Because they are big in number of members. Why are societies big in number of members? --> Because they are complex. The author never provides any driver to get out of this labyrinth, which he sets himself in.5) The book is so repetitive, that I had to drag myself to the end. The argument is: \\"food production\\", that is what it boils down to. The rest of the factors, for instance geography or technology, are all linked to food production. Those that could achieve agriculture first, presumably thanks to their incredible geography, are the ones that had a head start and that were able to have people to build weaponry, writing systems, inventions, etc. This is a common fallacy called \\"begging the question\\" (petitio principii). The author assumes that it takes all peoples the same number of years to excel in food production, which can be seen by his repeated argument that if such people had not invaded such other people, the latter could have achieved agriculture or other advances if they had been provided due time (as an example from the book, why couldn't it have taken natives in the Pampas region in Argentina, with its excellent soil and benign climate, less time to master local produce as opposed to the people in Europe? However, the former group never achieved the power that Europeans did. In fact, the author poses this question but never answers it).Furthermore, assumptions on what country has better instances for inventors to rise are judgmental rather than scientific. The author never treats the direct relationship between capital and technological advancements, which has been a main topic of discussion in a branch of economics called \\"development economics\\", specifically by the endogenous development theories and by theories entertained with Beta Convergence across the globe, which became a major topic of discussion after the WWII (and hence, there are hundreds of papers and books written about this topic).6) Most importantly: where is culture in this entire picture? Sapiens is, according to Diamond, a product of food production, which led to expansion. The only cultural features mentioned by the author are some of the paintings in caves (topic that can be read extensively in newspapers), pottery (only praise to Japan) and writing. The latter seems to be there to justify how some groups could expand extensively based on written stories about other peoples, navigation maps, etc.Anthropologists that instead of watching birds actually spent time with the descendents of the peoples that the author refers to (Levi-Strauss, Malinowski, to name only a few of the greatest figures in social sciences) have taken the pains to write down detailed explanations as to the traits in cultural development that made Sapiens what it is today.In Diamond's account, where is exogamy which played a crucial role in creating the diversity in races and cultures that exist today and the dispersion of Sapiens across the globe? Edgar Morin in his bio-anthropological work (not only a scientific achievement, but also a work of art) explains a dialectic relationship between brain expansion and cultural complexity, which were possible thanks to exogamy, a treat that is explained extensively by Claude Levi-Strauss and that was later taken by Freud in his anthropological and psychology studies.I could go on and on to write several pages... but I think that I made my point across.If you want to read a beautiful revamp of this topic, I suggest that you pick \\"Dark Age Ahead\\" by Jane Jacobs. She points out a few of the major mistakes in Diamond's book.My background: I am a student in a 5-year degree program in Philosophy and a PhD candidate in Economics.

Your average racist would say that Australia would have developed a great civilization while Europe would have remained a region of the world where people today would still be throwing spears about. Mr. Diamond explores the progress of humanity by scientifically studying the factors that permitted and encouraged the growth of complex societies. A society is where it is because of geographical factors, and not because of any variables of intelligence or physique. What are these factors? The answers are fascinating:Societies moved from hunter/gatherer types to farmers because they lived in areas where potential food crops grew, and where animals capable of being domesticated lived. Most of the world's food crops originated in the Fertile Crescent of the Mediterranean. Many areas of the world such as Australia and much of the United States had no original food crops. Could it be that some people were just too stupid to recognize a plant's potential? No. Amazingly almost all edible plants were domesticated thousands of years ago, as were our domesticated animals. Australia had no animals capable of being domesticated while horses, sheep, goats, and pigs originated in, and spread quickly through the Euro-Asian continent. We learn some interesting facts about food plant development. Many plants became food because of defective genes. The wild almond tree is poisonous, but some trees were found with defective cyanide producing genes. They were cultivated. Wild peas have a gene that causes the pea pod to explode when ripe, which would make harvesting impossible. Pea plants were found that lacked this &quot;explosion&quot; gene, and so today we eat peas.Societies with domestic animals developed diseases that originated in these animals. (Measles, tuberculosis, and smallpox come from cattle; influenza from pigs). Thus Europeans decimated the Incas and Native Americans by passing on these germs. Incas and Native Americans had no domesticated animals (only the llama in Peru), so they could not fight back with germs of their own.Mr. Diamond presents an immense amount of evidence to show that all peoples are intelligent, and that the development of large, organized societies hinges entirely on varied local natural resources, and being in locations where natural barriers (deserts, mountains, oceans) did not preclude the sharing of resources with others. This is a most impressive work that provides the reader with insight into why hunter/gatherer tribes live together on the same planet with highly complex technological nations."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"Diamond labors hard to explain that geography explains all the differences in societies. He's like someone arguing that a person's lifespan depends only on nutrition and then supports the premise with countless stories of people who ate well and lived a long life, and of people with bad nutrition who died young. The presenter neglects any stories with factors like genetics, lifestyle, accidents, wars, or diseases. In a likewise manner, Diamond gives us a myopic view of the importance of geography, plants, and animals in history. He seems more intent on promoting a philosophy of historic racial equality than exploring all the facts. Diamond seems to say that &quot;your ancestors are neither good or bad, but geography makes them so&quot;.For example, he states that civilization flourishes in areas with broad East-West land masses which encourage sharing of plants and animals developed for the same clime. Yet in the Americas the greatest civilizations, the Aztecs and Mayans, appeared near the narrowest point of the continent. They built amazing structures, developed astonishing mathematics, and achieved literacy without sharing plants or animals in the same latitude with far flung neighbors.He postulates that the sharing of ideas, plants, and animals within the Americas were difficult due to the geography of the Isthmus of Panama and the prairies in North America. This does not ring true since the isthmus can be over come by a short boat trip and the continent was traversed Lewis and Clark (perhaps Montezuma just needed a scrappy Native American guide like Sacajawea).Diamond dismisses politics, religion, culture, individuals, and timing.For an example consider Cortez's victory over the Aztecs. Cortez's victory was not assured. Many elements had to be aligned for a few hundred Spaniards to overcome a mighty empire. The odds were really in Montezuma's favor. Even with horses, armor, and guns, the Aztecs were easily a match for Cortez. The Spanish armor was superfluous. According to Keegan, they even shed their heavy armor in favor of the native quilt vests. The firearms at that time were not quick to reload, so sheer numbers could have overwhelmed the Spanish. The Aztecs lost because of politics, religion, and individuals.The brutal politics and religion of the Aztecs made their subjects hate them. The Spanish were immediately supported with armies and food by the smaller nations like the Totonacs that hated the Aztecs for their cruelty. The insatiable appetite of the Aztec gods for human sacrifices insured that Cortez found ready allies.If either Montezuma or Cortez had been composed of slightly different temperaments the war could easily have gone the other way. Had Montezuma been more decisive, he could have had Cortez killed at the coast. Had Cortez not been so incredibly determined to take the country, he could have just returned to Spain with a load of the early gold presents sent to him.History is determined by far more than geography, plants, and animals. Culture, religion, individuals, politics, and timing all play important roles. My dear fellow readers, please *think* before blindly accepting Diamond's grossly incomplete view of history."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"Sometimes back I read \\"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies\\" by Jared Diamond. No doubt a fantastic book which deserves five stars ... It talks about how the environmental factors contributed towards the evolution of humans.Some of the questions he tries to answer ...1. Why some Hunter-gatherers in some places moved on to farming and others did not?.(The author suggests that when cost-benefit analysis is done, in some cases hunting-gathering was better(for example ... it takes time to plant and grow the plants) and other cases it was not. The author emphasizes that the benefits of planned farming were enormous ... it enabled humans to grow more food in per square unit of an area. This in turn enabled population growth.)2. Why only some plants/vegetables were domesticated?3. Why the Eurasians were more successful in plant domestication (b'cos of their latitudinal layout) whereas not that successful in African/American continent (due to to longitudinal layout)?4. How plant domestication lead to Trade?5.

This book presents a pretty cohesive story about how long-term human history was shaped by basic causes we all understand, like geography, topography, climate. The climate and location made it better to grow stuff in the Middle East, so early people did it and it worked. That led to farms and farm animals and civilization. Pretty simple story. He fills in the details pretty convincingly. Things fit together. He doesn't need some non-scientific excuse like \\"white people are smarter\\", which only serves to inflame people.It's not that this book is completely right in all it's explanations.

While most have been pretty insightful -- I only found one blatant racist pig -- they seem to miss a fundamental point: why is the economic and political dominance of the west that Diamond researches seen as inherently _good_? There's no doubt that the events he chronicles did happen, the disease, the political conquests, etc, and I believe most of his reasons as to why they did. The problem lies in the fact that neither he, nor the other reviewers here, ask the more fundamental question -- So WHAT? So what if the west has better weapons, resistance to disease, and economic dominance? Why are these equated with success or superiority? We need to deconstruct _why_ these were/are seen as the goal for civilizations past and present. The New Guinean asks why whites have more &quot;cargo&quot; -- no doubt a provocative question -- but no one stops to think &quot;is 'cargo' really good, or desirable, or admirable?&quot; Diamond has taken a very traditional and very male view of what exactly is the &quot;good stuff&quot; in life."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"Purchased this book after reading all the good reviews. Was very disappointed. The idea of the book is interesting, yet almost never addresses the topics in the title (Guns, Germs and Steel).

According to him, people of Black Africa have not been lucky : as draught animals, they have only inherited of the African buffalo. And the African buffalo is reportedly known for its bad temper.

In the preface, Diamond states that the readers are not about to read a \\"racist treatise\\" and that the book doesn't \\"involve human racial differences at all.\\" Skip a few pages to the prologue and Diamond postulates \\"Why did New Guineans wind up technologically primitive, despite what I believe to be their superior intelligence?\\" Is New Guinean a race? Maybe, maybe not... but reverse the statement and then see how the critics chime in.May society one day separate thought from nicety."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"The whole purpose of writing this book, as the author Jared Diamond freely admits, is to debunk the notion that the human race, culture and traditions had anything to do with the striking differences of the technological progress achieved by different societies on different continents throughout history. His main postulate is that only in the Fertile Triangle of the Middle East were there the right conditions, such as climate, choice of plants and animals to be domesticated etc., to favor food production on a grand scale. These favorable conditions in turn allowed other technological developments, which resulted in - until recently - the technological preeminence of Western civilization. According the Diamond, any other group of humans given the same opportunities would have fared in the same way. Thus, he puts the onus on geography and environment, one of the few theories in the evolution of human societies, which has been kicking around for some time. In support of this, he provides an endless litany of examples, mostly conjectural and hypothetical.Diamond speaks from a totally anthropocentric position: anything and everything in the world throughout recorded, or at least archeologically documented human history, is weighted from the perspective of its usefulness to humans. He seems to completely lack compassion for the non-human living creatures and the biosphere in general. His only concern is how to best exploit the Earth and use all living things to the benefit of man. Given his antiracist position, this anthroporacism is offensive.Somewhat surprisingly for such a politically correct author, is his implicit advocacy of eugenics by stating that New Guineans are smarter than Westerners because only the fittest and smartest survived throughout their history of \\"high mortality from murder, chronic tribal warfare, accidents and problems in procuring food\\". In contrast, Europeans have diluted the quality of their genetic pool by allowing \\"to survive live-born infants fatal infections as well as reproduce themselves, regardless of their intelligence and the genes they bear \\"(sic) (Prologue paperback ed. p. 20 - 21).Lastly, one idiosyncratic note: in the Prologue Diamond takes great pains to assure the reader that he is sublimely qualified to write a complete and definitive book on this subject by the virtue of his upbringing, education, and professional and personal experience. Perhaps, this might have been better left for a reviewer to decide."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"It is hard to understand why this book won the pulitzer (though another reviewer points it out: only journalists give the awards -- not scientists, historians and others in relevant fields who could have pointed out flaws).Readers would benefit from reading J.M.Blaut's criticisms of this book, in his Eight Eurocentric Historians.

The fact that people benefited from where they originated has been known for generations, however it has been associated with racist theories of genetic superiority of the people themselves.Diamond points out that there were many advantages due to historical circumstances not based on racist theory. Europeans conquered the new world, but the fact that they brought horses, guns, germs and steel made a significant difference in success of their invasion; not their marginal genetic difference from the conquered. None of these technological advantages originated in Europe, but farther east in Eurasia.Eurasia is the largest landmass on Earth and it also has the widest expanse of temperate lands as well. Thus species and technologies suited to these latitudes could spread quickly. Domestication of plants and animals and the interspecies transfer of their deseases to humans in the eurasian land mass led to better food, better bugs, and better immunity. In the America's and Africa the landmasses are oriented across latitudes, preventing the spread of plant and animal species of use to humans. The fact that the US Manifest Destiny spread east to west is compelling evidence that latitude does matter. This natural cultural evolution provided by Eurasia's latitude advantage provided unsurmountable advantages for Eurasian peoples.Like many simple but powerful theories these are threatening ideas. The fact that preconceived notions of superiority can be explained away by simple concepts of material chance is not pleasant to some. In his follow up book Colapse he points to the failure of the Greenland Norse who refused to adopt superior techniques of the Inuit, even as they starved to death.By challenging the orthodoxy of racism Diamond does a service for Humanity and the natural sciences, even if some refuse to open their minds."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"Excellent, essential and very revealing !

This gets him into diffculties, as he is not always able to stick to his own line: thus, he argues that (eg) Australian Aborigines pursued an optimal developmental course in light of the limits they faced from the lack of domesticable plants and animals; but he also suggests that China's loss of leadership to Europe in the modern era may be explained by its greater centralisation. This is at best inconsistent.It also points up the central failing of the book, as for all that it presents a compelling explanation of the advantages of Eurasia as a cradle of development, it fails to answer &quot;Yali's question&quot;, offering little to explain how one rather than another part of Eurasia (ie, Northwestern Europe (and latterly its cultural successor, North America) rather than the Mediterranean, Levant, Indian subcontinent, or China) has prevailed in the last five hundred years and why the character of its dominance has been so overwhelming. Presumably this is because any attempted explanation would take Diamond further down the culturally deterministic road he prefers not to travel.

A fair fraction of the recent evolutionary change affected brain & axon growth. For example, you see new versions of SLC6A4, a serotonin transporter, in Europeans and Asians. There's a new version of a gene (DBA1) that shapes the development of the layers of the cerebral cortex in east Asia.3.

However, none of the above reviewers remarked that quite often, the book is rather sloppy both in analysis and detail, including a very different subtitle on the paper cover and in the book itself (I have the Jonathan Cape version). For example, in the encounter between Pizarro and the Inca throne pretendent Atahuallpa, the latter is several times presented as the ruling Inca, which he was not. Atahuallpa had just won major victories over his opponent and was heading for the capital Cusco to claim the throne when he found Pizarro and company on his way. Not very surprisingly, Atahuallpa had other things on his mind than evaluating the possible threat these foreigners could present. Another example: several times it is mentioned that the Incas had no writing. However, they had quipus, an elaborate system of threads and knots with which they could make extensive precise records. These quipus could easily be transferred through the realm with the aid of long distance runners. They could well be considered the equivalent of cuneiform, and were very well adapted to Andean state building efforts. Also the importance of potatoes is played down, as well as many other things, especially New World dating of plant domestication, that do not conform to Diamond's analysis. I was also struck by the fact that Diamond hardly ever makes reference to the work of other scientists and historians, although his work heavily leans on their scholarship. Their work is only referred to in the section Further Reading, which I find rather offensive to these scholars (also because the Index does not refer to that section). So, although this is a most interesting and challenging book, it is impossible to know what part of the argument should actually be attributed to Diamond, and what to other scientists. For example, considerable portions of the argument about infectious diseases come straight from William McNeill's Plagues and Peoples, without ever mentioning this in the main text. As a result, the book's arguments and details should not be quoted unless there is certainty that Diamond has not taken them from someone else without mentioning him or her. I think the book is very strong on biology and languages, but considerably less so on human history.

That is: Why are people of European descent so much more successful than the rest of the world? His answers to that are extremely well articulated but yet they are not particularly complex. They gainsay the obvious answer that may have (and often does) have racial overtones. Briefly the answer has nothing to do with genetics.Diamond goes to wonderful detail to describe how natives of Africa, New Guinea or South America have to live their lives in desperate conditions and the ingenuity that is required to survive. To boil a lengthy thesis into a few words he would say that the environmental conditions for different peoples spelled their destiny. \\"History followed different courses for different peoples because of differences among people's environments, not because of biological differences among people themselves\\"The book outlines a very basic point that prevails throughout history and that is they who control information technology rule the world. I have firmly believed this for many years and reading Diamond's book strengthened that thought.In the earliest days that technology consisted of the tools to hunt which led to storing wild crops which led to agriculture which led to communities and writing and disease and war and more. The picture is not always pretty. It is real. Other ethno-biologists may disagree with his premise but they cannot deny that Diamond's thinking is very fruitful in understanding humanity and our history.The cultivation of food led to great societies over the history of humans and that led to some of the most significant governments and therefore dominant armies and then of course, international domination. The reason some areas were able to tame wild plants into vegetables and animals into domestication are purely environmental according to Diamond. The environmental factors include the number of animals that could be domesticated either for food or work and the amount of wild harvest that could be used in agriculture.These factors varied profoundly over the earth and were certainly affected by climactic conditions. Europe had the most favorable conditions for this and that led to the creation of communities and ultimately to dynasties and world domination. The United States was formed as a residue of that fact.Despite the geo-economic factors that distinguish the \\"First World\\" from any others, there is no genetic factor that suggests that they are intellectually inferior. To some extent those of us from the \\"First World\\" have had our world handed to us on a platter and we may be less ingenuous than our \\"Third World\\" compatriots.

I read this book having recently returned from an extended visit to East Africa so I was intrigued by the breadth of data presented in it. However, from the synthesis of this geographic data, the historical conclusions are entirely off base.I definitely agree with the author's premise that geographical assets are significant in the development of civilizations, but Mr. Diamond's leap from geographic assistance in development to historical mandate of dominance is weak. If Mr. Diamond's assertions are to be believed, then clearly China should rule the world,(that chapter on the exemption of China was weak) if not them then India or one of the many mysterious North American civilizations.As a student of Mexican and Native American history, I understand that guns had very little to do with the conquest of the Mexica and subjugation of the Aztec peoples. The guns of the Castilian conquistadores weren't even guns at all, but were in fact clumsy arquebuses, weapons of limited range and efficiency.Individually, the Castilian's best military advantage was probably the horse closely followed by their Toledo steel. Yet even armed with those weapons they still were very close to defeat on several occasions. In fact, all of the Conquistadores adopted Native American cotton armor because it was far superior. The primary reason they triumphed over the peoples in the Valley of Mexico was their clever use of politics and propaganda.Overlooked in the analysis of this book is the impact of significant people and significant movements. I understand that in American history, you take away Abraham Lincoln and we have two separate countries. Take away Genghis Khan, and the peoples of Western Europe would probably be speaking Arabic. Take away Taoism and Confucianism from China and perhaps they throw the might of their civilization into agressive expansion.Basically, the book is fundamentally flawed because you can't neatly tidy up history into the sum of certain geographical circumstances. To be fair, you can't also solely use religion or economics. History is the combination of all of these elements and so much more. It is entirely beyond me why this book is as lauded as much as it is today. As a compendium of geographical, botanical and biological information there are no new revelations. The historical assumptions derived from this information, despite your opinion of their validity are not new either. Maybe its the glowing endorsement from Bill Gates? After all, Rise of Nations (which lets you take on all these civilizations from the stone age to the computer age) soon came out after this book was published.

Evidence of 'racism', yes? One gets the idea, though, that he would prefer the reverse. That is, that Europeans 'joined the club' and reverted to hunter gatherers.You will be told that the very same elements credited with the rise of western Europe \\"were developed by other peoples living elsewhere and were then imported to western Europe.\\" However, he makes no attempt whatsoever to explain why these elements were of no use to their original 'developers'.Although he decries the idea that western Europeans have a higher intelligence for any genetic reason and calls this idea 'loathsome'. He nevertheless amazes the observant reader with a multitude of reasons why the reverse must be true! He states that \\"New Guineans suffered high mortality from murder, chronic tribal warfare, accidents and problems in procuring food. Intelligent people are likelier than less intelligent ones to escape those high causes of mortality in traditional New Guinea societies.\\" Lest there be any argument that this is indeed a genetic cause for superior racial intelligence he makes it very clear by following this paragraph with this, \\"Besides this genetic reason...\\"I fail to see where he is going with this 'proof' since the same argument could be made on behalf of an 'antelope'!Although one not steeped in reverse prejudice would think that the extreme advantages that come in a western European civilization from mastering mathematics, literature and science would encourage these traits in the next generation, Jared Diamond instead informs us that, in a western European society, it is so easy to reproduce that one can reproduce no matter how low your intelligence!Since he can obviously offer no accomplishment to make his point of a higher intelligence by virtue of New Guinean race, he instead informs us that, as he judges it, the mark of intelligence is being \\"more alert, more expressive, and more interested in things and people around them then the average European or American is.\\"Perhaps he should expect a look of utter and complete BOREDOM when in the company of a European or an American.This is all so idiotic that I can barely continue to read past page 25, although if I do, my criticisms are sure to be longer than his work.

Instead of focusing on particular people and events and dates, the author takes a look at civilization as a whole.

His explanation is that such cultures either were resistant to change or preferred their own cultures limited state to the other cultures advancements. ???? For my rebuttal I defer to Mrs. Gump: &quot;Stupid is as stupid does.&quot; While the author's goal is to discount genetic differences for causation, he immediately contradicts himself saying that natives of New Guinea are genetically smarter than Europeans due to two factors: 1] In populous societies inferior intellects are able to breed diluting the racial genetic intelligence, while in small primitive societies only superior intellects breed, and 2] Westerners further diminish thinking skills by watching so much TV, while primitive societies must think constantly [p 18-20].

He demonstrates the primacy of environment to the progress of people groups and crafts a convincing case for the what might be called the &quot;right place at the right time&quot; school of cultural supremacy.Advantages such as a wide variety of domesticable plants and animals and the ease of transmission of technologies explain the rapid rise of some to meteor heights without reference to any innate superiority.The advantages bestowed by their respective geography culminated in the development of Guns, Germs and Steel by the would-be-colonizers.In short, this book weaves the bare facts of World geography into a wholesale account of the development of human societies. Mr. Diamond is fully cognizant of the political ramifications of accounting for the different development rates of people groups, thus he is careful to eschew any idea that would smack of racial superiority and reaffirm the completely contingent and external sources of such differences.Diamond, in fact, essentially assumes that racial or ethnic differences are irrelevant. He makes numerous attempts to discredit theories based upon racial difference and restricts his positive explanatory assertions to those based upon geography.The Book is a fascinating speculative account of the development of human society. It seemed to me that he was a bit too curt in dispensing other, less politically palatable, explanations for this phenomena. In so doing, he abstains from bringing the death knell down on the claim of an innate basis for racial disparities. His ultimate conclusions were hamstrung by his self-imposed political constraints that serve to hamper the compelling case that he makes in opposition. Nonetheless, the book is so ambitious and fascinating, that I was more than willing to overlook this shortcoming."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"In 1997, Jared Diamond set the academic world on fire with this seminal tract on the development of human societies. Fifteen years later, the embers from the debate he set off continue to glow. Diamond explains that the reason why the peoples of Eurasia developed complex societies first, and then conquered the rest of the world was due to their guns (weapons), germs (diseases), and steel (technology), which set them apart from all other societies. As a historical illustration, Diamond notes the dramatic events in Cajamarca, Peru, in 1532, when a handful of horse-mounted Spaniards armed with steel swords and helmets fell upon and slaughtered a large host of Incas, subduing them and eventually conquered the Americas. What gave the Europeans the advantage in guns, germs, and steel, according to Diamond was their large-scale food production. Large, populous, societies are able to create complex and centralized governments, specialized trades (including weapons making), and armies. Animal domestication also leads to endemic diseases that these societies slowly acclimate to, but are devastating when introduced to new peoples. Therefore, the origins of \\"Farmer Power\\" comprise the heart of this book. And it is \\"Biogeography\\" that determines farmer power.Farming begins with the domestication of wild plants. The region that contained the highest number of species with domesticable plants was the Fertile Crescent. Therefore, permanent villages, and later cities, what we term civilization, began in Mesopotamia. The second big advantage this region had was a high number of domesticable species of animals. Five species in particular served to aid farmers in Eurasia: Horses, cattle, sheep, pigs, and goats. These animals allowed farmers to plow land far faster than humans could on their own, thus creating ever larger food surpluses to feed growing populations. Yet these animals were not distributed evenly throughout the world. The larger landmass in Eurasia, combined with the decline of large mammals in the Americas and Australia at the end of the last ice age left Eurasia with the most species of suitable animals. The third geographic advantage of Eurasia was the east-west orientation of the landmass, which allowed farming to spread laterally to new regions. This was not possible in continents with a north-south axis, as the same plants could not grow in a different latitude and hence, climate. Therefore, large-scale farming was commonplace in Mexico and Peru, but the crops that fed the Aztecs and Incas did not suit the nearby regions, the larger landmasses in North and South America which never produced societies quite as populous. Once the peoples in Eurasia had these factors working together, they produced the most populous and complex societies in the world. Writing, technology, and centralized governments followed on the heels of large populations sustained by farmers driving ox and horse-drawn ploughs. These large populations also housed fearful diseases from their livestock, from which they themselves were at least partially immune.When this combination, large populations with writing, technology, centralized governments, and diseases was unleashed on other parts of the world, the results were devastating, particularly the diseases, which Diamond states killed 99 percent of those who were previously unexposed. Diamond details the demise of the Incas at the hands of the Spaniards, but societies all across the Americas and Australia suffered the same fates. As a result, the majority of the people who live in those regions today are descended from Eurasians.By putting together the elements of domesticable plants, animals, and east-west axes, Jared Diamond provided the answer of why civilizations arose where they did, and why Eurasian civilizations developed fastest. This is one of the greatest contributions to our understanding of human history in decades. But as well-received as this book was wining the Pulitzer Prize, it also has been a lightning rod for criticism. Geography can't be the only factor in history, critics argue. Culture must matter as well. Diamond answered such attacks in the preface to the paperback edition published one year after the original. A common argument goes that scientific inquiry was encouraged by the Judeo-Christian tradition but was stifled by Confucianism. Yet Diamond notes that Confucius China was technologically ahead of the West until about 1400. Geography trumps culture, according to Diamond. Why this so should be clear to the reader by the end of the book: Geography creates certain material realities that cannot be undone by other factors, and that shape the very broadest patterns of history. Societies cannot grow large without crops, draft animals, and the proper climate. The region of the world that favored these factors was (not surprisingly) the region of the world with the largest landmass, Eurasia. And that is why Eurasians came to dominate the globe.If imitation is the greatest form of flattery, Guns, Germs, and Steel has been flattered indeed. Whereas Diamond explained why Eurasia rules the world, he did not explain why western Eurasia in particular came to dominate. Thirteen years after Guns, Germs, and Steel, another work was published that explained the rise of Europe using a similar geographic framework that Diamond established. Ian Morris, basing his work in large part off this illustrious predecessor, explains the rise of Europe in Why the West Rules as a function of location. In doing so, he picked up where Diamond left off. The circle is now complete."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"If you have the slightest interest in the grand themes of the evolution of thinking and culture, this book is one of the intellectual touchstones you should include in your reading.

Very well written and fascinating book that looks at why different societies ended up the way they did and thus either dominated our were conquered. It rejects the racist idea that there is any difference in the capabilities or intelligence of human beings in different parts of the world and examines the different environmental factors and available resources that allowed them to progress at different rates. After reading it, I look at so many things in a different light. I especially like how Diamond turns conventional explanations around to demonstrate the fallacy of that explanations as well as wondering why history did not go in a different directions. Upon reading many of the negative reviews of this book I wonder how many of them read the whole thing (or even most of it). Most criticism they bring up are addressed in the book."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"In this thought-provoking and ambitious book, Diamond sets out to explain, in broad terms, how the current human economic, political and social world came to be the way it is. He refutes racist notions of inherent genetic superiority, pointing instead to geographical features, such as oceans, mountain ranges and the positioning of continents. The global distribution of useful plant and animal species is also crucial. This book is wonderfully entertaining, providing many a nugget of fascinating information for the curious. However, Diamond's conclusions are humbling, when one considers the way vast impersonal forces have worked together to shape human history."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"On a recent trip to Central America; I got a chance to visit the ruins from the Aztec and the Mayan civilizations. Visiting this site one is quickly reminded of the utter destruction and sins committed by the western nations. The bestial rage of the conquering rabble can be seen in each of the acts designed to eternalize the conquest. The Aztec caste has long since vanished as a dominant power; their stone blocks enigmatically; impervious to the ravages of time. The white troops sacked the already defeated city; attacking the monuments with un-brindled fury. They unified the greed for the gold that covered the walls; in perfect representations of the sun god; with sadistic pleasure of exchanging the joyful and life-giving symbols of a grieving people for the bereaved idols of the joyful people. The temples were razed to their foundations or their walls were made to serve the ascent of the churches of the new religion. At that time I was quite curious over the reasons for the disparities in the civilizations. Why? The west had an advantage and achieved glory; leaving the proud cultures of America was sidelined.The answer to the question lies in this text. The answer, almost too clear and believable, is the luck of the draw of natural resources. The Eurasian continental landmass was the winner of the biological draw in two crucial ways.1. Most domesticable crops and animals2. Largest contiguous size of similar climateHaving the larger number of domesticable species of plants and animals the Eurasians were able to over time develop their agriculture; employing the animals to undertake manual labor. Another advantage the Eurasian enjoyed were the expanse of the continent in the horizontal (east-west) direction; in comparison the Americas being aligned in the vertical (north-south) plain. This ensured similar climates for a stretched region on the (East-West) axis. The development of agriculture gave rise to concentrated population; since habitants did not have to travel for long distances in search of food. The creation of cities; economy; trade politics; philosophy and technology evolved with the concentration of people in a small area.Diamond places plenty of evidence in supporting this claim. As in the text he describes the vestiges of technology enabled the Maori invaders from New Zealand sequester the Maoriori of Chatman Island. Interestingly both had the same ancestors separated from one other for a century. Within the century the Maori tribe who had better climate; domesticated animals were able to harvest; create technology; develop methods of warfare. On the other hand the Maoriori tribe with severe climate and landscape; having no domesticated animals retained their hunter gatherer society. These limitations enabled their conquest. Further he discusses the Austronesian expansion into the Pacific, the Chinese expansion into Southeast Asia, and the Bantu expansion into sub-Saharan Africa, engulfing the pygmy and Koisan peoples. In each case the story involves a group of people who from a later point of view seem aggressive, conquering large areas of land and subjugating the previous inhabitants, if any. In each case, Diamond tries to show us that the same factors were at work: a superior set of crops and land-use techniques, leading to population growth and territorial expansion.Towards the end of the book, Diamond at last addresses an obvious question. His arguments for expecting Eurasian dominance over Africa, America, and Australasia leave us asking why Europe and not China, India, or the Middle East, has ended up dominating the world. Here his reasoning becomes less convincing. He suggests that China was too integrated, that its geographical connectedness made it too easily unified under stultifying dictatorships, whereas Europe had just the right amount of geographical fragmentation (Britain, Spain, and Italy are all walled off by mountains or seas) to keep power divided among competing regions of roughly equal strength, while allowing ideas to flow freely among them.This seems like a stretch. Taiwan, Japan and Korea are geographically separated from China, but shared with China an oriental reluctance to engage with the rest of the world. Also, these finer geographical features only become important after the development of organized states, at which point one would expect cultural factors to play some role as well. As we zoom in on specific areas in recent times, we have to abandon Diamond's large-scale scientific explanations, which discard cultural factors by averaging them out over large areas or long times. He also fails to explain how the culture and civilization which surpassed Europe's in terms of technological advancement; architecture and art till 13th century; began to be surpassed with the one from Europe."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"This book is the most captivating book on science and discovery that I have ever read.

All the food? Why have other societies been shackled with poverty? Why have some societies seemed to have been given the short end of the stick by fate? Could it be race?

It delivers a comprehensive overview of the evolution of human civilization, which no other book has been able to offer yet. Fascinating work!!"},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"I enjoyed this book because it gave me another perspective on why the world is the way it is. I've always wondered why the Western civilizations flourished, while many of the tribal societies, like those of the Americas, Africa and Austraila were defeated by Westerners. Were these people inately inferior, or did their environment have something to do with their defeat?Guns, Germs, and Steel takes the position that you do not NECESSARILY have to conclude that these people are inferior because they are defeated people. The book attempts to explain how these tribal societies' environments could account for why these people were defeated by Westerners.Despite the popular MISCONCEPTION of this book, the author does not pretend that he is presenting an iron-clad case that these people's environment HAD to have been the cause for their defeat. Like any rational scientist, he doesn't conclude that these people WEREN'T innately inferior (biologically, for example) in some way. No, he does no such thing. What he is doing is answering this question right here:If these tribal societies didn't contain inferior humans (inferior in some sort of biological, innate way), then how do you account for their &quot;backwards societies&quot; and their constant defeat by Westerners.The book concludes that there is enough information about these groups environments to make the case that these people didn't NECESSARILY have to be inferior peoples just because they were defeated. This is a subtle point that too many people missed. So in other words, according to the conclusions of this book, it would be a weak argument to conclude that these people of tribal societies HAD to be inferior because they were defeated people, and because they didn't advance in the similar way that WEstern society advanced.Oh, and unlike what the reviewer below said, the authoer NEVER said anything about the New Guini people being superior to Westerners, or for anyone for that matter. What he did do, in one little paragraph in the book, was use the commonly used argument for why these people HAD to be inferior, and show how it could be turned around for why these people HAD to be superior. He wasn't writing out an argument for why these aborignals were smarter, but instead, using the method of showing how you can lead to two contradictory conclusions using the same argument. And what was that argument? It was just the basic &quot;commen-sense&quot; approach to looking at the world, instead of the rational and empirical based approach of science. The author most likely used this little example to show why empiricism and rational thought are better methods for discovering truths than using your superficial &quot;common-sense&quot; analysis, since in this example, the &quot;common-sense&quot; analysis&quot; lead to contradictory conclusions.It amazes me how people have painted this book into a left/right category. It isn't a political book. Those that call it PC or liberal propaganda are those that tend to not be interested in finding the truth about the world around them, but instead, only interested in finding evidence to back up their own personal ideologies. Well, guys, sometimes, the world doesn't act like you want it to. Just because a book's conclusions may be well accepted in today's PC climate (which I admit, we are living in a society that has an excess amount of political correctnes), and this conclusion being that the non-Westerners aren't NECESSARILY biologically inferior to Westerners, doesn't mean that it is biased in anyway.Only the weak and shallowed minded people would conclude that because a liberal may like this book, or because its message would be one that would not be attacked by the PC elite, that this book must therefore be biased and corrupted in someway.Oh, and by the way, since when did it mean you are liberal, or brainwashed by political correctness if you happen to believe that all men were created equal?"},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"If you are interested in this book, I would strongly urge you to buy his previous book _The Third Chimpanzee_ instead. _Guns, Germs, and Steel_ is merely a book length explication of the ideas contained in one 30 page chapter of that book. Unfortunately, padding them out to 350 pages didn't add much in the way of depth or interest to the ideas. Instead, Diamond goes through and repeats the same basic points 6 or 7 times over the course of this longer work. His writing quickly grew tedious as no new ideas emerged after page 40 or so--merely more repetitive hammering home of the basic points.Not that the core idea--that local biological factors had a decisive influence on the rise of early civiliations--isn't compelling. It is a fascinating perspective. But it's ultimately not enough to carry the entire book, and Diamond really has little else to offer.

In this best-selling work, Jared Diamond attempts to answer the question of a friend from Papua New Guinea: Why did whites build and manufacture so much, but Papuans so little? The answer Diamond comes to is that much techological innovation, and the rise of the West techologically and militarily, can be traced to something man cannot control: climate, terrain and geography. The Old World was blessed with crops easier to domesticate, so it farmed and built cities while the Indians of the New World remained hunter-gatherers. Eurasia had a west-east axis, so travel and exchange of ideas and tech was easier than crossing the different temperatures and climates of the New World and Africa with their north-south axis lines. Very eye-opening look into non-Western societies around the world.As an addendum, I believe the great Victor Davis Hanson wrote Carnage and Culture as an alternative to GGS as to why the West has risen. I however, would recommend both books. I think they compliment one another well."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"In \\"Guns, Germs, and Steel\\", the author presented many interesting notions on the fates of human societies. Yet, he appeared to be uninformed in a couple of centrally important facts. Guns and Steel were not European inventions. Aside from cast iron, steel swords and weapons were already existent in China in the first century A.D. (see Jacques Gernet's \\"A History of Chinese Civilization\\", for example) Firearms and cannons, not just gunpowder, were also invented and deployed in China in the eleventh century A.D. Both of which saw their usage against the Mongols during the 1200s A.D. In fact, Genghis Khan was mortally wounded by a cannon on one of his campaigns, thus leading to his premature death, which left the eventual completion of his quest for empire to his grandson.But firearms and cannons were also adopted by the Mongols, who were the first to use these weapons in Europe during their invasions of Hungary, which probably resulted in the transfer of these technologies to Europe. So here's the interesting paradox: China had long possessed guns and steel, two of the things in the title of the book \\"Guns, Germs, and Steel.\\" Yet, they did not set upon the course of history that Europe did starting in the 1500s. Despite the omissions of facts, the author was able to offer a general explanation for the broader divergence in historical trends. He pointed to the fact that political unity in China, as opposed to political disunity in Europe, many times stifled the continuation of development because the decree of a despot could completely halt critical junctures in development in China, but similar decrees would have far lesser effects in a fragmented Europe. This notion is refreshing, but appears to be lacking in depth, since the author did not mention whether steel and firearms production was stifled in this way. And here's my important point: if these critical technological advancements were not left to rust by a Chinese despot, then Mr. Diamond's explanation seems to be insufficient. And I believe a fuller explanation of this case would have to include cultural and social factors. I think it was a regrettable failure on Mr. Diamonds part to neglect examining the stifling characteristics of Confucian culture, which have been the primary factor in limiting the ambitions of that country and its people.Another error, albeit a minor one, that I noticed was the author's reference to the \\"Greek\\" conquest of Persia and the Indus Valley in one of the last pages of the book. If he meant the exploits of Alexander the Great, then he should have known that Alexander was Macedonian, as were most of his armies. The distinction had already been well established in biographies and scholarships on the Macedonian king. At any rate, it would be no more justified to call the Macedonian conquests as Greek conquests than it would be to call the Mongol invasions of Europe as Chinese invasions."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"Mr. Diamond created a classic book for understanding the development of the human race.

It is quite enlightening."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"Jared Diamond has written a comprehensive readable book describing some of the prominent reasons that societies have failed in the past and often succumbed to invaders. It seemed well written to me and although I thought the title a little pretensious, the subject matter is good."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"Another book I wish I hadn't waited so long to read. The thesis, well-known at this point, is that it is not inherent biological or \\"racial\\" differences that account for variations in success during certain points in history, but rather the geography and climate peoples started out in. The better the conditions, the earlier the development of food production, which then leads to a population growth and more \\"developed\\" government institutions and innovations such as writing and military technology. The darker part of the thesis is that early exposure to animals leads to both the evolution of hybridized animal-human diseases (chicken pox, the bubonic plague, smallpox, etc.) and immunity to them. As Diamond notes, this is the deadliest weapon \\"civilizations\\" have in their arsenal against peoples not as far along on the food production/complex government path, as shown by the conquests of both the indigenous peoples of the Americas and Australia.Although Diamond is careful not to pass judgment or pull at heartstrings (which may be warranted in many instances), he does note that the pivotal moment in the long race for development was the extinction of many of the large mammals in Australia and the Americas. Had those animals survived and been domesticatable, the fate of the Americas in particular might have gone the other way. However, Eurasia was the continent with the most geogrpahic advantages, the most significant being the east-west axis, which goes hand in hand with similar latitudes throughout the continent. Similar latitudes, in turn, make it easier to pass crops from one end of the continent to another. That Africa and the Americas are dominated by a north-south latitude means that it is difficult to pass crops froms one end of the continents to the other.Towards the end, Diamond is careful to point out that while geography gives a head start, it is not a guarantee, and political considerations must be taken into account when trying to determine which country- or even business- will win. Throughout the book, Diamond mentions in several places that although the Americas and other regions hadn't achieved certain milestones by the time they met with the Eurasians, that didn't mean that they weren't going to if left alone. He also notes that in the indigenous cultures he's worked closely with, he's met some brilliant inventors.I thought the thesis was inherently not racist, and I'm not getting- at all- some reviewers complaints about that. In fact, at the beginning, Diamond points out reasons why the average member of the indigenous population of New Guinea is arguably more inherently intelligent than the average member of a given Western civilization: because New Guineans have a longer history of hunter-gathering, the primary killer among them is murder. Evading such a death requires more intelligence than evading death by infectious disease, which is more likely to fell a Westerner. Also, because hunting and gathering for food requires more skill and knowledge than going to a supermarket for food, survival doubly demands intelligence. Finally, most New Guineans lack the distractions Americans, Europeans and many upwardly mobile Asian countries have (television, internet, etc.) which have been shown to impede intellectual development, particularly in young children. Diamond makes that point not to prove the intellectual superiority of a certain country or \\"race\\", but to show that ultimately, it doesn't matter; no one would argue that the New Guinean legacy has been more successful through the world than the Eurasian.I thought this was one of the most thought provoking books I've ever read and I can't wait to read more from Diamond. I also thought this was written clearly enough for most people to understand and even enjoy- I found myself laughing at a few parts, although my humor may admittedly be a little bit drier than others. Regardless, this was an engrossing read that helps reframe thoughts on \\"progress\\" and \\"civilization.\\""},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"Perhaps one of the most important books I've read, Diamond asks the question: Why did some human cultures innovate and prosper, and end up colonizing the rest? Why did other cultures not develop past stone tools? Gives a scientific answer not based on race. Diamond is one smart fellow. A mature scientist. He uses everything he knows in this book. Guns, Germs & Steel is a Pulitzer Prize winner, winner of the Phi Beta Kappa Award in Science, and a National Bestseller.

It is disappointing that it lacks proper attributions in many places. The book also gets a bit repetitive and boring after a while. The key ideas should be able to be delivered in half of the current length."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"Why did western culture triumph in the struggle for world dominance? Here's your answer, clearly and boldly laid out by a far-sighted historian grounded in evolutionary biology and biogeography. Or, rather, here are the four answers, all deriving from one overarching truth: human history is a function of the environment. 1. There are significant continental differences in wild plant and large animal populations, particularly in regard to domesticability. Most of the plant species on which humans depend today originated in southwest eurasia in the region known as the Fertile Crescent. Africa south of the Sahara (and a bit of West Africa) had and has no native domestic plants or animals. Australia has none of either except the macadamia nut (domesticated by Europeans at a late date). The Americas have only a handful of native domestic plants, all low in protein, and only the llama was domesticated - and that in a limited area. 2. The geographic axes of the continents were crucial. Whereas domestic plants and animals from the Fertile Crescent could easily spread to both the Atlantic and Pacific in a contiguous climate zone, the north-south orientation of Africa and the Americas meant that agronomic innovations in one place could not easily spread to other inhabited INTRAcontinental regions. (Think of planting a tropical food crop in Canada, for example. For crops to spread from the Andes to even central Mexican highlands with a similar climate, they would have to traverse tropical rainforest regions. >From Mexico to the Southwest U.S. meant traversing a desert, etc.) 3. The geographic arrangement of the continents affected INTERcontinental movement. The oceans prevented any new eurasian cultural infusion of the Americas until 1492, and delayed its spread to Polynesia. Similarly, though North Africa benefited from Fertile Crescent agriculture the Sahara blocked movement south (making North Africa in this regard part of eurasia). When invaders arrived with their advantages of domestic food and animals they almost invariably overwhelmed every native hunter-gatherer population: the advantages of nutrition and energy afforded by agriculture were huge. 4. The advantages of the first three factors created the final factor which is population size. Agriculture permitted a population explosion wherever it took hold. It allowed the creation of specialists, leading to metallurgy, writing, empires or national governments, investment in public works including military, underwriting of expeditions, etc. Also, and critical to their success, the combination of agricultural settlement and close association with domestic animals permitted the evolution of animal-based microbes into human diseases. All the killers to which eurasians became more or less immune, and which devastated native populations elsewhere, came to us from pigs and cows (and other animals to a lesser degree). (An estimated 95 percent of Native American deaths after Columbus arrived are attributed to smallpox, flu, tuberculosis, the plague, and other hitchhikers &oacute; not guns and swords.) Jared Diamond marshals his facts, arranges them in easily understood chapters, and illustrates the whole with specific examples from biology, medicine, geography, archaeology, linguistics, and scholarly history to deliver a readable and convincing overview of how we got here and why. Excellent and recommended."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"This is an amazing book, and a lifetime of research and thinking by Mr. Diamond must have gone into creating it. Even though it is almost 500 pages in length, it concisely covers the basics of much of human history and civilization. Thankfully, Mr. Diamond puts forth the opposite of a racist interpretation of human history. It is very much taboo to suggest that genetic differences between different races resulted in one group of people conquering or dominating another, but it turns out that there are genetic differences in the brain between the populations of people in different countries of the world today. For example, different populations have differences in the composition of certain neurotransmitter receptors, that may influence such things as exploratory behavior (i.e., novelty seeking), and might something like that not influence global patterns of migration? Read C. Robert Cloninger's 'Feeling Good' for more information on dopamine receptors. Another point is that this book seems to have arrived at a time when people want to write and read 'histories of everything'. That type of book seems to be selling well right now.

It would be foolish to spend much looking at the points where his thesis may fail instead of spending more time marveling at the mighty achievement he did accomplish. Of course, taking such a large chunk of history and creating a theory to explain all of its shifts will not always be a perfect but it is wonderful to see just how much of history can be explained by his wonderfully all-encompassing ideas.With the soul of a scientist, Jared Diamond has created a wonderful synthesis to explain the development of writing, agriculture, conquest, disease and many, many other factors. Historians may balk at the largeness of such ideas, not seen Karl Marx found a convenient explanation for all human history, but it is a wonderful book to read, whether it is delighting or frustrating.It gives the reader much to think about and hopefully allows a new perspective to blossom among all of one's older, inherited ideas.

He brings scientific expertise and outside perspectives from the realms of botany, zoology, geography, and anthropology to the field of history. The theory of environmental determinism which he generally supports is nothing new, and many have elaborated on it before, but his global scope and willingness to reach back into prehistory for evidence is commendable. A very readable and important book, but with a mediocre writing style and a somewhat sloppy and unfocused structure, I don't believe it deserved the Pulitzer prize. Read it anyway if you have little background in history."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"If you read the reviews below, you'll have noticed that the reaction to this book was very polarized (I almost said &quot;black and white&quot;). Many readers enjoyed it thoroughly and found it very stimulating. A number of readers, however, savaged it in a fairly emotional tone. The readers who panned the book fall into several groups, dominated by the ones who just can't get past that off-hand comment in the introduction of the book concerning the author's conviction that his hunter-gatherer friends in New Guinea seem more intelligent on average than his friends of European descent. Lighten up. All he was saying was that he had difficulty with the thesis that agriculturally-based societies consistently trounce hunter-gather societies because of genetically determined intellectual superiority, given that hunter-gatherers have to live on their wits while in the case of members of agricultural, animal-domesticating societies, natural selection has operated more to favor immunity to the childhood diseases peculiar to those societies.So Diamond searched for another explanation, and came up with one that's consistently interesting, though obviously not foolproof: Eurasian societies happened to have access to a high-protein cereal (wheat) with a reproductive method amenable to quick and easy tinkering by humans, which grew in an area with few geographical barriers to east-west diffusion, thus avoiding the need for adaptation of the crop to the shorter or longer days of other latitudes. In the New World, in contrast, the available grain (ancestral corn) had lower protein, was more vulnerable to excessive hybridization by wild unimproved crops, and faced barriers to transmission along the predominantly North-South axis of the combined continents. Why the emphasis on cereals, a product of temperate climates, rather than the foods relied on by the original proto-humans in Africa? Cereal was critical because it was adapted to a climate with a severe dry season, which encouraged development of a plant whose survival strategy was become an annual that concentrated its food value in a rich seed that could survive a drought before resprouting, rather than a perennial that invested in permanent structure, bark, etc. This is the kind of food that permitted early humans to experiment with gathering and storing excess food. Why the emphasis on ease of diffusion? Because the author believes that cultural and technological innovation occur more quickly when large numbers of diverse, well-fed societies could experiment independently and then communicate with one another. You don't have to buy any of this, but his evidence for each proposition (and the many others in his book) certainly is worth a look.Another category of harsh critics points to the book's repetitiousness (a fair criticism) and to the popular-science approach of summarizing the work of other scientists in a Reader's Digest fashion. This may be a fair criticism, too, but unless you're terrifically well trained in a number of fields of science, do you think it is likely to bother you?Personally I'd have liked to hear more of the author's views on how to explain the dominance of the horse-mounted waves of Eurasian invaders. Clearly this book works best from the end of the last Ice Age through about 1 A.D., and for conflicts among continents rather than within each continent."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"The author presents a very compelling argument about just how humanity progressed on the various continents from 13,000 to 500 years ago. Some 60% of the book's material is of this compelling nature, and even the most skeptical readers will find themselves thinking, \\"Of course, that -has- to be true, even if it is difficult to prove.\\" I find no difficulty with his primary hypothesis, that initial resources promoted plant and animal domestication, especially in the Fertile Crescent of Eurasia, and the lack of such resources on other continents (and the various South Pacific islands) is the primary reason that development elsewhere was retarded or even halted.I have some difficulty with his secondary hypothesis, that the lack of development elsewhere had nothing to do with racial characteristics or capabilities. I do not disagree with his secondary hypothesis, but I think it very much distracts his argument for the primary one. It is this hypothesis that accounts for the author's dwelling on themes characterized by some as being \\"politically correct\\" or even \\"Marxist.\\" The author's preoccupation with these themes comprises about 10% of the book, and is where the author's arguments become the sloppiest. Some examples:1) (pp. 22-23) He argues that New Guineans seem to him smarter than typical Westerners, and offers various hypothetical explanations as to why. While his goal is, I think, to demonstrate the absurdity of the argument, he does not explicitly argue that way. Significantly, he ignores the most likely reason for his perception, a selection effect: of course, the New Guineans seem smarter as a whole, because he won't be spending his time talking with those who are not as bright. Also, he has a much stronger cultural context by which to judge the ignorance of Westerners than New Guineans.2) (pp. 64, 67, 252, 317) Europeans \\"discover\\" (always in quotes) the Americas, Hawaii, or New Guinea, but (p. 209) typhus microbes discovered (not in quotes) other means of infection. This is ubiquitous PC, but annoying nonetheless. I'm willing to concede that Columbus in 1492 was not \\"the\\" discovery of the Americas, but not that it was not really a discovery. Quotes should indicate using a word in an unconventional manner, or to actually quote someone's opinion, otherwise they are just snide. The microbes \\"discovery\\" should be in quotes, because it is not intelligent, while Columbus actually did discover something, even if he was not the first.3) (p. 199) The author writes: \\"The skin lesions caused by smallpox similarly spread microbes by direct or indirect body contact (occasionally very indirect, as when U.S. whites bent on wiping out 'belligerent' Native Americans sent them gifts of blankets previously used by smallpox patients).\\" This parenthetical comment is nonfactual, and is a kind of historical urban legend. A search engine query on \\"smallpox blankets indians\\" provides plenty of background. The grain of truth is that during the French and Indian war, British General Jeffry Amherst wrote about doing something like that, and it is unclear the extent to which it was done. There are no other documented instances. This truth differs from the author's account on several points: there was no \\"U.S.\\" yet; it was not \\"whites\\" in general; and as for \\"bent on wiping out\\" and \\"'belligerent'\\" there was a war going on. Official U.S. policy of the mid-19th century was to vaccinate Native Americans against smallpox. The problem of ubiquitous PC is that these kinds of comments can enter into scholarly work without being questioned.4) (p. 287) The author writes: \\"Large societies can function economically only if they have a redistributive economy in addition to a reciprocal economy. Goods in excess of an individual's needs must be transferred from the individual to a centralized authority, which then redistributes the goods to individuals with deficits.\\" This is one spot where the book appears to be Marxist. The author mentions elsewhere that a lot of the redistribution was from the people to the government, such as using slaves to build pyramids, yet here mentions only the ideal of helping those less well-off. Nor does he mention the role of government in providing a trustworthy medium of exchange, called \\"money,\\" that is the primary reason that a large society can function economically. Don't look to this book for a coherent economic analysis of primitive societies.Aside from the PC issues, the book has other milder problems. After hitting on several good points about how something likely came to be, he adds even more that are of questionable value and scholarship. For example (p. 129), among his arguments on why the acorn did not become a source of food is that acorns and squirrels evolved around each other, and with the squirrels still around, humans essentially had no chance to domesticate the acorn. This is a marvelous explanation, but it completely fails as a hypothesis, since it is essentially not provable. This detracts from the material because such explanations are given equal weight with others that are far more convincing.The author habitually makes 'ad hoc', and 'post hoc ergo propter hoc' arguments. In part, this is due to the material. As he mentions in the epilogue, this isn't a science like physics where one can perform experiments, but we only have the evidence of the past. We take the present as the starting point and ask how we got here, and if we are not careful with the facts, we end up with explanations that aren't explanations, but rather excuses as to why another explanation doesn't work in this particular case.In spite of these difficulties, this is a monumental work, and very much worth reading. I would advise readers to be skeptical of much of the author's reasoning, but the author's primary thesis is boldly presented, and for that core thesis my main criticisms are only nitpicks."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"It's hard to say anything new about a famous book that has been reviewed by many hundreds of people. I won't even pretend I've read all the reviews already posted, which would take hours. But of those I've browsed I have noticed a general trend which I want to counter if I can. It's probably a point that has been made before, even if it was 800 posts ago, but it bears repeating.The key to understanding Guns, Germs, and Steel isn't just a matter of realizing what Diamond argues in favor of (i.e. civil progress is an effect of favorable geography and resource dependency). The key to appreciating the book is understanding what Diamond is trying to build a case against. Many reviewers have stated that Diamond argues against racialist theories of progress, and this is true. He argues you don't need to hypothesize genetic advantages between groups in order to account for how one group may attain superiority over another. Perhaps he's right, but then this argument is not especially novel. Racism and racial theories in the human sciences have been extremely unpopular ever since the fall of colonialism and the ending of WWII. With a few exceptions, (The Bell Curve being a famous example) it's difficult to find recent scholarship in the social sciences that advocates genetic or racialist arguments for progress.What is of more interest, and what I think deserves greater scrutiny is that Diamond gives no support to ANY form of cultural argument. This is notable because cultural, social, and psychological accounts of human progress have been the heavily favored alternative to genetic arguments. Diamond tries to do away with them all. There is no need for Max Weber's Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism (where America's early religious ethics produce a culture that places an exaggerated premium on work and progress). Diamond's thinking also negates Hegel or any philosophy of history that places importance on singular great individuals who raise, shape, and change the direction of civilizations. Indeed, Hegel, Nietzsche, Marx, Mill, Freud, Darwin and a great many other theorists must be put aside with regard to human progress. What we are left with is a world where human variables matter only on the micro level; not on the macro level. The desire and nature to advance is taken as a constant. It is the natural environment that determines the outcome, and survival of the fittest isn't the issue.I think Diamond makes an excellent case, though hardly flawless, providing a plausible account of how groups could have advanced without regard to their genes, their creeds, or great leaders. You might question why you would want to strip groups of their identity and variability, since in essence Diamond is arguing that one group is as good as the next--all are equally capable. My reading of it is that he takes this approach to avoid the general fogginess that comes from cultural/sociological approaches. In Diamond's theoretical outlook, you need not perform a tribal ethnography to learn why North American Indians weren't prepared for a European invasion. All you really need is to understand the low number of founder crops naturally available to them, the lack of domesticateable work animals, and their comparable isolation geographically.Many reviewers have argued that Diamond ignores human variables. But that is the very point of the book! I agree that Diamond's theory is extremely reductive and he never conclusively makes the case for why it is impossible that cultural factors influence technological advances. What's more, Diamond's more recent book Collapse proposes just the reverse, asserting that societies and groups often choose and pursue the very actions that lead to their destruction. (For example, the natives of Easter Island misguidedly cut down all the trees on their island, ultimately leading to a famine that devastates the population). Together the two books suggest we live in a world where civilizations grow and progress based on environmental circumstances, while on the other hand they fail and collapse based chiefly on their own ineptitude.A last point: when you're talking about a book of this status, you don't necessarily read it because it is essentially correct or even that you believe it to be true. You read it because it provides the best and clearest example of a particularly kind of argument. In this case, its hard to think of another book that lays out the anti-genetic, anti-cultural account of civilization more clearly and successfully than Guns, Germs, and Steel. As philosopher Mortimer Adler used to say, great books are not repositories of truth. You read them to hone your critical thinking, as it's only through critical thought that you can get to any truth whatsoever. You don't need to agree with Diamond to get some value from his book; Guns, Germs, and Steel happens to be an excellent place to exercise your mind.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"It is almost unnecessary, at this point, for me to review Guns, Germs & Steel by Jared Diamond. Diamond is a respected scientist and author, the book has already won a Pulitzer, and numerous helpful reviews are already available on this site. However, it is interesting that there have also been a number of negative reviews, especially from those with an anthropology agenda. My review is addressed to those budding anthropologists out there that might be persuaded by some of the reviews on this site not to read this book.As I hope most practitioners are aware, anthropology is a discipline divided. There are those that approach the study of human history and cultures as a science, and there are those that study anthropology as a humanity. Diamond, an ecologist, only knows how to be a scientist. A scientist seeks the basic principles (i.e., processes) operating to produce a pattern. An hypothesis is made of the effect of a dependent variable upon an independent variable, and controlled experiments are run to test that hypothesis and its alternatives. As explained by the author, this is difficult when studying historical processes but not impossible. We must rely on natural experiments. For example, one can make the hypothesis that the direction of the axis of a continent had no effect, historically, on the dispersal of technology, especially regarding food production (the status quo, or null hypothesis, in this case). One can now compare the dispersal rate for Eurasia (East-West axis) to those for the Americas and Africa (N-S axis). From the available data, the null hypothesis is not supported, and it would seem that an E-W axis facilitated the dispersion of farming practices better than a N-S axis. Though the difference is subtle, the (superficially) described scientific approach is not the same as observing a pattern and then concocting a process scenario that fits. The latter approach is often more satisfying to non-scientists as it relies upon unambiguous authority: \\"The answer is THIS because SOMEONE who knows said so.\\"That being said, Diamond does present his conclusions as \\"facts.\\" This is a popular book, after all, not a scientific article. I would expect that as evidence contrary to his hypothesis becomes available, Dr. Diamond will modify his present conclusions -- perhaps even abandon them outright. That is the nature of science, and one must be willing to accept that the best answer today, giving the data, may not be the best tomorrow. The best that we can do in any historical science is hypothesize that repeated patterns are the result of a common process. I found the arguments presented in Guns, Germs & Steel to be well-reasoned and consistent with the data presented. It took a skilled researcher and thinker like Jared Diamond to pull all this together, but his authority shouldn't matter a bit. Read it and think about the evolution of human societies for yourself.Some of the reviewers have complained of a \\"liberal\\" agenda. Apparently, they subscribe to the hypothesis that certain races, because of intrinsic factors beyond skin color, facial features, etc., are/were better suited that others to develop civilization as we know it. Possibly. However, Diamond, through his analyses, demonstrated that extrinsic factors are sufficient to explain the observed differences in cultural development seen in societies around the world. While race may be a factor (are there any data?), it isn't a necessary one.The claim has also been made that the ideas presented by Diamond are not completely original -- not that he plagiarized other authors, only that these ideas have been around for a while. That is always the nature of popular scientific literature; Guns, Germs & Steel won a Pulitzer, not a Nobel Prize. It is a well-written and entertaining discussion of those ideas about human cultural evolution. The cutting-edge seldom makes it to best-seller lists, or paperback for that matter.The main criticism that I had of Guns, Germs & Steel was that is very repetitive. However, based upon some readers' reactions to the book, I can now see why Diamond had to beat his points into the ground. The historical processes behind human cultural evolution proposed are simple, but they are apparently controversial."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"Overall, Mr. Diamond offers an interesting and compelling argument as to why different societies and cultures developped differently. His argument was clear, and the book made for easy reading. For people who have little knowledge of this subject and who, in light of recent attention to the matter (e.g. The Bell Curve, Origins of Race), want to learn more, this book would be a good starting place. My only reservation in recommending this book is that it is not a book for an advanced student. Having good basic knowledge of history and anthropology, I found much of the book to be too elementary and very repetitive. My mother, however, who had little knowledge of the subject, loved the book. My basic recommendation: if you don't know much about the development of human races and cultures, this book provides an easy-to-understand introduction to the subject. If, however, you are looking for a ground-breaking, paradigm-shifting scientific tract, this is probably not the book for you."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"This book is well worth reading. Its author, Jared Diamond, is what in my day was called a \`cultural geographer', that is he is student of how the geo-physical environment effects the development of human society and its culture. In this book he attempts the heroic task of explaining the phenomenon of European world dominance from the 16th Century through most of the 20th Century in terms of geography and climate.Does he succeed? Well yes and no. In point of fact, as he himself admits, the geo-physical environment cannot completely explain the evolution of human societies which is much too complex to be explained so simply. What Diamond does do very well is explain the effect of geography and climate on food production, animal husbandry and cultural diffusion (i.e. the spread of agricultural techniques and technology in general). In the course of doing so he discusses such interesting phenomena as the role of population densities on technical development and disease resistance. His basic thesis is that Europe (and by extension North America, Australia and New Zealand) became dominant because of a geo-physical environment highly suitable to food production and that Europe's population density and cultural diversity created a breeding ground for both diseases (and disease resistance) and technological innovation. More controversially, he maintains that China's backwardness until the late 20th Century is entirely attributable to its monolithic culture and, expect for short intervals, its unified political system.I have one caveat for readers of this book. It does not provide a fact filled, irrefutable proof that human history can be explained entirely in terms of geography and climate. Diamond, I am certain, would be dismayed if anyone thought so. It does provide the engaged reader with a fascinating and plausible theory of how geography played one of the key roles in the evolution of human society"},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"This is far from a definitive theory of history or anything else and the author's sometime provincial sounding observations in certain areas --they're smart in New Guinea, the tribesmen have no TV!--while provocative, are suspect.But this is a powerful cross-disciplinary look seeking insights applying the tools of one fileld of study to another. There is an array of hard-to-find but enlightening facts that younger readers will especially find valuable. Others will note that some of his original ideas were in fact widely discussed by science-fiction writers a few decades ago and assumed in many college courses in the '70's.There is a need for more efforts such as this one. The book is fascinating, raises intriguing questions on the various inter-relations of different systems, and is fun to read."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"With so many reviews, it hardly seems necessary to give a synopsis of this book. I will reiterate a common compliant, it is a bit too long because some items are rehashed. It doesn't take into account (or give enough value to) some things, culture and religion being among them, and there seems to be some items that are missing and some contradictory.That being said, I really did enjoy reading this book, it is for the most part well written and well thought out and it tackles a very big and compelling question. I will state my beliefs here, only because they provide a lens for me, and that lens colors how I see the world. I am a believing Christian, one that takes for granted that God created the world, not necessarily as it is, but as it once was. I state that because, upon reflection, I think of Mark Twains' 'Letter's From Earth', and the bit there where he chastises God for creating such wonders as the tsetse fly and ring worm.I think that Diamonds explanation of how some dreadful diseases jumped from animal to man, either because of ignorance in husbandry practices, lack of cleanliness or by sexual contact explains how perhaps there can be harmony in the belief that God did create a good world, but that over time it was indeed corrupted.I also bring up the subject of my beliefs to simply say that is is a very scholarly work and well received by myself, even though, it seems, my beliefs may be at odds with any researcher or writer that places belief in evolution and natural systems as the only answer to questions that we all have inside.I found the discussion in this book where it relates to animals, mammals in particular, to be very interesting. I never before had reflected upon the fact that even though zebras seem to be much like a horse, the fact that they cannot be domesticated and humans were well into modern history before parts of Africa saw a horse had a huge impact upon history.Having lived in Hawaii, I knew that the introduction of disease wiped out vast numbers of natives after the arrival of Europeans, but Diamond explains in detail how and why these diseases cultivated themselves in human populations and why the natives all over the New World were totally unprepared for the arrival of them.There is a big deal of writing on the axis of continents and how that had a huge effect upon the development of cities and large populations. Diamond perhaps goes over this part of his theory too much, and may put too much emphasis upon it, but the study of the effects that it had upon crops and the jump from hunter gathers to tribes to cities still makes a good and interesting read even if a bit labored.All said and done, this is a good book. It is highly readable, which for a science/history/text book type of work is a very good thing. I highly recommend it to anyone interested in it's driving question, \\"why did some people (in the world) end up with all the cargo?\\"."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"For an amateur evolutionary anthropologist I found the book a fascinating, multi-faceted, and generally readable story of the evolution of civilization since the last ice age. Diamond takes us from nomadic hunter-gatherers who were fortunately situated by climate and geography to find domesticated plants and animals to the birth of fixed farming communities. The latter needed organization, bureaucracy, political systems, and language, as well as an army to defend their territory and expand into neighboring ones. He demonstrates which of the wild plants were most readily domesticated (wheat, barley, millet, sorghum) and which animals contributed to the protein diet and transportation (sheep, goats, cows, pigs, horses,dogs). He also makes logical arguments as to why other animals were not domesticable. Interestingly, most of the domesticated animals are herbivores. Because of the roughly 10% efficiency of conversion of food (either meat or vegetation) to weight, the carnivores must consume 10 times their weight in their prey of herbivores, which must therefore consume 10 times their weight in vegetation; it is thus much more efficient for man to eliminate carnivores - the middle man - as their primary diet. Of course, most of the carnivores are also more dangerous and not easily captured. But this is a sidebar to the story. With this as a point of departure, Diamond traces the evolution and trajectories of societies around the world - starting with the Fertile Crescent in the middle east about 12000 B.C. - in a suitable climate (much later decayed to deserts by deforestation and overgrazing). And progressing first to Austronasian, (China) to Polynesia, New Guinea, and Australia and somewhat later to Greece and western Europe. The diffusion of farming, animals, language, and technology (including the wheel), moved readily in both directions across the Euro-Asian continents - which extends east-west without many ecological or geographical barriers. This compares to the slow diffusion of corresponding features in the western hemisphere where plants and animals (llama and alpaca in South America) never made it across the vast climatic and geographical barriers into North America. It is surprising that corn domesticated in Mexico took a few millenia to make it to native Americans in eastern U.S. And the wheel - used on Mexican toys - took several millennia to develop in the western hemisphere much after they had become operating transportation systems in the middle east. With the development of ocean going ships (which had been abandoned by the Chinese for political reasons) we approach recorded history - with the Norse arrivals in Greenland (which did not last), and the Spanish conquests of the Incas in Peru (with a few hundred horse-mounted troops with weapons), and the Aztecs in Mexico. Having brought \\"civilization\\" to the new world, they then devastated the natives with weapons and disease. Diamond presents this \\"history\\" as hypotheses in need of further elaboration rather than as dogma. The story is made more fascinating by the anthropological tools (carbon dating), the garbage left by primitive tribes and communities, pottery, language, and technology, which make sense of the geographical dispersion of peoples and their cultural evolution. Diamond's book is repetitive and plodding in places, but the reader will be well rewarded by pursuing this fascinating story, which ends with a question as to what the future holds for civilization."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"Jared Diamond's work may be the most important contribution to the understanding of human history since Rousseau's DISCOURSE OF THE ORIGIN OF INEQUALITY (1755) forced philosophers to question the assumption that civilization was &quot;naturally&quot; superior to pre-literate (&quot;savage&quot;) society. Diamond has had the courage to raise the essential questions about the psychic unity of our species, the origins of political institutions, and the shape of modern history. In so doing, his analysis reflects the explosion of knowledge in evolutionary biology over the last decade while integrating research cutting across many fields in the social sciences and humanities. Although some specialists have quibbled about details (professors are territorial animals), Diamond's basic question -- why did Europe conquer the New World, Africa and Asia -- cannot be addressed without something like his broad view. Given the absurd stereotype of biology as genetic determinism, it is particularly fascinating to see how biogeography takes on an essential role in the explanation of cultural differences and historical sequences. No longer can serious analyses of Western global hegemony ignore the argument that it is due to such factors as the timing of hominid settlement in various continents, their orientation and scale, and the diversity of their fauna and fauna suited for domestication. Diamond's complex analysis of the origins (and frequent collapse) of political institutions challenges the simplistic formulas that dominate most social science today. If you are seriously interested in understanding human nature, history and politics, this book is not to be missed. Despite all the publicity it has received, few of my colleagues seem to have read -- or even know about -- Diamond's important and thought-provoking book. If you are seriously interested in understanding human nature, history and politics, GUNS, GERMS AND STEEL is not to be missed. Roger D.

Here in the U.S., schools are still teaching watered-down versions (at best) and fiction (at worst) as historical fact.Gun, Germs and Steel puts the real history of the world into a manageable presentation, and is honest about being imperfect and generalizing facts in order to sweep through broad subjects. Its explanations are based on factual discoveries that have been verified by scientific communities many times over.The subject matter is so vast and informative that it literally changed the way I look at and think about people in the world we live in. My only regret is that the author just barely begins to call out the frauds of how religion and government are intertwined in their assumptions of state power. Most commendable is Diamond's attention to many examples of the frauds of racism and the distracting rationalizations for humanity's most natural and favorite past time: war."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"I thought this was one of the most interesting books I've read in a long time. Jared Diamond does an absolutely amazing job and goes into great detail to explaining the progress of mankind and how much geography played in shaping our world today. I would have to say that was the most profound piece of information for me - the impact of geography. I had always thought the study of geography was just maps and globes but Mr. Diamond shows us just how important location can be in the development of civilizations.

He sets out to figure out why the Europeans were able to succeed not only in their enviornment, but control throughout the world.Geography is something Diamond finds as a major factor. Geographic luck was able to determine that type of crops, and the conditions.Diamond concludes that once the societies discovered how to produce enough food for themselves, then some of the other citizens were able to use their free time to advance other areas. This created specialists which resulted in the innovations of Guns and Steel. The germ advantage was because the Europeans lived with pigs.Domestic animals (Diamond finds 14 thorughout history) most of them centered in Europe gave the major advantage against disease.Diamond's Guns, Germs, and Steel is an outstanding and interesting book to read."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"Reading this book I wasn't able to buy into his arguments. Too many sweeping generalizations and too many factual errors in the text. For example, when talking about bananas he writes about early man selecting for smaller and smaller seeds until there weren't any more. Modern seedless bananas are that way because they are triploid and sterile. This is something that has happened fairly recently, probably within the last couple of hundred years. Sloppy terminology, factual errors and the sweeping generalizations ruined this book for me."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"According to the author, he was asked by a native Papua New Guinean why they do not have as much cargo as the white man. By that he meant as many goods. The author spent several years trying to answer this question. According to him, it's all about Geography, and not biology. It is not that the white men are smarter than the native Indians in the New Worlds. \\"History followed different courses for different peoples because of differences among peoples' environments, not because of biological differences among peoples themselves.\\"Civilization started from the Fertile Crescent, the area north of the Middle East, today Lebanon and Syria, because ample food was present, the soil was fertile, and there were a variety of animals to domesticate. This allowed people to live together in larger communities, which in turn made innovation richer (more minds to solve a problem or invent a solution), and more people free to pursue other careers. The people of the Fertile Crescent later moved to Egypt, and into Europe. The Geography of Europe allowed this new civilization to reach them. Europe also had animals it could domesticate, giving food, and thus bigger societies. In Papua New Guinea, on the other hand, the island did not have animals to domesticate, and food was scarce. This forced the Papua New Guinean to live in smaller communities (since large communities cannot be fed). Smaller communities meant less people thus less brain power. This also meant no people were free to pursue other careers than hunting and gathering food. In larger societies, people were free to pursue those other careers which allowed them to discover steel, which led to guns, and eventually the domination of the world.The large societies created from the Fertile Crescent meant more domesticated animals to provide food (meat, eggs, and milk), transportation (horses) and work (animals working the fields). This meant closer contact between humans and animals. This is what eventually caused the big outbreaks of diseases, such as smallpox, that killed millions of people (according to the author, most if not all major outbreaks came from domesticated animals). However, the Europeans eventually built immunity to such diseases. When they reached the New Worlds (The Americas and Australia), the natives there, living in small communities because of lack of domesticated animals, were not immune to such diseases as the smallpox and influenza. These diseases, it is estimated by some, wiped out 90% of the American natives. Guns killed the rest.So the central thesis of the book is this: Europeans came to dominate the world due to their favorable geographic position. Europeans had the benefits of highly fertile land and animals that could be domesticated, while the native peoples of Africa, the Pacific and the Americas did not have these assets. As a result, Europeans had a \\"head start\\" in the development of their civilization. If the natives tribes of the New Worlds had lived in Europe, says Diamond, it would be they, not Europeans, who would dominate the world today. This book makes the point that geography is what made the Europeans the superior race.However, not all historians and scholars agree with Jared Diamond. Checking the reviews on Amazon.com, I found many readers giving a one star rating. One reviewer stated, \\"The native Indians of North America lived over land that is very fertile, and yet, despite their favorable geography, did not progress as European nations did.\\"Another reviewer writes, \\"He expects his ignorant readers to assume that sub-Saharan Africa had no domestic table animals and plants, something that almost made me fall out of my chair with laughter. Sub-Saharan Africans live in the richest area of the planet, from minerals to fauna! The entire region is teaming with multitudes of plants and animals that would be easily domesticated: sorghum, millet, yams, and rice; guinea fowl, elephants, buffalo, giraffes, zebras, and wildebeests.\\"Another reviewer writes, \\"On p. 92, he states that: \\"the availability of domestic plants and animals ultimately explains why empires, literacy, and steel weapons developed earliest in Eurasia and later, or not at all, on other continents.\\" That statement is false, since written records of the Ancient Egyptian (African) language have been dated from about 3200 BC, making it the oldest and longest documented language. The Sumerian language, as Diamond claims is the oldest language, developed around 3000 BC.One reviewer writes, \\"What Jared has missed is natural selection... that 5,000 years of living in a more complex social environment has meant that the Europeans advanced genetically as their environment advanced. The Europeans who survived, were the more intelligent, the more social, more politically Machiavellian and the more immune ones.\\"Another reviewer writes, \\"One hundred years of research has established that East Asians and Europeans average higher IQs than do Africans. East Asians, measured in North America and in Pacific Rim countries, typically average IQs in the range of 101 to 111. Caucasoid populations in North America, Europe, and Australasia typically average IQs from 85 to 115 with an overall mean of 100. African populations living south of the Sahara, in North America, in the Caribbean, and in Britain typically have mean IQs from 70 to 90... The National Collaborative Prenatal Project on 53,000 children by Sarah Broman and her colleagues showed that head perimeter at birth significantly predicts head perimeter at 7 years - and head perimeter at seven years predicts IQ. It also shows that Asian children average a larger head perimeter at birth than do White children who average a larger head perimeter than do Black children.\\" This reader is suggesting that it is biology, and not geography, that determines the superiority of a race.One reviewer writes, \\"He dismisses the work of the psychometricians whose data, in spite of the taboos of our current state, reveal in hundreds of studies that people's intelligence vary by racial group. He throws out this data, incredibly, based on his own assessments of personal experience with different peoples. In fact, he baldly states his belief that Stone Age peoples such as New Guineans are actually on average more intelligent than white Europeans.\\"Another reviewer writes, \\"Civilizations are built on intelligence, and where intelligence is not then, perforce, civilizations do not grow. People may be reluctant to swallow that bitter truth.\\"One reader asks why are so called third World countries, like Middle Eastern countries, so much behind today? They are rich countries, with big cities, lots of food and domesticated animals, yet behind in all the sciences. According to this reader, it is the freedom given by the European nations to its people that made them superior to other races.Finally, one reviewer states, \\"If east-west trade routes and available plant and animal life were all there were to it, why then civilization should have risen in Europe a billion years earlier!\\"This book is a fascinating read and very convincing. Also watch the DVD documentary based on this book."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"This book absolutely deserves the New York times bestseller rating, as well the the Pulitzer prize that it won.

It is lucid and, for the most part, fascinating.The premise is fairly straightforward: the more surplus food a society has the more time it has to develop technology and complex culture. The more productive and easier to domestic plants and animals orginated in and spread from the Fertile Crescent west to Europe and North Africa and east to China. Read the book to find out why these plants and animals could spread east and west and could not be spread far north and south and why the earliest civilizations were the first to collapse.Contrary to what you might read or infer, the book is about as political as mail delivery. Even so, it has been a serious disappointment to white racists who still need to believe in the myth of white supremacy in its many guises, academic and otherwise.The title of the book is a bit misleading. By the time the guns, germs and steel arise as factors in the rise of Europe, the Europeans are well on the way to developing the tools they will use to colonize the world. The divisions of labor made possible by surplus food supplies are already developed. This is but one of the many reasons you should read the book to get the details and the big picture.The premise of this book, if not the work itself, is as important as the concept that all humans have basic inalienable rights. Let us hope that both concepts spread quickly before it is too late."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"Jared Diamond is the most refreshing intellectual shower I have received during the last ten years.I would describe Diamond as a neo-renaissance man with a lateral view that spans history, evolutionary physiology and science communication. Furthermore he manages to summarize world history into a SINGLE albeit long essay (this book). On top of that he embarrasses history experts by having written one of the most outstanding historical analyses of the last decades.My superlatives seem to be justified when reading supportive comments by giants such as Edward Wilson or Paul Ehrlich...Diamond can be considered an evolutionary biologist. In that category, he completes the queue ranging from Ernst Mayr to Stephen Jay Gould. His impact on non-scientists rivals that of Richard Dawkins.I would suggest that \\"Guns, Germs, and Steel\\" becomes the compulsary 101 history course for all graduate education; worldwide. Tell Unesco that.But most important of all is the underlying statement that science - once again- comes to the rescue in the heated public debate on prejudice over cultural identity and increasing racist attitudes. Only using one basic science tool, namely, objective analysis, Diamond unveils the reason why, say, Europeans are what they are today and all of the might of the Inca's couldn't possibly have taken over Africa.Professor Diamond. Thank you for the insight!Karel Ameye"},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"I thought that this book really put a spin on the way that I viewed the world. I was willing to accept the ideal of evolution but it never made so much sense to me until I read this book. The ideas behind how societies developed really surprised me. I did not expect it to be based so much on food production and animal domestication. The thing that surprised me most about this book was that before the Europeans arrived there were no horses in America. Finding out how people progress because of East West alignment as opposed to North South alignment made perfect sense to me. I never knew how many people were killed off with the germs from other societies. I was surprised by how many people were in the Americas and were killed off in order for the most immune race to survive.I got a little dull near the end when he was talking about the New Guenea stuff but besides that it was an interesting read."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"I do not have a degree in history but have always been interested in discovering the past.

I never felt left behind by the author and was intrigued by the expanding case for environment as the driving cause of conquest and the make up of our modern world.A joy to read, it is enlightening and well laid out.

That was right after he ridiculed and condemned as a racist anyone who suggests there might be intellectual differences between racial groups. Incredible. Poorly written, repetitive and unoriginal.

Many of the ideas in this book can be found elsewhere but I have not found any other single work that manages to combine history, biology, linguistics, geology, paleontology and anthropology into a unified argument that provides such a useful paradigm for studying the unequal outcomes of world history. Whatever your own beliefs and opinions and however much you might disagree with Diamond's particular arguments, you can't help but learn from this book (ever heard of glottochronology?). All in all, an impressive and thought-provoking work."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"Diamond's thesis is that it was geographical determinsm that was responsible for the dominance of the West, and that cultural factors- individualism, capitalism and so forth- were only of short term importance. He does have interesting answers for every exception to his rule, and indeed, he builds a compelling story to explain every culture and its success or failure.But none of these stories are universals, and none is applicable outside the region in question. Each of Diamond's stories amounts to what we might call a &quot;Just So&quot; story, after Kipling's tales by the same name. Building backwards from the outcome, Diamond can justify the special cases in each instance, but his universals all fail. For instance, China didn't attain the power of the west because it unified too soon, and this happend becasue it lacked the peninsulas and mountain ranges that isolated communities in Europe, allowing for greater development of different experiments in societal structure. This &quot;Island Geography&quot; approach is attractive and it echos a common thread in biodiversity, but it certainly doesn't explain the dominance of North America today- or the difference between North and South America.One problem with Diamond's thesis is that he's inconsistent. Sometimes it's the shortage of natural resources that triggers advancement of technology, and sometimes that same shortage impairs it. Having a lot of natural resources is similarly invoked to explain success and failure.A more serious problem is that Diamond has taken one brief snapshot in time- the world since the 19th Century- and has taken that as the absolute measure of the success or failure of a society and a geography. But a few centuries ago it was the world oif the East that was predominant, and indeed the Arabic world came very close to completely conquering Europe. Had Diamond written his book then, he would have needed to justify his thesis with arguments opposite from those he presents. And perhaps in another few centuries things will have reversed once more. Given all that, I find his argument singularly unconvincing"},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"The western colonising pioneers have left a legacy of racial bias to their descendants. Wherever white folk have taken civilisation to the savage native populations the indigenous peoples have suffered destruction of their own cultures (which were invisible to the colonizers or regarded as proof of the natives' savagery)and racial vilification. The superiority of western culture, as perceived by Europeans, has been taken as proof of the superiority of Europeans themselves and the inferiority of the colonised peoples. Surely, the arguement goes, if they had been as intelligent, hard-working, creative or favored by God as the Europeans, they would have developed advanced cultures as the Europeans have done.Diamond's book is a brilliant riposte to that racist arguement. He shows how domesticatible plants and animals were the key factor in the development of farming allowing the abandonment of a hunter and gatherer existence. He shows that the so-called inferior cultures lacked those resources. He shows that the development of farming allowed specialisation in production, the development of an army and resistence to disease through close contact with farm animals which are the ultimate source of most human infections. He shows that colonising forces were able to subdue indigenous populations by infecting them and carving them up with their superior weapons.Once again science demonstrates the folly of racial supremacy theory. Good on you, Jared!"},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"Jared Diamond is plagued by the same politically correct Euro-centric bias that refuses to look beyond his European and Jewish worldview that everything started from Eden. He is happily ignorant of the political history, influence and achievements of ancient Indian, Persian, Indo-Chinese, Chinese and American civilizations. He is a brilliant man with a great logically sound yet incomplete and misleading story. He simply overstates the accomplishments of the fertile crescent and Europe and the geographical challenges in Africa. The civilizations of Angkor succeeded in some of the most densest jungles of Asia. The Incas independently built a civilization more advanced than any in Europe at heights of 12,000 feet above sea level. The torrid and humid whether of India has always favored malaria. While geography, technology and germs are significant, human ingenuity, luck, geo-political realities and immunity from \\"guns\\", barbarism, plunder and invasion are factors that determine the success and development of a civilization far more.India, China, Egypt and Persia were all technologically superior to Europe until the 19th century. They fell to the colonial powers purely because of political reasons. No germs, guns, or steel! There was a long bloody civil war in Peru between Atahualpa and his brother Huascar prior to the arrival of the conquistadores. Had the spaniards arrived in Peru 50 years earlier they would have been decimated. In reality, Europe acquired all their cargo only in the last 2 centuries, for most of the last 5000 years, the people with the best cargo have been the Indians, Chinese, Persians and Peruvians. And now in the 21st century, the cargo is going back to Asia! I wonder what relevance this book would have in 2 centuries from today. Neither Germs, Guns or Steel mattered in Alexander's conquest of Persia, Arab conquest of Persia or Mongol conquests by Genghis Khan. Ambition, economics and opportunism may be intangibles hard for scientists like Jared Diamond to grasp but they are all too real!Peru's latitude is closer to Sub Saharan Africa than the temperate regions of Europe. The Peruvians took great pains to adapt their varieties of corn and potatoes across different altitudes in effect producing 1000s of varieties by the ingenuity of their terrace cultivation techniques. The north-south longitudinal theory of agriculture is just pure drivel. The simple truth is that some civilizations try and develop despite difficult geographical constraints while others just don't.By just taking the example of Peru and India, one can repudiate every theory by Jared Diamond.Also, I find it hard to believe that the Chinese script evolved from Cuneiform. The script of the Indus Valley remains undeciphered.Such a book if made required reading in school can bias children early on into believing a myopic, distorted over-simplification of history. The book has little new to offer other than a catchy Hollywood title. Jared diamond is willfully very naive in his analysis. The large number of positive reviews makes me wonder how easily people take information on face value when they hear something from a \\"well educated intellectual\\". Jared Diamond seems to have come up with a theory and done extensive research to collect evidence for it. If he did his research first and then came up with a theory the Book would perhaps been called - Politics, Economics and Ambition - a much more mundane title, but an honest one."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"I listened to the audiobook version in my car and I enjoyed it so much that I often found myself sitting in the parking lot of my destination listening for ten more minutes.Diamond has a way of analyzing history that is both thorough and ingenious.

With such a head start, why didn't Africa take the next step? Why didn't they develop steel, guns, advanced navigation, etc. Why are MOST of the names we rattle off (Newton, Einstein, Copernicus, Caesar, etc.) as the most amazing people in history of some type of European origin? Why didn't the Mayans, Incas, Aztecs, or Aboriginies take the steps that Europe took? What happenend? Why did they stop?Again, VERY interesting book actually based on science that provides a logical answer to some of these questions, and like ANY good scientist, Diamond admits, IMMEDIATELY, that there is NO definite answer to this question, but this is what the data suggest.Highly recommed this if you are ready to think about why the world is the way it is. Forget the obvious things you know. ANY army with guns will eventually beat ANY army that only has clubs...forget that, but try to think about WHY did Spain have guns & the Incas didn't.

He goes beyond all cultural cliches, norms and prejudices and draws the big picture relying on numerous branches of science and evidence alone. It really is a big picture, story of our civilizations, expertly and efficiently stuffed into less than 500 pages.It is just fascinating. The conquest and inhabitation of huge spans of our globe by people who had such &quot;primitive&quot; technology, especially the story of Madagascar was just incredible.Note that, he was directly involved with only some of the related research, he has mostly gathered and analyzed the works of many who had already done excellent research in the area. His writing is very readable, enjoyable and also friendly. His logic and reasoning are solid. It is just amusing, scanning through some of the commentary below, how many people got it so wrong.It is quite ironic that he has employed the very &quot;Western&quot; science and technology to reach to the inevitable conclusions that have come under attack by the staunch &quot;guardians&quot; of the Western &quot;castle&quot;.

The writing is dazzling, the thinking incisive, well, perhaps a tad less incisive the closer it gets to the modern world. Diamond notwithstanding, culture does matter. The more complex civilization has become, the more culture seems to matter. Also forms of government, of course. Bad or authoritarian government can drive a prosperous nation into backwardness (look at how Hungary, once an industrial powerhouse, sank once it was locked behind the Iron Curtain) and certainly it is difficult to turn to any explanation other than culture for explaining, say, the different trajectories of varying ethnic groups after emigration to the United States. Fortunately, we are not without books on this subject that are as good as what Diamond gives us on the neolithic revolution and its consequences.

Is the author trying to tell us that some of our assumptions concerning the rise of cultural norms are over simplified? If so, he might have done so more forcefully with fewer words, more carefully selected facts, and perhaps a more lucid writing style. Do some societies prevail because their native tongue is more efficient and expressive than those employed by other cultures? Following that theme might have made for a more intriguing book. Are there some determinisms at work in every culture which inhibit the fulfillment of its destiny? Maybe the author thinks so, but the massive brush used to paint such a scenario causes the entire work to shimmy through a mass of frequently fascinating material without conclusions. The book's excessive length detracts from its compelling points: we live, some of the time, at the mercy of gigantic forces we do not control. Do genetics control our formation, or climate, or enormous economic systems? And who can give us convincing answers? Anthropologists, sociologists, and psychologists of course come to mind. But what of poets, seers, artists, and theologians? Maybe Jared Diamond knows, but by the time he finishes inundating us with facts, some slightly pretentious, it's hard to tell for sure. I had hoped this book's scope and claim would give convincing guidance. But because it lacks definite focus, it did not."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"Bear in mind that this work is but one opinion, and that Diamond is, at heart, a scientist and currently professor of geography. He is, at best, biased. But this work is still very important, and as it is an easy read, though sometimes repetitive, it is eye-opening and kept me interested all 500 pages.I write this review mainly to dissolve some of the negative reviews I have seen posted... but if you're even considering buying or reading this book, do not let those incredulous commenters steer you away.I give it 5 stars for all of the reasons so many others have."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"A brilliant book for whoever is interested in human history. Jared Diamond's focus is on the last 13 thousand years or so, from the last Ice age up to now. His aim is to compress so much in a readable book, distilling the main driving forces in human history. According to Diamond's thesis (and others before him) if you re-run the movie of the last 13000 years over and over, you would end up most of the times with similar dynamics (of course, chaos theories would anticipate some twists every time you run such improbable experiments). The main driving forces in human history in such large time span are: the diverse potential availability of wild crops and animals apt to domestication in the five continents gave a head start to peoples living in privileged \\"real estates\\"; the orientation of continental axis (North-South vs. East-West) and the presence of physical barriers within continents accelerated or hindered the diffusion and transfer of knowledge, culture and ideas; the population size and the related competition for space and resources promoted better organizations (the hydraulic theory of states) and creative ways for survival and expansion (a sort of \\"grow or die\\" theory). The book is successful in introducing (or making popular) crop and soil science in world history. Definitively a must read, before approaching the more technical \\"The History and Geography of Human Genes\\" by Cavalli-Sforza, Menozzi and Piazza. Of course, other factors played a relevant role in history, and those factors have changed over the arc of time of your study. For instance, in the last 3000 years, in the West, Greco-Roman civilization has played her big role as much as Chinese unification in the Far East. If one focuses on the last 5 or 6 centuries, religion and state fragmentation in Europe and Middle East can explain many developments. Ivanhoe in the West and the Tale of Genji in Japan as far as literature is concerned can have an explanatory power, too. And so on. However, the driving forces that gave a head start to certain areas of the globe are well described in Guns, Germs, and Steel (a misleading title, by the way). If a weak spot this comment should highlight is the book's stinginess with tables and maps."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"This is one of my favorite books; I'd put it in my top five. This is not to say that I necessarily subscribe to all of the author's arguments. I've discussed this book with others and have read many critical reviews, and understand that the book and its arguments are not perfect. Nevertheless, it offers tremendous food for thought, regardless of whether you agree entirely or not. It is especially instructive for people without deep backgrounds in history and science. This book is a well-written and enjoyable exlpanation for why certain societies prospered instead of others. Its greatest value is that it provides evidence that environmental factors influenced history significantly, which is helpful for balancing outdated racial arguments among others."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"This book sets out to answer the question: How did European people get such a big edge? What were the key differences between Eurasia and the rest of the world that led to Europe having the wherewithal in 1492 to conquer the Americas, instead of vice-versa. The book makes a strong case for geographic and biological environmental factors, and argues strongly against factors involving presumed differences in the human 'races'. The geographic factors seem to be but common sence, (once Diamond has explained them!) The biological environmental factors are more technical, and cannot really be evaluated by the lay reader, but they are of such importance that I would like to see more professional-level reviews. Is North America as poor in domesticable plant and animal species as Diamond says? What do other experts in the field say?Basically, I'm with him. Part of the motivation for writing this book is to put out, for public discussion and edification, a strong theory to explain how Europeans/Asians &quot;got ahead&quot;. As Diamond points out, many of us think about this very question, and many of us are stuck with unpalatable 'common sence' answers along the lines of &quot;Native Americans (African, Aboriginal Australians) are naturally primitive&quot; or &quot;The Cultures developed by non Europeans are all fatally flawed (by warlikeness, laziness, conservatism, communism, etc.)&quot; I, myself, have wondered about this, and I am too politically correct (which is now an insulting stereotype in-and-of itself) to want to adopt, or even toy openly with any of these race-cultural supremacist theories. But the underlieing question is so important, we MUST discuss it, and get this kind of thinking out into the light of day, where it can be rigorously analysed and judged. Diamond allows us to do this by producing a thorough, well supported theory, covering almost every aspect of this problem. He shows how it can be solved with out recourse to the &quot;I guess those people are jest backward&quot; thinking. Whether all of the answers he suggests and supports will turn out to be the final ones, is certainly open to debate.The only drawback I would point out to his book is that he does get a little repetitious. Another serious round of editing would have helped. But perhaps repetition is not necessarily a bad idea in driving some of his ideas home...As for his reviewers... One reviewer thought Diamond's position is that Whites represent the pinnacle of modern society and that no one can usurp this distinction. This is silly. Diamond is attempting to figure out what gave Whites/Europeans their big edge in 1492. That they had this edge is difficult to dispute. He says nothing about whether they will keep it. Most of his arguments relate to cultures in isolations vs. those which are not. Since none of us are very isolated anymore (at least compared with the kinds of isolation some peoples had in pre-European-exploration times), his work cannot be said to make any projection about continued &quot;white&quot; dominance.Some reviewers complain his work is unoriginal. I'm sure that other experts in this field know that some of his theories and arguments did not spring, unaided, from his mind alone. I never had the impression that he was attempting to make us think so, either. He certainly cites enough other references... His great accomplishment is a clear, persuasive synthesis of ideas that can be read and appreciated by the non-expert.One reviewed scoffed that Diamond is unduly wedded to the idea that &quot;all men are created equal&quot;. I didn't get that impression from reading Diamond either. He does suggest that all peoples have their share of geniuses though, which I think would be difficult to disprove.He is also thought to undervalue the importance of culture. This is possible, but on the whole I disagree. Diamond is talking about very long time scales. I think that when we are talking about thousands of years, the physical constraints on the people are more important than any voluntary cultural decisions they make. As Diamond points out, any large number of people will have some groups who are willing to try new things, or who HAVE to try new things because they have been cut out of the best real estate. Over thousands of years, those who avail themselves of the most successful possible food or technology will tend to automatically shut out the others. This may not be observable over a period of tens of years, when cultural factors could easily conquer enlighted self-interest; maybe cultural factors could even triumph over 100's of years. But I think Diamond is more likely to be correct that over the time scale HE is interested in, the boundary conditions (availability of plants, animals and minerals) control the problem.Another complaint is that he does not adequately explain why the Fertile Crescent, with its big head start, or China &quot;won&quot; the domination of Eurasia and hence the world. I'd say that the answer to this problem is not the purpose of Diamond's book. The answers to this that question are more the province of conventional, relatively modern history, in which transient cultural factors may prove far more important than the &quot;initial conditions&quot; or &quot;boundary conditions&quot;. Reviewers who wanted to find the solution to that problem clearly should have read another book, or perhaps be writing their own."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"Forget culture. Forget warfare. Forget race. This author looks at human development from the earliest diaspora out of Africa, and leaves off where traditional history books begin. He makes a compelling thesis that any race that developed in Eurasia would have a leg up on virtually any other group; not by virtue of genetic superiority but through better raw materials.We all know the old adage about &quot;an infinite number of monkeys with an infinite number of typewriters and an infinite amount of time...&quot; The author is suggesting that the combination of open terrain (for the dissemination of knowledge and crops), the presence of large domesticatable mammals, and an abundance of nutritious (and cultivatable) wild crops led to the development of what we would now call &quot;civilization&quot; in Eurasia first. In other words, the number of monkeys (family groups or clans) in any area may be large, but not infinite; the number of typewriters (regional advantages as above) vary by continent or region; and the amount of time available for a civilization to gain a foothold in a region is not consistent. Probability would suggest that the area with the greatest number of &quot;monkeys&quot;, the best &quot;typewriters&quot; and the longest head start would finish that mythical work of literature first.It is refreshing for an historian to look at humanity dispassionately and to say that, in the aggregate, humans generally behave in a given way in a given situation, and until fairly recently the acts of a few outliers have been unable to significantly distort these trends. Like it or not, we're basically herd animals.There are some minor logical inconsistencies in the book, but I found it to be fairly thorough and a good read, although a little long on New Guinea."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"It has been a long time since I have read a book which has lead me to reflect on my thoughts every few pages. &quot;Chaos&quot; and &quot;Godel, Escher Bach come to mind. The author clearly has written a position paper espousing his own politically correct view of the development of dominant societies. However, there is enough objective content to educate more than persuade. The author does raise a few straw arguments counter to his own position only to knock them down quickly. One factor in the spread of dominant societies the author does not address is the natural or innate argressiveness of a society. A parallel situation in nature is the unleashing of africanized &quot;killer&quot; bees on South and North America. What has led to dominance of the species is its aggressiveness and not its ability to produce food from the same plants as the European honeybee. I have seen gifted, high IQ, well-nourished children routinely bested by aggressive younger children. When the means of food production reached the hardy people of northern climates tested by poor resources and harsh climate, the combination was explosive. I believe the spread of Christianity also helped by stabilizing these agressive societies enough to turn their energy outward on the world instead of their neighbors. I finished reading this book months ago and it still can keep me up at night."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"I have listened to the book on tape and found that the abridged version is well done and sufficiently detailed to present Diamond's arguments and illustrations.A couple of points: First, Diamond paints a very compelling &quot;big picture&quot; explanation. He does not attempt to explain all historical events, but does assert an explanation of the vast movements of human history. His explanation is powerful!Second, with so much of our cultural attention focused on the value of individual effort and individual choice and the rewards and punishments thereof, his explanation is a helpful balance or antidote for a merely individualistic view of the world. All things are not the result of individual actions and choices. The environment has a major role in defining the options available at any given time and place, and those circumstances become cumulative over time in their impact.Third, communities and organizations throughout the world are dealing with cultural diversity. Diamond's explanation is a great resource for rationally &quot;leveling the playing field&quot; and allowing for an appropriate recognition and discussion of the value of all persons and peoples.I had a great time reading the book and am recommending it to friends and family."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"We all know the story of the origin of man in Africa, the spreading of mankind throughout the world, the rise of agriculture in the fertile crescent and then the growth of civilization in the Middle East, China, Europe and America with Europe conquering the New World and then somewhat (though this may be changing now) dominating the Far East.What Diamond strives to answer is why did culture and power evolve this way?His answers revolve around:Available crops for domesticationAvailable animals for domesticationEase Of Technology transfer (east/west is easier than north/south and mountains and oceans are a problem)Diamond painstakingly goes through the diffences between various areas of the world. Focusing mainly on non-Western societies, he points out how they were handicapped by lack of resources (fewer available plants and animals) and also in the case of America, by time.Taking issue with the spotlight reviews, Diamond is not a 100% determinist. Regarding the New World, he describes several of the bad decisions those societies made when interacting with the Europeans, clearly causing their societal collase to accelerate. In the sections dealing with China, he details various human factirs that drove the Chinese to abandon their navies and much of their technology in the 1400s, stagnating for a precious few centuries when Europe moved forward.This synthesis of geographical determinism ALONG WITH choice is continued in Collapse. taking the two together should give you a good understanding of Diamond.Both books are excellent and must read for any serious student of history. 5 stars"},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"I once saw Jared Diamond referred to as the current Jedi Master of human history, and from this important and influential book it's easy to see why. In \\"Guns, Germs, and Steel,\\" Diamond lays out a grand unifying theory of human history that is as powerfully explanatory as evolutionary theory is for the diversity of species. In doing so, he provides a model for a much deeper understanding of all human history.The title is a reference to the proximate (immediate) factors--of which guns, germs and steel are just a few--that have resulted in the triumph of certain societies over others. It's a catchy title, but it doesn't reflect the true thrust of the book, which is demonstrating how ultimate factors like the availability of domesticable plants and animals and the geographic ease of technology and foods diffusion led to more dense and complex societies and eventually to those factors that helped some societies engulf others through conquest or other means. In other words, it's ultimately all about the real estate.To argue his thesis, Diamond draws on a wealth of history, genetics, linguistics, archeology, and other disciplines to create an unprecedented synthesis. Maybe you're familiar with much of the material presented here, but when put together so coherently in the service of his theory, it is incredibly illuminating. Most readers won't have even thought of the important questions about our world that the author answers so convincingly.The book isn't perfect. Diamond likes to drive home his points through repetition, which aids in retention but can get tiring. The organization could have been a little better, and a considerable amount of material not directly related to his thesis could have been trimmed off.But this book gets my highest rating because it successfully explains the broadest trends, patterns and processes of human history, and provides a foundation essential for understanding why things are as they are today. It deserves all the critical and popular acclaim it's received."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"As I read it, this book argues that modern imbalances of power between human societies can ultimately be traced to accidents of geography which determined the possibilities for the development of plant and animal domestication, state societies, and culturally stimulating inter-societal contacts such as long-distance trade.Whatever one thinks of that overall thesis, the book does offer much to the reader, both general and specialist, in the way of revelations of unexpected facts. The author integrates much of the latest work on genetics, agricultural history, cultural anthropology, linguistics, archaeology, and other fields and introduces them to the general reader as well as to the over-specialized academic.The thesis functions well as far as it can go. The danger is that, in accepting the book's thesis, the uncritical reader might simply replace &quot;racialist&quot; or &quot;culturalist&quot; explanations for the disparate &quot;fates of human societies&quot; with an excessively &quot;geographical determinist&quot; one.I find convincing overall Diamond's arguments as to why human societies in different continents (&quot;Eurasia[plus North Africa],&quot; &quot;[Sub-Saharan] Africa,&quot; &quot;New Guinea,&quot; &quot;Australia,&quot; and &quot;North/South America) developed differently. He is right to stress the link between the environmental preconditions for the development of human societies, as well as to highlight that epidemic pathogens are as integral to the package of &quot;civilization&quot; as writing, bureaucracy, or high technology and that they are part of the &quot;advantage&quot; which ensured the victory of Eurasian over American, Australian, and certain Oceanic peoples (the last ultimately products of Eurasia and yet through isolation losing the advantages of that heritage).However, the thesis can only go so far, particularly when we consider the imbalances of power between the &quot;Eurasian&quot; societies themselves, which ordinarily command more of the attention of the general reader than the deposition of an Inca emperor or, unfortunately, the dispossession of contemporary Amazonian tribespeople.After spending more than a whole chapter on enumerating the geographical advantages enjoyed by China, Diamond comes up against the problem of China's current subordination to the West. On the one hand, China seems to embody in miniature the geographical virtues of Eurasia as a whole -- a variety of highly productive areas with easy access to each other. On the other hand, by facilitating early and sustained political unification, this particular geography appears, to Diamond as to the geographical determinists from whom he inherits the argument, to have precluded the inter-state competition which promoted technological innovation in Western Europe, whose geography prevents easy unification.If we consider more closely the &quot;conundrum&quot; of why China did not discover Europe when it had treasure fleets of gargantuan junks reaching as far as East Africa in the 15th century, we see that geographical determinism loses its explanatory power at this level of analysis.Diamond, like many Westerners, assumes that &quot;voyages of discovery&quot; are self-evident goods in themselves which will be embarked upon if only the machinations of bureaucracies do not stifle them. Or perhaps that a regional multi-state system will in itself encourage such ventures.These both miss the point about European expansionism. Here the question is not of opportunity (and preconditions) but of motive.The Chinese and other non-Western European Eurasian peoples had no compelling desire to discover the farthest ends of Europe (and needless to say, therefore availed themselves of no chance of stumbling into the Americas), because, among &quot;civilized&quot; areas, Western Europe was marginal to the world economy which was centered in the manufacturing and agricultural powerhouses of China and India and the spiceries of Indonesia.The next less marginal area consisted of the Islamic heartlands of the Middle East (though still far more advanced than Western Europe) which had long reached out towards the wealth of those eastern lands through both conquest, trade, and missionizing in a way which partly foreshadows later European behavior. European expansionism can only be understood in the wider context of the evolving world system and not in terms of its internal dynamics, much less its &quot;unique characteristics.&quot; (If we want to talk about the last, we can posit that Western Europe's uniquely combative and competitive stance towards a neighboring -- and fraternal -- civilization, that of Islam, was also a motivating factor in the former's expansionism).The above is not meant to detract from my generally positive appraisal of the book, only to point out the limits beyond which its thesis can no longer be profitably applied.It is unfortunate that Diamond did not take on the IQ-counting, neo-racialists head on, only shooting out provocative statements like &quot;Individual Stone-Age Papuans are smarter on average than individual Internet-Age Americans.&quot; I personally do not see anything implausible about such a contention. After all, a person who has no calculator at hand when he solves mathematical problems is likely to be better able to add, subtract, multiply, and divide on his own than someone who always has recourse to such a brain-supplementing, brain-substituting device. A population which has never invented eyeglasses will likely have on average better native eyesight than one in which everyone uses eyeglasses and where natural selection can no longer penalize shortsightedness.These examples just remind us that such things as &quot;intelligence&quot; are as much culturally determined as they are biologically. If a non-modernized Papuan with his particular cultural background made up an intelligence test and administered it to an American, it is likely that the American would not do as well on it as a fellow Papuan. If the &quot;Jews&quot; as a group are &quot;smarter&quot; than other populations, than that is less a sign of inherent genetic superiority than on millennial processes of social (and not strictly natural) selection for the particularly narrow economic niche into which most societies have ghettoized the Jews.Though it falls short of explaining everything in the last 13,000 years, &quot;Guns, Germs, and Steel&quot; does provide us a useful long-term, global perspective from which to reconsider our most pressing questions of inter-societal and intra-societal imbalances of power."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"I'd always wondered why the cavalry never arrived through history's battles astride zebras. They are, after all closely related to horses -- why did Africans never make that leap to stripped horse flesh when their Eurasian cousins were able to commanded the non-stripped version thousands of years ago?Diamond answers this question and provides other fascinating information in this extremely logical and well argued book (zebras have far nastier tempers than horses and are not domesticable).This is human history at its most basic. The question answered is why some peoples achieved more advanced developmental trajectories than others over the last ten thousand years.Diamond's history is the history of homo sapiens, not historical man. In fact, he shows how the history of our species interacted with basic geographical and biological facts in all parts of the world to produce &quot;history&quot; as most of us know it (at least through the age of colonialism).This book proves, at its most elemental level, that people are people. Which continents our ancestors migrated to almost totally explains the stage of development reached by different peoples five hundred years ago when world's collided. In this, Diamond presents clear and convincing evidence and arguemnt that history up to a point was pre-ordained.What elements preordained development levels among people? The presence or absence of domesticable plant and animal species and the breadth of lattitude possessed by the continents. The Eurasian land mass was the clear winner in nature's draw which meant that those who were lucky enough to inhabit it had developed clear advantages over other peoples of the world by the time they met.Diamond makes this point through clearly marshalled evidence, sound conclusions and simple yet elegant prose.In this, the book is a breakthrough work: it explains convincingly much about the lack of differences between peoples and the absolute importance of location, avaialable food and animal speciies in determining such critical success factors for development as agriculture, village life, and the emergence of writing and technology.The title of this book more accurately could have been &quot;Lattitude, Grass Plants and Large Mammels.&quot; Guns, germs and steel are not the focus, but the result of those percursor elements, which are discussed much more that the title words. I also found that the author repeats him self and his basic points a lot. His case is well made, but made over and over again. At times the book got boringly repetitive. At other times, iteresting tidbits arising out of the author's case pulled me back in.Having said that, this is an important book, even monumental for the clarity and convincing manner in which Diamond presents his thesis."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"Seems to be a book everyone one should read, though I just love history.

Diamond analyzes the social and environmental differences that resulted in such vast differences in development. Jared Diamond is an expert in the field of Anthropology and one of the most well informed voices in the community, in regards to this subject.

There were many times that I thought \\"Oh, great, thanks for telling me again that 'guns, germs, and steel' are the end results of such and such.\\" I would have much preferred that the title be something like \\"The Fates of Human Societies\\" and slowly work up to \\"Germs\\" in the first third, then \\"Steel\\" in the 2nd third, then \\"Guns\\" in the 3rd third."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"Just starting reading this book, as I found it fortunately in the library sale books, and can't believe I never got around to reading Jared Diamond and Guns, Germs and Steel.

This book addresses the most essential questions about why some cultures have advanced to put a man on the moon, while other cultures remained as hunter-gathers. Just as natural selection and the environment determine the course of biological evolution, the availability/accessibility of resource and geography/climate of the land determines the course of societal evolution. It is only now, in the post industrial age, that Humans have finally begun to mitigate such natural forces.I have personally used Jared Diamond's \\"working theory\\" that is outlined in this book to comprehensively explain the rise and fall of the Islamic Renaissance in just a few pages of text; without having to delve deep into the details of historical events or key characters.Jared Diamond has turned the history of Human civilization (on the macro scale) into a science!"},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"I had read this the first time in 1995 or 1996, and then again shortly thereafter to engage in a hot debate with a friend over Diamond's ideas. But I have not been back to this book in almost two decades. When I saw the updated version, I decided to treat myself to a week with the book.One thing that jumps out at me now that did not on my prior readings was Diamond's total exclusion of any theory that Asian cultures colonized the west coast of America in prehistorical days. There is so much evidence to conclude that they did, and so little evidence to show that they did not. The book is a tease, because you keep thinking he will cycle around to it, and then he avoids it again.For example, in the chapter \\"Blueprints and Borrowed Letters,\\" Diamond holds up the acquisition of writing by MesoAmericans as an independent invention. But fewer than four pages later, he goes into detail establishing all the changes in Sumerian writing from its first appearance through syllabaries, phonemes, etc., to when it became full-fledged, changes in techniques, abandoned styles... then notes how writing just sprang up in Mexico without any intermediate steps. No explanation for that, eh?While I'm in that chapter, Diamond mentions how the Soviets' acquisition of nuclear technology may have been an example of idea diffusion (they knew *we* knew how to do it, so they figured out how.) However, the Russians openly brag that they stole our nuclear technology and copied it. It's no secret how they got it -- blueprint copying.Back to ancient America.In the chapter on \\"hemispheres colliding,\\" Diamond clearly lays out how pottery technology spread from Ecuador (an early pottery site) to the Andes sites in Peru (1300 years later). Ecuador is on the west coast of America, in perfect position to borrow this technology from Asia.In the chapter \\"How Africa Became Black,\\" Diamond pulls his biggest \\"nothing to see here.\\" If all ancient Americans crossed a land bridge from Siberia and then migrated south, and the end of the Ice Age blocked that bridge so no more could cross, how do you account for the wide variations in appearance among the groups of living Native American populations? When you see the south Asian and Polynesian influence in the physiology of some American peoples (rounded eyes, darker skin...), why is that less conclusive than the evidence portrayed for New Guinean people or Japanese people?Of further interest is how the Indonesian people used ocean currents to navigate to the east coast of Africa and all throughout the Indian Ocean. Would those ocean-going traders never have used the currents to take them east? Never?Two points should be made. The lack of communicable diseases in America to spread to the Europeans argues heavily against massive Asian colonization, as does the absence of the wheel.Still, there is heavy evidence that Diamond either glosses over or dismisses without mentioning, and my 2-decades-smarter self wonders why.Entertaining book, a great way to fill a week, and lots of fun information to ponder."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"What a great book.

The detail /research in the book is stunning. This is one of the books that I can clearly say I came away a lot smarter (or should I say knowledgeable) after reading it than when I started. The book contains so much knowledge that in all honesty it is hard to retain all of it. This book covers a lot of ground and while it is not an easy read it well worth the effort.

Mr. Diamond presents a compelling argument as to why our world has been shaped Occidental civilization. However his prose is too dense and can lose readers who aren't willing to wade through it to find the gems of his insight. Arguably, the greatest strength of this book is the author's courage to explain our world's recent historical dominance by the West in the face of a certain backlash. Kudos also for the evenhanded treatment of all societies."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"The criticisms of Guns, Germs and Steel are well taken: Diamond makes a gratuitous remark suggesting New Guinea tribes people are more intelligent, on average, than Westerners, there's lots of redundancy and it fails to meet the standards of scientific literature. Finally, his \\"PC\\" refrains help get the book sold to high school and university programs, but is redundant to a theory that is inherently \\"PC.\\" Nonetheless, this book is outstanding.Foremost, for me, Diamond provides a rich, highly readable survey of current scientific literature on human development from a range of disciplines. His fundamental theory that agricultural assets led to powerful societies is not original, but presented with greater depth and insight than elsewhere, reflecting access to new tools in microbiology and other fields of research. The underlying theory and supporting evidence give me the sense of greater understanding of human history and society."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"Read the first few chapters, and the last few. Then dip into specific chapters of interest. The book is so repetitive - it should have been 100 pages, if only publishers would learn that our time is worth more than our money, and we don't buy books by weight. Essentially, very interesting ideas, badly written. Pulitzer obviously rewarded the research and the political position over the quality of the writing. As stated by others, Diamond has an agenda, but that does not invalidate all of his ideas, it simply trucates the thought processes, and leaves some obvious questions unanswered. Some questions that need answering: (1) If Eurasians were better fed for 10,000 years, has that made them more intelligent? If not, then Diamond becomes the first doctor to claim that nutrition is irrelevant during pregnancy or early childhood. (2) More importantly, following from above, is 10,000 years of superior nutrition sufficient to produce evolutionary changes in the brain, such that even when nutrition is equalized in the 20th century (sort of), the Eurasions have had a head start? Diamond would be more credible if he asked some of these questions, which logically follow from his own thesis. Another point - the title is misleading. The book has one chapter on germs, and mentions guns and steel as part of the big picture. But the basic thesis is about food and geography. Nevertheless, the book is thought-provoking, and the ideas are well argued, they just may not be the whole truth."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"With all the lucid and believable staements in the book, why did he have to repeat several times that New Guinea natives are smarter than the rest of the people on earth?

The short answer, according to Guns, Germs and Steel, is that it had the benefit of greater diversity, and that this diversity was the gift of geography.

More kinds of food meant more people, thus more kinds of diseases (which other peoples weren't immune to) and also more new ideas.

The question motivating the book is: Why did history unfold differently on different continents? ... the answers to the question don't involve human racial differences at all...\\" (Pg. 9) He summarizes his thesis, \\"History followed different courses for different peoples because of differences among peoples' environments, not because of biological differences among peoples themselves.\\" (Pg. 25)He states, \\"Surely, if some local wild mammal species of [Australia, the Americas, and Africa] had been domesticable, [the people] would have domesticated them and gained great advantage from them... the explanation for the lack of native mammal domestication outside Eurasia lay with the locally available wild mammals themselves, not with the local peoples. (Pg. 164) Later, he adds, \\"Australia and the Americas... lost most of their candidates in a massive wave of late-Pleistocene extinctions... Finally, a higher percentage of the surviving candidates proved suitable for domestication on Eurasia than on the other continents.\\" (Pg. 175)He observes, \\"Early writing served the needs of those political institutions (such as record-keeping and royal propaganda), and the users were full-time bureaucrats nourished by stored food surpluses grown by food-producing peasants. Writing was never developed or even adopted by hunter-gatherer societies, because they lacked both the institutional uses of early writing and the social and agricultural mechanisms for generating the food surpluses to feed scribes... Once writing had been invented by those few societies, it then spread, by trade and conquest and religion, to other societies with similar economies and political organizations.\\" (Pg. 236-237)He points out, \\"The failure of the Khoisan and Pygmies to develop agriculture was not due to any inadequacy of theirs as farmers but merely to the accident that southern Africa's wild plants were most unsuitable for domestication. Neither Bantu nor white farmers... were subsequently able to develop southern African native plants into food crops.\\" (Pg. 389) He adds, \\"food production was delayed in sub-Saharan Africa... by Africa's paucity of domesticable native animal and plant species, its much smaller area suitable for indigenous food production, and its north-south axis, which retarded the spread of food production and inventions.\\" (Pg. 398)While this is (in some circles) a controversial book, it's definitely a thought-provoking and well-written one, and will captivate the interest of even those who disagree with some or all of its arguments."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"I needed this book for my Anthropology class.

In attempting to answer the question of why some cultures are sucessful in leaving their mark on the world, while other, equally meritous cultures are engulfed or face extinction, he brings to bear a number of highly interesting, plausable hypotheses.

I recommend it highly to the general reader."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"Diamond's bestseller may be destined for a spot on the shelf next to Stephen Hawking's works - bought by millions of readers, most of whom seem only to get through a chapter or two. That's a shame, because &quot;Guns, Germs, and Steel&quot; is both accessible and important, but its 420 pages may be too much for those preferring quickie books to a modest challenge.Diamond, a physiology professor at UCLA, writes about the rise of civilization, or more precisely, he asks why European civilization became so advanced that it was able to conquer other continents, rather than vice versa. The guns, germs, and steel of the title are the tools of conquest used the by the europeans, but they aren't the answer. The question goes back even further: assuming that humanity arose from common African ancestors several million years ago, what set of factors allowed certain european and asian societies to develop the advanced weapons, virulent germs, and modern technology they used to subdue the other continents, rather than the other way around. Diamond jumps off from the 1532 capture of the Inca emperor Atahuallpa by Pizarro and his tiny band of Spaniards, asking, &quot;Why did Pizarro capture Atahuallpa instead of Atahuallpa capturing or killing Pizarro?... How did Pizarro come to be there to capture him, instead of Atahuallpa's coming to Spain to capture King Charles I?&quot;.The answer, as Diamond patiently and capably demonstrates, has nothing to do with racist notions of intelligence but comes down to the fact that prehistoric societies in the Fertile Crescent area of the middle east were blessed with a variety of plants and animals that could be domesticated and that eurasia is blessed with a long east-west axis. That's pretty much it. Sounds simple? Well, it is and it isn't. Cogently reviewing tools, agriculture, language, ecology, and a host of other scientific fields, Diamond shows how societies that produced food surpluses became large and sedentary and developed specialized classes of bureaucrats, priests, and craftspeople who created modern civilization and all the technologies and ideologies that supported exploration and conquest.The book is not a scientific thesis full of academic jargon, but is a clear historical outline for the educated layperson. It is designed to make the reader's job easy, with chapter summaries in the prologue and wrap-up paragraphs at the end of each chapter. One quibble: it could be shortened by one-third without sacrificing substance. Diamond's patient explications can occasionally be repetitive or overlong. Readers are constantly reminded of simple truths developed in earlier chapters, so that new ideas are slow in developing. However, the thesis itself is thought-provokingly simple and probably unique for many readers. Quite simply, it is a new and persuasive way of looking at the world.

Well, not that simple but that's the essential story, and Jared Diamond makes the point well enough. Other, more traditionally historical considerations are not covered however and there is almost nothing about cultural or religious factors. Perhaps that's just as well as these lead to much conjecture and Diamond is taking a new approach which, to be considered adequately, needs the simplification.Did you know zebras were never domesticated because they bite people? That's part of the story because larger animals that could be domesticated gave early societies a leg up as they struggled towards the future. Eurasia/North Africa had horses, cattle, sheep, and goats. In the Americas and New Guinea/Australia (the latter were joined in earlier times) most candidates were killed off--which would mean that early humans were already too advanced to coexist with larger mammals with which they did not co-evolve (the author does not do much more than imply this).Not much is said about North American buffalo.Diamond does a better job on plants. With only a few additions from the New World, dietary staples today originated in Eurasia.Germs: the more times you got sick, the better off your descendents (I'm paraphrasing). Those of us in the West can thank our domestic animals for transferring many of the diseases--making us lethal.Diamond is accused of determinism. I think he's just taking the earth as organism into account....the drifting and the shaping of continents and the life which preceded our own.He's also a bit politically correct. In the first chapter or so genocide is mentioned time and again in an indicting modern context but then the word goes unsaid in all sorts of &quot;displacements&quot; from the earliest times onward. I imagine he had to get our attention.Diamond likes long lists of things separated by commas. He repeats them over and over. This accounts for a lot of the redundancy other reviewers have noted."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"If you don't expect any book to be completely without mistakes, and you don't feel any book you buy must be the be-all-end-all on a subject, you will certainly enjoy Guns, Germs, and Steel. I found it fascinating to learn the details of the accidental domestication of crops (e.g. how poison wild almonds became delicious edible almonds); about the &quot;big 14&quot; -- the few ancient animals that were suitable for domestication, and why so many other species were not suitable; about diseases from the microbes' point of view; and so on.I had heard the basics before, but the details in this book and the way they are presented make it worth the purchase price. (I got the audiobook version from the library, but plan to buy the softcover). The reader isn't bad. Although his intonation can be strange at times, he has the ideal voice for lengthy works (11 x 90 min) -- low pitched, unhurried and not overly dramatic.Who cares whether or not this book is too politically correct? Don't be discouraged by a top 1000 reviewer. This book is not perfect, but it is rich in information and ideas, and I really enjoyed hearing it."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"This book sets out to answer the question: How did European people get such a big edge? What were the key differences between Eurasia and the rest of the world that led to Europe having the wherewithal in 1492 to conquer the Americas, instead of vice-versa. The book makes a strong case for geographic and biological environmental factors, and argues strongly against factors involving presumed differences in the human 'races'. The geographic factors seem to be but common sence, (once Diamond has explained them!) The biological environmental factors are more technical, and cannot really be evaluated by the lay reader, but they are of such importance that I would like to see more professional-level reviews. Is North America as poor in domesticable plant and animal species as Diamond says? What do other experts in the field say?Basically, I'm with him. Part of the motivation for writing this book is to put out, for public discussion and edification, a strong theory to explain how Europeans/Asians &quot;got ahead&quot;. As Diamond points out, many of us think about this very question, and many of us are stuck with unpalatable 'common sence' answers along the lines of &quot;Native Americans (African, Aboriginal Australians) are naturally primitive&quot; or &quot;The Cultures developed by non Europeans are all fatally flawed (by warlikeness, laziness, conservatism, communism, etc.)&quot; I, myself, have wondered about this, and I am too politically correct (which is now an insulting stereotype in-and-of itself) to want to adopt, or even toy openly with any of these race-cultural supremacist theories. But the underlieing question is so important, we MUST discuss it, and get this kind of thinking out into the light of day, where it can be rigorously analysed and judged. Diamond allows us to do this by producing a thorough, well supported theory, covering almost every aspect of this problem. He shows how it can be solved with out recourse to the &quot;I guess those people are jest backward&quot; thinking. Whether all of the answers he suggests and supports will turn out to be the final ones, is certainly open to debate.The only drawback I would point out to his book is that he does get a little repetitious. Another serious round of editing would have helped. But perhaps repetition is not necessarily a bad idea in driving some of his ideas home...As for his reviewers... One reviewer thought Diamond's position is that Whites represent the pinnacle of modern society and that no one can usurp this distinction. This is silly. Diamond is attempting to figure out what gave Whites/Europeans their big edge in 1492. That they had this edge is difficult to dispute. He says nothing about whether they will keep it. Most of his arguments relate to cultures in isolations vs. those which are not. Since none of us are very isolated anymore (at least compared with the kinds of isolation some peoples had in pre-European-exploration times), his work cannot be said to make any projection about continued &quot;white&quot; dominance.Some reviewers complain his work is unoriginal. I'm sure that other experts in this field know that some of his theories and arguments did not spring, unaided, from his mind alone. I never had the impression that he was attempting to make us think so, either. He certainly cites enough other references... His great accomplishment is a clear, persuasive synthesis of ideas that can be read and appreciated by the non-expert.One reviewed scoffed that Diamond is unduly wedded to the idea that &quot;all men are created equal&quot;. I didn't get that impression from reading Diamond either. He does suggest that all peoples have their share of geniuses though, which I think would be difficult to disprove.He is also thought to undervalue the importance of culture. This is possible, but on the whole I disagree. Diamond is talking about very long time scales. I think that when we are talking about thousands of years, the physical constraints on the people are more important than any voluntary cultural decisions they make. As Diamond points out, any large number of people will have some groups who are willing to try new things, or who HAVE to try new things because they have been cut out of the best real estate. Over thousands of years, those who avail themselves of the most successful possible food or technology will tend to automatically shut out the others. This may not be observable over a period of tens of years, when cultural factors could easily conquer enlighted self-interest; maybe cultural factors could even triumph over 100's of years. But I think Diamond is more likely to be correct that over the time scale HE is interested in, the boundary conditions (availability of plants, animals and minerals) control the problem.Another complaint is that he does not adequately explain why the Fertile Crescent, with its big head start, or China &quot;won&quot; the domination of Eurasia and hence the world. I'd say that the answer to this problem is not the purpose of Diamond's book. The answers to this that question are more the province of conventional, relatively modern history, in which transient cultural factors may prove far more important than the &quot;initial conditions&quot; or &quot;boundary conditions&quot;. Reviewers who wanted to find the solution to that problem clearly should have read another book, or perhaps be writing their own."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"Diamond creates a sweeping picture of the development of humanity. However, his book is Euro-centric, patronizing and bound by European concepts of time and space. He fails to consider native perspectives on Europeans, does not explore Native empires to an adequate degree, and entirely dismisses the importance of religion to both European and Native societies. The author does not discuss the role of human agency in determining the fate of society. Diamond also fails to explore the China questions: having had the same or more advanced resources and technology as the Europeans, why didn't China take over the world? He discusses germs in depth, but spends little or no time on guns and steel.Having read this book side by side with Mann's 1491, I definitely recommend the latter"},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"Finally someone has taken a comprehensive look at a complicated dynamic and made sense of it for the layperson.

Farming allows for higher population densities - resulting a civilization resistant to disease with structured government and written language. These innovations are requirements for advanced technology including steel and guns.That is a short overview. The wikipedia summary is quite good too.The problem, the reason Guns, Germs, and Steel is almost unreadable, is Prof. Diamond goes too wide - he explains everything in minute detail. He expects none of his arguments to be taken at face value.

Most of them do not write scintillating narrations of a grand theory that falls well on the deterministic side of center, as grand theories go.But Jared Diamond does. That's a good thing.Diamond's affection for the New Guinea tribal people who have befriended him during his field research places an endearing frame around a dissertation that might otherwise have seemed rather unfeeling. Indeed, the programmatic question of one of them--hereafter to be known as 'Yali's question'--serves as the spinal chord of these nearly five hundred pages:'Why is it that you white people developed so much cargo and brought it to New Guinea, but we black people had little cargo of our own?'Now there's a big question. Diamond thinks it can be answered.Tongue lodged in cheek, Diamond opens his preface to the book's paperback edition with this sentence: 'This book attempts to provide a short history of everybody for the last 13,000 years.' Upon review, however, Diamond's statement is not entirely jocular. It actually describes with unusual clarity the book he has placed in many thousands of readers' hands. His evidence may be limited--so the word 'attempts'--yet he is happy to admit such and still press on with what might turn out to be an early attempt at an ecological-geographical theory of history that will eventually produce more sophisticated and convincing successors. This is one of the ways that science proceeds or advances--you choose the verb, depending on your methodological persuasion. When it is self-correcting, as Diamond in his most prudent moments trusts that it will be, this is not a way to do science. Or history. Or whichever best approximates to the task Diamond has set for himself and, fortunately, for our over-his-shoulder curiosity.A man of Diamond's convictions is bound to consider the hunters-and-gathers, missionaries, academics, and historians whom me meets upon the way as distinctively nave. Still, to his credit, he does not regard them as dangerously nave. Instead, he utilizes a generous dollup of case studies to open our eyes to how preexisting conditions set the course of human histories in a way that ought to be considered to complex for responsible investigation and conceptualization.Diamond tells a good story. He is clearly warm to his topic and it does not require much effort to be affected by his contagious enthusiasm. I found his concluding 'The Future of Human History as a Science', replete as his meditations are with sensitivity to the reality that different phenomena require distinct methodologies if they are to be understood.Still, I can't help but suspect that--regardless of the the author's caveats--the driving conviction behind his method is deterministic and overly dismissive of factors like individual personality and religious ideology independent of any determining elements that might have brought it into just the shape it has at any moment.Still, let's take him at his word. Considerations that can perhaps best be labeled ecological largely set the stage for what is possible in human history and humanity's future. It is then up to us what we make of it.This might not be a general theory of everything our race, in its global context, experiences. But it's an interesting and competent stab at a piece of it, well written and effectively framed."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"I just ordered this book, and therefore can't say whether or not I agree or disagree,(why I gave it a 3), with the reviews I've read, but what I can say is that I dislike the ratings I've seen.

European culture gave Europeans an advantage over cultures of the New World.However, one should know that culture is an adaptation. Culture is heavily shaped by a population's environment, meaning that cultural advantages can be explained by environmental differences or advantages between ethnic groups. So the reason Europeans were more adept at metalurgy was the because they had practice, because they had been specializing in that mode of life for a while. Their cultural adaptation, a result of the environment they lived in, gave them a great advantage over Native Americans. As for race, the minor genotypic differences between ethnic groups (a term that means cultural groups, not race) have been debunked as sources of superiority for populations."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"Jared Diamond offers a comparative study of the sociological and anthropological evolution of the world's different societies. Though his idea is no new discovery, Diamond reasserts the importance of the different environments in producing different societies. He writes that while science can fix a date for the evolution of homo sapiens form ape, it remains hard to tell why the different civilizations witnessed different jumpstarts at different times in history.Accordingly, Diamond employs his encyclopedic knowledge of human and social sciences to draw conclusions about how environment caused certain peoples to develop in certain ways. The difference in development eventually defined the human civilization's history.For those who have played the computer game civilization, this is the intellectual version of the game.Diamond's style is attractive even though at times, the reader might feel that the author has included some details - such as explaining the mechanism of carbon dating - that might seem boring for the reader.Also, notwithstanding the comparative character of the book, such a work should have focused on one or two civilizations at most, not include examples form world history at large. The book is interesting for those who are interested in the history of human civilization. Politics junkies might not find it as entertaining."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"This book is amazing. It explains reasons why everything has happened the way it has for the last 13,000 years. It tells why it is not based on the racist belief that, who conquers who is because of race such as the English or the Egyptians but that it is based on many factors such as food production and geographic location. The book explains everything in a very precise way so that you will understand why the aborigines didn't turn into a thriving metal-using gun-toting civilization or, why Europeans and the Chinese didn't stay as cavemen still using stone tools till modern times waitting for some other more advaced civiliztion to take them over.The book also in the beggining, enlightens people to the fact that we evolved from monkeys (surprisingly people still don't know that fact or don't want to believe it for that matter). It Helps to explain where we orginated from (Africa) and that there are five differents \\"types\\" of humans four of which still reside in Africa today. It will help you to understand how humans evolved to become tribes than chiefdoms and so forth. It will also help you to understand the importance of domesticated animals in the rise of civilization.There is so much to say about this book. It is hard to explain completely without typing the whole book into this review. There is so much that this books explains and helps someone understand that it cannot be written down in a short review or a long one for that matter. It cannot be summarized in the regular sense because there is so much important information on every single page. Just know that if you purchase this book, which I highly reccomend you do, get ready for a eye-opening mind-blowing possibly life-changing experience that will leave you stunned at how much knowledge and understanding that you've just gotten from this single important book."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"Whenever I argue against racism, I am asked, \\"Well, then, why DID Eurpeans colonize Africa and Australia and the Americans, instead of the other way around?\\" I always knew there were good answers but couldn't quite explain what they were. Though I know the danger in feeling that something must be intuitively correct, that is exactly what I felt on reading this book. The answers presented make sense, and seem very well supported by facts. Without doing the research myself, it is tough to tell - but this book has made me quite confident in my previously only gut beliefs that all people are basically equal. Read this book to learn, and also to think."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"For those of you who have always wondered how human fair on our planet before the Egyptian Pharaohs, this book tells it all. The author covers the evolution of mankind all the way back from homo-erectus and explains in great details the reasons why some early hunters and gatherers evolved into farmers that ultimately conceived of advanced tools such as writing and political systems, enabling them to ultimately dominate other less fortunate groups. The wealth of knowledge of the author is incredible. All aspect of evolution from plants to animals, to geography and climate are explored and used to explain our current state of evolution. This book is a great complement for any one interested in understanding the history of mankind all the way back from our days in the trees of Africa!"},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"I read _Guns, Germs and Steel_ in tandem with two other books: Robert Wright's _NonZero_ and Howard Bloom's _Global Brain_. The three books together have led for me to an epiphany about human society, and our relationship to the rest of the natural world.I was taught in grade school, high school and college to view human history as something anecdotal and essentially humanistic in nature, intrinsically separate from the world of science, physics and natural history. But these three books made it clear, in their different but overlapping perspectives, that the study of human societies is merely the study of a kind of relatively complex natural system. Human beings interact with the geography, ecology and energy systems of the planet in a way not essentially different from any other large population of mammals might.The 21st century seems to be emerging as a century of synthesis. Barriers between the physical and social sciences; between sociology, biology, and neurology; and the environmental sciences are falling.Dr. Diamond's book should be required reading in high school, and the synthesist approach of Edward O. Wilson should be taught as well. Things that never made sense to me as I was taught by conventional lesson plans and the standard texts, primarily about the ascendance of the West, make perfect sense in the light of Diamond's ecological perspective.I am convinced that we are poised to make great breakthroughs in the social sciences. We will do so once we acknowledge that human beings comprise merely another kind of adaptive and successful multicellular life form. Like any complex system, prediction of particular details about human society may prove outside our grasp. But do we attempt to predict the movement of particular ants in a given ant hill? Broad patterns about our behavior and relationship to the universe will nonetheless begin to emerge, as we allow ourselves to see our connection to the matter, energy and life systems of the rest of the universe.As this worldview develops, new troubling questions emerge. If human beings have, as Diamond says, been subjecting each other to wholesale slaughter for tens of thousands of years, what becomes of the guilt of the West in our extinction of the Indian cultures of the western hemisphere? If human beings, the original Native Americans, 12,000 years ago hunted all the large mammals of the Americas to extinction, what does this say about our Romantic notions about the \\"noble\\" American aborigines and their supposed respect for all life? What of free will and social responsibility, when every human society seems to act similarly under similar circumstances?There appears, in the past 50,000 years, to be no shortage of terrible violence of man against man and against other life forms. No human race or culture seems to have a monopoly on or exemption from violence, oppression, and self-defeating behavior. We seem to act in an \\"enlightened\\" fashion only when we can afford to do so, when the economic gains from that behavior are clear, or when there is some status to be gained.At what point do human beings stop reacting to the environment, and begin planning ahead, plotting a future with vision?"},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"Jared Diamond, I hope you read these comments, because I'd like to thank you for teaching me more about our culture in 400 pages than I ever learned in 20 + years of school. Tremendous effort! Incredibly interesting and informative. I love the way you go back and review what you have discussed. You are a natural born teacher and your book should be required reading in every school in the world."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"Ever wonder why European cultures became the dominant conquering forces in the world?Certainly there are many reasons, but Jared Diamond has written a brilliant synthesis of the development of mankind and cultures that has led up to the world as we know it. He outlines the fascinating impact that geography, agriculture (the germs), and technology (the guns and steel) have on human cultures. It seems that many times we are a product of our environment. That is the locally available plants and animals that had the potential to be domesticated varied greatly around the world. And these had profound impacts on how societies developed. This book is a must reading for everyone!!"},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"Guns, Germs, and Steel, starts with a great title, and an impressive premise in the form a compelling question. As posed by a native of New Guinea, a friend of the author who in some ways reminded me of Watson asking Holmes how he knew the man sitting in the parlor collected postage stamps and took the morning express from the Highlands... Hmmm,not so elementary,Watson...your question. Or maybe even closer to the mark, the scene where Crusoe meets Friday, the fellow who becomes Robinson Crusoe's man servant and friend when Crusoe is ship wrecked on the native island. You get the idea...The question posed is essentially, how come the Wests got so much cargo? i.e., stuff, and we New Guineans don't.The book details and examines the question in an academic's way of looking at things,and as a result,the book's greatest strength is also its weakness. ( In all fairness I must say that I didn't read the whole book, the reason being that the bookstore was closing soon, and I had come there to find a CD anyway...) Nevertheless, I got enough of the sense of it to say that,hey, Professor, nice try but you missed a kind of important point -- entirely. I don't mean to sound facetious, at least not entirely. All the factors that Diamond considers, the ones he gives weight to are in their own way very interesting, and I'm sure, valid points... Environment is crucial. Mountains make nice walls for people to peek over and see what the guys next door are doing to solve problem A, B, or C, and how can they copy or innovate their own answer to it. Or better yet, just take them over by force and steal it. That's always been a standard human approach to problem solving-- theft. However,environment aside for a moment,excuse me but didn't you leave something kind of important out of your analysis? Wasn't Religion a somewhat significant thing in the West? This incredibly potent force which has propelled Western history for two thousand years,this titanic need to, shall we say share our conception of God with our neighbors, whether or not they have invited us to the party, isn't that pretty much standard Western mentality and normal proceedure? Bring in more advanced technology, impose religious beliefs, crush obstacles or people who are crushable. Take what they have,in the name of religion and manefest destiny. Hasn't that been the because in answer to the West's global hegimony. Religion driven motives propelled by all the other factors and issues mentioned in the book,of course. But when you write a book attempting to shed light on this question of why the West (won or took depending on your vantage point) the West, and the World, by extention, it seems kind of important to mention this little thing called Religion...Having said this, and I apologize if I missed the chapter on religion, there are many wonderful nuggets in the book. It's definitely worth a read. I especially liked the photographs of the people. I do think we tend to forget what people living in other lands look like, innundated as we are with idealized images of ourselves. Though I consider myself to be almost completely egalitarian and free from predjudice, I was amazed to see in how many ways my own thinking is strongly biased. For example, I did think of the natives of New Guinea as some kind of stone age peoples lacking in some way in what we so confidently think of as intelligence. The book forced me to look at my own reactions to peoples, and made me realize just how biased I am in so many ways, consciously, and unconsciously.As for the future, well, I'm afraid Diamond's as much in dark as anyone in predicting where we are going... English has ascended to the preeminant language of the world, and we are the lucky recepients of this fate, or accident of history. But intelligence and geography, and human needs will shift. The Chinese, as we are learning lately in Washington have been vastly underated. Perhaps we'd be wise to begin reading more books about Chinese history, philosophy, and, ehem, religion."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"I'm glad I read the book before I read the reviews.JD developes his assumptions and hypotheses in the in the manner of a scientist. He introduces his ideas and than brings out the material to support them.The result is a new view of how the Europeans came to dominate the planet.I don't think his intention was to demonstrate the superiority of a &quot;racial&quot; group.I approached this book with hightened expectation, having read his &quot;The Arrow of Disease&quot; in Discover Magazine.I liked this book because JD took things we all knew about, and looked at their importance in a different way, and presented it in a cogent and interesting manner.If he desired to engender discussion and debate, he was successful.I saw the Eurasian success from a new perspective. Although I never considered that we are where we are today as a gift from God, I must admit to having absorbed the ideas of my culture. JD showed that things, even using earlier information, might be different - and why it might be so.The author was not didactic. Ideas were not rigid. He did not set out to explain why English succeeded, and the Ottoman Turks did not (or did they - for a while).He did not set out to - once again - tell us some of us are smart (intelligent) and some of us are dumb (not intelligent, or not AS intelligent as . . . WHO?).This book was another view of how things got to be the way they are.In the book, It's a Wonderful Life, by Stephen Jay Gould, Gould makes a point about evolution and Homo sapien (that's us, folks). Its a crap shoot. Roll the dice again, and Homo sapien might not even show up at the table.Yep, not a plan, not Manifest Destiny, not the White Man's Burden, not God's Will - just a lot of luck, and as one wag pointed out, Location, location, location.I recommend this book to anyone who's reasonably intelligent, and enjoys the challenge of new ideas."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"An excellent book covering a lot of territory. Jared Diamond presents the material in a fascinating, readable fashion. His arguments are very well laid out, and he pays special attention to maintaining the unity of his argument. It also demonstrates brilliantly how rational thinking unravels a mystery."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"This is not a flawless book. A number of other reviewers have already pointed out flaws in specific details, some evidence chains, and a few conclusions. Here and there, opinion pokes its way into the prose.That said, I give this book 5 stars and a hearty recommendation to anyone interested in the whys and hows of history. While many of the details in modern history are more complex than Diamond's methods can address, the great sweeping trends leading to our modern world are well described and documented. Diamonds methodology and integration set the footings in place for serious, detailed, and ongoing research into how and why societies evolved when and where they did. Some of his conclusions may be overturned by that continuing research, but there must always be a foundation to build upon.Finally, it is instructive to look at how other reviewers here have approached the book. It's challenging on many levels, and some of the reviewers respond uncomfortably to that challenge. Read the rest of the reviews and make up your own mind (and then, buy the book. It has lessons even in areas where it may be wrong)."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"In the era of books based on psuedo or shoddy science, such as the Bell Curve, etc. Along comes a book that explains how history happened, and why it happened in a rationalistic and deterministic fashion. Is argument is well-organized, and well researched. The power of his theory comes in his mass analysis, depending not on individuals but on the species as a whole. The amount of information in this book could easily be expanded into 3 or 4 volumes on several subjects (the section on disease vectors is particularly fascinating). The book shows the powerful results when a true scientist analyzes the big questions of history."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"A tv interview started me on the Diamond trail.

Ably dismissing the conceited and partisan theories of earlier generations (and of most people living today), Diamond proposes sensible scientific alternatives which carry the ring of truth, and apparently so self-evident that it seems amazing no one thought of them before.He isn't too concerned with the individuals and events which are the backbone of traditional histories. He won't explain why one or other political power in Europe gained the advantage in some situation. These are the fine details of the broader picture - and in a very real sense they don't affect the outcome of history. What Diamond wants to know is, for instance, why a steadfastly stone-age Europe was not colonised by gun-toting Native Americans. His ideas give a kind of tragic certainty to the history that we all know and I suspect that many will try to dismiss them as &quot;cultural determinism&quot;, as they have with other authors in this vein.If I have any criticism at all it is that Diamond rather labours the point, but this is not necessarily a bad thing with new and interesting ideas.This is an approach to history of which I would like to see a lot more - I could not put this book down. I have read most of the science books shortlisted for the 1998 Rhone-Poulenc prize and am very glad that this one won.If it is permissible to recommend a companion volume try &quot;Cannibals and Kings&quot; by Marvin Harris."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"For students of the social sciences and teachers alike, it is rare to find a book so wide in breadth and so monumentally couragous in unearthing why our social world is how it is. With a mear few hundred pages, Diamond paints a complex picture of the past 15,000 years in a qualitative manner which draws strongly from holistic vantage point that ushers the reader into a new and exiting paradigm. Diamond is careful not to make sweeping, unqualified assumptions, while at the same time he is successful in bringing together a wide aray of information to prove his point. Both the general interest reader and the experts will enjoy this important book. In an age when the nature nurture debate continues to rage, this author has the ability to move beyond the quibbling to a new understanding of the human animal, and the world we inhabit."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"\\"... all other things being equal, more land and more people mean more competing societies and inventions, hence a faster pace of development.\\"That statement comes near the end of Jared Diamond's Guns, Germs and Steel and, by the time you get to it, you know that all things equal is the exception, not the norm. And you know the things that Diamond are talking about are never the people. His assertion that all races are equal never has to be said. That's how hard he holds the line.But the things that the different people are granted in their place in the world are all important. What \\"packages\\" of wild plants and animals were available for domestication? What types of geography were they surrounded with? Was their land mass situated on an east to west axis, or north to south? It all matters.And the image that comes across is one of luck, and one of a slowly moving set of lucky or unlucky events and collisions that combine, pick up speed and confuse the assertion that we have more because we are superior.If I could I would lobby to put this in every High School curriculum. It would do much to prepare our children with an accurate view of the world."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"Outside of the tedious repetition and somewhat pedantic style of writing, my primary issues with this book are: 1) Almost flippant references to anthropology and anthropological theory. Diamond makes it sound as it cultural anthropology is a transparent and non-complicated discipline (one need not even be educated in anthropology to write a best-selling book on the subject.) This is a familiar - in my opinion - mistaken view of professionals in the &quot;hard sciences.&quot; 2) I disagree with the views that Diamond articulates in the final chapter - that history should (let alone can) become a science, and that this will enable people to make a better future. My opinion is that to successfully challenge racism require a change in the terms of the debate - which may mean getting away from &quot;scientific&quot; thinking altogether."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"I thought this book was pretty good. It gave me some insightful views on fields of study I never even knew existed. Basically the book is about a short history of the world in thirteen thousand years. Jared Diamond talks about everything that helps a society evolve to become more advanced, such as plant and animal domestication, military, population size, and literacy. Diamond hits the nail on the head in his porpouse to inform the every day reader in on what really is going on around the globe into the earliest times.I would recomend this book to the knowledge seeking reader who is interested in anything about the world from all kinds of different time periods. The book can be a little confusing considering how it jumps from topic to topic so abruptly, but for the most part its easy to keep up with, even if you have no background knowledge to support your reading.

He has methodically argued for a specific paradigm of pre-literate cultural development based upon extensive interdisciplinary scientific evidence.His argument, explaining the technological imperialism of the West during the Age of Discovery, boils down to having beenin the right place (Mesopotamia), at the right time,with the right tools, i.e. domestication of animals & cereal-based agriculturewhich allowed these societies to move on to more complex structures & technologies, i.e., metal forging -- Guns & Steeland the superioritiy of European colonial military technology as it colonized the Americas, India, & East Indies-- GermsThe scope and sophistication of his argument make his analyses among the most influential and well-researched works of history of the last 25 years.

I enjoyed the author's use of rhetorical questions to explore the viewpoints of persons who oppose his assertions. Overall, an informative and invigorating read.

This is phenomenal research which, as he mentions, must have taken the author more than two decades. This very enlightening work provides answers to some very big questions that any sufficenlty curious sapien would venture a guess at. Even if one does not agree with all of Diamond's reasoning, one still shall end up learning a lot from the book, and would be left both stunned and satisfied at the comprehensiveness of the volume.

Before you buy it---and I strongly recommend that you do---be forewarned, however, that the type is small, the text is thick, to fully grasp the sentences may require re-reading them three times, and the book is a lengthy one. This is not summer reading material and it is definitely not a vacation read. This is truly a tome (and if you don't know what tome means, then do what your parents told you: look it up) and you best bring your 'A' game when you sit down to enjoy it.Oh, by the way, a number of reviewers perceive a bias in this work. In fact, one reviewer went so far as to put in the following in their Amazon review:\\"Diamond plants these doubts [regarding the bias that Diamond is perceived to have causing the reviewer to have doubts about Diamond's objectivity] through his sometimes-careless prose. Consider the following statement, which he includes in the introduction to his chapter on the rise of food production:'My fellow farmhands were, for the most part, tough whites whose normal speech featured strings of curses, and who spent their weekdays working so that they could devote their weekends to squandering their weeks' wages in the local saloon. Among the farmhands, though, was a member of the Blackfoot Indian tribe named Levi, who behaved very differently from the coarse miners - being polite, gentle, responsible, sober, and well spoken'I thought for a moment that I'd wandered into the script for \\"Dances With Wolves.\\" Note that had this statement been turned on it's head (had he, for example, recounted an anecdote about \\"fire-water drinking Indian drunks\\" or \\"lazy black layabouts\\") my instincts, obviously, would immediately warn me that the author's biases might be influencing how he chooses to present the evidence. I myself am a Black American, I'm all too painfully aware that we've had to wade through some pretty grim stuff penned by authors clutching at straws to support their racist white supremacist views of the world. In this case Diamond does the reverse by aiming his negative bias towards Caucasians, but if I'm truly interested in unbiased science then my skepticism should remain the same.\\"Well, I, too, am an African-American and my in-depth response is that the reviewer has completely taken the initial quote from Diamond out of context, left out a subsequent critical reference to Levi from the same chapter, and drawn a conclusion from this quote that is patently incorrect (which indicates some type of bias on behalf of the reviewer, doesn't it?). The Levi reference the reviewer does not mention is that later in the chapter Diamond says that Levi also disappointed Diamond by coming in early one Sunday morning as drunk and disheveled as the other whites Diamond describes. And the whole reason Diamond brings all of this up is to set-up and share a quote from the drunk Levi which basically says \\"Dang you Caucasians and the ship that brought you from Switzerland to my ancestral land\\". Then Diamond uses that as a launching off point to go on and ask a fundamental question: why was it that the Europeans came to the New World and why didn't New World natives explore Europe? This is a key question for the whole book and an excellent one. The rest of Guns, Germs, and Steel then goes on to explore in depth why was it this way, which, as you will read, has virtually nothing to do with race, ethnicity, genetics, or the like.My off-hand response to this type of comment (i.e. reviewers in general trying to say there is a bias in this work) is (heavy sarcasm): \\"Gee, a book that has a point of view to it. Man, that never happens.\\" Get over it people. Every thing ever written reflects the perspective, either overtly shared or not, of the author. For goodness sakes, we don't let that prevent us from reading the newspaper including the editorial pages or watching television shows so please don't let that stand in your way of reading this book.So, in short, skip the PBS special, buy the book, do your full ocular muscle training first, then begin your read and be ready to be thoroughly intellectually challenged. Oooh, my grey matter still aches---but in a good way!"},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"Mr. Diamond does an excellent job in Guns, Germs, and Steel of explaining how civilization spread across the world. I think those critical of the book are perhaps expecting too much out of it. Mr. Diamond shared his thoughts about what factors led to the disparity between societies. I don't recall him saying with authority that this was the only factor. Rather, he presents it as the main reason. He takes a very statistical approach. Since we know that in a given population selected at random we are all basically the same we need to look at factors beyond the individual. What has existed with us throughout history? The world has. This is why he chose geography. He also doesn't discredit the contributions that individuals made to society. His main point was that humans are all unique in their day but on a grand scale as individuals we mean nothing. I think this offends many of his critics and causes them to discount his other rather logical point. Inventions were inevitable (including religion). He explains this in his chapter on the domestication of crops. Yes, many will this chapter dry and uninteresting (personally I loved it) but it does set the basis for his theory.The problem with Mr. Diamonds critics are that they are stuck on certain events that don't match the theory. Like how come Native Americans don't rule the world? They had the best crop land. Well, Mr. Diamond explained that they hadn't yet domesticated crops or animals. Corn was in its infancy and it takes centuries to produce a crop worth settling down.To be critical I ask that Mr. Diamond leave his personal experiences out of any further books.

It's not revolutionary thinking but it is the most comprehensive work to date."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"This is a brilliant and absolutely groundbreaking book. But, I have no idea why it has such obvious flaws. Which one is it south west Asia or Fertile Crescent? Pick one and stick with it. The novice reader would be rushing for a map. Only to find the author is making up new Geographic paradigms. Worst Eurasia how can I connect with a territory created to make his case. How on Earth is North Africa, not Africa but Eurasia? Then in comes Ethiopia to mess up his plan. So should we say Ethiopia is atypical and hence not Africa? Everything in Ethiopia makes it line up with North Africa, but this caveat messes up the Sub-Saharan African argument. Now in comes black people and European people. Where do these black people come from,? Because I know where Europeans come from. Then say Africans and Europeans! The book is random, messy in its flexible terminology and this is its greatest weakness. Because terms such as sub-Saharan Africa are more colonial than historical and if you are working out of these models you distort history - as he has done.Please do not let the above review make anyone think I did not consider this book an absolute masterpiece. It is because it is such a masterpiece that these flaws are so annoying. This is the kind of book power brokers and statesmen will read. No one book can sum up the history of everything, but this comes as close as humanly possible. I am more sensitive to the flaws in geographical designations and linguistics because it is a subject I follow in detail.The book is a gift to a new understanding and all kinds of subsequent work will be based upon some of its paradigm shifts."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"A short summary: central Asian peoples (Eurasians) have come to dominate modern history because they had many more useful domestic animals and a wider range of nourishing crops available, and better geography to migrate and dominate. The superior animals could get more useful work done, move larger armies for conquest, and evolve worse animal-human shared diseases & immunities that did bad things to other populations. The better crops allowed a robust humanity, a denser population in areas, and more free time to invent things. The east-to-west same-latitude freedom of movement enabled relatively easy movement of people and armies. In short: more inventions, deadlier diseases, better weapons. Guns, germs and steel. The subsequent shortage of analysis makes one think that the author doesn't much like the Eurasian descendants -- western man.Luck, for the author, becomes the biggest factor in group population successes, it seems. Readers may remember the phrase, \\"geographical determinism\\" from school. Jared Diamond does allow that different populations having access to same technologies often do not acquire and use them at the same rate (see p. 252 about such a difference in close-bordering New Guinea tribes). Also, food production today in North America is overwhelmingly more productive than in pre-Columbian days. The author attributes this solely to the previous absence of the right kind of domesticated animals and plants. No negatives about the possible lack of native wishes to make improvements.Still, this book is absorbing, and the reader will like the author's style and his enormous amount of research, interestingly told. \\"Yali's Question\\" starts the book, a nice approach. The question came from a New Guinean (Yali) who had asked and wondered why the \\"white people\\" have brought much \\"cargo\\" (good goods) to New Guinea, but New Guineans didn't bring cargo to the rest of the world. Mr. Yali's question obviously expressed the worry that his people bore a deep inferiority to the recent light-skinned peoples who had landed on their large island. Perhaps someone smarter than this reviewer will read the last chapter and discern if Diamond's conclusion actually answers Yali's Question directly."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"It's tempting to point out the the good bits. When I read it I really appreciated the depth in which he explores biogeographical factors in human history. It was a idea I hadn't seen explored before and its certainly very important. It's also tempting to point on the little mistakes. Diamond's historical scholarship is far from rigorous and he tends to extrapolate a lot from hearsay and narratives that he made up himself. He has a section on the site stinkyjournalism for doing this with respect to current events. However the important aspect of this book is the oversimplification. From a certain deterministic point of view, history was a product of a variety of factors and you can pick one and declare it the \\"cause.\\" Geography, however, is an odd choice when there are so many people being unpredictable. The problem with claiming geographic determinism, is that it allows people to ignore historical and modern systems of inequality. You can't say that slavery, colonialism, or genocide were historically inevitable and somehow justified. By oversimplifying social and cultural systems, Diamond is supporting inequality and neo-colonialism."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"This item was purchased as a gift, it arrived in a short amount of time, was packaged well and was enjoyed by the receiving party."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"Jared Diamond's Guns, Germs and Steel is a great work; Diamond successfully introduces and melds numerous disparate sources to explain the predominance of Western states over aboriginal cultures. However, the work is greatly flawed at the same time-- it misrepresents the achievements of other states, such as the Ottomans, whose achievements would run counter to his thesis. For the Ottomans had superior guns (they hammered Constantinople into submission prior to widespread European use of cannon), germs (or, actually resistance to same; the Ottomans had a smallpox vaccine well before Europe) and steel (Damascene). Diamond uncharacteristically provides no scholastic support for his brief synopsis of the Ottoman's fate, \\" They committed ecological suicide by destroying their own resource base\\" (Epilogue, p. 411 of the Norton paperback edition). There are numerous current works on the Ottoman's and their position relative to the Western states, ecological suicide is not considered a relevant factor. In short, Diamond's central thesis is flawed, based on his reasoning, we should all be subjects of the Sultan. However, I would still strongly recommend this book, both for it's collection of source materials and Diamond's skill at producing a readable product as well as it's place as another example of environmental determinism, a philosophy unique to the last few centuries (think Malthus)."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"The book makes some great associations and explains things in fairly simple terms.

This book is a world history hand job which has nothing to do with serious historical inquiry, and which will itself be looked back upon by future historians as an exquisite specimen of western bourgeois consciousness at the very height of its catharsis and hubris. Jared Diamond is an ornithologist-turned-sudden-expert-on-everything-in-the-world who feebly attempts to capture the essence of history in facile, two-bit concepts such as the \\"onion skin\\" or \\"Yali's question.\\" Real, documented, historical analytical exposition is replaced by little tidbits gleaned here and there from an actual history book and then quickly buried beneath long, windy passages of Jared's armchair musings on \\"why it was so.\\" You can almost hear the game on in the background as these musings slowly peter out and reach no conclusion whatsoever. The so-called \\"central thesis of the book\\" is a dumbed-down, oversimplified misrepresentation of critical responses to the long-defunct Social Darwinistic view of history (which, incidentally, is also dumbed-down as Jared reconstructs it), which Jared then abruptly proceeds to contradict on every page of his book. Sentences like \\"Civilization is not created out of sheer will or intelligence, but is the result of a chain of developments, each made possible by certain preconditions,\\" by which Jared means to move his argument forward, are tautologies which say absolutely nothing at all, perhaps even less than nothing.

Starved of English language writing, I immediately bought it and read through it in the next forty-eight hours. And it was worth it. Sometimes the simplest ideas, like \\"geography is destiny\\" as espoused by the book, are the most surprising.Diamond does an admirable job in keeping the prose concise and understandable, no mean feat for any academic. Reading through the first few chapters really challenged me to re-evaluate conventionally accepted ideas of economic development and the supremacy of technology. In the end, it all has to do with luck.I highly recommend this book, and would have given it five stars if not for the modest criticism that the momentum of the book does not carry through to the end. Diamond is at his best in taking you through history in small steps, each a logical conclusion drawn from its immediate past, but illuminating when grasped in its entirety. I only wish that his book itself would have left me with that feeling, instead of an anticlimax where you finish the book and ask \\"now what?\\" That's better than \\"so what\\" but the expectations built from the earlier passages suggest a summing up or a step backward to tie the separate chapters into a cohesive whole. Diamond would better serve his readers with a hint of what he (and you) have learned from the book for the present and immediate future.

Diamond expands on this slightly oddly worded question to try to explain why various societies are the way they are, and what happens when they come into contact. For example, Diamond ponders why European states colonized the New World and the Native American population, rather than Native Americans crossing the Atlantic to colonize Europe.Diamond attributes much of the current structure and results of conflict between different people to geography. He largely assumes an environmental determinism, that the environment of a particular society strongly affects its ability to produce food, to development technical innovations, to develop immunity to disease, to trade effectively with its neighbors, and to wage war. I am not an expert in this sort of field, but I found most of Diamonds arguments pretty convincing.For example, crop cultivation on the Eurasian landmass was enhanced through its long east-west axis, where the climate is relatively similar throughout. Thus, a crop cultivated somewhere along the Eurasian landmass could quickly migrate to other nearby regions along the east-west axis. Contrast this with the African or North-South American landmasses, which are oriented with long North-South axis, and are broken up with deserts. It is difficult for crop cultivated in one area to migrate to other areas of these landmasses. This provided an advantage Eurasian societies had over those in Africa and the New World, and a major factor as to why these land masses were largely colonized by European states.Could there be other innate factors unrelated to geography but more to psychological make-up of humans on different parts of the globe that shape human history? Diamond does not totally discount that, as he sprinkles in a couple of examples of different societies in similar environments having some different characteristics. However, Diamond claims that if Australian aborigines where interchanged with European peoples in 5000 BC, the transplanted aborigines would still end up colonizing the transplanted Europeans living in Australia. Those that have trouble with this philosophical point of view are probably going to think a lot less of this book, but Diamond makes his ideas fairly convincing, and backs up this world view with a number of examples that greatly outnumber the rare counterexamples.Needless to say, an attempt to characterize human history and explain why the world is the way it is today is not the type of book one reads during an afternoon at the beach. However, I found most of the book surprisingly easy to read, and at around 450 pages, fairly digestable. It has moments where Diamond's writing is a little unclear, and gets a bit tedious to read. But I learned a lot, and felt I gained a much greater appreciation of the world by reading it."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"It's been 2 years since I read this book but I find myself still recommending it to people who don't understand Prof. Diamond's premise. I realize that much of this work has previously been covered in detail by other writers but Prof. Diamond does an excellent job of synthesizing the whole thesis of environmental advantage based on flora & fauna.Critics of Prof. Diamond tend to focus on the lack of the human element but that only reinforces Diamond's thesis: that the human element would not have developed but for the prerequisite environmental advantages. These critics' arguments may be more well founded with regard to Diamond's newest work \\"Collapse\\" with its focus smaller, less generalizable, civilizations.

The reference notes that some 13,000 years ago, all humans were Stone-Age-technology hunter-gatherers, and then considers why different groups of humans developed different types of societies and different levels of technologies, on the different continents. The argument is made that neurobiologically all groups of humans were more or less similar, but that the Eurasians were the most fortunate in living in Eurasia compared to the other continents in terms of plants suitable for domestication, animals for domestication, and the minimum of geographical barriers for the spread of food production techniques and other ideas. Farming and herding allowed larger, more organized societies, and gave their members the opportunity to develop and disseminate writing and technology. As well, these societies, in close relation with their farm animals, evolved over generations immunity to many of the viruses the farm animals spread. The result was that when, some 500 years ago, the Eurasians came in contact with Native Americans, Australians and sub-Saharan Africans, the Eurasian guns, germs and steel swords, allowed the conquer, displacement and/or decimation of these latter inhabitants. In making this argument, this reference describes in easy-to-read language, the spread of humans around the world from pre-history until 11,000 B.C., domestication of wild crops and animals in different parts of the world, the rates of spread of food production in different parts of the world, the evolution of livestock-related germs, the development of writing in different parts of the world, the development of various technologies in different parts of the world, the development of government and organized religion in different parts of the world, the histories of Australia and New Guinea, the history of East Asia, the history of Austronesian expansion, the history of Africa, and a comparative history of the Americans and Eurasia.

Mr. Diamond's analysis of food production and the beginnings of farming, of why some animals can be domesticated and others not, and ultimately of why fifteenth and sixteenth century Europeans \\"won\\" and Native Americans \\"lost\\" are engrossing. These sections of the book are truly \\"page turners\\".For me, the book falters in the last third, repeating again and again material already covered, and perhaps becoming too fascinated with the author's own travels and experiences. In the end, though Mr. Diamond describes and wishes for a \\"science\\" of history, his own approach to some of the material is what really cries out for such an orientation. He has clearly done the homework and gathered the data for a rigorous mathematical analysis of why things have come out the way they have. Yet, such work is missing from the book.

A truly scientific approach could have really changed how we study history."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"In the epilogue to this book, the author states explicitly that his intent is not to discount the importance of intelligence to human survival. Rather, his intent is to explain the effects of environment on the developments of societies. It seems clear that random geographical effects alone cannot explain why Europeans had so much &quot;cargo&quot; of their own, while the indigenous peoples of Africa, Australia, and the Americas had so little. This book is a clear description of how geography and random luck influenced the development of societies.But there is much left unanswered. Diamond states that the east-west orientation of Eurasia contributed, in part, to the rapid diffusion of agriculture and other technology. But not all cultures of Eurasia evolved into world-conquering superpowers. For example, France colonized much of Southeast Asia. But according to Diamond's theory, Southeast Asia should have had about the same technology as France because both countries are Eurasian.Not all Eurasian cultures were so successful in their efforts to expand or even survive. For example, the culture of the Egyptian empires lasted for thousands of years but died out, and, has left little but a few crumbling stone tombs. But the culture of Greece had profound and fundamental influences on European and Muslim culture. According to Diamond, both Egyptian and Greek culture should have evolved into superpowers because they both developed in Eurasia. It was the Greeks who passed their ideas on; the Egyptians died and faded away.There is a non-geographical explanation of why the Egyptian empires eventually died out. These empires came to the point where vast amounts of the empire's production were spent, not on infrastructure for use by the living, but on vast resources for the dead! How long can a culture that glorifies death, and spends its treasury on dead emporors, survive? The Greeks did not value death, but knowledge. The Greeks spent time by learning new technologies or inventing better defenses. It's no mistake that the Greeks passed thier legacy on, while the Egyptians did not.So, much is accounted for by considering the geography in which a culture exists. The author needs to state at the beginning of the book that his treatment focuses on the deterministic causes of human societies. He should also state that deterministic causes alone cannot explain all outcomes of world history."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"An interesting analysis of history.

Always, the european way seems to be better in his view.He never mentions the quipu, the Incan record keeping tool that may also have been used as a primitive form of &quot;writing&quot;.He ignores the development of the boomerang in Australia, and downplays the great New World civilizations such as the Anasazi, the Inca, Tiwanaku, the Maya, Aztec, and many others.The book is a bit dated also-in the intro he discusses early man in the Americas and dismisses the evidence from Monte Verde, which has recently been supported by the discovery of other ancient early american remains such as the Spirit Cave remains, the infamous Kennewick man, and sites in argentina, and brazil of similar ages. Finally, rather than exploring the reasons why other cultures didnt develop civilizations like the europeans, why not discuss the directions of their civilizations? Given more time and less interaction with europeans, would the Cherokee, the Aztecs, the Tlingit, and many other groups headed for the same pattern as european cultures?

His intent is to prove his own belief that the reason mankind is the way it is because of its geography. By geography it means that different geographical areas with varying climates and natural resources directly influenced the path that mankind took in becoming the way it is today. It is, in a way, an attempt to explain human history in a way that it could have been predicted. However, it is arrogant to think that it was man's destiny to be this way. It is arrogant to think that the Spaniards were meant to conquer the Inca's and Aztec's and not have the Inca's conquer them. Luckily, the author points this out and makes it his intent to discover why it is not the other way around. If the events that are told are factual, he came upon the idea of explaining human history when a politician from New Guinea named asked him why the white man discovered such technological wonders instead of, say, a New Guinea highlander. The author realizes that most answers given would seem racist and sets out to discover why. Basically, he intends to answer Yali's question. He intends to look at human history as a science. He intends to only make assumptions based on scientific evidence and on a basis of solid genetics and logic. He intends to write a book to end all history books. He intends to give an argument so solid, so carefully planned, that no one could possibly argue with it. He intends to think of every possibility and examine every one of them to finalize its validity. In short, he intends to write a history of man that explains how we became the technology driven, world controlling, diverse peoples that we are. The author goes about explaining humanity by carefully examining every theory as to why different cultures in different regions evolved so differently from each other. Naturally the first thing he disproves is that there is a difference genetically in the peoples themselves. His discoveries prove quite contrary to the racist beliefs of the past. Modern medicine has taken the \\"civilized\\" world out of natural selection. However, the \\"uncivilized\\" portion of the world is still very much at nature's whim. Natural selection certainly doesn't favor the stupid or weak, so genetically the \\"uncivilized\\" are probably far superior to the \\"civilized\\". Analysis based on logic such as this takes up most of the book. Eventually the author settles that the turning point in deciding uncivilized versus civilized for a society is when that society adopted agriculture and a sedentary lifestyle. He deduces that a sedentary, agricultural lifestyle encouraged technological advancements and allowed for population growth and expansion. A certain amount of land can support more agricultural people then hunter-gatherer people. Through sheer numbers agriculture and therefore \\"civilization\\" spread across the world. Naturally the areas to discover agriculture first became more advanced quicker. Therefore natural resources played a big role. However, for this to be accepted as fact one must first analyze why agriculture arose in some areas and not others, how plants are domesticated and so on and so forth. Every explanation leads to ten more needed explanations which leads to 100 more explanations which continues for a couple hundred pages. Everything is thought of and no detail or factor of human history is left out, right down to how plants were probably domesticated through surprises found in excretions, the main way plants go about spreading from place to place. The details are accompanied by numerous graphs, tables, maps and pictures, which either repeat the details or explain them even more. The author goes about his task so meticulously and carefully that the details begin to bog everything down. Where the author is going with the information or why he is explaining so many details is often never explained. Some details seem unnecessary and irrelevant. Whatever point the author is trying to make is often lost in the details. The author goes about his task of explaining humanity by analyzing events in history and going into great detail as to how we came to be the way we are. However, the way it feels is that the author wants to bore the reader into submission in believing his view. The book is successful in what it was trying to accomplish, in that it logically explains how humanity came to be the way it is. However, it is not successful in being at all enjoyable. I felt as though I was being bombarded with facts and smothered with useless information. I suppose I was persuaded to believe that geography and its contributing factors lead to humanity being the way it is, but does it really matter? Were the hours I spent reading this book at all necessary? Was this book necessary? This book leaves me with questions like that. This book leaves me unsatisfied. Not once did it even try to answer or even pose the question as to whether civilized or uncivilized life is better. Not once does it attempt to tackle whether civilized life is more worthwhile or enjoyable or more rewarding. It seems to only answer questions that it can answer and avoid all that it can't. It seems afraid to try to answer questions of a more philosophical nature. The book concentrates so much on being only facts that it bored me to death. It hides from speaking opinions so much that it also hides from being even remotely interesting. Opinions may at times be controversial, but they are never boring. How this book won the Pulitzer Prize I do not know. This book was a boring collection of facts and logic. I would advise the reader of this review to ignore this book completely. Don't read this book unless you are in desperate need of a long nap."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"Although the subject of GG&amp;S is interesting, and does shed some light on why, when and how different civilizations originated/developed, the book is so repetitive, that I did not bother to read the last 50 pages.

He then states that his aboriginal friends of New Guinea are obviously more intelligent than white Europeans and wonders how the two cultures developed so differently.

Noting that many earlier writers have suggested an innate superiority of the population, he argues persuasively that it was in fact an accident of geography. In essence, as Diamond shows with solid evidence, the earliest civilizations in the Fertile Crescent area (roughly Iraq and parts of Syria) enjoyed unique advantages due to a large number of easily domesticable plants and animals. Domestication of plants and animals spread out from Iraq to other areas both East and West, giving Eurasia a jump start in technology. Technology, population growth, and urbanization interacted and reinforced each other to produce the combination of guns, germs, and steel that ultimately resulted, about 9,000 years later, in Europeans conquering the rest of the world. Along the way, he offers provocative answers to questions such as why European diseases devastated the native populations of the Americas, Polynesia, and Australia, but no diseases from those regions did real damage to European settlers.I should also note what this book is not, since negative reviewers here and elsewhere seem not to understand it. First, it isn't an explanation of why specifically Western European countries rose to global dominance. This topic is discussed only for a few pages, and only in the epilogue. And even then, the discussion is entirely a contrast of Western Europe vs China. Other outcomes that were at least hypothetically possible, such as global empires arising from India, Japan, or Korea, aren't even discussed, nor are such questions as why England thrived for centuries as an imperial power while Spain, with wealthier conquests, rapidly became a hollow shell that merely looked like a powerful empire on the map.It also isn't an argument that geography is destiny and culture is meaningless. Consider this passage from page 252: \\"Traditional New Guinea has conservative societies that resist new ways, living side by side with innovative societies that selectively adopt new ways. The result, with the arrival of Western technology, is that the most entreprenuerial societies are now exploiting Western technology to overwhelm their conservative neighbors.... The Chimbu tribe proved especially aggressive in adopting Western technology. When Chimbus saw white settlers planting coffee, they began growing coffee themselves as a cash crop.... In contrast, the Daribi, a neighboring highland people with whom I worked for eight years, are especially conservative and uninterested in new technology. When the first helicopter landed in the Daribi area, they just looked at it and went back to what they had been doing; the Chimbus would have been bargaining to charter it. As a result, Chimbus are now moving into the Daribi area, taking it over for plantations, and reducing the Daribi to working for them.\\"The above passage illustrates a point with an example from New Guinea. Diamond has lived for many years in New Guinea, performing research largely into bird populations, and has a clear fascination with the place. He starts the book with a question asked by a native New Guinean and a dedication to numerous Guinean friends; he returns there for discussion or examples in almost every chapter. Generally history on this global scale is written from a heavily Eurocentric or perhaps American perspective; Diamond's unique 'New Guineacentric' perspective adds to the appeal of the book.\\"Guns, Germs, and Steel\\" is skillfully written. Certainly it isn't light reading, but it is hard to imagine how a study covering such a broad subject matter, and analyzing in comparable depth, could have been more readable. I strongly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"I'm not sure what all the controversy is when it comes to this book. Diamond is not trying to eliminate any human cultural or technological factors when trying to understand why some nations produce \\"cargo\\" and others do not. He freely acknowledges them, but keeps taking it one step deeper to try and find the ultimate underlying factor. His answer? FOOD PRODUCTION.Nearly the entire waking existence of early man was spent in search of his/her next meal. Only through means of improved food production (either through domestication of animals, deliberate farming, or both) was the surplus created that allowed for man's energy to be spent on any other endeavor.The result of this \\"ultimate cause\\" allowed for the creation of \\"proximate causes\\" that allow certain nations to dominate others. Central governments, population density, immunity to disease, artisan classes, traditions of learning, technological innovation, etc.It appears much of the backlash against this book is due to Diamond's argument that only certain geographies had in place the natural resources and climate to develop the means for significant food production. However, this is a vastly different argument than the misinterpretation that geography was the key to cultural and political ascendancy. The point is food production, not geography!As a student of history (through formal training, not as a hobby), to me this book we enlightening. \\"History\\" has a starting point, and it is well into the autumn of man's existence. Peering back in time into prehistory is, by definition, impossible through historiographical methods. Diamond's multidisciplined approach is refreshing for any student of history who feels there is just more out there to learn. If anyone was a fan of Keegan's \\"A History of Warfare\\" in that it borrowed anthropological knowledge to better understand the origins of warfare, Diamond provides similar service in that he uses biology and geography to better understand the origins of mans ability to do more than worry about his next meal.The evidence is compelling. There simply were certain parts of the globe that could not develop means of significant food production in isolation. Those that could enjoyed a multi-millennia head start on developing the \\"proximate causes\\" of political/economic domination. The contenders therefore came from specific geographies--why among the contenders some came to dominate the others is still left for interpretation."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"This intriguing and expansive book gathers knowledge from a number of fields (archaeology, anthropology, ecology, evolutionary biology, horticulture, and more). Its novelty is not in the details, any of which can be found in other books, but in the synthesis of 13,000 years' worth of human history. Diamond argues that many (but not all) of \\"the striking differences between the long-term histories of peoples of the different continents have been due not to innate differences in the people themselves but to differences in their environments.\\"Diamond covers so much material that any attempt at summary would be imprecise. The sections I found most compelling dealt with agriculture and animal husbandry--two topics that would have probably induced sleep if covered by another author. For example, he presents the fascinating background that the dominant five \\"large\\" domesticated mammals--sheep, goats, cattle, pigs, and horses--originated in central Eurasia (and that no easily domesticated, large mammals were available, for example, to North Americans or Australians); that these animals include the world's only widespread \\"beasts of burden,\\" giving their human handlers additional advantages in mobility and farming; and that most of the world's lethal diseases resulted from proximity to the barnyard, gradually providing Eurasians with immunity to illnesses that later wiped out entire societies upon first exposure. The minor mammals (camels, llamas, reindeer) were too limited by geography and climate to affect the course of history outside their confines. As for zebras, bears, giraffes, tigers, hippos--to this day, nobody has been able to domesticate them. While this seems intuitively obvious, no writer has so clearly and irrefutably connected the dots, showing how access to these animals gave early chiefdoms an insurmountable advantage over those human societies without them and allowed them to develop surpluses and commerce that supported the world's most enduring civilizations.Comments made by the author's critics, while few in number, nearly prevented me from reading this book and need to be addressed so other readers won't be similarly discouraged. A few readers seem offended by Diamond's self-mocking and somewhat tongue-in-cheek assertion (in the Introduction) that the natives of New Guinea have certain advantages that make them arguably more \\"intelligent.\\" Yet these commentators are willfully ignoring the context: Diamond admits that \\"New Guineans tend to perform poorly at tasks that Westerners have been trained to perform since childhood,\\" yet he is quite aware of how \\"stupid I look to New Guineans when I'm with them in the jungle.\\" That is, if one defines \\"intelligence\\" not as the knowledge needed to use a computer or write a book review but, rather, as the ability to survive in the wild (\\"following a jungle trail\\" or identifying poisonous mushrooms, to cite two of the author's examples), then the New Guineans win hands down. To make a similarly lighthearted argument: when the house of cards we call \\"civilization\\" is threatened by the least misfortune (economic recession, power blackout, bad weather, the death of a British princess), a frightening number of otherwise \\"intelligent\\" people, instead of relying on their wits and survival skills, rush straight for their therapists.Likewise, anyone who accuses Diamond of \\"geographic determinism\\" cannot have read the epilogue, in which he clearly rejects such an extreme position. He admits that individuals and cultures--and, for that matter, pure chance--can also influence history, but \\"that some environments provide more starting materials, and more favorable conditions for utilizing inventions, then do other environments.\\" The author's argument is unambiguous: while culture, as well as individual inventors and rulers, certainly influence history on a microcosmic level (during spans of centuries or millennia), there are larger factors, such as geography and ecology, at play when human history is considered as a whole over the last 13,000 years. Diamond is looking at the forest rather than the trees; thus, to fault the author for ignoring such factors as religion and politics is off the mark, since such belief systems didn't exist in anything remotely resembling their present form for most of the period under discussion. Furthermore, to identify human advances in terms of culture still fails to explain how differing cultures arose in the first place.Finally, and more easily dismissed, are those hecklers who howl \\"political correctness.\\" Such critics seldom identify flaws in the author's arguments or even tell us what they insinuate by this increasingly meaningless term.Since the book's span is so sweeping and since many of Diamond's hypotheses are offered tentatively (as suggestions for a new \\"science\\" of history), there are bound to be statements or implications that may eventually prove inaccurate or too simplistic. I strongly suspect, however, that his overarching thesis will withstand the test of time; at the very least, \\"Guns, Germs, and Steel\\" will inspire open-minded thinkers to consider human history--in its broadest sense--in a whole new light."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"Carnage and Culture: Landmark Battles in the Rise of Western Power by Victor Davis Hanson is an interesting read. The central thesis of the book is that the Western style of direct decisive infantry warfare, with roots in democracy and capitalism, has been historically superior and partly responsible for the Western Worlds superior position. Hanson seeks to present his book as a kind of rebuttal to Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies by Jared Diamond.As to the latter objective. Hanson fails miserably for Hanson's and Diamond's theories are not inconsistent and Hanson's attempt to make them so detracts from the rest of the book.. Diamond's seeks to explain why it was the Spanish who conquered the Incas in 16th century Peru and not Incas who sailed to Madrid to conquer the Spanish. He theorizes that the Spanish had greater access to domesticatable crops and animals and European geography allowed for an easier exchange of ideas from other burgeoning societies. Hanson seeks to minimize the advantages of what Diamond speaks of and instead focuses on military strategy, and western economic and political thought. What Hanson misses is that without advanced military transport in the horse, the availability of sophisticated weapons, such as steel swords, rudimentary guns and cannon the Incas would never have been conquered.Hanson's own treatment of the conquest of Tenochtitlan (Mexico City) in 1520-1521 is the proof. The Mexican Army utilized infantry tactics, since they did not have any calvary. They fought decisive battles with their opponents, since like the ancient Greeks they had a war season. While the Greeks was based on the harvest, the Mexican was based on the harvest and religious considerations. While they also fought symbolic flower wars these were not the ones fought to protect their Empire.The Spanish, with several hundred Spaniards and thousands of natives under Cortez, were able to defeat the Mexicans. It was the horses, guns and eventually smallpox which were decisive. There can be no argument that Spain or Cortez operated in a democratic or that capitalism was the basis of their economy. One can even argue that what defeated the Aztecs was their penchant for human sacrifice and the desire to capture Cortez instead of killing him. In numerous battles the Aztecs could have killed Cortez but did not.Hanson's and Diamond's book build on each other and offer a compelling explanation to justify each others theories. Hanson unintentionally builds on Diamond's concepts to explain why societies with equal resources do not necessarily develop equally.Otherwise, Hanson's book is well written and very interesting. It is in the description of the battles and the campaigns where he excels. It would have been better if Hanson had dealt with some of the possible exceptions to his theory - the century old Ottoman Empire, the supremacy of the Prussian military tradition which was hardly based on notions of democracy and the Russian almost suicidal defense of their homeland at Stalingrad. Maybe he is saving that for his next book."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"1. The unrivalled extent of the Eurasian landmass allowed the proliferation of many different civilisations, between which information could be exchanged allowing far greater cross-fertilization of cultures.Wrong! However unified the Eurasian land-mass may look to a cartographer, it is intractably divided by formidable topographical features. Europe is isolated from Central Asia by the Alps, the Urals, the Caucasus, the Russian Steppes, the Taiga and the Anatolian plateau. East Asia is divided from Central Asia by the Thar desert the Himalayas the Gobi desert and the Tian Shan mountains. No significant cultural exchanges took place between these regions until the 15th century, by which time sub-Saharan Africa and America lagged far behind Europe and China in terms of technology and higher cultural attainment. Sub-Saharan Africa lies as close to the Fertile Crescent, regarded as the cradle of civilisation, as Western Europe and far closer than China.2. A diverse abundance of potential food crops is necessary in order for settled agricultural communities to flourish.Wrong! The Inca created a complex civilisation based on the cultivation of two food crops, the potato and maize. Large agricultural communities, like Cahokia in North America, flourished on the exploitation of maize. Western European agriculture was overwhelmingly based on wheat production, China's on rice.3.The European biome contained a greater variety of domesticable crops than Africa and America and these crops were more nutritious.Wrong! America had indigenous food crops which were more nutritious than European staples. Beans, corn, squashes and peanuts are superior to wheat and, if grown in rotation, create a self-replenishing agricultural cycle. Far from having no viable indigenous staples, Africa had okra, rice, sorghum, millet, the bambara ground nut, black-eyed peas, watermelons and numerous gourds and tubers, as well as immensely useful plants such as the oil palm and the tamarisk. African slaves actually introduced rice cultivation to the United States. The standard refrence on this subject is, \\"Lost Crops of Africa\\".4. Eurasia had more domesticable large mammals than Sub-Saharan Africa or the Americas.Wrong! Africa has indigenous breeds of sheep, goats and cattle which were spread from the Sudan to the Cape by 200AD. The South Americans domesticated the llama. The North Americans, like the Aboriginals of Australia, almost hunted their domesticable mammals to extinction. Why didn't Europeans hunt horses, cows and sheep to extinction?5. Only urban civilisations can develop the levels of technological skill and social organisztion required for military conquest.Wrong! The two greatest conquerors in history, Atilla the Hun and Ghengis Khan came from nomadic tribal civilisations. Rome was overthrown by nomads. The Indus valley civilisation was destroyed by Indo-European barbarians.6. The transmission of European diseases helped European nations conquer non-European nations.Wrong! The European nations had achieved such technological superiority to non-European nations by the colonial epoch, that there could be no serious question of a non-European army successfully resisting an attack by a European army. Europeans conquered huge swathes of territory with tiny armies (Pizzaro). Epidemic disease only became a factor post-conquest. In Africa, India and South America native diseases like malaria were just as deadly to Europeans as European diseases were to the indigenous peoples.7. China lacked the type of convoluted coastline necessary for dissidents to hide out in.Bizzare! Is Jared Diamond trying to claim that dissidents can only hide on convoluted coastlines? This is about as strange as his assumption that only large bodies of water constitute an effective barrier to trade and travel. China abounds in intractable wastes and remote mountain ranges where bandits and outlaws fled the authority of central government, the most obvious region being the famous water margin.8. Urban populations are less intelligent than non-urban populations.Western European civilisation sets a premium on education. Abstract reasoning skills are rewarded by better employment prospects, which in turn create enhanced relationship opportunities, meaning that intelligent people are encouraged to procreate with other intelligent people, unlike in Papua New Guinea, where the physical prowess is far more important than deductive logic.Europe and China developed the worlds greatest civilisations in regions which were no bigger than the regions inhabited by any other cultures, which enjoyed no great advantages in terms of agricultural potential, which had no special abundance of handy food crops and which had particular disadvantages in terms of climate. Diamond's theory sounds so incontestable because he has edited out substantial volumes of contradictory information with the skill and shamelessness of a Stalin era Commissar."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"Guns, Germs, and Steel is an academic exercise in junkyard salvage. Any mechanic will tell you that a car that doesn't run isn't necessarily trash. It can still be useful for the parts that the car is made of. This book is worth reading, not because its thesis is in working order - it's not - but because there is a wealth of interesting information in the parts that make up the thesis. If a reader can overlook the overly simplified environmental determinism, they can mine out fascinating nuggets of information ranging from crop domestication, to linguistic studies to human migration.From an argumentative perspective, the author establishes a non-falsifiable case. It is a pseudo-scientific masquerade where causation is conflated with correlation and where the entire cannon of diverse human history can be plucked through to find supportive theories and examples. The author upholds collaborating evidence because it collaborates, and discounts everything else because it does not. For example, he meticulously describes the evolutionary process by which corn was domesticated and changed from pinky-sized ears to the forearm-sized corn cobs that we enjoy today, but ignores and rejects the implications of human evolution caused by different selective advantages for a farmer and a hunter-gatherer over the same span of time. The thesis and the support are self-fulfilling, and argumentatively fallacious.In the final chapter, the author reveals his intention to bring scientific methodology to human history. The scientific positivism he proposes - which has long been rejected for social sciences because it fails to predict human behavior - strives to tell a tale of human development that unfolded a certain specific way and could not have unfolded in any other way.In the book's thesis-framing example, Pizarro leads 168 Spaniards to victory over 80,000 Incan soldiers. The author argues that the result was environmentally pre-determined and accordingly that there was no way it could have occurred differently. This is just one example by which he explicitly attempts to remove human agency from the equation of human history, with the penultimate goal of discrediting any claim that human differences account for differences in human history.The author's intentions are clear, as he is very careful to jump through politically correct hoops with disclaimer after disclaimer to appease his hypersensitive academic audience. Over and over again he assures the reader that he is not racist (which he proves by explaining how he thinks native New Guineans are more intelligent than American Whites, a politically correct - albeit racist - contention).The central problem with his thesis becomes evident in his final chapters when he tries - and fails - to reconcile the explanations of human pre-history with recorded accounts of modern-recorded history. The problem of human agency overwhelms an otherwise untested hypothesis. When writing about events for which there is no record beyond the ultimate terminal result it is easy to discount the impact of human decisions because there is no record of those decisions being made. Since the choice between A and B is not explicit, one can assume that there wasn't a choice at all using the perfection of hind-sight. Surely the Allied Forces had to land at Normandy (instead Pas de Calais or Italy) to win World War 2 because they won the war after landing at Normandy. This is the circular logic that permeates primary thesis: It had to happen because it did happen.But in the final chapters, he attempts to bring his theory of human development into the 20th Century and cracks begin to emerge. The success of Chinese Civilization which was predicted by environmental determinism choked and failed because of human choices (the choice of Eunuchs to shut down ports). The failure of Japan to adopt muskets resulted from the human code of the Samurai and the honor of the sword. Once human history - and the inevitable choices incurred by human agency - are recorded, there is more difficulty discounting the impact of those decisions.Ultimately, then, this book is not able to discount the impact of human agency or redirect the focus from human difference.Although the thesis is not compelling - largely because it overreaches - there is certainly use in the individual arguments that are made. Certainly, environmental conditions played some role in human history. The important caveat that needs to be made is that environmental variables helped shape but did not dictate the paths that human history took. Different people in the same environments would have lead to different results. The author all but admits this when he talks about the near-death of Hitler before World War 2, and the failed assassination attempt later.The sections on human migration, plant and animal domestication, and written language development are fascinating. The utility of this book is that it surveys such a broad range of topics, explaining extremely complex theories succinctly and in plain English. You don't have to be an anthropologist or a botanist to grasp the narrative prose. The author litters the pages with anecdotal evidence that, like the parts of a broken down car, can be taken out and reassembled into a car that runs.This reservoir of interesting, useful information makes this book worth the time to read, so long as one is sufficiently critical of the thesis. And just in case you are on the border, the book has pictures too."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"If you haven't read this book, you are in for a treat. This is the kind of book about which it can truly be said, I have only one regret, and that's that I've already read it! Or--even though the narrative runs to 426 pages--when one gets to the end, one wishes there were more. I'm trying to think if I've ever read anything comparable. In terms of scope, pure readability, interesting information, delicious ideas, a compelling thesis, worldly wisdom, etc., I can think of nothing. The closest would be something by Marvin Harris.Professor Diamond begins by rephrasing a question asked of him by a New Guinea man in 1972, \\"Why did wealth and power become distributed as they now are, rather than in some other way? For instance, why weren't Native Americans, Africans, and Aboriginal Australians the ones who decimated, subjugated, or exterminated Europeans and Asians?\\" (p. 15) A stunning question really. And Diamond answers it fully and in such a manner that there can be little doubt that he is substantially right. The answer of course is presented in the title, \\"Guns, Germs, and Steel.\\" How did the Conquistadors conquer the Aztecs and the Incas with a few score of soldiers against masses of resistence numbered in the tens of thousands? And how did the Europeans follow that up with the subjagation of the entire New World? In the first case, the answer is guns, horses and steel, and in the second case mostly germs, and mostly smallpox, a disease to which the Europeans had immunity because of their long association with cattle from which the disease evolved, while the Native peoples of North and South America had no such experience and no immunity. The fact that the first domesticated herd animals were from the old world and not the new is from the purely human point of view an \\"accident\\" of history and geography. Consequently, we can see that it was not the \\"superior\\" European culture that made the difference, but the factors named above and, I must say, pure chance.For those critical of this book I think it should be appreciated that this is not a history as such. It is a work more akin to anthropology or ethnology. Jared Diamond is a physiologist, so it should also be appreciated that none of this has any pretense to be original research. What Diamond set out to do, and did remarkably well in my opinion, is to explain for a general, educated readership in detail just why the cultural history of the world developed the way it did. This is emphatically not a work for scholars or scientists (although many have read the book with pleasure and have learned from it).And it is not a perfect book. The narrative is indeed uneven in parts, but this is a long, ambitious book, covering a lot of ground, so Professor Diamond may be forgiven for the occasional nod. His much contended statement that New Guineans are smarter than Europeans is a miss statement, of course. He should have simply said \\"as smart\\" (or as dumb, depending on your point of view), and left it at that. By the way, on page 408 he admits the statement is a \\"subjective impression\\" and can be contested. And yes, the book tends to the political correct, but I suspect that Diamond wrote it that way to anticipate and put aside such questions so that his main arguments might be appreciated without distraction. If you write anything politically incorrect in this day and age, there is the very real chance that the politically incorrect statement will attract all the attention and the rest of your book be ignored.And it is true that some of his substantive arguments--for example, the north-south axis of the American continents working against the spread of plants and knowledge--may be in error. (I sure don't know.) Or the idea that the indented coastline and connectness of Europe and China led to cultural advantage may be wrong. However, even if Diamond is somewhat awry the mark here, his arguments are interesting and stimulating; and for those who want to know more he gives suggestions for further reading near the back of the book. The fact that Diamond brought these ideas and others to a large readership is a positive thing in itself. Whether they are correct or not is not proven, of course, and indeed we can be sure that some of the ideas are wrong. But this is to be expected. Our knowledge of the world and how we came to be the way we are is an ever changing, every growing phenomenon. Diamond's book cannot be properly judged yet, but will stand naked after, say, another generation of scientific and scholarly progress has passed. At that time it will be interesting to compare his arguments with what is known and see where he was substantially correct and where he wasn't. For now I think the bottom line on this remarkable work is to just enjoy it, learn from it, and let it stimulate your mind, and take it from there."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"I really enjoyed this one, as I am in the select group of thinkers similar.

Your average racist would say that Australia would have developed a great civilization while Europe would have remained a region of the world where people today would still be throwing spears about. Mr. Diamond explores the progress of humanity by scientifically studying the factors that permitted and encouraged the growth of complex societies. A society is where it is because of geographical factors, and not because of any variables of intelligence or physique. What are these factors? The answers are fascinating:Societies moved from hunter/gatherer types to farmers because they lived in areas where potential food crops grew, and where animals capable of being domesticated lived. Most of the world's food crops originated in the Fertile Crescent of the Mediterranean. Many areas of the world such as Australia and much of the United States had no original food crops. Could it be that some people were just too stupid to recognize a plant's potential? No. Amazingly almost all edible plants were domesticated thousands of years ago, as were our domesticated animals. Australia had no animals capable of being domesticated while horses, sheep, goats, and pigs originated in, and spread quickly through the Euro-Asian continent. We learn some interesting facts about food plant development. Many plants became food because of defective genes. The wild almond tree is poisonous, but some trees were found with defective cyanide producing genes. They were cultivated. Wild peas have a gene that causes the pea pod to explode when ripe, which would make harvesting impossible. Pea plants were found that lacked this &quot;explosion&quot; gene, and so today we eat peas.Societies with domestic animals developed diseases that originated in these animals. (Measles, tuberculosis, and smallpox come from cattle; influenza from pigs). Thus Europeans decimated the Incas and Native Americans by passing on these germs. Incas and Native Americans had no domesticated animals (only the llama in Peru), so they could not fight back with germs of their own.Mr. Diamond presents an immense amount of evidence to show that all peoples are intelligent, and that the development of large, organized societies hinges entirely on varied local natural resources, and being in locations where natural barriers (deserts, mountains, oceans) did not preclude the sharing of resources with others. This is a most impressive work that provides the reader with insight into why hunter/gatherer tribes live together on the same planet with highly complex technological nations."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"There are not many books that are able to change one's outlook on certain issues, but this one has it for me. Biologist Jared Diamond's book asks why the people of Eurasia have ended up dominating all over the world. His explanations are ingenious and compelling: because Eurasia has an east-west axis (unlike Africa and the Americas, which has a north-south axis) inventions in agriculture in one place in the vast continent could diffuse to another with little difficulty. The exchange in agricultural innovations would later make way for future diffusions of technology, giving the continent a technological edge over other continents. Also, there was an abundance of plants and animals suitable for domestication in Eurasia. This would eventually favor population growth and urban settlement in Eurasia, unlike the other continents that remain sparsely populated. Living in settlements with people like him and domestic animals give way to plagues in Eurasia, but also, eventually, to people immunized against many germs. This meant than when the indigenous inhabitants of the American continent met the European invaders, they were decimated more by their germs than by their guns. Diamond's thesis had been very useful to me in understanding some of today's conflicts: for example, why the Arab-Israeli has persisted until today (this is not in the book, I'm just elaborating on his ideas). My guess is that the first Israeli settlers in Palestine thought the Arabs would be a bit like the American Indians, soon disappearing from the land and giving way to a superior civilization; yet Jews and Arabs are both Eurasians (and close cousins, at that) so the Jewish superiority over the Arabs ended up being only temporary and receding (I'm not very optimistic about the future of Israel, given the demographic trends).Overall, Diamond can be considered a believer in geographical determinism. This view was common in the West before Darwin and Mendel's discoveries made way for biological explanations between the various peoples, yet Diamond's arguments are very persuasive. Some people in the genes-are-everything crowd have criticized Diamond for dismissing the possibility of biological differences among the different ethnic groups (specifically on intelligence, which is really the thing people fear most). Diamond does not believe there are significant differences on intelligence between hunter-gatherers such as those he is familiar with on New Guinea and people on the developed world; it's just that the intelligence of the New Guineans is focused on such things as on how to get food from the hostile jungle environment, and this, of course does not get captured by standard intelligence tests. Here, though, I don't think why both geographical and genetic explanations cannot work together."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"An incredibly expansive romp through the development of human culture. Interesting theory on the rise of dominant cultures which makes a great deal of sense.Production of food and domestication of animals gives the culture an early advantage, allowing it to develop surplus, which allows the development of technology. Geography (north/south or east/west axis), the initial disposition of animals(not all animals can be domesticated), and agricultural resources (variety of edible plants) are key to getting the first early advantage.Thought provoking."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"I won't give a synopsis of the book as there are plenty of other good reviews that cover that. I'll just say I found this book to have a fascinating and compelling argument for why history has gone the way it has. I did not find it to be racist or even biased as the author goes to great lengths to explain his every viewpoint and provides plenty of valid reasons against any kind of bias.The biggest flaw of the book, in my mind at least, is that it is terribly repetitive. Diamond repeats the same points and conclusions many times. It gets to the point where you feel that entire pages could have been cut out and the book would have lost nothing. Aside from that however, it is an entertaining and informative read."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"I've seen so many critiques and reviews on the internet, from scholars and professional reviewers, that seem like they haven't even read the book. For almost every critique that can be raised, Jared Daimond addresses it in his book already. If you will just read the book yourself, in its entirety, you will see what I mean. This book and the broad explanations he puts forward are pretty much beyond reproach, not least because of their broad scope.Many criticisms can be refuted because the book focuses on the broadest patterns of history, taken over timespans of several hundred years or more.Another essential point to keep in mind before critiquing is that Daimond distinguishes between proximate and ultimate factors, and raises this distinction repeatedly throughout the book. So before raising a criticism, stop and considered whether you are addressing a proximate cause (like technological advances, or large population) or an ulimate cause (which will inevitably be reduced to one of a few factors which are the very premise of the book).These ultimate factors can be crudely boiled down to the following:1)Naturally occurring species of easily domesticable plants (species which are highly nuritious) and large animals.2)Geographical features (impassable mountains and deserts, location across differing latitudes and climates) that facilitate or impede diffussion of agriculture, technology, and population.--and that is the book in a nutshell. Those grossly reduced ideas I will carry with me forever and consider every time I hear an explanation of historical outcomes."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"..it wouldn't be \\"one damn fact after the other,\\" a comment on the study of history that Diamond references. His historical book is the antithesis of the \\"big man\\" version of history, so-and-so meets X, and says this and that, and decides Y. His is a study of history in its broadest swaths, examining the proximate reasons for a given outcome, but always striving to ground his work in the ultimate causations.One of the numerous strengths of this book is Diamond's multidisciplinary command of the increasingly fragmented fields of human knowledge. He can readily draw on linguistic theories, archeology, paleontology, literature, agriculture, etc. I found his brief explanation of Carbon-14 dating lucid, with the important emphasis on the recently discovered variability in this isotope in the earth's atmosphere over the last 50,000 years. He draws on his long anthropological experience in New Guinea to buttress his central premises, and I personally found his account of the human expansion into South East Asia, Australia and Polynesia most illuminating. Another high point was his description of the Spanish defeat of the Incas at Cajamarca in 1532.He provides very plausible answers to seemingly difficult questions as to how 168 Spaniards could defeat 80,000 Incas, as well as the central question of the book, \\"Yali's question,\\" why the \\"whites\\" had most of the \\"cargo,\\" and the New Guineans so little. His thesis is that the environment and geography are the paramount determinants, and it was where particular mammals could be domesticated, and certain grains could be cultivated that determined where \\"civilizations\\" would eventually arise. With a class of individuals not devoted to acquiring food full-time, they had the time to develop technological improvements to the human condition. In addition, an incidental condition occurred due to man's proximity to domesticated animals - diseases, which certain individuals developed immunity to, and which decimated populations not previously exposed, as in the Americas. He does not totally dismiss that quirky \\"human factor\\" of a few great and not so great men, and specifically speculates how the world might have been different if Hitler had been killed in the 1944 assassination attempt, or even earlier, in a 1930 car accident.Aside from the numerous thought-provoking aspects of the book itself, I found myself reading many of the 93 1-star reviews of this book posted at Amazon (out of at 1048 as of this writing). How could this many people strongly dislike the book? (By way of comparison, another best seller, Ayaan Hirsi Ali's \\"Infidel\\" has only 3 1-star reviews out of 216). Many simply denounced the book for being \\"politically correct,\\" meaning that he provided a non-racist answer for why some societies are more technologically advanced than others (but not necessarily happier!). Others fell asleep (!) reading this enthralling account of humankind's development, but I really could find no one who indicated factual errors (some were claimed, but I wondered if they had actually read the book, because they made assertions that Diamond did not.) I too looked for assertions I would contest, and felt his statement that the wheel would not have helped the people of Mesoamerica without domesticated animals to be incorrect (for anyone who has ever used a wheel barrel), but later in the book, Diamond also raises this point.Overall, a superlative book, and a start towards making the study of history a science."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"The Aborigines of Australia built mankind's first known watercraft 40,000 plus years ago, yet today they are the most primitive stone age people of any continent.

Or did it arise in colder climates more readily because people were trapped in their warm home with nothing else to do but experiment? Was it both?Most critics of this book sound to me like they have only read the summary on the back of the book. Their arguments are preconceived.Even if you are one of those critics, read it. Disagree with it afterwards if you still want to, regardless I think it will add new perspective to human history for you.

Certainly, the books presents some important limitations as commented in other reviews: the deterministic bias, the lack of consideration about free human will in the study of human history (I am sorry, but explaining the extinction of dinosaurs cannot the same as finding the causes of the conquest of America by Europeans), the quick dismissal of facts that contradict his theory (his explanation about the difference between the history of Europe and China is, at best, poor, at worst, pathetic).Overall, the book is worthy of being read.

Certainly geography plays a role in the development of civilization and his analysis of the interactions between geography, human development, agriculture, animal husbandry and disease is brilliant.Diamond logically and eloquently explains why the Incas and Aztecs were wiped out by European disease yet he does not explain why the Incas who were as mathematically adept as any culture on the planet had only achieved Stone Age technology despite adequate natural resources. While along the same time line in a span of 400 years 1000-1400 a.d. Europe went from the Dark Age to world dominance. At the same time China developed gunpowder but Europe discovered guns, why did China not overtake the west? Genghis Khan almost did it with horses, should not gun powder be the ultimate weapon for the Chinese?I think it is important to consider the relationship between humans adapting to its environment, and the environment adapting to humans. It is within this \`give and take' milieu gestating over 1000's of years which lead to the development of unique cultures and civilizations. To discover why \`civilizations clash' is perhaps left to other so named texts. Yes geography plays a role in the development of culture and society but it is not the sole factor. Diamonds book is an important text but it does not stand alone.

If you do not have time to read it thoroughly, then skim over some details and carefully read the last few pages of each chapter. Do read chapters 1 to 5 and the epilogue in full though. ***** SUMMARY and REFLECTION start here **Consider past and present major civilizations: Egypt, Greek, Roman, China, Arab, Western Europe. Why did almost all of them reside in Eurasia? The current exceptions, USA and Australia, actually prove the rule. They both are also built on European technology and people.Guns, Germs, and Steel explores broad patterns of the development of civilizations. Diamond proposes that neither luck, genetic endowments, nor great men have decisive influence on the fate of civilizations. Rather, it is environmental factors which reign supreme.Diamond's reasoning starts from the proximate factors which obviously helped European's conquests of much of the world. Three broad categories of factors played large roles in the process.1) Material technology, such as gun, steel swords, ocean-going ships.2) Social organization, especially political organizations and writing3) Epidemic diseases which most other people, especially native Americans, did not have resistance against.Why, though, have all those factors arise in most advanced forms in Eurasia, and not other continents? Diamond asked the question and came up with fairly curious answers:geography and speciesFirst, Eurasia is the largest continent on earth. Its larger size supports a larger diversity of wild plants and animals. Moreover, its measure over the east/west axis is much wider than any other continents. The east/west measure is important because species can spread much more easily along that axis than the north/south one. (Different latitude means different climates, which will be difficult for species to adapt to. Just imagine polar bears trying to live in tropical rainforests) Although the combined size of North and South Americas are over seventy percent that of Eurasia, its width is much less, which results in fewer diverse species in any one area.The geographical advantage (size and east/west spread) translates into a larger number of diverse species. Out of those candidates, there will be a few useful for and worth the effort for domestication. It turns out that Eurasia has the largest number of domesticable animals and plants.The paths to civilization began with lifestyle change, from hunting-gathering to agriculture. The latter is only possible when there are enough number of species suitable for food and other uses. People in Eurasia were the first to receive those gifts from nature, and thus they were the first to settle in villages. Agriculture brought food surplus and food storage, which enabled denser population and specialization of work. Certain people freed from the daily task of feeding themselves spent their time developing crafts, technology, and writing. Others acted as chiefs and priests to organize the community. In contrast, hunter-gatherers are more egalitarian-all members have more or less equal power and similar responsibility-but that also means they have few ways to invest in the future and long-term developments.So far we arrived at the reasons for more advanced technology and social organizations. What then to explain the deadly diseases carried by Europeans to the New World? It turns out that the same factor, domestic animals, were the sources of this most lethal gift of conquests.Why should we not attribute the rise of civilizations to great men? Certainly, men like Newton, Galileo, Alexander the Great, Shin Huang Ti played large roles in the unfolding of history. But they operated within the constraints of environment and cannot exert their influences beyond the support of their society and geography. Newton would be uninfluential had he born into an illiterate hunter-gather tribe, nor could he have a chance to learn enough math to develop sophisticated theories in the first place. Even if he had developed such theories, they would be buried unread for centuries.** CRITIQUE starts here **Under the broad limits of environment, though, we do have a choice. Einstein probably accelerated the development of theory of relativity for decades (if not longer) and thus exerted large influence on lives of many millions.A major concern Diamond failed to address without bias in this book is the interaction between environment and evolution. Since the environments surrounding people of different continents have been so different for thousands of years, wouldn't that change the nature of those humans in some way? Diamond alludes to the possibility that New Guineans are smarter than Europeans because the selection pressure for their intelligence is stronger in order to survive in the wild, while Europeans need to contend with deadlier diseases which bend the selection pressure toward immunity instead. It can be argued differently that survival-based selection plays lesser role than sexual selection. Men of high intelligence can in principle acquire more wealth and power and reproduce at a higher rate when they are in cities than in the wild. Arguments alone can never settle such complex questions. We need much more varied and balanced empirical facts to support any sweeping conclusions about our past. (In fact it is probable that no sweeping conclusions can ever be justified.)Diamond's thesis that environment is the overarching factor determining both cultures and fates of societies is convincing, but not the whole story--for he ignores a vital variable affecting us all, human evolution. For a far more detailed objection on this ground, search for \\"Michael Levin's review of Guns, Germs, and Steel\\" on the Web.-- Noppadon Kamol, Author of a book on Happiness (in progress)"},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"I picked up this book as a starter to understand the rise and fall of the North American native tribes. It turned out to be a lot more. I enjoyed reading Diamond's theory, and for the most part, he has been very convincing. There are points on which he relied heavily on circumstancial evidence (e.g., the almond tree), I think the possibility is certainly there, and with 80000 years to boot, occurance is quite likely.Although this book covers mainly geographical factors on the rise of civilisations, Diamond did later develop a second theory called \\"optimal fragmentation theory.\\" This theory accounts for contributions from human and sociological factors, which most reviewers find lacking in Guns, Germs, and Steel.In Diamond's defense, however, the subject of optimal fragmentation was briefly touched towards the end of the book, in the context of Chinese and European technological advances. Perhaps, at the time of writing, said theory was still being developed.This is one of the best written books I have read, and for a subject this vast and still relatively new, Diamond has done an excellent job in presenting it so that we, the laymen, can understand quickly and easily.I did find, that Diamond tried too hard to be politically correct. In my opinion, he could have condensed the last couple of chapters into two words -- ethnic clensing -- when he wrote about the near ethnic homogenity of China and Africa. Despite this, I think this book deserves the Pulitzer Prize."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"This is one of my favorite books regarding human development. It provides explanation for the success particularly of early and ancient civilizations and why there might have a disparity of technological development during the time of European exploration around the 1500s. However, outside the scope of this book (therefore I excuse it) are the internal intellectual, cultural, and political developments of monarchy, republicanism, and democracy as well as the necessary new social contracts between people in a high-population, low-marginal value individual that made concepts such individualism and liberty not only novel, but foundations of societal success and evolution. Once adopted, these concepts fueled certain civilizations to thrive beyond whatever were the particular limitations of their immediate environment.That said, it is still an excellent book on the subject of geographic determinism.However, and sadly, I have never read a more racist, bigoted book in my life. Reading the first chapter of this book is like time traveling back to the 1850's in terms of racial understanding. Although instead of being in the 1850's South, we find ourselves marooned up the Congo River under the sway of the quite-mad Kurtz for whom black is good white is evil. For instance, \\"modern stone-age people are on the average probably more intelligent not less intelligent than industrialized peoples\\". Care to provide any supporting evidence for this Jared?No, he doesn't. It's just another throw-away bigoted line like any other racist would toss out as if it were the truth. The whole first chapter reads like Jared Diamond's 'Mein Kampf'. I suspect the environment of his upbringing has some influennce here (he was born in 1937) and he is still fighting some long-since-forgotten demons from his youth. Isn't it more likely that both have similar innate levels of intelligence that are honed toward different sets of skills (his trying to build a shelter in the jungle example)? Why even bother mentioning this? Well, because he's a bigot of course and that's what bigots do, offend your sensibilities at every turn with illogical and ignorant statements.He should take a page from his book and live by his own words, \\"The objection to such racist explanations is not just that they are loathsome, but that they are wrong.\\" Yeah, WE know that, YOU obviously don't."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"... and smooth.

A long nasal shell was thrust through the septum of his nose and a fine cassowary feather head-dress adorned his head. Guantlets of plaited cane, decorated with cowrie shells and white feathers, were fastened to his arms and legs, and a bark belt fitted around his body with a white, triangular, pubic shell hanging from it.Still, I couldn't help but admire the intelligent way he could tell the correct shrub from the incorrect shrub, it was stunning really and proof to me that these people would soon take their rightful part in the white man's world and at a very high level.He asked if I might not like to enter his tribe's great house, or 'mene'.Beneath the fierce looking figure of Iriwaki, a veil of raffia-like fibres hid the interior of the mene which was about fifty feet tall at the highest point of a sharply sloping roof. To both the right and left of the entrance, in front of shields and totems cut from canoe wood, were the skulls of pigs and crocodiles, while above the shields, rows of pigeon holes had been constructed from the midrib of sago palms. In each of these was a human skull: most had been painted and worked up with clay or bees-wax and given eyes of cowrie shells so they looked like hideous faces.I was again drawn to the unbelievable intelligence of my host. A couple of days ago I had given him a message written on a piece of bark to relay to my wife. Upon his return, he had rushed off to a large group of his friends, waving the slither of wood. \\"Look what the white man has done,\\" he shouted. \\"See this wood: he made it talk! I took it up the hill and it told his woman everything. It talked!\\"Since it was his wedding day, the 'buguru' was reaching a climax and each man in the village was compelled to take my host's new wife, each making a gift of an armshell or necklace or some tobacco in return for her favors.Just then, to my horror, I realized that the great men's house, or dubu-daimo had just been completed - for such places were often dedicated with the blood of human victims, the slain bodies of which were dragged along their length. The New Guinea natives then commenced to club spear and stab to death my entire party.At once the clothes were stripped and the heads cut off. Braves dragged out the headless bodies and began to cut them up as women and girls rushed from their houses to carry off the cut up pieces to roast on fires for a cannibal feast.I don't know why they spared me, but I was once asked how many converts to Christianity I had made while in New Guinea, for I was a missionary, and I replied, \\"Converts? None. But if we can reduce the appalling infant mortality and induce them to adopt some of the rudimentary rules of sanitation; and generally make them happier and healthier natives, our work will not be in vain.\\"I didn't yet realize then, of course, that my native guide was hiding the native intelligence of Albert E. Einstein beneath his shaven and painted head! That is until Mr. Jared Diamond revealed it a mere hundred years from now."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"A sloppily thought out piece of unworthy, almost insulting speculation.

A ruthless editor could have pared this down to a readable, interesting book of about 100 pages.As a scientific paper, it is laughable. Of course, by publishing his personal guesses and speculation intermixed with generally accepted science, he neatly avoided experiencing a humiliating peer review and rejection.Diamond begins his investigation with a concious bias-- he clearely stated that his purpose was to parry the &quot;race- based&quot; view of civilized development. He then builds his case by accepting that which bolsters his arguments and discarding that which disagrees with his thesis. This approach &quot;ain't science.&quot; I can't argue with Diamond's conclusion but his case is weak.Outside of his New Guinea experiences (which we hear about ad infinitum) and his area of expertise, he is simply speculating on the possible causes of a known result. Diamond is trying to build a whole dinosaur out of a tiny bone fragment.The concluding remarks include the obligatory appeal for &quot;further funding&quot;-- the usual self-serving phrase heard so often these days. Diamond reveals his desire to elevate weak &quot;scientific&quot; disciplines to the level of hard science-- math, physics, chemistry, etc. and this harebrained idea simply diminishes his stature and-- indirectly-- his scientific credibility.As for the glowing reviews from others-- P.T.

So here's my contribution: what his book is really about is chaos/complexity theory although I don't think the author appreciates that. Complex systems are extraordinarily sensitive to initial conditions and the development of modern civiliation is a complex system. A few extra grain species in Iraq and presto, 5000 years later you end up with New York and London. The irony is that there's nothing deterministic about a complex system. It's totally unpredictable. The idea of determinism that prevades the book is an illusion of history viewed through hindsight."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"The central logical contradiction in Guns, Germs, and Steel is that Diamond makes environmental differences between the continents seem so compelling that it's hard to believe that humans would not become somewhat genetically adapted to their homelands through natural selection.Most of his readers must have assumed that natural selection can't work fast enough to diversify humans. But Diamond knows that's not true, as his own lactose tolerance illustration demonstrated.This mutation didn't begin to spread until people started milking animals sometime in the last 13,000 years. However, by now 98 percent of Swedes are lactose tolerant as adults versus two percent of Thais.This example of human biodiversity is hardly trivial: evolving the ability to digest milk has had a sizable economic and cultural impact on, say, the Swiss.Self-defeatingly, Diamond began Guns, Germs, and Steel by making a eugenic argument that New Guineans are smarter than whites because \\"natural selection promoting genes for intelligence has probably been far more ruthless in New Guinea than in more densely populated, politically complex societies...\\"Of course, the virtually tautological reality is actually that while New Guineans are, on average, no doubt better at Stone Age life than you or I would be, people whose ancestors have survived for many generations in \\"densely populated, politically complex societies\\" tend to be better at functioning in \\"densely populated, politically complex societies\\" -- i.e., the modern world.Diamond lectures but almost never debates. I've only heard of one time when he allowed himself to be dragged into a public discussion with a well-informed opponent (an NPR call-in show with his critic Victor Davis Hanson).I talked to Diamond once after he gave a speech. We were chatting nicely until I asked him a tough question along the lines outlined above: Wouldn't different agricultural environments select for different hereditary traits in different locales?I mentioned how James Q. Wilson's \\"The Marriage Problem\\" has a couple of chapters on how tropical agriculture in West Africa affects family structures. Since women can often raise enough food to feed their kids by themselves, men don't invest as much in their individual children. So wouldn't the kind of man with the most surviving children be different in a tropical agricultural environment, where he doesn't need to work too much to support them, than in a temperate agricultural environment, where he does?Now, Diamond has spent a lot of time birdwatching in New Guinea, which is similar to Africa. So he knows all about what tropical agriculture selects for. But he had no intention of touching that tar-baby with a ten-foot pole. To get away from me and my question, he grabbed his papers and literally dog-trotted at about 5 mph out of the auditorium!Diamond can run, but he won't be able to hide from the facts forever. I hear there are now several scientific papers in the publication pipeline about racial differences in genes that affect cognition and personality, each comparable in importance to the recent blockbuster paper on the genetic roots of high Ashkenazi Jewish IQ.In summary, while there is much good material in GG&S; (although it's boringly presented), the political correctness that made Diamond into a media superstar saps the book of usefulness. His more courageous earlier book, \\"The Third Chimpanzee,\\" is, while outdated in places, much more fun and thought-provoking."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"Diamond makes an argument that could turn biological arguments for racism and racial superiority on their respective heads. He explores proven causes of societal advancement, things as basic as the availability of nutrient rich foods and domesticable animals, and shows the impact they have on the development of any society.Despite the moans of earlier reviewers who are still clinging desperately to the notion that less advanced societies are the result of less advanced minds, Diamond explains that there is another, more plausible argument - one that can not only explain differences between populations that are genetically identical, but which can explain the very rise of civilization itself from the humblest beginnings.For example, even among different (closely related) Pacific islands there are marked differences in their advancement. Some developed kingdoms and others were still hunter-gatherers. Diamond shows effectively that their advancements correlate DIRECTLY to their access to resources, ie on islands with poorer food sources you see far smaller populations, and therefore simpler social structure and fewer innovations so people may live the same way for generations. Islands with better food sources can support bigger populations with the same initial technologies as the other islands, then more stratified social classes emerge since everyone doesn't have to hunt or farm to eat. Bigger populations need more social laws which need more complex governments to enforce them, and much more competition between individuals to stay on top which leads to more and better changes in all aspects of society.All types of societies are descended from lowly hunter-gatherers at some point. If it were true that those less advanced societies bred low intellect, no society would ever have advanced in the first place. Those who still insist upon (and benefit from) the old ideas of racial superiority can never understand the weight of this book without challenging the very premise on which they stand. If you are open to an honest, thorough explanation of cause and effect in human diversification, this is your book."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"A disarmingly easy read on a controversial topic.

It's clear to me that regardless of race or culture, no particular subset of humanity averages smarter or \\"better,\\" and yet, some are tremendously advanced while others are still trying to jumpstart their societal development.Diamond does a great job of explaining how various factors of geography and agriculture lead to the beginnings of civilization and spread in various directions at various rates. The check on the theory, of course, is the Mississippian Culture of North America, that achieved cities in the tens or hundreds of thousands, only to collapse under the logistical strain and hygiene issues they were not placed to resolve. I'd never been a supporter of the extermination theory of Ice Age megafauna, but Diamond presented it in such a way I'm forced to concede the point, and I'm notoriously hard to sway.I can't give it four stars, because I would liked to have seen more figures and references rather than the overview given. It's certainly detailed and thorough, but is more a public presentation than scholarly. This does make it more accessible and readable, and is clearly what was intended, but I would have appreciated a more technical work.As others have noted, reviewer Agnew, who ironically boasts degrees in literature and law, clearly has not read the work, because his criticisms are directly addressed in the text.

I was a reluctant reader of this book initially, thanks to the thickness of the book and the seemingly distant fields of knowledge touched on, such as, epidemiology and archeology. However, I was proven wrong.The writer employs lucid writing to explain how archaelogical evidence actually point to the fact that all of us originate from the African continent. After our ancestors migrated to various parts of the globe, their destinies were affected by geographical factors, which in turn affected their abilities to form organized government, manufacture sophisticated weapons, procure food and develop writing. Interspersed with diagrams, tables, maps and picture of aborigines, the book convincingly demolishes the grounds for racist theories by relying heavily on scientific evidence.The book is simple enough for readers with no background information at all to understand it, yet comprehensive enough in its coverage to satisfy the needs of more seasoned readers.

Why did New Guineans wind up technologically primitive, despite what I believe to be their superior intelligence?&quot;The author assesses superior intelligence based on the native's ability to find their way in the jungle, where Europeans find themselves lost. In this way, the uniquely human ability to abstract knowledge symbolically is discarded as a sign of intelligence in favor of finding ones way around a jungle -- an ability found in creatures with microscopic brains.The author says New Guinean's genetic superiority is due to their not being affected by indiscriminate diseases like Europeans. They were naturally selected for intelligence. Specious stuff -- and the book is filled with it.The West obviously dominates encounters with other cultures due to superior technology, organization, etc. This does not yield the right answer, so these are called proximate causes. In order to get the right answer (dumb luck), it is necessary to push the origin of the advantage back 13,000 years into conveniently prehistoric times.The author is up-front with his intentions; one knows from the start the book third world are the same -- or preferably -- better than we are, despite the actual results obtained, evidence of which we see around us generation after generation.At times, the author seems unhappy with civilization. We live in a world dependent on complex systems we don't have the time or ability to understand. If ones feels guilty about seemingly unearned material wealth, its easy to feel (falsely) virtuous by identifying with those who don't have it.One major problem is the author assumes that human history is only a product of economic forces. He speculates whether individuals have any effect on the broad sweep of history before concluding they probably don't.Others who think like this are usually called Marxists. Replace the book's take on aboriginal people with the proletariat and the underlying philosophical assumptions lead in the same direction. The author is probably not a Marxist, just starts with a set of assumptions that lead inevitably to its rediscovery.Marxism has been discredited at tremendous cost, yet keeps popping up to delight Pulitzer Prize committees and PC types in academia. They share interest in pushing the buttons and turning the knobs to direct the automatons that are us toward their perfect society. They have adopted a material-causation worldview at odds with reality; it keeps failing. They don't know why, since they are barely aware of their underlying assumptions (or the alternative is unthinkable). Thus, the same erroneous ideas keeps recycling in different guises, always with the hope the next take will be the guide to man-made Utopia.A different &quot;assumption&quot; one could make is that humans are moral agents who initiate new chains of cause-and-effect without preceding causes. This assumption is supported by most of human history in that people who accept it as true create things of lasting value. It would have resulted in a totally different book.By instead adopting the (failed) materialist model of human history and treating people as automatons responding to economic forces, the author ends up writing a book filled with interesting but often selective facts, linked by irrelevant conclusions that can only mislead people from actual lessons of history.Truth, justice, and fully realized human potential will not be found by romanticizing the desolation of the Third World or by propping up stone-age peoples while denigrating &quot;ourselves&quot;. Just the opposite.But there are those who feel a spiritual calling they cannot respond to directly due to their irreligion; they think they find it by taking responsibility for those worse off than themselves. Others just know that if they can turn the whole world into the Third World, it's easier to be &quot;on top&quot;. Kings need peasants. It is these two groups for whom this book will click. How else can one explain the dismissal of math, science, philosophy, in favor of &quot;jungle knowledge&quot; as a sign of intelligence?"},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"Jared Diamond is a biologist writing about social science in Guns, Germs, and Steel. In a way, this book is a rebuttal to The Bell Curve; that book argued that Northern European Caucasians were inherently superior, and inferred that efforts to bring other races to equal status would only waste time and resources.Diamond's book is equally skewed, arguing that Europeans have accomplished nothing to reach their powerful position, but merely benefitted from fortuitous environmental factors. Perhaps a qualified social scientist could have effectively argued this case - but I doubt that any would try.Diamond makes many egregious errors, combined with clumsy oversimplifications. Time and again, he shows an ignorance of and disinterest in historical or cultural causes for the outcomes he describes; he always attributes these outcomes to technological or biological factors instead. His interpretation of Cortes' conquest of the Aztec Empire should make any Latin American historian weep.It's incredibly saddening that this book has reached such a large and credulous audience."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"I read this book some years ago, and provided many \\"aha\\" moments. Diamond's explanations are extremely compelling, even to someone with more than a passing education in history, geography and historiography. Of course, they are all a \\"just so\\" story, rather than an accurate representation of how things turned out. Geography *of course* is important in the historical development of different nations and civilizations. Is geography (along with associated factors of agricultural technology, domesticated animals and his pained explanation about why Europeans were better with guns than the Chinese who invented them) the only factor in why Western Civilization grew to dominate others? Of course it isn't. Europe had no unique access to these things: Asian civilizations had arguably superior such advantages. Victor Davis Hanson makes a similar \\"one factor\\" argument in his book \\"Carnage and Culture.\\" Hanson's argument is that Westerners are simply better at war than other civilizations, because most Westerners were influenced by the Ancient Greeks, who developed a superior method of combat and of developing innovations than other nations did. Is Hanson's theory 100% the One True Answer? No, the rise of Japan and the invincibility of Mongol raiders rather puts his theory to fault, but it's at least as important as geography. There are all kinds of \\"one factor\\" arguments possible, all of which could make for as convincing a book as this one. Victorian historians thought it was the vigor of \\"nordic\\" civilizations which made Western world domination inevitable: also convincing if that was the only book you had read on that particular day, and also ultimately deeply silly (basically, this means the West dominates because it is dominant). Other Victorian historians made out human history to be the product of great battles, all of which had a huge element of random chance. Spengler also famously thought of civilizations as \\"cultural organisms\\" which eventually get old, become frail and die, just like any other organism whose telemeres have gotten shorter. I would imagine, like in, say, finance, the actual explanation for history is kind of complicated. I bet the Greek way of war has something to do with it, along with geography, culture, the Catholic Church, language and a whole lot of random chance. It's nice to think we know exactly why something happened, but a lot of what happens in the world, especially the world of human beings, is just plain random noise. Putting one factor explanations on history as Diamond does is not particularly helpful.There is also the matter of historical perspective. Diamond writes as if everything leading up to the present time of European world cultural domination were some kind of historical inevitability, and that *of course* -thus it will always be. This is the sheerest nonsense. At various times in human history, \\"Western Civilization\\" consisted of illiterate barbarians living in mud huts. In very recent times in human history (like, say, the 1930s), it kind of looked like that's where the West was heading again. Other civilizations culturally and physically eclipsed or dominated the West through history: the Japanese, the Chinese, the Islamic civilizations, Egyptian, Assyrian, Mongolian, Persian or Russian (if you count them as different, which I do) civilizations made Western civilization irrelevant through vast swathes of human history. Such civilizations may again eclipse Western civilization. Just to take one example, the Zoroastrian Persian civilization lasted longer than Rome, covered more territory and was in many ways more advanced: they even generally beat the Romans in warfare in the middle east. Why should I privilege the Romans over the Persians, just because some nations who were rather vaguely influenced by Rome now dominate the nations who were influenced by the Persians? I privilege them because they are my cultural ancestors, though in 1000 years, the poetry of Rumi may be more important than that of Martial.Finally, there are the matters of Diamond's historical veracity and bigotry. To address the second thing first, he seems to take a sort of perverse glee in making racial pronouncements to the detriment of \\"Western\\" people. According to Diamond, Western people are dirty, and have developed special immune systems; something I find hard to believe, and doubt is backed up by anything resembling statistical fact. Why wouldn't east Asians have developed superior immune systems? They lived in cities longer than the ancestors of most Westerners. Also, according to Diamond, he can tell that the average New Guinean is \\"on the average more intelligent, more alert, more expressive and more interested in things and people than the average European or American. (page 20, along with a tortured explanation of why Diamond's vacation perceptions are supposed to be superior to a century of psychometric research)\\" This is the sort of casual bigotry that used to inform Nordicist history about the dominance of the West, except somehow it becomes politically correct when pointed at Western people in modern times. Personally, I figure this just makes Diamond a garden variety modern bigot: a late 20th century version of a pith helmeted Kipling type who yammers on about \\"lesser breeds without the law.\\" To make matters worse, he's also empirically wrong: New Guineans have an average IQ of around 85, wheras Europeans and Americans are closer to 95 or 100, depending where you look (source; wakipedia). His historical veracity leaves rather a lot to be desired as well. I don't think he actually *knows* any history, other than the type of silliness you pick up in High School history classes. Diamond is a professional zoologist by trade, and it shows. For example, his ideas about China would be laughable to a Chinese person conversant with their history. He also got some of the dates and a lot of facts wrong about the conquest of South America. Sure, lots of Aztecs and Incas died of disease: most of them *after* they were conquered by the Spaniards. In fact, the few Spaniards there were were far more afflicted by tropical diseases than were the Aztecs: this is recorded historical fact. Yet, it doesn't fit Diamond's \\"Westerner as plague rat\\" theory, so he doesn't think to bring it up. Either he learned his history of the conquest of South America in a comic book, or he's deliberately misleading the reader. This is a complete travesty, and rather indicates you shouldn't trust anything else he's stated either.When people find out I write about history, the often bring this book up. I tend to politely change the subject. Everyone who reads this book thinks they're uniquely enlightened for having read it. In reality, they've been duped by a half baked popular writer who knows very little about history, and has some very ugly views about humanity."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"Diamond starts the book bashing The Bell Curve, saying that no variability in intelligence exists between the races, which is fine, if you're providing evidence to refute an arguement (he doesn't, it's all anecdotal). He then goes on to discredit himself by declaring, in the last few pages of the first section, how much smarter New Guineans are than Europeans (not all other humans, but specifically Europeans, which by implication means that Europeans are dumber than all other human beings). The rest of the book is like this. Every chance he gets he notes the unexceptional achievements of the West. It's all due to geography and absolutely, positively nothing else. Not the scientific enquiry that Europeans invented, then perfected; not the idea of liberty, which no other society thought of, but an idea the West was kind enough to export; China, apparently, is a victim of geography, not a self-imposed oppression that chokes off anything that might challenge it's political leaders; the barbaric attrocities committed in Africa is due to geography, not ethnic hatred; and on and on. Diamond is deafeningly silent on all these points. In other words, culture, political systems, economic systems, nor anything other than geography, plays a role in the course of civilization's evolution.This, of course, is absurd because there are numerous counter examples of a society or city collapsing, only to have the same geographic location become a cultural, political, economic success because of the differences in culture, politics, and economics between the failed society and the successful one.His political correctness is so out of control that he actually uses [sic] when using a direct quote because the author of the quote had the audacity to use \\"man\\", instead of some gender neutral term. Diamond would never be so insensitive to women as to use \\"man\\" when talking about mankind, probably another term Diamond wouldn't use because it's not gender neutral enough for him. I have a vague recollection of some of the more interesting ideas in this book, but I can't really remember most of them, because I was so disgusted with his outrageous bias and political correctness."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"I listened to this (unabridged version) twice, once casually, the second time carefully. The first time I really enjoyed it, and thought he was plowing new ground. But there were nagging doubts...thoughts that would not go away. And so I listened again, and it seemed less logical the harder I pondered it. As everyone knows, Diamond's thesis is (basically) that the \\"winners\\" in the game of life (we westerners and a few Asian societies) got that way not through hard work and dedication, through discipline and having a flexible yet strong culture that encourages growth and values the individual. No, we basically lucked in to our success. It is for this reason that there are no skyscrapers in wildest Borneo, that the tribesmen of New Guinea do not have cellphones and satellite TV.This is an intoxicating thought to those who, a little or a lot, loathe the West. But the logical inconsistencies are so blatant that, once Diamond's satin prose has worn off, they cannot be explained away easily. Why are today's winners yesterday's losers? Why did France go from howling backwater, to a powerful empire that covered the globe, back to its present state as nearly bankrupt social welfare state? Surely climate and topography, soils and water, did not change THAT much from the period of AD 1000 to AD 2000. The same can be said for Britain, Rome, Venice, and on and on.Diamond is an outstanding writer - I mean truly gifted. He makes the humdrum spring to life. He chooses examples and asks questions that are compelling and fun to read and think about. But it would be very easy (witness all the happy, glowing reviews) to stop there. I don't pretend to fully know why the West won, but it has. Hands down. There is a crescent of commercial success rimming the Pacific, but every winter the hot new flu comes from China for a good reason - millions of people in China still live with their livestock, and this in a culture that once put the empires of Europe to shame.Some cultures get it, others don't. Maybe it's as simple as that. An illustration: in the world of sailing and sailboats, there is a body of sailors that admire the \\"junk\\" rig, used on Chinese junks. There are those that scoff at it, preferring the traditional western sail plans. One wag of a writer put it best, \\"The Europeans sailed to China hundreds of years ago. The Chinese haven't sailed to Europe yet.\\" An oversimplification, but one that bears thought. Diamond's book deserves thought, too. And the more thought you give it, the more you'll see he started with a conclusion, and wrapped a book around it. That's not the way we got where we are today, and Diamond should know that. But then, I suspect he just doesn't \\"get it.\\""},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"GenesDiamond sets out to demonstrate that geography and environmental factors alone explain differences in development. At the outset he rules out biological factors. However, he then goes on to suggest New Guineans may be smarter than Westerners due to the selection pressures imposed by their environment and culture. Incredibly for an evolutionary biologist, Diamond overlooks that this process of gene-culture co-evolution could have likewise lead to different average behavioural traits between populations. Diamond writes:\\"My perspective on this controversy comes from 33 years of working with New Guineans in their own intact societies. From the very beginning of my work with New Guineans, they impressed me as being on the average more intelligent, more alert, more expressive, and more interested in things and people around them than the average European or American is....It's easy to recognize two reasons why my impression that New Guineans are smarter than Westerners may be correct. First, Europeans have for thousands of years been living in densely populated societies with central governments, police, and judiciaries. In those societies, infectious epidemic diseases of dense populations (such as smallpox) were historically the major cause of death, while murders were relatively uncommon and a state of war was the exception rather than the rule.\\"Recent genetic research shows that many human genes have been shaped by cultural forces (gene culture co-evolution). These include genes involved in brain function and that appears partly in response to the social transition as people moved from small hunter-gatherer groups a hundred strong to villages and towns inhabited by several thousand. Evolutionary changes in the genome could help explain cultural traits that last over many generations as societies adapted to different local pressures and in turn affect different rates of development.For some reason Diamond doesn't consider the possibility that selection for densely populated societies with central government and police would impact on selection for with reproductive success depending on being able to play by the rules. Successful individuals would be those who had a higher threshold for expression of violent behavior, especially when acting on their own initiative. Another aspect here is the role of polygamy and female farming societies and the extent this would affect selection for 'Big Man' traits as opposed to more dour characteristics.More recent books have discussed some of this research - for example NY Times science writer Nicholas Wade's \\"Before the Dawn\\", 'The 10,000 Year Explosion: How Civilization Accelerated Human Evolution\\", and UC Davis economist Greg Clark's \\"A Farewell to Alms\\" and subsequent papers on human domestication are useful. Clark, in particular notes:\\"...the arrival of settled agriculture and stable property rights set natural selection on a very different course. It created an accelerated period of evolution, rewarding with reproductive success a new repertoire of human behaviors - patience, self-control, passivity, and hard work - which consequently spread widely.And we see in England, from at least 1250, that the kind of people who succeeded in the economic system - who accumulated assets, got skills, got literacy - increased their representation in each generation. Through the long agrarian passage leading up to the Industrial Revolution man was becoming biologically more adapted to the modern economic world. Modern people are thus in part a creation of the market economies that emerged with the Neolithic Revolution. Just as people shaped economies, the pre-industrial economy shaped people. This has left the people of long settled agrarian societies substantially different now from our hunter gatherer ancestors, in terms of culture, and likely also in terms of biology.\\"NeuroscienceIn terms of differences in visual memory Diamond apparently was unaware of research in Australia showing that Australian Aborigines score particularly well in this respect. Clive Harper, a professor of pathology in Sydney, found that the visual cortex - the part of the brain used in processing and interpreting visual information - was about 25 per cent larger in aborigines than in Caucasians (Klekamp 1994).It's interesting that Diamond avoided neuroscience research. It might have given him pause about his starting point that cognitive ability was not a factor in developmental differences. With regards to the heritability of brain size, based on a review of 14 twin studies using CT to measure brain size, Peper et al. (2007) found a .81 heritablity of global brain measures, .66-97 heritability of brain volume, and .82/.88 heritability of grey/white matter. Moreover, based on a twin study, Posthuma et al. (2002) found a .30 genetic correlation between general intelligence and brain volume, replicating the findings of Pennington et al. (2000), who found a genetic correlation of 0.48 (as cited in Gignac et al, 2003).As for cranial capacity differences between regional populations, Beals, et al. (1984) found an average Asian, European, and African cranial capacity of, respectively, 1380, 1362 (sd = 35), and 1276 (sd =85) (N= 20,000); they attributed the selection to cold weather adaptation. Holloway (2002) found a B-W difference of 63 grams (N = 1,391 W; 615 Black). Similar findings have been found based in imaging studies (see 5). In their study, Isamah, et al. (2010) found that African Americans have 1 SD less total cerebrum volume than European Americans.It has been found that population craniometric differences align with genetic differences. As Hubbe et al. (2009) note:\\"...several studies have demonstrated a geographic structure in modern human craniometric diversity on a global level (e.g., Howells, 1973, 1989; Hanihara, 1996). Craniometric data have been found to follow a common geographic pattern with genetic markers, including both classical and microsatellite DNA markers (Relethford, 1994, 2004a, 2009; Manica et al., 2007; Betti et al., 2009).\\"Cranial capacity positively correlates with latitude and population density both which are positively intercorrelated.Other argumentsProfessor Diamond discusses three major geographic factors that greatly delayed the adoption of agriculture in those other regions:1) Flora. Compared with Eurasia, the other regions had a dearth of edible plants that were suitable for domestication. For example, the wild ancestors of domestic wheat and barley grew in the Middle East, but they were not present in SSA, Australia, or the Western Hemisphere.2) Fauna. Compared with Eurasia, the other regions had a dearth of large animals suitable for domestication. For example, the wild ancestors of domestic sheep, goats, and horses all lived in Eurasia 10,000 years ago, but they were not present in SSA, Australia, or the New World.3) Orientation of geographic axes. Unlike Eurasia, which has an enormous geographic span in the east-west direction (much greater than its span from north to south), the geographic axes of the other regions are \\"tilted,\\" with relatively short eastwest spans and relatively long north-south spansThis last factor is important because most domesticated plants cannot readily be grown in regions of different climate, nor in regions having markedly different growing seasons. Therefore, although the use of such plants in agriculture can spread rapidly in the east-west direction, it cannot spread readily in the north-south direction. Dr. Diamond suggests that the same is true for livestock, and for the spread of inventions.Eurasia, and particularly the Middle East, did have a far greater supply of useful and easily domesticable plants and animals than any other region. It is also true that both Australia and the United States were badly lacking in such species. However, the facts do not support his theory when it is applied to a comparison between sub-Saharan Africa and Mesoamerica.1) Flora.Dr. Diamond rightly stresses the importance of cereal crops in the rise of agriculture. The only useful wild cereal that grew in Mesoamerica was teosinte, the ancestor of corn. However, teosinte is not nearly as nutritious as wild wheat, and it was far less amenable to domestication. In contrast, sub-Saharan Africa possessed five useful cereal crops: sorghum, bulrush millet, finger millet, teff, and African rice. It seems, therefore, that SSA had an advantage in this regard.As a result, the innovations made in different parts of Eurasia soon became used in other parts of the continent, whereas innovations made in different parts of the Western Hemisphere (or Africa, or Australia) did not easily spread to other parts of those regions.(Sub Saharan Africa had useful non-cereal crops, including yams, cowpeas, watermelon, oil palm, and groundnuts; but these were balanced by the availability in Mesoamerica of beans, squash, tomatoes, and sweet potatoes.)2. Fauna.Few regions contain as many species of large animals as SSA, but Dr. Diamond insists that none of the wild species there are domesticable. For example, he states that zebras, although very similar to horses in anatomy, are hopelessly irascible, and points out that recent attempts to tame them have all failed.This is unconvincing. Wild horses were long considered to be untamable animals, as was the aurochs (the wild ancestor of domestic cattle), but both were domesticated in time. Until we have spent at least a few centuries trying to domesticate zebras, we should not rush to the conclusion that such attempts are hopeless. However, even if it turns out that zebras are untamable,It is not correct that Africa did not possess any potentially useful farm animals. The wild ancestor of domestic cattle -- the most useful of all farm animals -- was indigenous to North Africa,5 and domestic cattle were being used in the Sahara by 5.5 kya, probably earlier,6 and south of the Sahara by 5 kya.7 (The Sahara was much wetter several thousand years ago than it is now.8) In addition, domestic sheep and goats were introduced into Africa by 7.5 kya,9 and their use had spread south of the Sahara by 4 kya. Mesoamerica, on the other hand, did not have a single large domesticable animal, since most of the megafauna in the Western Hemisphere had been killed off by the Paleo-Indians by 11 kya. As regards fauna, therefore, SSA had a great advantage over Mesoamerica.3) Orientation of geographic axes.In Mesoamerica, the longest east-west span (from the eastern tip of Yucat&aacute;n to Mazatlan, on the west coast of Mexico) is only 1300 miles. Contrast this with sub-Saharan Africa, where a vast stretch of savannah (the Sudan, situated between the Sahara and the tropical rainforest) stretches 3500 miles in an east-west direction, from the highlands of Ethiopia to Senegal. It is clear that transmission of technology and domesticates could -- and repeatedly did -- take place along the Sudan, and also across Ethiopia.Furthermore, sub-Saharan Africa was not completely cut off from Eurasia, and some important aspects of Eurasian technology and culture did reach SSA. Techniques of pottery-making, bronze working, and ironworking reached SSA from the Middle East, as did the use of domesticated camels. (In addition, as already mentioned, domestic sheep and goats were introduced into SSA from the Middle East by 4 kya.) In contrast, prior to 1492, no Neolithic flora, fauna, or technology ever spread from the Old World to the Western Hemisphere.We see, therefore, that the geographic factors mentioned by Jared Diamond strongly favored SSA over Mesoamerica. Using his criteria, civilization should have begun earlier in SSA than it did in Mesoamerica, and it should have progressed more there(prior to the European expansion of modern times) than it did in Mesoamerica.In fact, though, by 1000 AD, Mesoamerica was far more advanced than SSA was, or ever had been. For example, Mesoamericans had originated writing on their own, had constructed many large stone structures, and had built large cities (rivaling any existing in Europe, and far larger than any in sub-Saharan Africa). Furthermore, the Mayan achievements in mathematics and astronomy dwarf any intellectual achievements in SSA.We must therefore conclude that, although Guns, Germs, and Steel is an informative book, the obvious superiority of Mesoamerican technology to that of sub-Saharan Africa appears to be a fatal blow to the main arguments presented in it (Hart, Understanding Human History 2007)."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"... it was fun and educational to read. The fact that most were never taught world history the way it should have been taught had me anticipating each chapter to come. It sort of bogged down for me here and there, but not enough to lose interest. His observations/theories on the rise of civilizations were pretty much on target but seem to peter out after contact with the new world. He also avoided(?) many ancient civilizations that would probably have acted as a monkey wrench thrown into the gears of his theoretical works. Also, another item in which I think should have been given equal space to were the political/religious decisions that most likely had very serious progressive/regressive results ( he used China as one of the examples and I have a few of my own). At the end Diamond acknowledges this point very very briefly, and I'm sure it is because it could have made all the effort of writing this book in the 1st place look like a total waste. Can't blame him for that, but it forces me to hold back on 1 star. Still, more than worth the time and education to be had. I recommend it."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"I was very disappointed by the book. Maybe my expectations were too high. Basically, the book reduces human cultural history to a series of accidents: accidents of geography and accidents of biological evolution. The scope of Diamond's argument is wonderful and I applaud his efforts. Diamond surveys 15,000 years of human history in terms of plant, animal and germ evolution. If this is the first time you've seen the way humans are at the mercy of germ mutation, it may take your breath away. On the other hand, Diamond leaves no role for human character to play a part. Perhaps it is hopelessly old fashion to suggest individual responsibility exists, but I think we are asking for an ecological disaster if we abandon all efforts to cultivate it. In summary, I was turned off by the narrow-minded materialism.The book is structured as an apologia from a European biologist to a politician of New Guinea. At the beginning of the book, the author introduces us to Yali, a young politician of New Guinea. The politician asks the author why the 'Europeans' have so much and peoples of New Guinea so little. Time and again, the book returns to this simple question.It might have been interesting to question the premise of Yali's question. Have Europeans really hit the jackpot? Unfortunately, we don't inquire into the nature of jackpots. The only measure of success is power and wealth.Diamond's answer is Darwinian: it was an accident. Europeans just 'happened to be' in the right place at the right time. Geography, weather patterns, and access to species suitable for domestication made European success inevitable. I won't argue that random events play an important role in shaping human history, but Diamond's answer is simply uninformative. It could be summarized as Europeans got lucky because they were lucky. What does that tell us?I can't imagine Yali to taking this answer seriously. If you grew up in New Guinea with European tourists blundering through your village taking photographs and passing out trinkets, would you accept an explanation that it was all an accident? That explanation would only work for the tourist who wants to avoid feeling connected to the people they meet along the way. Maybe that's why the book seems to go on and on and on without coming to a conclusion. Diamond is has no answer for Yali, but hopes to put him to sleep.A far more insightful (and controversial) history of the 'human community' can be found in William McNeill's 'Rise of the West' or 'Plagues and People.' Yali would be well served by adding these to his reading list.Finally, the title of this book is misleading. Germs get a fair amount of attention, but 'guns' and 'steel' go almost unmentioned. According to the index, the term 'gun' gets 8 references during the 400+ page book. The term 'steel' gets only 4 references. Germs get about 80. A title along the lines of 'Geography and Germs: how weather and disease shape human cultures' would have been more accurate."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"While the premise for Guns, Germs and Steel is interesting and certainly intrigued me enough to buy the book, I found the author pedantic, repetitive and generally uninteresting in his presentation. I was turned off by Diamond's assumption that his reader was not only naive enough to think that the current social/economic position held by Whites represents the pinnacle of modern society (suggesting, in fact, that no one else can usurp this distinction) but that the only way he could effectively convey his theory is through the condescending, over-enunciated manner he chose to use.Had this book been written in a previous time period, Diamond's theory would be useless-- reference the eras dominated by the Huns, Ottomans and even Illyrians of Alexander the Great. Further, every indication of present society leans towards the fact that the changing, integrating face of the world leaves even more doubt that whites will remain the supreme race from which Diamond basis his premise.This is not to say the book is without merit. Diamond touches on many areas of prehistoric history and its relationship to the present, combined with quite a bit of research, to explain little discussed aspects of how things became what they are. In fact, I will never again eat an appealing piece of fruit without thinking of my predecessors who helped cull the less desirables from the gene pool. In this sense the book did, at times, serve to be quite eye-opening which is why it is still worth the time to read--however a sense of humor and a huge grain of salt are also necessary accompaniments.My main objection to this work, however, remains his tone which is far too supercilious for the product of thought he actually produces. I was turned off by his attempt at being overly academic in his explanations of his theory while at the same time continuously repeating what he was going to tell me. I felt as though I were reading someone's poorly written thesis about a topic no one was really interested in instead of a work that won a Pulitzer Prize. How disappointing. Don't buy this book. If you feel you must read it, save your money and borrow it from the library."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"The book's thesis is interesting and by and large persuasive -- humans migrating from the Fertile Crescent came to dominate the world because of dumb luck, not any innate racial superiority. Unfortunately, 90% (or more) of the content of this book would have fit in a Scientific American article. The incessant repetition and the clunky style made it a chore to read. If Diamond is merely synthesizing and popularizing scientific orthodoxy, he should have left it to a competent writer such as James Gleick or Richard Rhodes. If he is appealing over the heads of his peers to the public at large, he should be excommunicated."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"Diamond went on a search to explain why whites (Europeans) conquered nonwhites. Diamond's interesting thesis posits that geography is all. Diamond is no historian and he seems to think that if his thesis fails then the 'explanation' must be some sort of inherent racial differences. Diamond argues that the differences in geography allow different plants and animals to flourish so that some areas are better for agriculture, the basis of civilization.Diamond avoids discussion of religion's role in exploration and expansion, likewise capitalism. He also does not explain the differences between the successes of certain European countries, say England compared to Spain.Humans are apparently mere carriers of the inevitable results of geographic benefits. Ignore the grand theorizing, but learn from the facts he presents."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"As a student of anthropology I had this book recommended to me numerous times.

What I thought would be an interesting telling of the history of humanity was more than just boring - it was infuriating in that it has received so much positve press for such a bloated piece of work!Jared Diamond is a Geographer and an Evolutionary Biologist, therefore he has authority to speak about the physical evolution of humanity, even to a certain extent about the people of the globe. That is where his academic authority ends. Unfortunately for the book, he goes on for an additional 15 chapters or so talking about cultural development. It is a big leap to make from technology development based on geographic resources to determining the order of language and tool use as signs of cultural progression. He states theories as fact without addressing the fact that there are valid opposing theories within the field.This books is 440 pages of a man exercising his ego. For an evolutionary biologist by practice, he certainly does not correct the misconceptions of the masses concerning the purpose and direction of evolution; instead he helps to reenforce them with his deterministic outlook. Perhaps the most absurd section comes from page 129, where he states that humans never domesticated acorns because we couldn't out compete the squirrels. I can honestly say that the only reason I have kept this book is in case I cannot sleep and need something to put me out quickly."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"Jared Diamond's book, Guns, Germs, and Steel, is based on a premise which is undoubtedly correct, that geography has affected history. Unfortunately for readers who expected a sholarly treatment of the subject, the book only serves to detail the author's prejudices. Perhaps the book was written with college freshmen in mind as the audience; it is doubtful anyone else would be impressed with the author's very selective use of facts, his unproven assertions, or his hysterical invective against Europeans, however politically correct that literary style is at present. The author cannot even mention European explorers without placing quotation marks around the word &quot;explorers&quot;. In the absence of any evidence of objectivity, it is difficult to take seriously any of his assertions.

In short, the book presents a logical and reasonable thesis and backs it up very well. The objections of other reviewers are nothing more than quibbles; yes, there may be some situations where other variables take precedence over those listed as primary in the book, but the conceptual framework laid out by Dr. Diamond is an extremely useful model that successful explains most of the large scale variation seen.

It's the kind of book that makes you feel smarter and more aware of your surroundings. He makes each of his points so clearly that the reader draws the conclusions his or herself before Diamond does, which makes his arguments seems stronger.

Why was it that the civilizations of the continent of Eurasia* achieve the most technological advancement, written language, productive farming techniques, and military power? Why were the Americas, sub-Saharan Africa, and Australia technologically 'backward' by comparison?For centuries the answers to these questions was racial and cultural supremacy, such as that the west was simply better than the other 'lesser' peoples. We now quickly and correctly identify such thoughts as hateful, racist, and counter-productive, but questions still remain and often we do not know how to begin to ask them. In recent times the trend for historical revisionists is to try to focus on the strengths of the conquered cultures and explaining that their down fall was due to disease or dishonorable trickery. Nevertheless, more questions remain, if disease was such a factor why was it only one way, and why were the Europeans able to fool their opponents at times easily? Diamond dares to try to tackle these questions head on.\\"The time is now ripe for a fresh look at these questions, because of new information from scientific disciplines seemingly remote from human history. Those disciplines include, above all, genetics, molecular biology, and biogeography as applied to crops and their wild ancestors; the same disciplines plus behavioral ecology, as applied to domestic animals and their wild ancestors; molecular biology of human germs and related germs of animals; epidemiology of human diseases; human genetics; linguistics; archaeological studies on all continents and major islands; and studies of the histories of technology, writing and political organization.\\"p.26Diamond rejects all of the racist and revisionist arguments pointing out that no race or group of people is stronger, smarter, more capable, creative, or more cruel and ruthless. All humans are the same--that is not to say that all individuals are the same and equally as capable, but any large group of humans is just as good as any other. There is no 'master race,' no group of human beings proven superior to every other group of human beings. Diamond successful argues that since people adapt to their environment, often environmental factors determine how a civilization will develop. A good example would be a person from Florida who would find Maine winters intolerable and while someone from Maine would like wise find Floridian summers unbearable. Humans are creatures of their environment and the societies they build are products of the environment as well.Various environmental factors such as how fertile the land is, what types of crops grow, the abundance of large animals that can domesticated, and geographic features. Australia, with rare exception, has terrible land for farming which is why its native population was still in the Stone Age in the 1800s, the Americas have no great animals capable of domestication that put them in at a great military and physical disadvantage. Without great beasts to domesticate they would miss out on a good source of food and would have no Calvary. Animals were also the source of diseases that the Europeans were able to build immunities that peoples native to the Americas were not.Diamond's narrative is a bit difficult and technical even for an advanced reader. Although when he discusses his personnel adventures his narrative becomes more clear, the center chapters that focus and agriculture and farm animals are very tough to plow through. I highly recommend this book, but it is something to be tackled more at the graduate level.*One thing that I strongly agree with Diamond on, is that Europe and Asia are not two continents but one big continent."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"I was given this book by a friend for a gift and enjoyed reading through the material. It chalenged some of my pre-conceived ideas about the rise and fall of countries and civilizations. I had never before considered the idea that germs could have had such a great impact on the development and decline of civilazations. My only criticism of the book is that Diamond seems to write as though no one else has ever considered these issues before. The fact is many other scientists, economists and philosophers have developed theories and concepts which Diamond does not seem to consider. Overall though I enjoyed the book and even watched the documetary that was made from the book. I recommend both the book and the movie to anyone who is new to this field.Douglas Geyman"},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"Guns, Germs, and Steel is an excellent book with pros being that concepts are easy to understand, many examples that the concepts are applied in, and ultimately the ideas make sense while the cons being just repetitive and tedious at times.Most of the ideas and concepts that Jared Diamond introduces and explains is easy to follow. Jared Diamond first proposes questions of why things happened in history and then goes about answering it in, on average, twenty page chapters that introduce different ideas and patterns with explanations. He then ties these ideas and trends into a logical way that helps answer the question posed at the beginning of each chapter. If you are not an expert or have extensive knowledge in these fields, then expect to find this book very enlightening and agree with most of Jared Diamond's ideas.The next positive thing about this book is that it has an abundance of examples to look at. The purpose for the examples that Jared Diamond includes after each concept introduced is to further convince the reader that his views are correct by aiding the reader's learning in the new concept introduced by seeing it in action. But as I read further into the book I started to question whether his concepts are universal or only applied to the examples given, which can lead to some controversy. But nonetheless, the examples given was key to convince people to believe his ideas.An important good thing about this book is that the ideas introduced in this book are believable and makes sense to most readers. This connection with the reader is the most important thing that the author can do. In this book, basic concepts are introduced and progress throughout the first half or so of the book. Understanding the basic concepts, such as the roles of food production, domestication, and geographic location in affecting human society's development that are introduced in this book, helps the reader understand the book as a whole along with the main idea of the book which is Diamond's thesis that peoples on different continents histories are different because of environmental factors.The only negative thing that I am able to say about this book is that at some points in the book the reading becomes repetitive. Many basic ideas of the book are repeated many times in this book which makes it hard to read sometimes because it feels like you are wasting your time. One repetitive thing that comes to mind is the idea that food production allowed specialization and all that other good stuff that allowed the formation of a complex society. But despite the tedious parts of the book, Guns, Germs, and Steel offers a load of interesting stuff. I am sure that there are other negative stuff about this book, but that would require that I be an expert in these fields to validate the information that the book provides.In conclusion, Guns, Germs, and Steel is certainly an excellent read that brings many new perspectives and ideas that one might have never though of before if you are not an expert in these kind of fields. Although I would rather not read this book again, I definitely recommend this book to any person out there that is learning about world history."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"When a friend of mine said he had read this book, it sounde really compelling.

His ideas flow quite readily, his thoughts were quite organized, and his arguments quite thorough; and ,if I may so boldly say, mostly appear to be sound and correct. In a nutshell, certain elements are required before advanced civilization can develop from either tribal or small civilization status, such as, inclusively, the existence of high protein, high yield grains, beasts of burden and frequented trade routes. Southern Africa, Australia, North America, the Pacific Islands and Central America were lacking one or all of the above, while Europe, the Fertile Crescent, India, and China had them. However, the question in my mind remains as to why India and China did not advance on their own into the modern industrial age, but instead required prodding from the West. The author proposes that China's topology, flattish and easily travailed, spawned over the millennia an oppressive government that reached with stagnant hand into the lives of every day people, a fine statement, but he doesn't make the logical argument as to why a Chinese government should necessarily prohibit innovation. At any rate, the book definitely belongs on your reading list."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"i enjoyed this book so tremendously, learned so much from it, that i would have unhesitatingly given this a 5 star except for the last chapter on Japan. i'd like to hear other readers' opinion on this. it seems to me that that last chapter has an unsual tone of uncertainty or lack of confidence to it, esp. when compared to the rest of the book, when the author draws the conclusion that, a few hundred years AD, there's either a massive influx of korean people migrating to japan, thus making modern japanese direct descendents of koreans; or that there's a big influx, but not a massive one, thus making modern japanese a mix of koreans and the ancient japanese, jomo, people. but shouldn't this be discernable through dna analysis? also, why did he omit the fact that the japanese language is heavily influenced by the chinese language? about 30-50% of the language is still written today in \\"kanji\\". \\"kan\\" in kanji is just a slightly different way to pronounce \\"han\\", i.e. the han dynasty in China around a few hundred years BC. further, and this is my amateur opinion only, no doubt, but i often thought the korean language and the japanese language are very similar. in fact, if i hear something, and i initially think it's japanese, but upon listening further find myself not understanding it (i have very elementary japanese skills), i'll know it's korean. it works every time.does this chapter not seem a little odd to other readers?"},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"The colonial dominance of Europeans has been deeply ingrained in the social and political fabrics of human history. With their guns, germs, and steel, these northerners decimated anyone who stood in their path for gold, god, and glory. So why were the Europeans so powerful? Why wasn't it the Asians or Africans who colonized the world instead? For centuries, scholars believed it was because of biology; that is the Europeans were simply a superior race. However, social scientist Jared Diamond believes it was Europe's advantageous geography that ultimately led them to supremacy, and he set out to validate this thesis in his Pulitzer winning masterpiece, \\"Guns, Germs, and Steel.\\" Diamond's fundamental theory is that because the Eurasian Fertile Crescent allowed Europeans to grow a surplus of food, the population was able to focus on other aspects of living. With food no longer the center of all activity, Europeans were able to establish social stratification, political bureaucracy, division of labor, and technology. This explains why they had far superior weaponry, organization, and knowledge compared to their enemies. Moreover, because Europe had exposure to a larger variety of animals, the people were able to develop an evolutionary resistance to their diseases over time. As a result, when Europeans came in contact with outsiders (i.e. Amerindians), they wrecked havoc with pestilence. \\"Guns, Germs, and Steel\\" is a monumental contribution to the social sciences. Diamond's literature completely changed our view of human history and made us contemplate the colossal effects geography might have had on the fates of societies. It is a book that everyone needs to read."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"This book was recommended by a friend who taught Honors history at the high-school level.

Diamond, unlike Professor Twist, is seeking answers to real world problems. In this case, he seeks to understand the plight of indigenous peoples and their subordination to European and Asian cultures in light of evolutionary pressures. Even so, Diamond seems awkward in his attempts to justify the ways of the Blind Watchmaker to men as so. One false note comes early in the book, when he departs from his evenhandedness to assure us that not only should we not hold New Guineans to be less intellectually endowed than Europeans (a reasonable enough assumption), but that they are probably intellectually superior. He admits that he can't demonstrate that superiority empirically, so that assertion strikes the reader as an attempt to curry favor by a politically correct reverse bias.On the other hand, there's a lot of really stimulating and interesting stuff in this book. Diamond talks about: what kinds of foodstuffs are necessary to support civilization; why disease almost always flowed from native Europeans to native Americans (and not vice-versa), whereas Europeans encounter many new diseases when they attempted to enter Africa; why those previous two topics are related; how innovation happens; etc. It seems like there's an interesting fact or point of view whenever you turn the page.The book seeks a complete explanation for the course of human history. It has that sort of broad, sweeping intellectual appeal that a hefty work of philosophy or science has. For example, after someone learns Newtonian mechanics, he tends to see the entire universe as the interplay between physical forces that are expressed in terms of differential equations. A similar dynamic happens here, where the reader suddenly sees commonplaces in a new light.As with most grand theories, it's important to see that there are some important limits to the analysis. While we can see why, in broad strokes, European and Asian peoples might have overwhelming advantages in human history in purely biological and geographical terms, Diamond's analysis is of no help in answering historical questions that still might strike us as large, but come within the realm of European or Asian culture, instead of at the border with other peoples. For example, it's hard to see how his analysis adds anything to our understand of conflicts such as the Greco-Persian wars, the rise and decline of Rome, the Napoleonic Wars, or the American Civil War. Certainly these questions are important, and we rightly inquire into agricultural, military, political, and culture causes for these events. In these cases Diamond's analysis is largely impossible, since we are dealing with peoples that share genetics, foodstuffs, climates, terrains, etc.Perhaps I'm nit-picking. It's an excellent, thought-provoking book. I'd just like to temper the inevitable temptation to view all history through this lens."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"If you already understand the principles of cultural ecology, this is a great book that neatly synthesizes the basic theories and applies them on a grand scale.Unfortunately, if this is the case, then the book is a tad redundant (as far as not providing new knowledge) and does not get into the fun nitty gritty details. (Though this is obvious as this book is claiming to tour world history in under 500 pages)If you don't already understand cultural ecology, then this is potentially a great introduction. It is a good review of the bisc priniciples. Assuming, of course, you read the book with an intent to understand his princples. If your only response is, why don't the tropics have a state government, then you need to reread the book, because you did not understand and missed the point entirely. This book is not an exercize in political correctness, it is an excercize in cultural ecology.The basis of his argument is only certain areas were predisposed to develop agriculture, which allows greater population, and from this comes specialization, technological advances and organized government."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"Diamond makes a sound case with many examples to hold up his theory that there are no inherent biological advantages among human races. While his premise that as agriculture develops, a kind of snowball affect takes place leading to greater and greater levels of complexity of civilization, and that some areas are better suited to the beginings of agriculture than others, that doesn't entirely account for the differences between modern cultures.Diamond's theory seems very reasonable when considering the origins of civilization and why the earliest complex societies were in the Fertile Cresent and in China, but he takes it a step further in trying to explain the differences between modern societies such as China, Germany, Brazil, Zaire, and the US.. I think it is obvious that modern societies have been heavily influenced by more than geographic barriers and ancient head starts in agriculture. Also, I think it takes away from the scientific/unbiased feel of the book when Diamond keeps throwing around the term \\"racist\\" with all of its negative connotation for anyone who argues that there are inherent differences within the human race [and then he actually goes on the say that he believes his uncivilized islander friends are actually smarter than Americans], while there obviously are some differences (at least in looks) and very well could be differences in abilities as well.Basically, this is an interesting read that offers many insights into the evolution of global societies and may accurately explain why some peoples never developed or adopted advanced civilization's ways, but doesn't explain the persisting divergences between advanced, modern societies today. It also doesn't prove that there are no racial differences that would give one group an advantage over another."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"Yali, from New Guinea, asked why Europeans had developed so much cargo.

Europeans overcame the Incas and the Aztecs against numerical odds with their weapons and tactics. Until World War I the military use of horses transformed warfare. Transmission of diseases introduced through the presence of Europeans played a role in weakening resistance to European supremacy.Plant and animal domestication contribute to greater population density. There is a higher birthrate through the use of a fixed abode and there is increased food production over hunter-gatherer methods. The storage of food is possible. Stored food means a society, a kingdom, can maintain people given special functions such as priests, soldiers, artisans.Much of history has consisted of unequal conflicts. By Roman times almost all of the leading crops of today were being cultivated. The vast majority of wild plants are unsuitable for cultivation. Fertile Crescent cereals were productive in the wild. The Feritle Crescent has biological diversity over small distances.To be domesticated a wild mammal must possess many different characteristics. To be used for food the animals must be herbivores, fast-growing, non-finicky eaters. They must have decent dispositions and breed in captivity. They must live in herds, have a dominance structure, and over-lapping territories.Eurasia's East-West axis allowed Fertile Crescent crops to spread over the band of the temperate latitudes. Predominately North-South axies in Africa and the Americas made the diffusion of crops difficult. Necessity produced the atom bomb, cotton gin, and steam engine. Complex societies form by merger. Unlike Russia and the United States, China seems monolithic. China's head start contributed to developments in neighboring regions. Human societies in East Asia and the Pacific provide many examples of how environment shapes history.The books is fascinating. The author compresses an amazing amount of information between the book's covers."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"This is very important book about the powerful role that geography plays, and has played, in determining the relative success or failure of the societies it originates and gives shelter to.I've had some fun in reading through the various and extremely varied reviews on the merit of J. Diamonds thesis. Many \\"educated\\" minds have weighed in on the validity of \\"this or that\\" aspect of his basis. Now, I'm not exactly at the forefront of modern biological, political, or social science, but I know enough to firmly believe that \\"geographic determinism\\" is a major influence on societal development. When I look at it through the lens of Chaos Theory (where big outcomes are sensitively influenced products of tiny variables) it seems clear to me that where societies originated on this map could very well be the biggest factor in determining their success.This is a fascinating read. Very well researched, peppered with interesting historical stories and insight.

Diamond looks beyond immediate and proximate causes to ultimate causes, i.e.. different areas on the globe had different &quot;starting materials&quot; in the way of domesticable plants and animals as well as a geography which aided or impeded the spread of ideas, crops, and animals. In great detail, with strong logic, he traces the beginnings of civilization on all continents and supports it with ample evidence. Great book."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"UCLA biologist Jared Diamond presents a wonderfully coherent argument setting the foundation for a truly &quot;hard science&quot; view of the behavioral History of human populations. The cornerstone of his position are the principles of Variation and Selection, first applied by Charles Darwin to the expression of biological traits of species and later by B.F. Skinner to the behavior of individuals, each birthing respectively the fields of Evolutionary Biology and Behavior Analysis. Perhaps even without knowing it, the author has bridged the gap between those two fields to the extent that a unified framework for understanding complex systems now seems to be entering maturity by creating a new precedent for the applicability of Selectionism. Diamond translates this framework almost flawlessly to the problem of scientifically explaining historic events.One example of the profundity of his approach is his explanation for why Europe instead of China, despite their shared Eurasian advantages, became the dominant global influence from the 15th century onward. The geography of Europe is sufficiently disjointed that political unification of the area is difficult and impractical allowing for a higher degree of Variation in political stances among the various political entities of the region. China, however, has a river and canal system extensive and navigable enough that it became politically unified very early in its history. The implication in the latter case is that political unification leads to a homogeneity in its characteristics at any given point in time, reducing regional Variation of a population's behavioral characteristics substantially. Consequently, when the eunuch ruler of China was deposed in the early 15th century, the decision of his successors was to undo the technological and maritime advances he had supported. Water clocks were smashed and the navy was scrapped. Because China was a unified political entity (due to its vast river system), diffusion of this new anti-technology characteristic was wide and swift, effectively stalling progress throughout the entire region. This is a prime example of how concrete geographic variables give rise to the topography of a population's behavior which in turn dictates what variants are available to be selected for.Jared Diamond's Guns, Germs, and Steel is an innovative work and is undoubtedly only the beginning in what will surely be a slow and tedious revolution in the way we view History. The paradigm of Selectionism operating on the behavior of populations has a long road ahead of it because it basically amounts to the unpopular and unsavory philosophy of &quot;Geographic Determinism.&quot; Just as Darwinian evolution has been vehemently resisted within some religious circles and Skinnerian behaviorism resisted by mainstream Psychology, Diamond's masterpiece will take some time before being widely accepted by the general population, although its parsimony will bear it through. This classic book belongs on every persons' shelf right next to The Origin of Species and The Behavior of Organisms."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"Diamond offers an interesting, somewhat unpopular view of the evolution of human societies. Despite criticisms to the contrary, I find the flow of his discussion to be very well organized. He takes us on a journey through a number of intelligently illustrated variables which, in his view, were key to the disparities among the development of various societies and cultures. However, this work is in no way a complete discussion, as he fails to touch upon the role that organized religions have played in shaping the history of the search for power, wealth and dominance."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"A fantastic read for me -- this is a very profound body of work. While at times, I felt I was questioning the scientific &quot;proof&quot; behind the positions, my natural instincts kept telling me that -- even if the proof was not beyond doubt -- the probability was very high that the logic and fact connected. This made a direct impact on my correlation between winning and losing strategies at many levels -- including in the world economic and business conditions today."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"In this book, Diamond attempts to show why Eurasians came to politically dominate native Africans, Americans, and Australians--even though Africa has been human territory for a much longer time than anywhere else on earth. An over-simplified version of his argument is this:1. The domestication of plants and animals was the first key to building a society that could dominate others over a wide area. Any society that domesticates a species (wheat, orange, horse, cow, etc.) can move that species with them as part of cultural or military conquest--but only to an area with a similar climate.Eurasia has a huge area of similar climate, and most initial conquerers moved between east and west in that same climatic zone.When an African or American society domesticated a species, they couldn't generally take it with them, because they usually had to move north or south--and thus into a different climate. (The Nile valley and all of Africa above the Sahara are part of the Eurasian climate zone, and generally shared its advantages.)2. Eurasians were simply lucky. They had many more species of both plants and animals suitable for domestication. Even with modern technology and experience, there are many fewer species suitable for initial domestication in Africa, the Americas, and Australia. (Genetic engineering may change this, but the Eurasians control that technology too, at present. Could the hope of Africa be to become much more permissive and risk-taking with biotech?)3. Once you've got agriculture, you get cities, and humans living close to animals. Initially, that makes people more exposed to mutations of animal diseases, but over time the survivors develop an immunity. When later the survivors make contact with other humans, those others die of diseases their ancestors never confronted. (90% of all Native American deaths after the European conquest were due to disease, not war.)It's fascinating speculation, and truly does try to address one of the great questions of history. For now, it's left to future research to try to prove or disprove the broad theory, if that can even be done.As others have pointed out, Diamond shouldn't have tried to guess why Europeans currently dominate Asians and Middle Easterners--all three of which had the same advantages. His arguments do better at explaining Euriasian dominance of others than they do at explaining the more back-and-forth between various Eurasian cultures.It's not clear to me that Diamond's forces are currently at work, in the sense that any new species domesticated now would almost certainly be transported easily all over the world. Eurasia has won and unless its culture destroys itself, others will have to join that culture to be competitive. (One possible exception is the AIDS pandemic. African societies may be forced, through lack of medication, to develop a genetic immunity to AIDS, where other parts of the world could end up treating the symptoms well enough that the genetic exposure remains.)I think the best way to view this book is as an explanation of the history of the last 500 years. If you like broad-brush speculation with a LOT of interesting facts across multiple disciplines, I think you'll love this book. I sure did."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"The book has a good deal of valuable history and science in it. Unfortunately, they are put to an unworthy use. Diamond is intent on reminding us that western culture does not deserve its dominant place in the world. Not that western culture didn't have the natural assets he deems useful. It's that western culture isn't nice enough or smart enough to be where it is. There are some laughably transparent cases of special pleading. One of his New Guinea tribes must be smarter than practically anybody else because most meetings with a stranger have a potential for lethal combat. That they can figure out how to escape such an introduction must mean they're smart. How about they're dumb to have such a culture? A vague and huge ancient language group includes both North Africa and classical Greece. This should, he says, surprise people who think Greece is notable by itself. As if the glory that was Greece should be spread out to North Africa because their proto-language might have been the same. Or the North Africans started the whole thing. Pizarro defeated the Incas because the Inca was illiterate. The Inca didn't understand the depths of European duplicity. Not having read some European history. The Inca in question had just conquered a rival in a bloody civil war, but was a child in intrigue. Who takes this stuff seriously?

However, it turned out to be disappointing because of both its superficiality and its wrong and absurd conclusions, one of which is that white people were aggressive and genocidal while the rest of the world's inhabitants were entirely peaceful and never engaged in warfare or genocide (so you see, everything evil in the world is because of white people). By contrast, he positively gushes about non-white achievements in a truly absurd fashion, e.g., stating that because Africans had settled throughout the continent in small communities, thereby reducing the effects of malaria (wrong), that that was \\"an extraordinary achievement\\" (!). Diamond claims that the New Guineans have remained primitive because of their poor agriculture and that non-Europeans were defeated partly because of disease, yet in Africa the natives had good agriculture and livestock and the diseases decimated the Europeans, yet they remained in the stone age through the first half of the 20th century (and in some parts, that is still the case). You can't have it both ways. Also, in eastern Asia, as soon as European culture came into contact with Chinese and Japanese cultures, the latter adopted those advances and incorporated them into their cultures and have advanced to a very modern stage. In Africa and New Guinea that is not the case.

Diamond tries to paint a picture where these differences were nonexistent. I've been in enough school classes where we dividided into groups to do the same project. At the end of the semester the diversity of the end results was amazing even though the groups were supposed to be identical in IQ, ability, etc.It is highly likely that certain cultures ARE better than others.

Starting from a promising and evocative premise Mr. Diamond ends with a load of scholarly fudge so tainted by current fashionable thinking that his great enterprise is very much diminished.&quot;How is it that you white people have developed all this cargo and brought it to New Guinea and we black people have no cargo ?&quot; The question is seminal. You have more than enough for yourselves and can bring it here and almost give it away; and we have none. Good cheap fish hooks; transistor radios, with batteries; small reliable electric generators; outboard motors that can pull against the fastest-rushing river currets; beautiful rifles that can bring down game at 300 meters; satellite television; --- cargo, cargo, cargo.Diamond doesn't see the poignancy of the question, he's too busy trying to show his humanity, political correctness and he is on his knees begging for forgiveness from our very insightful Yali. In this case at least, I agree with the author, this New Guinean has more intelligence than at least one Western academic.Pizzaro was a bad boy. Pestilential vectors operating through close living with animals gave immunity to infection. Colonial loathsomeness. What has this got to do with cargo ?Yali knows the truth: some civilizations are indeed better than others. Some are indeed more humane and more productive and allow more freedom for human development than others and only an intellectual caught in the web of his own nitpicking could believe otherwise. I do not doubt the innate intelligence of people everywhere, but tick-tack-ticking on a keyboard by a computer operator is several orders of magnitude from the accretion of science and multi-layered technologies that brought Western civilization from Euclid and Archimedes to a 4-million device computer chip.But, but, you say, old Ed Wilson says its a good book.

The book should be read for the presentation of this theory alone. It will resonate in your mind.To say that geography is the only reason for all of history is, to me, faulty, however. Too many human variables are in the mix. The decisions that rulers make. The smarts of military leaders. The religion of the people. Also, the unpredictability of the human soul, which can change so much and affect the future in ways that no computer could calculate. The human race is too complex, and as a result the decisions, inventions, and innovations are also complex, and stem from more than simply the latest the availability of edible and/or usable resources.Diamond is a brilliant writer and his book reads easily.

It is based on the fact that whites today are generally more successful than other races. however, it wouldn't hold up to the test of time: 1,000 years ago, the opposite would be true. he would be asking: &quot;if whites are not biologically inferior to Muslims and Africans, then how come middle eastern and North African Civilizations are superior to white ones? Even Muslims living in Spain, a European country, have a higher standard of living and greater cities than Christians living in Spain&quot;. Who knows how his argument will hold up 1,000 years from now)I'm sorry to have to be so frank, but unfortunately today, too many people in all societies of the world study only the history of the past 500 years from Western textbooks, where the rise of White Civilization (put into euphemisms such as &quot;European&quot; or &quot;Western&quot;) came to dominate and humiliate all other world civilizations through superior-well, everything, especially after 1800. Once again, sorry to be so blunt. Rather than be put into the context of 40,000 years of human history and 10,000 years of human civilization, schools around the United States teach the past 500 years (the exact period of time that 'the West' was on the rise) as the entire bulk of modern world history.Not surprisingly, any serious student of history today would be led to suspect at first (with the exception of Japan), that all nonwhite peoples were somehow inferior, especially African &amp; Native American peoples but not excluding all other nonwhites. Any semiserious student of politics AND history would ponder, given all the anti-racist rhetoric in society today, why white civilization suddenly came to dominate all the other ones and why white scientists seemed to come up with all the inventions, from Pythagoreas to Einstein.This book goes a great deal at providing a much-needed explanation for people whose only other alternative would be private racism, a conviction that nonwhite civilizations failed because the people who composed these places were biologically inferior.It is not surprising that many people reject Jared Diamond viciously, because his book is revolutionary."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"I picked up this book from a local library because I was interested in learning something new about how civilizations evolved. I saw the video on PBS and it had piqued my interest at first. The writing style was very repetitive and goes into great lenghts about esoteric details related to food production and domestication of plants and animals. I did learn about the evolution from hunter gatherer to farming based community, and what unexpected impacts it had. I'm not so well versed as other reviewers to be able to object to anything in the book on ideological or moral grounds.I just couldn't continue reading the book because it was very long winded. I read it half way through, and, chapter after chapter, it kept talking about food production and domestication of crops and animals ad nauseum. I asked myself why am I being innundated with so much detail about a subject that could be covered as a preface to the real subject of the book, which was, human conquests and evolution of human civilization.It does start off as an interesting read. It covers the conquests of the Maori people over the Maoriri tribe in the Catham Islands, and then it goes on to talk about how the Spanish conquistadors won out over the native american Incas and others. It was intersting to learn that hunter gatherers were generally more peaceful (in terms of waging wars) than the food producers.Some questions are posed early on in the book and are never addressed until several chapters later, which kind of bothered me. An example of this is the question: \\"what was the reason for the failure of food production to appear, until modern times, in some ecologically very suitable areas that are among the world's richest centers of agriculture and herding today\\". In short, why did food production not appear until modern times in some of the richest places for agriculture, like California? This question was posed in the beginning of chapter 5 on p. 93. Several chapters later in the middle of chapter 8, is the question finally addressed. It talks about the various geographic and botanical factors why the fertile crescent was the first place where food production was developed, and why the abscence of these factors caused agriculture to catch on later in other places. All the while the user is left with this nagging un-answered question.Maybe I don't have the inclination to wade through very detailed and lengthy discussions about plant domestication. I totally lost interest after finishing chapter 8, which is about half way through the book. It switches over and starts talking about domesticating animals in chapter 9. And Part 2 of the book (which is all about food production) lasts until the end of chapter 10.

Jared Diamond has a nice writing style, and perhaps he wasn't the first one to think about this hypothesis, but he does a great job presenting his arguments in a clear-yet-non-scientific manner.I think some people take offense with his position, because in the end, one of his main arguments is that there is no genetic reason why the European cultures have arisen to such power while other cultures haven't. In the end, despite culture, skin color, etc., there really isn't that much physically separating a Blackfeet Indian to a white Wall Street banker to a hunter in Africa.Geography obviously plays a significant role in human society. If you are isolated from others (like the Americas and various islands), you are at more a disadvantage when other societies come visit you, bearing knowledge/technologies/bacteria/viruses that have never been encountered by the indigenous peoples. Obviously many societies all over the world have domesticated animals/plants for their own uses. Yet some animals can't be domesticated despite years of human interaction (elephants still kill/harm their trainers and elephants have been used by humans for many centuries) whereas when was the last time you heard a cow killing it's rancher? And remember there are millions of cows vs. thousands of elephants. And cows can do more things reliably than just die for our consumption, pulling plows, carrying heavy goods, etc.Cultures that had easy access to ideas/technologies to improve their own lives, to free up time that would otherwise be spent stalking game, digging roots, or tending/harvesting crops. Would Shakespeare have written (allegedly?) so many plays when he had to repeatedly go out to hunt? And hunting/planting/harvesting crops each have their own dangers, from broken bones, accidental injury from tools/weapons, etc. And back in the old days, even minor injuries by today's standards may result in death back then.But anyway, I recommend that y'all not only buy, but also get Giorgio Kostantinos-The Quest for a better fate of society read this book!

Alas this important factor has been neglected by historians and archaeologists in their findings of how human societies have developed during the ages."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"Why are some human societies more advanced than others? It's a question that, well into the 20th century, was most often answered in racist terms. Naturally, it was thought, some people developed better technology than others because they were smarter. Diamond tears into such assumptions, making a persuasive case that human technological and cultural advancement have little to do with comparative intelligence, and lot to do with local conditions that put some cultures (or at least their neighbors) on a technological pathway a lot earlier than others. Diamond traces the ultimate keys for the shift from pre-modern to modern back to the areas of agriculture and animal domestication, which, as he explains, would have unlocked a succession of other innovations in centuries to follow. For people who ended a hunter-gatherer lifestyle and settled down, the mere fact of one being in one place would have led to a host of other possibilities, such as increased tool use, the development of plant and animal husbandry, the specialization of jobs and religion, the centralization of government and the rise of an administrative class, the development of language, etc, etc.Diamond explains in (sometimes boring) detail the many disadvantages that the continents of Africa, Australia, and the two Americas had as places for civilization to develop, such as a lack of domesticable flora and fauna, a difficulty in transferring lifestyles between north-south climate zones, and a lack of suitable geography. He points out cases in which African, American, and Australasian cultures progressed as far as was achievable for anyone in their circumstances, and observes that Europe's disunity compared to China was actually an asset, though China had had a more advanced civilization and had given Europe a number of innovations, as did the Middle East. Then, of course, there is the all-important germs factor -- Europeans in their urban centers were exposed to a variety of pathogens, which were so instrumental in the decimation of New World Indians.I'm aware that books like Diamonds' are challenged by works such as the Bell Curve, which seek to explain the relative accomplishments of different groups of people in terms of genes. Here's my take on that: yes, genes probably do play *some* role, but, to me, Diamond's insights simply have a lot more explanatory power than Herrnstein and Murray's do. When a human society encounters new difficulties or advantages in its environment, it's *vastly* more likely that the society will evolve, since this is the path of least resistance, than it is that human genes will evolve. Likewise, societal structures pose a much more obvious obstacle to human progress than genes do. Of course, this doesn't mean that genes don't evolve, whenever there is some sort of acute pressure, just that we need to be cautious about what we attribute to them. Historic legacy is incredibly important, and relatively minor developments can have huge consequences generations down the road, in ways that aren't obvious to the average modern person focused only on what he or she can see right now.I consider GGS an important work because it goes all the way back to human prehistory in establishing the chain of causes that brought about modern civilization, providing many compelling, illustrative refutations of the \\"genes are destiny\\" hypothesis. Yes, as some readers have complained, it's true that Diamond favors the distant past and glosses over a lot significant developments in more modern times. However, I don't think that really matters. GGS is a book about ultimate causes, not secondary ones. That is, it seeks to explain what the recently dominant societies of the world have in common in their long-term past, not the specific reasons that specific countries are the dominant geopolitical players at this specific instant in history. If you want insight into that question (or just want to hear someone credit all that is right in the world to your own chosen values), go read more books! But, I think that whatever those authors have to say, their arguments will be refinements to the intuitive truth of Diamond's ultimate causes. In my opinion, there's a good reason that the phrase \\"guns, germs, and steel\\" is now part of the public consciousness.On the audiobook experience: yes, unfortunately, the reader is really dry, even by my forgiving standards."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"I had to read this book for a class back in college, and it was the first time I actually enjoyed such a requirement.

The book has some misnomers and speculative spots. Overall, though, the gist of the book flows throughout and he proves his point.

The fact that Eurasia extends much farther along its East/West axis than along its North/South direction allows any domesticated plant or animal to find an similar climate from one end of the vast contiguous landmass to the other. As the distance from Vladivostok to Lisbon is much greater than the distance from New York to Los Angles, or any East/West distance in South America or Africa, the ability to transfer crops and livestock to equivalent climates was much more limited in continents other than Eurasia. Add the much greater land area of Eurasia compared to other continents, and you see that you would expect a much greater variety of plant and animal species.This greater variety of domesticated plants and animals then added to the advantages of greater population in Eurasia. This greater variety advanced Eurasian technological supremacy and contributed to the diseases and the associated immunity of the people of that landmass. When the Europeans then made contact with the Americas and Africa, if their superior technology did not win the day the devastating diseases that they carried certainly did!"},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"This was a fascinating read. It provides terrific info about and understandings of the history of us humans. However, its explanations, based largely on geography and natural resources, are limited. While these factors undoubtedly affected the history of peoples in different regions of the world, they don't explain why China took off economically in the late 70s and Africa is just beginning to find its economic feet. Why did the colonies of England (U.S., Australia, Canada, N.Z.) mostly recover and thrive after conquest while the colonies of other European countries mostly failed to? The author, Jared Diamond, over-estimates the effects of geography and natural resources while under-estimating the effects of culture on historical outcomes. I don't expect a book to cover all factors within its subject, but I do expect it to provide balanced understanding of how important various factors might be. The author's view of geography as deterministic of outcomes should be challenged; there's a harmfulness to maintaining that humans are hapless victims of their environment. Thankfully, there are books like \\"A Farewell to Alms\\" that provide a different view. At the same time, Jared Diamond has made a real contribution, if biased, to understanding human history. No question that it's an interesting and important book."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"Guns, Germs and Steel by Jared DiamondGuns, Germs and Steel as the author Jared Diamond succinctly summarizes it, is about why the rise of complex human societies unfolded differently on different continents over the last 13,000 years. It's an insightful book that provides well-researched information on how human societies evolved and in doing so provides compelling evidence against racially based theories of human history. This award winning book is 480 pages long and is composed of the following four major parts: 1. From Eden to Cajamarca, 2. The Rise and Spread of Food Production, 3. From Food to Guns, Germs, and Steel, and 4. Around the World in Five Chapters.Positives:1. Award winning Pulitzer Prize book that lives up to all the accolades that it has received.2. Well-written, well-researched, and most importantly the ability to convey findings in a lucid manner for all to enjoy and learn from.3. As a result of the books compelling arguments, its findings has dismantled racially based theories. Bravo!4. The book provides theories that can and have been applied to better understand other fields, namely economics.5. Provides compelling information on how Europe dominated the New World.6. Provides a grand unifying theory that explains how societies evolved over the past 13,000 years.7. This book doesn't answer all the questions to a satisfying conclusion but it certainly will inspire others (and it already has) to take the mantle from Mr. Diamond and get there. Sometimes the greatest books are not the ones that give you all the answers but provides you the inspiration to seek them for yourself.8. Tables and illustrations that add value.9. Fascinating histories about the domestication of plants and animals.10. Geography, geography and geography.11. Germs as the ultimate weapons.12. Writing systems that helps put the puzzle together.13. Kleptocrats...and the use of religions to justify their power.14. It takes you to societies we know so little about. Thank you.15. Ambitious book that exceeded my expectations.16. Thought-provoking, great scholarly work that will be referenced for years to come.Negatives:1. With an ambitious unifying theory as Mr. Diamond espouses, there will be elements of it that are not satisfying to some critics. However, from my view point the work of this book in many aspects are groundbreaking and should inspire further research and discussion.2. It can be repetitive at times but understandably so.3. Some arguments are more speculative than others.4. I think the author does go out of his way to be politically correct.In summary, This book is anthropology at its best. It's an inspiring, ground-breaking book that makes compelling arguments on the evolution of societies. Does it answers all the questions to our satisfaction? No, but it lays the groundwork for future research. Mr. Diamond must be commended for a major contribution to history. This is a must read book. It will require an investment of time but you will be rewarded with wisdom .Further recommendations, even books that may go against specific elements of Mr. Diamond's position: \\"10,000 Year Explosion...\\" by Cochran and Harpending, and \\"Before the Dawn...\\" by Nicholas Wade."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"I am a social studies teacher and haven't referenced any book more than this book in the 4 different subject areas that I teach. It is a comprehensive study of the social progression of humanity. It ultimately explains (not justifies) why certain ethnic and social group have become more powerful in recent and modern history. I learned more from this book about people and why the world works the way it does than I did in the entirety my Social Studies Education undergrad program."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"I would recommend this Pulitzer Prize-winning book especially for readers who are interested in anthropology and archaeology.It is an investigation into why some human societies have been so much more successful than others, why Papua New Guinea natives have so much less in terms of material goods, less technology, poorer health and shorter life spans, etc. than do Americans, even though they are clearly as least as intelligent (Dr. Diamond believes that they are actually more intelligent.)He spent 30 years collecting information in search of an answer, and this book is the result. Certain societies were able to conquer others because they had guns, germs, and steel; which the conquered peoples did not. (For example, the Spanish conquistador Pizarro defeated the Incan leader Atahaulpa and his army of 80,000 with just 168 men!)That seems like basic common sense, but Diamond wanted to take it farther. Why did some societies have guns, germs, and steel while others did not?After years of research, his theoretical conclusion is: geography. The more fortunate peoples lived in areas where they had access to crops that could be cultivated and animals that could be domesticated. This allowed their populations to expand and gave them sufficient resources such that they could support some individuals who did not work to produce food. Such individuals were free to spend their time and efforts in developing technology.Again, Diamond's argument makes sense. The book is a compendium of information in support of his theory. Some may consider it overkill, but in a field of science in which researchers cannot perform controlled experiments and have them replicated by others, they must collect as many facts as possible to support (or refute) their theories. I consider Diamond's surfeit of information to be necessary and valid scientific investigation. Plus, it is interesting to read about.The subject matter in Guns, Germs, and Steel doesn't have the high drama of some of the things in The World Without Us, nor the humor of Bonk, (other science books I've recently read.) The subjects are more mundane and everyday, such as the development of agriculture and the use of domestic animals in food production. But these are things that are fundamental and important in understanding how civilization arose and progressed, and I find them interesting as well.Naturally, as a microbiologist, I was particularly fascinated by Diamond's theory that most or all infectious diseases arose from close contact with domesticated animals. Although I knew that some microorganisms do cross between humans and other species (mycobacteria, flu viruses, mad cow disease), and that some diseases in humans are related to similar diseases in animals (AIDS, smallpox), I had never heard it proposed that ALL diseases arose in this way. If generally true, there obviously are exceptions, such as certain types of fluke parasites that come from water snails, which have never been a domesticated animal as far as I know. And HIV appears to have originated in chimps and/or gorillas, also undomesticated. Also, the origins of most virulent organisms are too far in the past to ever be traced or proven. Still, his theory does make sense and it is an intriguing concept.A bit of trivia that I found fascinating is that the following plants are poisonous and/or inedibly bitter in their wild versions: almonds, lima beans, watermelons, eggplants, cabbage, and potatoes!This book has been criticized for repetition, and I would agree with that. However, I do see a reason for it. Guns, Germs, and Steel was written for the purpose of proposing a scientific theory, not just for entertainment, and as such it is different in structure. Since the entire book addresses different aspects of the same underlying question, naturally there is considerable overlap in some of the facts - they fit into more than one theme (and therefore more than one chapter.) Since his goal is to \\"prove\\" his theory insofar as it is possible, Diamond must muster every supporting fact he can come up with, never mind if it also supports and has been included in another facet of his investigation (and thus another chapter.) So I don't find that problematic.As for self-aggrandizement - yes, there is that, too (and it is far more apparent on the DVD.) But I can forgive that as well. Celebrity doesn't come easily to scientists in our culture - you don't write a bestseller science book, appear on TV and in a documentary film, or win the Pulitzer Prize without putting considerable effort into promoting yourself. It's just part of doing business.For an opposing viewpoint, it might be interesting to read Edward O. Wilson's book, The Diversity of Life, which takes the opposite position on why we eat the particular foods that we do, than does Diamond's theory. (Wilson believes that we eat only a very few of the wide range of available edibles simply out of habit, because they were what our neolithic ancestors cultivated. Diamond suggests that certain plants and animals are far more suitable to agriculture and domestication than others, and their availability at any given place determined how successful the culture was that lived there.)I first began listening to Guns, Germs, and Steel on audiobook, but soon realized that there is just too much detailed information in it to effectively hold in my mind, so I requested a copy of the book from the library, and I was glad that I did. Reading it for yourself also allows you to see the maps, charts, tables, drawings, and photos, of which there are a great many. This book is just too complex to translate well to audio.(518 pages, including 32 pages of plates)"},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"I was searching for a world history book that would condense the most significant events into one volume. A friend happened to recommend this book so I bought it. Although I've only read one third of the book, it seems to me a little dense and scientific. It does not read as a novel but rather as a scientific approach towards civilization. For an avid history major this may seem like the right book; however, for someone looking for a brush up on world history from a broad perspective, this book would seem technical and even boring at some points. There's also the constant referral to New Guinea in almost every significant aspect of the book; no doubt attributable to the field work performed by Diamond on this particular place. It seems however that it obscures the objectivity of world history by his specific findings and subjective conclusions. However being only a beginner in terms of world history knowledge, I would leave it up to historians to debate this last point.

This is a must read for any serious student of history. Diamond outlines convincing and easy to understand reasons why the racist view of history is baseless and shows how the environmental factors of the various continents profoundly impacted the course of human history. He ends the book arguing well that history must be considered every bit the science as epidemiology and paleontology are. Very impressive."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"The book itself is presented as a broad overview of history, as it would be impossible to paint an accurate portrayal of civilization in a book this size.

He just barely touched on the idea that maybe the varied diets of hunters and gatherers was better quality-wise than the monotonous diets of the earliest cereal farmers. (See pages 105, 112, 138 and 149 in the hardback.)Hunters and gatherers had fluoride intakes vastly greater than we do today. Fluoride is in the rougher-tougher parts of foods. For the most relevant example, the grain that cows eat has about 100 times the fluoride of the bread that we eat. The same is true between cow's pasture grass and our vegetables like broccoli. In some cases the difference goes the other way. For example, our canned salmon with the bones has much higher fluoride than their salmon meat peeled off the bones. But all totaled a reasonable estimate is that hunters and gatherers got about 5 times the fluoride of modern people.A common misconception is that if we were hunters and gatherers we would die by about age 30 because our teeth would rot out. Nothing could be farther from the truth. Almost any book on anthropology will tell you that it was hard to find so much as a trace of tooth decay before agriculture was adopted. In fact, that is one clue used to say that people had started farming - their teeth started showing small areas with weak enamel called enamel defects, and traces of decay. Even with primitive agriculture, many groups still had almost zero decay. This was especially true if they lived near the sea (seafood is very rich in fluoride, roughly 10 times a fresh water equivalent). Although tooth decay is largely under control in modern America, it is often called the most common disease on earth.The spread of tooth decay is an excellent example of Diamond's &quot;arrow of disease&quot; concept. There is a 1945 book, a bit weird and very obscure, that tells the story of how people's teeth changed when their diets changed from primitive to modern. It is called Nutrition and Physical Degeneration, by Weston A. Price, DDS. The interesting thing is that the changes happened not so much to the first people to eat modern food, but to their children who were conceived, born, and raised on it. The older generation, even the very oldest, had fine sets of teeth. The children had both rampant dental caries and crooked teeth - and a whole litany of other health problems. The pictures and examples in this book are staggering.By a quirk of fate there is also a story about a group of people whose diets went the other way. A group of modern settlers got stranded on an island, Tristan da Cunha, for a few decades when shipping routes changed. When they were found their children had near-perfect teeth. Increased fluoride in their diet was given the credit. (Sognnaes 1941, Journal of Dental Research 20:16.) When they once again returned to modern foods, the new kids born had rotten teeth. (Rosevear 1993, PPNF Nutrition Journal 17(1):12.)During the 1930's many mineral deficiencies were discovered. One of the big stories of the 1940's was that fluoride in water supplies was found to reduce dental decay by about 50%. This finding, by a public health dentist, H. Trendly Dean, reverberated throughout the dental community. Shortly thereafter followed the first official U.S. recommendation to use fluoride supplements for preventing tooth decay, by McClure in 1943, and the first artificial fluoridation of water, by public health dentists in 1945, and the formation of anti-fluoridationist groups by other dentists.About half the country ended up fluoridated. For the rest of us there were fluoride products prescribed by doctors. In 1961 the first popular fluoride-vitamin supplements were used in pregnancy and childhood. These products prevented virtually 100% of all cavities in teeth that formed while the fluoride was being taken. They also caused quite a few cases of &quot;mild fluorosis&quot; (white spots on teeth) when the early doses were way too high for infants. A low and steady supply of fluoride during pregnancy and childhood helped create the gorgeous teeth you see on so many young people today. Modern doctors such as FB Glenn and TC Peebles discovered some of these techniques and have written about them in great detail.I would have enjoyed his book more if Diamond had stumbled onto some of these fluoride stories, but overall it is still a great read."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"There are so many things wrong with this book,I don't know where to start. First, the author sees himself as a scientist and writes like he is providing an article to Vanity Fair. Ignoring science, disregarding significant works and stating opinion as fact he proceeds to batter us with trivia while ignoring facts. I have no argument with the inability of IQ tests to accurately define human intelligence as it relates to practical capability. That doesn't mean, as one of the other reviewers mentioned, that the Bell Curve is not a significant book. Argue the rationale not simply state an opinion and walk away. This book is so plagued with bad science and silly extrapolations from 11,000 years ago that it ignores many of the realities of history.

Absolutely rediculous. I cannot believe anyone let this book get published with such a silly theory."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"Jared Diamond's Thesis of \\"Guns Germs and Steel\\" is summed up in its enigmatic title: those who posses these items have an overwhelming advantage over those who don't. This work, which I apparently was an early adopter seeing that it is still on the best seller list a full six years after I read it, is very well researched and rather convincing in its argument. Of course the geographic argument is not really new but it is somewhat better logically (albeit possibly overly politically correct) than biological arguments for Europe's cultural supremacy. The idea that mankind (and thus cultural information) generally migrates in east-west directions and moreover the idea that mankind moves for the sake of food and population growth also makes sense. All of that being said, we can easily see why Europe and Asia made such great societal advances while the rest of the world remained in hunter gatherer societies since they had fertile land plenty of irrigation and movement through navigable rivers. Further Diamond states it was the accident of firearms that allowed Europeans to subjugate the world. I use the word accident because it seems most likely that development of the gun was done with out much realization of propulsion or the power of expanding gas. Regardless of the how they came to be, Diamond states that it was guns that set the Europeans apart from the Chinese and here is where the logic of his argument reaches shaky ground: It is pretty obvious that it was a categorical and fundamental shift in thought on the part of the Europeans and a Isolationist view along with a world view that saw time as circular and nature as supreme on the part of the Chinese that caused the supremacy of Europe. While it is true that the discovery of guns and other revolutionary technologies like the sextant, stirrup and windmill as well advancements in shipbuilding and mapmaking provided the tools for supremacy it was the shift in thought that nature and the world was to be dominated by civilized man that motivated Europeans toward supremacy.While I can't fully buy in to Diamond's theory I really did enjoy reading the book. It is full of great anecdotes and is very well written. Diamond knows how to formulate an argument and skirt around the issues that might defeat it. This book does provide an excellent account of the shift from hunter gatherer societies to farming and has a great value in having on of the best developed geographic argument for civilization I have come across. Knowing this, I still highly recommend the work and though I am really amazed that this book has had such a long lifespan on best seller lists I can understand why: It is an enjoyable read and if the reader be uninformed it is very convincing. I say give it a go and read this book at least you will be on the same page as literate America and if you are well informed on the subject the argument will be enjoyable and somewhat enlightening.Ted Murena"},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"This book addresses a basic, yet very complicated question. Today, nations of Europe (or European descent, ie the U.S.) dominate the world. They have the most economic, military and political power. Why?For example, Europeans ended up completely conquering the Americas. Why did that happen, instead of Native Americans conquering Europe? The obvious answer is this book's title. The Europeans had better weapons, better technology, better national organization, and were vectors for more lethal diseases (most notably smallpox). But why did those conquering advantages develop in Europe rather than the Americas (or Africa or Australia)?Diamond's answer boils down to geography. In short, the Eurasian landmass had advantages that the other continents lacked. More domesticatable plants (leading to more success in the agricultural revolution). More domesticatable animals (assisting with farming, labor, war - and the aforementioned germs). An east-west axis, with less severe geographic barriers (ie Africa being cut off by the sahara) allowing agriculture and technology to spread.He explores these factors, and others, in detail. He cites evidence to support his case: biological, archaeological, linguistic. He also takes us on a brief history of human history over the last 13,000 years, and convincingly attacks racist views that whites took over because other people are stupider. (Noting, for example, that people in all parts of the world domesticated pretty much every plant possible - even modern technology hasn't improved on our old record in that area. If you were unlucky enough to live where there were few such domesticatable flora... you had a problem.)On the downside, while Diamond makes his argument convincing, he perhaps tried too hard to do so, and ends up repeating his points a bit. The topic is, of course, a vast, incredibly complicated one, and he speaks in general terms on some points, often simplifying a certain subject (but to his credit, admits when he is doing so).There is a lot of interesting history to be learned here, and it is well argued and well written. If the topic interests you, this book will will clearly whet your apetite to learn more."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"Diamond argues persuasively and backs up his arguments thoroughly - almost too thoroughly.

Jared Diamond wrote his book in a unique way: he asked the questions, and then went on the explain them. This made his point clear and understandable. Although Mr. Diamond covered numerous questions in each chapter, he thoroughly explained his answers and did not rush one to understand his logic. This is a great book with only 2 flaws: it requires 100% attentiveness, and it takes forever to read!! :-)"},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"I read this book before taking the History of Western Civilzation, and before taking US History. I have quoted it no less than a dozen times in various papers I have written. And I am certain I will continue to use it as a reference for many years to come. If you're not really interested in History as a discipline, this might be tedious for you. But if you are interested in how we got here, repeating themes throughout the ages, and very plausible explanations and deductions about why the world is the way it is, this study is a great place to start.There is only one possible assumption made in this book that could eventually prove wrong. Just as every other historian that I know of has claimed, Diamond buys into the population of the Americas by East Asians who crossed Beringia and eventually migrated south. Certainly, this is a plausible assumption. But just as I finished this book, word came out of South America of discoveries at some archeological dig that provided evidence that ancient Amerinds might have a different origin..which is the one assumption I kept questioning as I was reading the book. If this turns into solid proof, it means that humans might have spontaneously evolved in the Americas at about the same time they spontaneously evolved in the Fertile Crescent. It will be interesting to follow these new archealogical clues as we learn of them. But even if this turns out to be true, it won't, in my opinion, have much effect on the major points that Diamond makes in this book. The Europeans still came over with the Guns, Germs, and the Steel -- so much for the mass of Native Americans."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"An elegantly concieved and well executed exploration of the effects of geography and prehistory on the state of modern societies.

This very ambitious book attempts to give the ultimate why.True, there are lots of expositions of the data behind the theories. Some reviewers think it is fluff or just burdensome to read but these expositions are necessary to make the point convincingly. The people whose racist notions he is rebutting require that his points be made very convincingly and thoroughly. Sadly, it's still not enough to undo the wrong-headed racist views that some hold. Although it is hardly the main point of the book, the book is a thorough rebuttal of racism.The reviewer who thought that this book represents racism against whites has missed the point entirely. The author's point, in this case, is that modern culture (TV in particular) provides activities for children that can inhibit intellectual and social growth.

The book presents a lot of food for thought which the reader should find illuminating."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"Dr. Diamond's book answering such a huge question of human anthropological history is well appreciated. A brilliantly crafted and very thorough examination of the reasons that we live in a Eurocentric world. A very satisfying and interesting read, and thoroughly thought provoking.

Why did the Europeans conquer the new world, rather than the other way around? Why did Europeans colonize Africa? Traditional explanations have relied on European racial superiority, a notion both morally abhorrent and scientifically refuted. Diamond builds on the work of anthropology, sociology, agriculture, immunology, and many other disciplines to put forth a coherent set of explanations for the ascendancy of different peoples throughout our 13,000 year history as a civilized species.

Diamond's primary contention is that white people and western society have gained cultural and social dominance not as a result of any will or abilities of their own, but as a by product of how many domesticable animals and the variety of plant life that make up their environment. While other less fortunate societies didn't have these \\"luxuries\\" to take advantage of. Uh, excuse me, it doesn't take a genius to realize the botanical and zoological superiority of Africa for example. Off the top of my head, I can list several potentially demosticle species of large animals in Africa, Asia and Australia. How many can you think of in Europe? The really sad thing is, judging by its popularity and years on the bestseller lists, people are eating this stuff up. This guy obviously hates himself or has spent a little too much time in that New Guinea sun. This type of, I hate to say it, liberal drivel is sickening.

When I have visited the so called &quot;underdeveloped&quot; countries, I found that those that would call themselves minorities here were actually living lives that I envied. I found that because they held onto values and practices for hundreds of years, they were much more at peace than western man.This author is an elitist while attempting to create an excuse for cultures that didn't &quot;develop&quot; like white people. How can you say that the white way is the right way?I have found greater values in the cultures found in Latin and African societies that have been less tainted by western values that destroy the land. Look at our lives that are consumed by trinkets. We care more about trinkets than about raising our own children. The double income family wants trinkets over having an actual family unit.Compare that to the so called undeveloped nations.

Thematically, the work lapses into excessive rationalizations of the reasons for the variability of technological development amongst societies. It is burdened by anecdote rather than analytic science (e.g. the author's assertion that today's hunter-gatherers are more intelligent than members of technologically advanced societies), and the aforementioned excess bias.

No protein, hmmmm, what could this mean? Why, those poor people!And even though you would think that this work might lose all credibility if when discussing human cultures, he were to leave out such a grossly significant fact, as the observation that the rugged terrain of the thousands of square miles of the New Guinea highlands is most well known, among educated people, as the home of a people that have been nothing for thousands of years but stone age men without a written language, or any metal tools, but with a human bone or a nasal shell through their septum because they are the world's most feared cannibals.Yet not one word will you find in this book about that, but with a subtle nod of Jared's head for those in the know, wink wink, that oh, their natural diet has no protein. So, of course, the same trade routes and tasty plants that led other peoples to great things, through no fault or effort of their own, left these poor people in New Guinea very hungry. Very hungry for protein!You will kill anyone who disagrees with you, by the end of this great work, about the fact that all cultures just have different ways of solving the same universal problems, like protein deficiency for example. And that socialism and capitalism and communism and cannibalism are all just different ways of accomplishing the very same things. Except for capitalism, of course, which is grossly unfair to the poor and to be despised!You will always have a warm feeling in your stomach, as well, at the secret thoughts that you will imagine that you only realize to yourself after reading this book, about how white boys aren't really anything special after all, despite what you had previously been tricked into believing, in how they just happened to find themselves on east west trade routes near plants that just happened to contain protein.Of course, you will find many other new ideas in this book, such as Jared Diamond's suggestion in the introduction, that Western civilization encourages white boys to pass on their genes, no matter how intellectually deficient they might be, because Western civilization makes so few demands upon its citizens. Which is why you must be given this book to read even before your orientation, while you are still unlearned enough to not even know about the famous cowry shell collecting New Guinea cannibals."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"Most explanations of why Western Europeans came to dominate the world range from subtly to disgustingly racist.

The book is jammed full of research on every angle, from diet to language to ideology in the development of human society.

This is one of those books. In Guns, Germs, and Steel Diamond investigates human prehistory from a scientific perspective drawing on numerous disciplines to develop a hypothesis that the globally unbalanced rise of civilization and technology was primarily a function of advantageous environmental conditions and resources available to those societies where civilization arose. Though the present landscape may suggest that early societies were on a relatively equal environmental playing field, Diamond's scientific review of the evidence indicates convincingly otherwise. A particularly persuasive point in the book argues that environmental conditions amenable to agriculture (mild climate, indigenous protein-rich plants, and large indigenous domestication-ready animals) facilitated a food surplus and consequently denser populations with surplus time for some members of the society to take on trades, invent, engineer, lead, develop government, heal, build, paint, etc. Innovations then fuelled more surplus time perpetuating a tornado of advancement, sparked in large part by the proverbial flapping butterfly wings of agriculture.Diamond's book challenged my fractured knowledge of human prehistory leaving worldview shattering ideas in its wake. His book also sparked my renewed interest in geography, anthropology, archaeology, weather, and geology among others. The book's fusion of the scientific method with the study of history was quite potent and refreshing, though at times overly reductionist. As such, less scientifically reducible elements like culture and religion are not considered within his hypothesis.At times the book did seem to forgo scientific rigor for political correctness. For example, though Diamond relies on numerous examples of relatively recent non-human elements of natural selection and genetics to build his case, he is unwilling to discuss the potential role of human biological variation created by our settling contrasting environments. Considering modern humans resided and/or began migrating to new and varied lands over 100,000 years ago, there seems sufficient time for some physiological variations to develop that may be relevant to Diamond's case. Unfortunately for this reader, anticipating a compelling argument either way, Diamond just states that environment-induced genetic variations are irrelevant to societal development (and \\"loathsome\\" to even think about) as if it were a self-evident axiom. Curiously, he challenges this axiom himself by postulating that the people of New Guinea are likely smarter than the average human considering the mental acuity necessary to survive in their harsh environment.Overall, besides some minor disappointments, this was a spectacular book and I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"First, a quick description of what this book does and what it does not do. Diamond presents an excellent summary of ideas on why native Eurasians came to dominate native Americans, Africans and Australians. He explains some existing theories clearly and relatively concisely (despite some repetition)and adds in some plausible new ideas of his own. His main thesis is that geography and an abundance of domesticable plants and animals gave the Eurasians a clear advantage over others. Contrary to what some critics seem to have been expecting, &quot;Guns, Germs and Steel&quot; does not explain why Europeans came to dominate rather than Indians, Chinese or other Eurasians. Although the European conquest of America is used as an example throughout, the Europeans are intended as representatives of Eurasia rather than as a distinct culture within the continent. This book takes the reader up to the point where nations and empires developed (about 3000 years ago in Eurasia). For further examination of how different societies within Eurasia developed beyond that point I recommend David Landes' &quot;The Wealth and Poverty of Nations&quot;.Within the scope of what Diamond addresses, I found the book to be very informative and well written, in an easy style that combined theory with examples from history and the occasional anecdote. As other reviewers have said, there are plenty of other books that contain more detail for those who want it, but as a newcomer to the subject I learned a lot from this book.The one drawback I found is that the reader is asked to accept a lot of information merely on the word of the author. If Diamond had added references to other books and journal articles as notes to the text he would have greatly enhanced the authority of the book."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"I read this book when it came out and saw Diamond on the lecture circuit when he plugged the book. I thought highly of it at the time. Seeing it still selling well four years later, I wanted to review it but felt a re-reading was in order. It was even better this time.Diamond's central rhetorical device is answering New Guinean friend Yali's questions why Europeans have so many more goods than New Guineans do. The answer is location, location, location: location with lots of domesticable crops; location with lots of domesticable animals; and location with lots of productive acreage having 'Goldilocks' access to the rest of the world -- strong enough for crop and idea diffusion but weak enough to prevent political unification. The book is twenty solidly written essays like his 'Discover' magazine articles. Linguistics, evolutionary biology, history, archaeology, anthropology, epidemiology, agronomy and paleontology are just part of the palette from which Diamond draws for his sweeping portrait of the most recent 13,000 years of human existence.There is hardly a wrong word written, a false step taken, or an error made in this exciting book, which delights in no small part by raising as many questions as it answers. Diamond knows a lot about a lot of things, and provides many an aha! moment. He also asks interesting questions about some things that neither he or anyone else knows about, and those questions are as interesting as any of his answers. He answers questions like: How did Africa become black? How did China become Chinese? and Why aren't Australia, New Guinea, and Malaysia Polynesian? One may not like the answers, but he takes a great shot at them, and I relish his doing so. He asks why proselytizing religion (Christianity and Islam) were driving forces for conquest among Europeans and West Asians but not Chinese. He also relates several interesting bits about his extensive field work (as an ornithologist) in New Guinea.The best page of the book is page 87, figure 4.1, &quot;Factors Underlying the Broadest Pattern of History.&quot; The entire book is spent explaining that diagram, which is itself an answer to What are the proximate, intermediate, and ultimate causes to history's broadest pattern? I would modify his ultimate factors to be geography (adding carrying capacity to his east/west axis) and, more controversially, co-evolution between humans and large animals (with respect to their availability and behavior). I am also surprised that he did not cite the island-area effect in species or cultural diversity. But perhaps that would have been gilding the lily. There is nothing in the author's framework that precludes a change in where the most goods are today. He notes carrying capacities and access have changed radically over the last 13,000 years, shifting the balance of power from time to time. 200 years ago, for instance, China had the most goods. 200 years from now it may again.If you like history, evolutionary biology or (like me) both, read this book today!"},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"Jared Diamond is a thoroughgoing geographical determinist. His book highlights both the strengths and the weaknesses of this approach.Diamond's major topic is the Neolithic Revolution. His intention is to demonstrate that environmental conditions were not equally suitable to the development of agriculture on different continents. Eurasia, he contends, was the most appropriate place. It had the largest number of domesticable plants and animals, an east-west axis favoring the diffusion of inventions, offered good possibilities for inter-continental communication, and was the largest and most populous continent. So the Eurasians were first in developing agriculture, gaining thus a headstart in history. Agriculture led to rising polulations and created a dynamic that prompted the evolution of states, writing and a sophisticated technology (guns and steel). These social and technological advantages, plus immunity to the most dangerous infectious diseases (germs), allowed Eurasians to easily subdue the natives of the Americas, Australia and Southeast Asia.On the whole this argument, which takes up the first 410 pages of the book, is convincing. Diamond is also right to insist on adopting a long time-frame. As early as 8000 years ago Eurasians had a substantial edge over their rivals on other continents, making it unlikely for those peoples and civilizations to catch up.Had Diamond stopped writing at this point, he would have published a good work.However, he was not content to treat only the Neolithic Revolution, but wanted to cover all major turns in world history. Hence the last 15 (!) pages of the book are devoted to a completely different subject. Having explained the rise of Eurasia, Diamond now wants to explain the rise of the West. Quickly the question becomes: Why Europe, not China? Borrowing an idea from Eric Jones ('The European Miracle'; but beware: Jones' approach is much more sophisticated than Diamond's, avoiding any kind of monocausal determinism) Diamond provides a simple answer: Europe was geographically more diverse than China. Therefore it did not become politically unified. Political fragmentation led to openness and openness to progress - ideas and inventions that were rejected at one place could succeed at another.This speculation is not plausible at all.First, there is no geographical NECESSITY for European fragmentation and Chinese unity. Europe has many features favoring political unity. Its long coastline and a great number of navigable rivers allow for easy transportation by water, offering an important asset to any would-be imperial power. The Romans took advantage of this to the utmost, and if they were able to conquer a great part of the continent, there can surely have been no compelling GEOGRAPHICAL reason for later powers to fail. Diamond himself seems to realize this, when he admits that India had even more agricultural core areas than Europe. Yet India was ruled as a unified empire for most of its history.Second, Diamond's explanation - even if assumed to be correct - accounts only for INNOVATION. It tells us why certain inventions made by Chinese craftsmen were never introduced into the production-process of China's economy. A more important question to ask would have been why many significant inventions were not made in China in the first place. A prime example coming to mind is modern natural science, which was never developed in the Middle Kingdom.Third, it is easy to see that Diamond's argument is undermined by his own evidence. As he tells us, China was scientifically and technologically ahead of Europe (and the rest of the world) for more than 1000 years. If China could achieve this superiority despite its supposed geographical disadvantages, we cannot escape the conclusion that those disadvantages either did not exist or were of minor importance. Europe, on the other hand, remained a cultural backwater for most of its history despite its supposed geographical advantages. Again, we cannot but conclude that these advantages either did not exist or were of minor importance.Thus Diamond's environmentalism is completely refuted by Chinese and European history before 1500 a.d. Moreover, no other version of geographical determinism is likely to fare better. Since China's geography did not change within the last 2000 years, every purely geographical interpretation of its history must be wrong. It will either fail to account for the period of Chinese superiority or for the period of Chinese backwardness.Diamond's errors are grounded in his method. Geographical determinism can explain the Neolitic Revolution, because this transformation was brought about by small bands of hunter-gatherers extremely dependant on their environment. Even so, Diamond needs FOUR causal factors to account for its different outcome on each continent (1. The wild plant and animal species available; 2. Orientation of the major continental axis; 3. Possibilities for inter-continental communication, 4. Size of area and population of a given continent). When we look at the great Eurasian civilizations, we have to deal with a type of society vastly more complex and far less dependant on its environment than are bands of hunter-gatherers. Yet Diamond wants to explain the history of these civilizations with reference to just ONE causal factor (the impact of geography on political unity). Instead of becoming more sophisticated in accordance with its subject, Diamond's approach turns brutally simplistic just as it is applied to the most difficult problem of world history.It is unlikely that the rise of the West can ever be explained geographically. Any serious attempt to write global history for periods after the Neolithic Revolution will have to be sensitive to the complex interplay between geography, economy, technology, politics and culture that shapes the development of large societies. The work of Max Weber and Fernand Braudel provides good examples of the kind of scholarship needed for this task. Jared Diamond's book not only fails to rise up to this standard, but is crude, superficial and disappointing even from a geographical point of view.Clearly Diamond did not know when to put his pen down. His book would have been better if he had refrained from addressing topics unsuited to his method."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"Geography is destiny is the moral of this book. At the beginning he relates a question posed to him by a New Guinea native: Why is it that the whites have all the cargo [technology] and his compatriots don't?Diamond boils it down to four key issues: the availability of plants and animals to be domesticated, the ease with which this domestication can be transferred (east-west being easier than north-south due to similar climates), isolation, and the size of the population. What we call western civilization emerged in the fertile soil of southwestern Asia, with a host of available plants and animals for domestication. It then spread rapidly along the east-west axis of Eurasia. This reliance on farming made a dense population possible, which along with the proximity of the domesticated animals led to a host of endemic diseases. These diseases, when brought to the Americas, did more to subjugate the natives than either the guns or the steel of the title.This thesis is explained in detail, first in overview and then with the quick example of the Polynesian islands. Part two of the book covers food production and the domestication of animals. Part three expands by covering the increase in disease and the spread of writing and technology based on the previous principles. And the final part provides a quick investigation of five parts of the world that demonstrate how geography affected their inhabitation and culture.It's a powerful and persuasive thesis, though Diamond admits that further investigation is needed.His prose is straightforward if somewhat rhetorical. He hews very closely to the advice that a writer should tell you what he's going to tell you, tell you, then tell you what he's told you. He's also quite fond of rhetorical questions, though this seems a useful device in this context.Overall, it's a fascinating and thought-provoking book, and includes an extension section on recommended further reading--all of which sound very interesting as well!"},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"Jared Diamond set out to do two very difficult things in this book: first, by his own admission, to summarize in one book 13,000 years of homo sapiens' history, and second, to write a popular, entry level book about the complexities of geographical and environmental determinism. To his credit, he brings both off very well.Diamonds' thesis, as noted by other reviewers, is that the triumph of western culture traces in large measure to accidents of geography and environment. In particular, the east-west orientation of Eurasia and the abundance of usable crop species and animal species in Eurasia in general and the Fertile Crescent in particular. The ability to create domestic crops and domestic animals, by his reasoning, led through a series of steps to the development of larger communities, the development of technology, and the triumph of the West.Diamond's critics accuse him of political correctness, of over-simplification and determinism. I don't believe any of those criticisms is accurate.Diamond frankly admits he is challenging the myth of caucasian inherent superiority. The sense of outrage some reviewers express when Diamond states that the most intelligent man he knows is a New Guinean &quot;primitive&quot; more or less proves Diamond's point. By confusing intelligence with education, and a subsistence culture with technological culture, those critics demonstrate and illustrate the myth Diamond addresses.Half of his critics accuse Diamond of oversimplification; the other half complain that he repeats points and that the book is hard to read. I think this is mostly reaction to the common problem of a scholarly subject being treated in a popularization. It is a very difficult thing for a scientist to write a popularization of his or her subject that isn't either condescendingly simplistic or too complex for lay readers. Diamond strikes a nice balance.Finally, critics claim that Diamond is asserting a kind of determinism that denies free will and understates cultural variables. They point to cultural variables like religion (the aggressiveness of Christianity and Moslem beliefs, for example), social, intellectual and others that are overwhelmingly important today. Those critics are missing Diamond's key point: it was those geographical and environmental factors he identifies that made the development of those cultural variables possible.Overall, this book is a very significant contribution to lay understanding of why the West &quot;has more cargo&quot; than other cultures. It is not intended to be a work of pure scholarship; it doesn't pretend that this is the Complete and Final Answer. It is frank in identifying issues still be be addressed. I strongly recommend it to any reader who wants to better understand the world we have inherited."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"In this single volume, Jared Diamond, professor of physiology and geography at UCLA, attempts to outline history's broadest pattern. He takes as his subject matter everything that has happened on all continents for the last 13,000 years. In 11,000 BC, at the end of the last Ice Age, all societies were on equal footing, existing as bands of preliterate hunter-gatherers. Yet by 1532 AD the Spanish conquistador Pizarro with 169 men was able to travel across thousands of miles of ocean and conquer the Incas at Cajamarca in spite of being vastly outnumbered. The poximate causes were guns, germs, and steel. However, this book is more concerned with ultimate causes, that is to say, broader patterns. Diamond finds the answer in geography and environmental endowment.The title is a little perplexing since the thesis that Diamond is setting forth does not explain proximate causes, it deals with more remote causation. For example, it explains why Europe was the most wealthy and powerful continent in 1500, but it doesn't explain why it was the Spanish that conquered the Incas or the Aztecs for that matter, or why, for example, Great Britain was the most powerful European country in 1850.Diamond tells us that the key to understanding human history is food production. The parts of the world that were endowed with a wide variety of domesticable plants and animals and a geography favorable to their migration and diffusion had clear advantages over other societies. There were some excellent chapters in this book on the origins of agriculture. He describes all the benefits of the domestication of large animals and their living in close proximity with human beings. This happened extensively in Europe and China, providing these populations with immunities to various diseases over the course of centuries. Agriculture led to more complex stratified societies with central government, writing, iron tools, standing armies, etc. It was for this reason - food production - that the world's most wealthy and powerful societies originated on the Eurasian continent.Diamond flatly rejects the notion that some societies were either culturally or racially superior. Some critics have simply called this political correctness, while others claim he is merely reinforcing Eurocentrism by claiming it was geographically inevitable. True, Diamond argues that any cultural or technological advantage was rooted in geography and environmental richness. But within the parameters of that determinism, historical actors still have considerable room to fail or succeed. Europeans have been ascendent for the last 500 hundred years; this does not mean that there position is somehow guaranteed. In the last twenty years there has been an enormous transfer of wealth, technology, and power to China and India, it appears they may soon achieve great power status.Most historians do not work on the scale that Diamond does. Instead of continents and millenium, they choose narrower geographic areas with much shorter time frames. Most historians also, from a much more proximate point of view, see history in terms of human ideas and conscious human actions, rather than a series of responses to the environment. Diamond has neglected, for example, to explain the emergence of modern science and its impact on societies. He also neglects to explain the impact of relgion, other than as a mere handmaiden of the state. In his attempt to achieve a grand theory of history he ulitimately fails - as all those before him have.Nevertheless , this is a monumental work of learning and originality, worthy of the Pulitzer Prize that it received. It is disingenuous for some reviewers to dismiss it as simply a theory of geographical determinism. It is much more, it spans a wide range of disciplines and it goes a long way in explaining the distribution of wealth and power among societies for the last 13,000 years."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"With so many reviews already available, there is no need to repeat main arguments of this extremely interesting and well-written book. I'll rather concentrate on several of the most controversial issues.It is impossible to write a comprehensive treatise on world history, which will not induce attacks on political and cultural grounds. Some critics blamed J. Diamond for advocacy of pure geographic determinism, that &quot;culture doesn't matter&quot; and so on. I think it is unjustified. He considered foremost the time before and during emergence of agricultural and, consequently, sedentary societies, not today's civilizations. When human population consisted of small bands and, later, tribes, their development was determined by environmental factors. Indeed, evidence from all continents suggests similarities in the emergence of domesticated plants, agriculture, and village life, starting about 10.000 years ago. The difference was in speed of this process - faster in places of benign environment, where food resources allowed denser population, slower in more adverse areas. As human societies grew in complexity and technological and cultural sophistication, more nonlinear interactions and feedbacks emerged. Then geography had likely to become less of a decisive factor, at least in a relatively straightforward way described by J. Diamond.Moreover, history of the last few thousand years didn't resemble anything like the linear ascendance of the Western Europe. Western civilization achieved its dominance right at the moment when advances in ship-building and navigational technology brought the era of &quot;great geographic discoveries&quot; starting in 1492, which led to colonization of much of the world. Had seafaring been more developed before, during the Islamic dominance of several centuries earlier, or had China not scrapped its fleet and long-range exploration plans in early XV century, the world history of the last five hundred years could be very different.Some readers took issue with the author's statement that &quot;average Guinean is probably smarter than average westerner&quot;. It is indeed highly debatable, even with the notion of &quot;smartness&quot; very different for different people. However, if one puts aside cheap chauvinism, one can see that there is something to this statement. A Guinean lives in a very diverse natural environment. He constantly needs to actively process (in contrast to, say, watching TV) large amount of information relevant to his essential survival and well-being. Another reason is that the Darwinian &quot;survival of the fittest&quot; mechanism still works in tribal New Guinea, while amenities of the modern consumer society allow procreation of relatively unattractive, inept and stupid people.Primary enabling factors of early civilization developments was the availability of domesticable plants and animals. Interestingly, the role of animals, as follows from the author's discourse, was much greater in this respect. Indeed, domesticated plants number many hundreds species, with each major agricultural regions having at least several developed crops. In contrast, large domesticable animals good for field work and transportation, are much rare. American continent and much of Africa didn't have suitable animals at all. Domesticated animals not only provide muscle power, but also make humans adaptable to germs. This allowed expansion into new regions with different germ population, which was one of the crucial factors in rapid conquering of Latin American territory by Spain.In Jared Diamond view the ultimate cause of Eurasian (and later European) domination is the extent of the East-West axis - largest for Eurasia and much smaller for other continents. Latitude stretch of Eurasian landmass certainly did play a role, but it is likely overstated by the author. Total East-West extent of the Eurasia was probably irrelevant, and the history of Sumerian and Egyptian empires would likely have been similar even without the Europe west of Greece and the Asia east of Persia. The crucial property was the Mediterranean and the Middle East juncture (Fertile Crescent and neighboring coastal territories). Was it latitudinal dominance or a fractal coastline? The role of a long, winding coastline could be a very significant one. It provides a lot of beachfront and river estuary water resources, temperate seashore climate, great variety of flora and fauna from sea level to mountains nearby. All this ensures richness of resources sustaining high-density human population. At the same time such topography allows easy interaction, trade and exchange between settlements, while preserving pockets of diversity and preventing easy conquering and destruction by a dominant tribe, unlike in areas of open mid-continent plains. Indeed, it is evident in this book that the Fertile Crescent and two-river delta in China are the only places having this combination of climate, topography and biological resources.To stress the importance of geographic factors and in particular availability of domesticable animals, the author mentions a curious fact - the absence of wheeled transport on American continent. To J. Diamond the failure of relatively advanced Mesoamerican cultures to develop wheeled transportation was due to the lack of any domesticated animals, which could be used to power them. Indeed, he argues, they had used wheels in toys, therefore they didn't lack technological creativity in this respect. I disagree with the author on this issue. There is a huge difference between a toy wheel - something rotating on an axis - and a working tool for transportation. The latter needs much higher degree of sophistication than many other contemporary technologies. A wheel even in a simple wheelbarrow must be very round and well-balanced on an axle, have a very sturdy and low-friction axle and hub, firm but light and flexible stress-distributing spokes and stress-tolerant outer edge. A transportation carriage in addition to that needs to have a sophisticated amortization system for a smooth ride, and a suitable harness for the animal. Manufacturing an inexpensive, sturdy and reliable wheel for hauling and transportation was a very tough challenge. Still, the question of why Mesoamerican cultures hadn't developed a wheel requires further scrutiny. Perhaps the reason was related to available material technologies and quality of soil less suitable to build roads."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"This book attempts to explain the current social-racial-political state of the world as natural endpoints from goings-on in prehistory. Although my title is obviously less sexy than Mr. Diamond's, anyone who has read this book will agree it is certainly more accurate of the content. Jared Diamond applies a very rational, non-racist*, evolutionary-like hypothesis to peoples and their surroundings. He correctly downplays individual great leaders of history as inevitable by-products of circumstance. And he ignores the influence of the great religions, I suspect, because his timeline for the workings of complex culture goes much further back. It got the Pulitzer prize for good reason. However, one small sentence in the introduction bothered me. In discrediting racial superiority and inferiority for the entire book, *he feels the need to tell the reader he thinks the average Papuan New Guinea native is intellectially more capable than the average European. Now why would he go say a thing like that? Mr. Diamond's dream is to have enough of his ideas put into a &quot;formula&quot; for explaining successful nation-peoples. Scholars will always argue and explain-away the past, but predicting the future I am afraid won't be possible. It is one thing for Mr. Diamond to take all the known earthy facts of the last 13,000 years (from archeology, genetic crop analyses, linguistic clues, ect.), organize them, and then say &quot;Told you so&quot; as if he knew all along everthing would happen as it did. It is quite another thing to predict, borrowing from evolutionary tenets, as his predecessor at Natural History Magazine, Stephen J. Gould, is well aware, when that randomness is by definition unpredictable, and never can be accounted for in history. That would be dull determinism, which has been disproved a credible philosophy since quantum theory. To his credit, Jared Diamond admittedly tells us his own theories would have led to misguided conclusions if he were to make them at various time stops in history. All in all though, it seems more than reasonable that the world was moved by &quot;Big Ideas&quot; applicable to the long run. I found the book to be highly readable, a seminal work of importance; and further recommend it to any scientifically curious person."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"I concur with most of the favorable reviews. The subject and thesis are fascinating. The delivery is less than perfect. The fact that the thesis is also politically correct does not make it any less compelling. Addressing some of the unfavorable reviews below: Repetitive? Yes, but certain dynamics neccessarily repeat. Culture, Food production, language, writing and other technologies (and animal and plant species themselves) make their transfer from the peoples of one geographical location to those of another based on the same repeating factors: presence or absence of geographical and climatalogical barriers, density of population (i.e. &quot;critical mass&quot;), and finally whether the receiving culture is otherwise primed to receive. This point neccessarily has to be repeated throughout the book. Technology transfer across geographical boundries. The criticism here is that the author picks and chooses which technologies could have been expected to transfer. (&quot;The easy ones transfer, the hard ones don't,&quot; implying that the Australians, for example were to stupid to make use of Indonesian tools, or the Sub-Saharan Africans to use writing.) I found no contradiction here. The individual nature of each advance in technology determines whether it will (a)likely transfer and (b)&quot;stick&quot; in a new location. The analysis is very neccessarily case by case, depending on need, availiblility of raw materials, climate, population density, and stage of prior cultural development. Can even the greatest salesman really sell refrigerators to Eskimos? -- or even to New Guineans, if they don't have electric plugs? The Mexican wheel. I too noted the contradiction here. The lack of a beast of burden does not render this technology any less valuable. Why didn't Aztec kids who played with toy wheels grow up to be Aztec adults who pushed wheelbarrows or pulled carts up ramps to build pyramids? Is it possible that Diamond has stretched too far in &quot;discovering&quot; an Aztec wheel in the pictures on Aztec pottery? I agree that the photos add nothing. Some intermediate junior editor pulled out his set of old National Geographics and threw in a few photos to make the book more salable."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"Jared Diamond is a multiple-carat writer that could have been better cut. His book is both ludicrously ambitious in its goal and thoroughly pragmatic in its approach: to tell the history of the world of the past 15'000 years, with a twist. The twist being his angle on things we thought we'd heard before. Like for instance the way the Spaniards overtook the Inca Empire, which Diamond makes boil down to habitat, climate, square mile per person and geology, rather than culture, religion, races or other sophistications. Civilization, for Diamond, is the consequence of many natural and physical causes he's arduously trying to figure out. Arduously, because he sometimes takes 30 pages to demonstrate something the average reader I am already realized after one paragraph. The academic that Diamond is shines through the thinker he's striving to be.

I've gotten to read about the fascinating circumstances that led to Western dominance of the modern world. Who would have thought that something as simple as the size of seeds in the local wild grasses would ultimately lead to Europe's eventual conquest of the entire globe (except China).And Native Americans had a distinct disadvantage because local large mammals were not easily domesticated, which meant they weren't subject to all of the diseases that Europeans dealt with by living closely to cattle, pigs and sheep. So Europeans arriving in the New World quickly spread new diseases to the Native Americans, wiping out their numbers before the fights even began.Natural selection of the human species. A history book starting approximately 13000 years ago. Put simply, it's the Book of Genesis for atheists."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"Another work of sweeping scope that seeks to understand what the factors either in human nature or environmental circumstance have led to Western European civilization's domination of the world. Diamond identifies numerous factors in the environment (access to cultivable Fertile Crescent crops, presence of animal species suitable for work, East-West continental alignment) and history of Europe that make the dominance of its civilization inevitable. Human genetic factors are also examined and proven inconsequential to the dominance of the White Caucasian. This book carefully lays out a counter-argument to any physical anthropological theories of racial superiority. At times the multitude of examples in this 450+ page tome seem redundant.

Times. The question posed by the work is one that I have wondered about on occasion but have never seen directly addressed; namely, why have different societies reached widely varying levels of comlexitiy and technolgical development? In exploring this question the author puts together a logical and compelling history of human civilizations. I was particularly interested in the theories of plant and animal domesticaiton, and of the association of human diseases and animal contact. The development of written language was also presented in a fascinating manner. I came away from the book with a sense of awe that human societies have evolved to the complexity that they have, given the difficulties in achieving even seemingly simple goals such as sustainable agriculture. It is rare to find a work as thought provoking as this. My one criticism of the book is that there were times when there was more repetition than necessary to make a point. This fact did not interfere, however, with my enjoyment of the book."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"In his attempt to explain why Europeans became dominant, Diamond asks and answers many questions along the way. He is very specific regarding comparative geography, climate, availability of domesticable plants and animals. Sometimes, in his willingness to address all questions Diamond is forced to speculate. Even then, he is logical and provides as much fact as he can to support his hypotheses.In attempting to debunk racist theories, he demonstrates how Polynesian societies became diverse because of diverse environmental factors despite physical commonalities. There were hunter gatherers and agricultural societies, conquerors and conquered.The book is scholarly, well structured, very enjoyable and readable. It progresses in such a way as to provoke questions and then goes on to answer each one. A well developed reading list at the end of the book, corresponding to each chapter ,encourages the reader to read other works.Anyone who has read &quot;Ishmael&quot; by Daniel Quinn, which is a novel that focuses on the causes and consequences of modern civilization, should read &quot;Guns Germs and Steel&quot;"},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"The problem with attributing human social development to externalities is that it glosses over the essential differences between all societies- that is how labor is socially organized and who decides how to allocate and use the social surplus. While geography tempers social development, it is the method of social production that is the overwhelming determinant of social success. Slave societies out produce hunter-gatherers. Feudal out-produces slave, and wage labor out produces slavery and feudal systems.What is more more instructive is how current social relations restrict and hamper social development by wasting social production on useless activities like military ventures and individualized social decision-making. e.g. Individuals riding in cars instead of individuals sharing mass transportation, a more socially efficient transportation system."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"In this case, Jared Diamond's only tool is a geography. That's his speciality. Therefore, he tries to argue that everything in the world can be explained with geography. If you understand geography, all else follows, so he implies.With over 1,000 reviews on this book, I'll be brief:PROS: The prose just flows. Diamond writes so well, so fluidly, it's just fun to read. The book is data rich. Most of the arguments are well researched and correct. Yes, geography was an important factor in determining the fate of the world and this book is great at showing the importance of geography.CONS: Diamond ignores the importance of economics, free trade, liberalizing thought and the economy, oppressive regimes, democracy, religion, and other important factors that were far more important than geography. From 400 AD to 1,400 AD, the Europeans made relatively little technological progress. It wasn't until they unburdened themselves from a tight dogma (i.e., the Renaissance) and opened up their economies that their technology really exploded.Diamond's argument is truly weak when he argues that Eurasia has an east-west axis and Africa/America have a north-south axis. I've walked across America four times. It's taken me years to do that. Trust me, there is plenty of east-west axis in the American continent. There was plenty of trade between Native Americans on an east-west axis. Same goes for Africa, which is HUGE on an east-west girth. Meanwhile, Eurasia has something called the Himalayas and the Ural mountains which impede its supposed east-west axis from working very well. There's a reason why it was easy for China to isolate itself for centuries from Europe. The Silk Road is one of the few easy ways to cross Eurasia, and even that isn't easy.CONCLUSION: I've read all of Diamond's book and I love them all, except this one. It's disappointing that this one is his most acclaimed one. Many won't read it with a critical eye, but many Amazon reviewers help point out the flaws. I would highly recommend reading one of his other books, like \\"The 3rd Chimpanzee\\" or \\"Collapse\\"."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"Why have some cultures developed nuclear power plants and space rockets and other cultures have stayed in the stone age?It's a big topic and Diamond makes a credible stab at it.Is the book too dense? Yes.Is the book repetitive? Yes.Would the book benefit from some editing? Yes.Is the book worth reading? Absolutely.Diamond is a geographic determinist. Successful advancement, (meaning jumbo jets versus stone axes) is controlled by the culture's environment. For example, Sub-Saharan Africa has a diverse population of large mammals, all unsuitable for domestication, such as the lion or the hippopotamus. Asia had access to many superstars of domestication, like the horse or the cow. Euro-Asia gets a developmental lead by being able to access these animals at a much earlier time than other cultures.Yes Diamond suffers from a problem of many academics; the one theory that controls the universe. Picture the history professor that bases his lecture that most of World War Two was a struggle over zinc deposits, etc. But in defense of Diamond, a lot of his theory does hold water. Anthropologists will fight over this book for years to come and just like the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, by Gibbon; this book may be discredited by future generations, but this is truly a thought provoking book. Read the book and join in the debate. You'll learn a lot. I certainly did."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"It's a great study of how geography has played a crucial role on the development of human societies. Jared Diamond provides a credible theory, pertaining to the greatness of many otherwise politically indistinct cultures and explains how their development relates to the modernized Western world. Furthermore, particularly early, it's a captivating, mind expanding read."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"Why did Spain conquer the great empires of the new world rather than the other way around? For Jared Diamond, there's no mystery, no explanations rooted in great men or in social institutions. It comes down to luck of the draw. Eurasia contained the world's greatest land mass--and its most abundant stock of domesticatable animals and plants. These animals and plants gave Eurasia an eight thousand year lead--a lead that could cope with any number of great men and social institutions.Guns, Germs, and Steel takes an intermediate position between works of physical anthropology and history. Most attempts at world history deal with the period starting with the establishment of farming in the fertile crescent and Egypt (with a chapter each on China and the new world). Diamond wonders about the period leading up to farming--and examines how the discovery of farming and animal husbandry might have spread in Eurasia (where the east-west axis allowed plants and animals to move along similar climate zones) and in Africa and the Americas where the north-south orientation slowed transmission.Diamond doesn't answer all of the questions. Why, for example, if the Polynesians could travel thousands of miles to establish colonies in Easter Island and in Hawaii, couldn't the Meso-Americans have gotten in boats and travelled to the civilization of the Andes. Surely a north-south access isn't quite sufficient to explain this lack. But overall, it's hard to argue with Diamond's thesis."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"Jarred Diamond did a good job of explaining some of the reasons why certain groups of people on Earth would have a tactical advantage in surviving and prospering over others. Although the assumptions of what is successful have a somewhat modern and Western skew, the book is well researched and includes a number of compelling arguments especially as it relates to environmental factors like agriculture and animal domestication.However, this book does not address the larger trends and longer time frames of history such as the Great Year of which Plato spoke. For example, recent archaeological finds make it increasingly clear that about 4000 to 5000 years ago when Mohenjodaro and the Indus Valley were in full bloom, the megaliths of Britain and the great pyramids in Caral, Peru and Giza were newly constructed, the ziggurats, dams and great water systems of Mesopotamia were fully functioning, and the architectural columns of Gobekli, Turkey were already 5000 years old, mankind was at a high state of civilization. Evidence shows countries traded far and wide and mankind had the technological capability to master much of his environment just as we do today. But it would not last. All of the great ancient civilizations, about which Jarred is mostly silent, went by the wayside over the next few thousand years as the Earth approached a worldwide Dark Age that was not overcome until the early renaissance period.For those interested in a larger, albeit more provocative, picture of history read Lost Star of Myth and Time. This book looks at the macro issues of man on Earth and finds a different set of circumstances is driving the trend of a civilization that was in broad decline for thousands of years before the recent upswing. Most interesting is the astronomical theory behind Lost Star that posits it is not just the geography of man on Earth that determines his success - it is the Earth's geography in space that also plays a role in human development. Specifically, as the solar system moves through space the Earth is subjected to electromagnetic waves that affect the ionosphere, magnetosphere and indirectly crops and consciousness itself.I must admit I am the author of Lost Star and doing some unabashed marketing here. Still, if you enjoy history and liked Guns, Germs and Steel, but want to view it in a larger context, I think you will love Lost Star of Myth and Time.Viva la Historia!"},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"Good overall, but I have several problems.I have seen his central points made years ago, in books such as Plagues and Peoples by William McNeill and The European Miracle by Eric Jones.

While really breaking no new ground, he at least brings ideas already known into new light to give us food for thought. Why didn't the wheel develop in the Americas as opposed to Asia and Europe? Well, they did not have a horse, or anything equal to it to haul a wheel.Those were the kind of ideas that finally got me to see the relation between animal domestication and technological development.He also analyzes the different diseases and why the Europeans had stronger immunities than the Americans. At the outset, he relates it to the different geographic environments. Europe and Eurasia have quite a different climate as opposed to the Americas.However, he also ignores other factors that play into technological and viral developments. Blatantly omitted was the step backwards taken by Europe during Medieval Times.He also forgets one reason for the European immunities was waste disposal. Europeans, being constrained by space, often located their refuse heaps too close to their major cities whereas Native Americans had some distance from those refuse areas. Also, Europe's smaller continent size had more people closer together to spread diseases. Also, during times of lose sexual morals led to the spread of sexually transmitted diseases in Europe.My final critique of Diamond's treatise is that is becomes very repititive, mostly in the different plant domestications of different cultures. What he says in 431 pages could have been said in 350.Still, despite all that, a reader will come away realizing why China, Africa, the Americas and Asia developed why they did, and connect old ideas that relate to each other."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"A tribute to fine writing and lucid argument, Jared Diamond's \\"Guns, Germs, and Steel\\" is to historical development from the scientific perspective of an evolutionary biologist what John Gribbin's work is to the lay understanding of cosmology.

The meta-history perspective of the book is refreshing. However, I can see how many historians and social scientists may have problems with Jared Diamond's approach. While Diamond accurately depicts the cogs of the mechanisms of history, he is less convincing that the big cogs will outweigh the smaller ones given enough time. History has shown that accidents and unintended consequences have changed its course many a time. Furthermore, as a small peeve, I did not like how he didn't attribute some of his most celebrated theses to its proper authors. He takes a lot of very well known geographical concepts, like the contintental axes, and fails to cite them. However, this is minor because it is supposed to be well known, at least to geographers. I could see how many people might think he thought of it himself, given that geography (not just capitals and countries, but the political, environmental, and cultural elements of human activity in spatial dimensions) is rarely taught in colleges nowadays.Overall, this is a good book, and there needs to be more books with the same ambition, but perhaps more originality."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"Mr. Diamond provides a thorough and enjoyable account of the origins of human society and the factors that determined the locations and natures of these societies.Although at points theoretical (as any work of this scope is destined to always be) I found the evidence presented both entirely compelling and interesting.

The only reason I have not given the full five stars was I would have liked to see the section on linguistics elaborated on a little more (although it is more likely than not my bias alone, being interested in the topic)."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"Hindsight, as they say, is 20/20, but in Guns, Germs and Steel, Jared Diamond makes a compelling case for why it was the Europeans who conquered the world and not the Native Americans, Africans or Australians.Diamond, in attempting to explain this fundamental question gives a broad overview of the history of human civilization, starting from our hunter-gatherer beginnings approximately 40,000 years ago. In this outline, Diamond points out certain natural advantages that Eurasia started out with, which, with the power of compounding statistics, made it a virtual certainty that Eurasians would eventually dominate the globe (baring some outside event like an asteroid collision.)Some of these are advantages one would not necessarily think of, such as the fact that the Eurasian continent has primarily an east-west axis, while in the Americas and Africa, movement of populations has to go north-south. The east-west axis means that crops domesticated in one area (the fertile crescent or China) can easily be transplanted in other areas since they have similar latitudes and climates. Therefore, food production technology can spread faster. Whereas just going 1,000 miles north or south changes the type of crops that can be domesticated and farmed, thus retarding the spread of food production.Diamond also points out that another big advantage of the Eurasians was their accidental benefit of having a large number of big mammals survive the late Pleistocene extinctions. This allowed the Eurasians to domesticate a wide range of animals. The Americas were left with one, the llama. Australia, none. Africa still contains large mammals, but all are not easily domesticated. Diamond points out that animal domestication also had an important advantage besides the obvious uses of labor, transport and food. All of our major epidemic diseases come from our domesticated animals. For example, influenza epidemics spread outward from China every year, started by people living in close proximity to pigs. As such, Eurasians developed key immunities from these diseases. But the Native Americans, Australians and Africans had very little experience with these microbes. More important to the conquest of the New World by Eurasians than guns or ships, was the presence of smallpox and other diseases that depopulated up to 90% of North America and Mesoamerica (Somewhat less catastrophically but still potent 30% in South America.)Diamond deals with very large macro-trends in history. Some people have criticized the book as not being able to explain specific historical elements, but Diamond readily acknowledges this. In Guns, Germs and Steel he is seeking to explain why it was virtually certain Eurasians would displace other peoples and cultures over the long term.As he notes, this type of macro-history could tell you why Eurasians would populate North America and not vice-versa, but it can't give you insight into why Kennedy won the 1960 Presidential election.Diamond has been accused of determinism (I am unsure why this is a dirty word.) But Guns, Germs and Steel is an important book because it can, I feel, compellingly demonstrate that history is not random. There are larger trends that lend a certain directionality to history. That directionality may arise from advantages/disadvantages randomly assigned, but once the machinery is in place, the power of probability takes over. In short, it was extremely likely, given the basic factors that Diamond lists, that Eurasians would dominate the rest of the planet. Another outcome, while possible, was extremely unlikely.Of real interest, and one deserving of book length treatment, is why did the Western Europeans, of the various Eurasian peoples (specifically fertile crescent peoples and the Chinese), come to be the ones who dominated the world? Although only touched on in the epilogue, Diamond posits that the answer for the fertile crescent peoples is obvious, the natural resources of the area were severely strained by the civilizations in the area. The fertile crescent went from being a net food exporter to and importer and populations fell. The question of the Chinese is harder, but Diamond's theory is compelling.China, even until 500 years ago was by far the technological superior of Western Europe, but their problem is that they were too unified. Essentially, Diamond postulates that China's centralization...cultural and technological progress. A prime example was the Chinese abandonment of oceangoing sailing ships in the 1500's. Although China's seafaring technology was quite advanced, a change in politics in the Chinese court led to a ban on overseas trade. Riding on a multi-masted ship could merit the death sentence by 1525.This could never have happened in Western Europe where the political culture was highly fragmented. If one nation renounced oceangoing ships, others would continue - and reap the rewards for their initiative, thus putting pressure on the original country to change its policies. When there is fragmentation and competition, selection pressure forces recalcitrant actors to adopt new ways and innovate themselves - or go extinct.Competition breeds strength.All in all Guns, Germs and Steel is a compelling work detailing exactly why things have turned out the way they have in terms of global cultures. Even if one is not interested in it for its political aspects, it is a fascinating overview of the last 40,000 of human history and will tell you interesting tidbits like how plants came to be domesticated."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"I love books like this - that get you looking at things from a perspective that is totally new.So why did you not have Africans, mounted on zebras or rhinos, colonising Europe?How was it that the Incas did not occupy Seville?

Is it correct? Who knows? It's a theory, and an elegant one.Basically, the book boils down into that old anxiom about the monkeys at typewriters, that if you get enough of them together for enough time, one of them will type the complete works of Shakespeare.You'll hear people claiming the book is \\"political\\" or \\"flawed.\\" And it is, to some extent. But Diamond effectively backs up his major points with convincing data, enough to force us to consider his points.However, some critics go so far as to claim that Diamond doesn't consider culture or politics as factors in technological advancement. This is patently untrue. Diamond stresses the cultural and political factors in population advancement. Those populations with more resources, larger numbers, and more time had the ability to develop sophisticated cultures capable of supporting inventors, artists, and politicians capable of making great changes.Other critics cite biological differences in humans, saying that Diamond purposefully ignores these differences. This might be true, but not important. After all, if all humans evolved from a common set of ancestors, how could biological differences evolve apart from environment? Again, place and time trumps.Naturally, the book's loudest opponents are those who feel threatened on a personal level by Diamond's thesis. Those who want to cherish the accomplishements of their ancestors. Those who feel that political systems are the result of the character of the people ..... Those who feel comforted by the color of their skin."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"The basic premise of this book is that the global dominance of Western societies can be traced to geographic advantages at its roots, rather than to biological or social superiority. Jared Diamond presents a well documented, coherent case that Western civilization was predisposed to success by an abundance of food crops, domesticatable animals, and a geography that facilitated migration of these skills and people. He presents those points well, and if you have not encountered discussion of the effect of geography and natural biology on the growth and development of civilizations, this book will present the basic ideas to you in a clear, if a bit rambling, style.Unfortunately, the author overplays his hand in several ways. This book explicitly aims to repudiate western civilization's claim to superiority. Much of the discussion is subordinated to this political aim, and as a result turns into a polemic against cultural arrogance, rather than attempting a balanced discussion of possible and likely effects. In the service of equalizing moral stature among all civilizations, we are told that western domination is only the result of incidental geographic circumstances. Western civilization is winning because the deck was stacked in its favor from the start, the author argues cogently - and therefore any superiority of its cultural institutions and traditions is only a &quot;proximate cause&quot; of success, and thus to be disregarded as secondary and unimportant. That last jump does not compute.Still, this is a good book, and an enjoyable read. Jared Diamond may be ignoring half of the story of civilization - cultural institutions, religion, the role of doctrine and tradition - but he presents his half well, if a bit over-zealously. Try to take the facts without the political payload, and you will benefit as well enjoy yourself."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"Like the book but the kindle edition has no illustrations, maps and very crudely formatted tables.

The author's premise is that there are specific geographic, animal and plant reasons why some countries and contents were able to flourish. Simple things such as whether or not certain continents had animals that could be domesticated. His theories made sense and accounted for why Europe and Asia where able to become so advanced and other continents were not as successful. I have recommended this to a number of friends and they almost all rave about this book and its content."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"In &quot;Guns, Germ and Steel&quot;, Jared Diamond presents the rather simple thesis that the rise of complex societies has been influenced primarily be geography. I say &quot;rather simple&quot;, because the author goes to great lengths to prove it. There is actually nothing simple about his argument, as geography encompasses climate, suitability for agriculture, native fauna, natural resources, etc. Furthermore, he needs to revise his argument for North and South America, Australia, Africa and much of Asia, to account for different variables in each locale.Finally, after laying out and backing up his thesis, he applies it to a walk through of modern history, and identifies why Europeans were so successful in dominating the rest of the globe. He is no apologist for brutality and slavery, but he correctly points out that the diseases the Europeans brought with them were the overwhelming cause of death and defeat for indigenous cultures around the world. In turn, these diseases were the result of the urban lifestyle Europeans had. A lifestyle supported by easily farmed grains and domesticated animals.Of course, it's all much more complicated than that, and Diamond does a superb job of walking the reader through his thesis in well written, easy to digest chapters. A background in evolution, biology or sociology will certainly enhance the readers understanding/enjoyment but it is by no means necessary. My only complaint about this work is that Diamond tends to belabor points long after his case is made. A zeal for thoroughness, however, is a small complaint about an otherwise excellent work."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"Having read the book and approximately 100 of the reviews, I have decided to give this book 3 stars. That conclusion is based on the fact that much of material is either new to me or is something that I had never sat down and thought about. I found the book interesting, provocative, and, ultimately, unsatisfying.In covering thousands of years of history over many continents, Diamond, by necessity, deals in sweeping statements and (over) generalizations. Because specific statement and arguments are not referenced (there is only a section on &quot;Further Readings&quot; in the back of the book), the reader not intimately familiar with the book's wide-ranging material must rely on Diamond's abilities to analyze and reason in a unbiased manner.It is immediately apparent on picking up the book that Diamond's reason for writing it is to refute any notions that Western civilization is superior because of the people involved. Instead, he argues that Western civilization is a fluke of nature, and that it is only luck that prevented Europe from being colonized by Third World peoples. I have no problem with Politically Correct thinking as long as it is factually correct. However, Diamond, very early in this book, gave me reason to doubt his abilities to analyze and reason carefully.The best example of the above is his discussion (on page 20 and 21) as to why he thinks that native New Guineans are more intelligent than Europeans. He offers no evidence except the observation that New Guineans have an obvious advantage over him when he is trying to find his way in the jungles. This is really not so surprising: one would expect people who have lived in an environment all of their lives to have mastered it. A truer test of intelligence would be how quickly someone can master a new environment. His argument is really no different than saying that Bostonians are more intelligent than Midwesterners because the Midwesterner finds the street layout of Boston to be confusing and ends up getting lost (an experience I recently had).The arguments proposed by Diamond as to why New Guineans are more intelligent than Europeans are even weaker. One argument is that constant tribal warfare selects more intelligent people. A moment's thought raises major questions about that line of reasoning: Why does warfare with primitive weapons select for intelligence instead of for size, brute strength, aggressiveness, or quickness? If there were constant innovation in weapons and fighting tactics, that would be a method by which intelligence would be selected by constant warfare by giving a survival advantage to intelligent warriors, but no evidence was presented to support that notion.The second reason is even weaker: New Guineans are more intelligent because they don't watch TV! The research on childhood intellectual development and TV viewing that I have seen is inconclusive, and Diamond does not quote any research to support his claim. Perhaps his claim is true, but, if so, it clearly leads to a conclusion that Diamond does not anticipate and that he would clearly object to. If TV watching leads to lower intelligence and functions as do most environment factors, then more TV watching would lead to lower intelligence than would low or medium TV watching. In other words, it would not be an all-or-none phenomenon. However, Diamond does not address the fact that, in several surveys, African-Americans have been found to watch considerably more TV per day than do other ethnic groups. By Diamond's reasoning, African-Americans are therefore less intelligent than are members of other ethnic groups, including New Guineans. He would be clearly appalled by this conclusion, yet it follows naturally from his previously stated line of reasoning.My question then is whether the reader can trust Diamond to analyze and reason carefully and take his line of inquiry wherever it leads, however unpopular and politically incorrect that may be. Based on the above example, I think the answer is no, that he will not venture into areas and explore other than a strictly environmentally deterministic approach. That is why I find this book interesting, but incomplete and, ultimately, unsatisfying. He simply leaves too many questions unaddressed.Many general reviewers are greatly enamored with this book, but I would have liked to have read more reviews by professional historians, cultural anthropologists, and archaeologists."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"In his book 'Guns, Germs and Steel' Jared Diamond offers a 'geographic determinist' view of world history with the specific intent of repudiating any notion that 'race' might be a factor in the development of advanced civilizations. He argues that the descendants of Europeans and Asians now dominate the earth economically, politically and technologically because of favorable geographic and environmental conditions that existed over 10,000 years ago in Europe and Asia, as opposed to Africa, Australia and the Americas. In his quest to discover the 'ultimate' causes of the current alignment of world power (e.g., why did Europeans settle the Americas and not vice-versa; why did Europeans and Asians advance technologically and not the Africans or Native Americans)Diamond posits that it can all be explained by the fact that Europe and Asia had the benefits of lands that could grow abundant crops and large animals that could be domesticated, whereas other areas of the earth did not have these benefits. Accordingly, these 'Eurasians' had a head start on producing crops that could feed large numbers of people, which then gave way to new technologies (guns and steel) which, along with germs that were deadly to Native Americans, allowed the 'Eurasians' to dominate the rest of the earth's inhabitants.I found the following problems with this book:Diamond presents an interesting and reasonable argument, but much of it seems to be theoretical. Despite the fact that he is making many educated guesses to substantiate his theories, he routinely seeks to give his statements the cover of authority by prefacing his views with words like 'undoubtedly', 'surely' or 'must have'. Watch out for those.Diamond ruins his intriguing theory by his political correctness. He dismisses biological theories about why some civilizations are more advanced than others, but he doesn't tell us why they should be dismissed. It sometimes seems as though he had a conclusion and then went in search of 'facts' to support that conclusion.Some of Diamond's agruments are too convenient. For example, he argues that China's geography and environment were just right for allowing its advanced civilization to develop, but later argues that China's failure to explore and settle other parts of the world was also due to its geography and environment. Is he forcing history into his theory?He says there is no evidence that any race of people is smarter than another, and then tells us that the people of New Guinea are actually more intelligent than Westerners. Where did that come from?Diamond fails to address the 'ultimate' cause of why, at the dawn of civilization, certain peoples were living in geographical areas favorable for the development of civilization, and others were not. Was it not a process of the smarter/stronger people forcing out/keeping out the less intelligent/weaker people? And, since this would have occurred before the development of agriculture, animal domestication or technology that would give the local inhabitants an advantage over others, to what do we attribute the ability of a people to inhabit and protect a fertile living area suitable for the development of a civilization, while others were forced to live in marginal areas?Diamond shows his PC throughout his book by putting words like 'discovered', 'explorer' and 'civilization' in quotes whenever writing about Westerners. He also routinely refers to the process of whites settling the New World as involving 'killing' or 'murdering' the natives, but similar settling processes by third world peoples are simply a 'displacing' or 'engulfing' of the natives.Diamond asserts that all religions developed as a means for the elite to gain power and control the people...no mention of the possibility of a sincere desire to insitute morality, or, heaven forbid, that anyone actually believed in their religion...Most troubling is Diamond's almost total exclusion of the human element from his theory of history. Like a good scientist (Diamond's specialty is bird evolution) he seeks to reduce all history down to an equation without the human variable to distort the process. Diamond doesn't get around to mentioning the possible human variables until page 417 of his 425 page book. In Diamond's view, humans are slightly more than automatons; one individual or group is interchangeable with any other; if all groups of people had been switched around so that 10,000 years ago they all lived on different continents, the world would be exactly the same today, except that the people we know as Africans and Native Americans would dominate the world.The general theory about the strong influence of geography and the environment on the development of civilizations has long been accepted. What is not accepted is the notion that geography and the environment are the primary determinants of human progress. As Will Durant wrote in 'The Lessons of History', after noting the importance of geography in history: 'The character and contour of a terrain may offer opportunities for agriculture, mining, or trade, but only the imagination and initiative of leaders, and the hardy industry of followers, can transform the possibilities into fact; and only a similar combination (as in Israel today) can make a culture take form over a thousand natural obstacles. Man, not the earth makes civilization.'I give this book a partial recommendation; the theory about the impact of geography and the environment on the development of civilizations has validity, but not nearly to the degree asserted by Diamond. Diamond's eagerness to prove his thesis caused him to ignore some important questions and facts and also caused him to make too many unwarranted assumptions."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies by Jared Diamond is a superb attempt to explain the fortunes of human history. His central thesis is that the current Western-European domination of the world is not a product of superior intelligence, but of an accident of geography. Namely the Europeans were the beneficiaries of superior access to wild plants that could be utilized for food production, wild animals that could be domesticated and the absence of physical barriers permitted the transfer of technology and plants and animals from the \\"Fertile Crescent,\\" where farming was founded, to Europe.The end result was that Europeans developed agricultural societies quicker than Mesoamericans, Africans and other societies. This led to larger, more dense societies with written languages, an increased resistence to germs, technological innovations and access to large beasts of burden that could be used for farming and warfare. When the Spanish met the Incas the above advantages allowed less than 200 Spaniards to subdue an immense Inca Army.Diamond's theory is more than plausible and well argued. Especially important is the effect of germs on the outcome of the confrontation as well as the latter ones between Europeans and most other of the worlds cultures. At times germs, such as smallpox, effectively wiped out whole civilizations without the necessity of a single military confrontation. The demise of the developed Native American civilizations in the Mississippi valley is a prime example.Contrary to other reviews, Diamond does not seek to use geographic determinism as an explanation for every cultural development. As an example he readily admits that there are other important factors when considering a confrontation of two cultures with similar geographic advantages. His explanation of why Europeans and not the Chinese colonized North America is an example. His subscribes the failure of Chinese to complete the task not to food production, germs, or the lack of available technology, but to the 15th Century political process that China operated under. The European system encouraged innovation as a result of numerous power centers where ideas that one center dismissed could be accepted by others. Columbus' rejection by numerous parties before the Spanish agreed to finance his expedition is the classic example. On the other hand, China had centralized political system so when a decision was made to stop exploration and destroy the navy there was no other place to go.The book is well written and while repetitious at times it is an easy read.

Coon wrote, &quot;Caucasoids and Mongoloids who live in their homelands and in recently colonized regions, such as North America, did not rise to their present population levels and positions of cultural dominance by accident. They achieved this because their ancestors occupied the most favorable of the earths zoological regions, in which other kinds of animals also attained dominance during the Pleistocene. These regions had challenging climates and ample breeding grounds and were centrally located within continental land masses. There general adaptation was more important than special adaptation. Any other subspecies that had evolved in these regions would probably have been just as successful.&quot;"},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"I enjoyed this book from beginning to end. I do agree with some of the previous reviews about the author repeating some ideas to many times. Also, would the statement about New Guineans being on the average more intelligent than Europeans qualify as a racist remark? On a more serious note, several other reviewers compare the book with Landes' Wealth &amp; Poverty of Nations \`. I think both books complement each other well. The geographical and ecological factors that Diamond weaves so well to support his ideas began mattering less and less as mankind's technological capabilities grew. Then a paradigm shift took place and the factors discussed in the Landes ( culture, government, policy, etc.) book began determining success. In my view Diamond explains human history from BC 12000 to AD 1300-1400, Landes after this date. This would explain why different European countries of similar backgrounds fared so differently after 1500 AD. Now that everyone seems to be converging on market oriented and efficiency driven societies any ideas anyone on what the next paradigm shift will be? Although I recommend it the Landes book also has several annoying things but that is another story."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"Besides putting forth a compelling thesis (as to the origins of the world's haves and have-nots), Diamond's book is full of interesting facts from a variety of academic fields. (Every night in bed I'd say, &quot;Hey, Ellen, listen to this...&quot; and share some obscure but fascinating tidbit from zoology, epidemiology, linguistics, geography, paleontology, etc.) Diamond's treatment is admittedly broad-brush, but highly insightful nonetheless.

Basically Diamond argues eloquently that geography and luck of the draw food resources and animals explain much of the winners success in history. His is a well formed, well researched argument. However, I believe that he turns a blind eye to the major effects ( good and bad ) that different religions and cultures have had on the success of their people. His request for further study by Historians using more scientific means is welcomed . Perhaps someone's PHD thesis could use historical information to compare transplanted religions and cultures into dominant and non dominate societies and analyze the results. My guess is that cultural bias and religions had as much to do with history as did geography and food supply.

His answer, in short, is geography. Well, maybe. He does admit that geography shapes culture, but culture also makes a huge difference in what people *do* with geography's endowments. For my money, which I spent, David Landes' &quot;The Wealth and Poverty of Nations&quot; is a better take on the same question. Landes focuses on culture; he admits that geography plays a role (he's not as monocausal as Diamond) but emphasizes cultural traits over geography because, well, they matter more. Best statistic: the GDP of the 30 million overseas chinese exceeds that of the entire People's Republic of China. Why? The overseas chinese -- who thrive everywhere -- have a culture of thrift and hard work. The PRC Chinese have a culture of sucking up to the authorites.

It is disconcerting to read, \\"...as can be seen in Figure 2.1...\\" but have no such figure. It is inexcusable to charge this much for an e-book and not include the material from the print version. I didn't get this for free, I paid for it. The phrase, \\"Some images from the print edition are not available in the Kindle edition due to rights issues,\\" is not sufficient to let the buyer know that it contains NONE of the images, and it should be displayed more prominently.

The essential thesis is that those civilizations who first domesticated plants and animals got a jump on developing technology and immunity to deadly germs. This gave them an enormous advantage which resulted in the propogation of their way of life and dominance over other less technologically developed cultures.Diamond backs up his thesis with observation and an excellent understanding of a variety of disciplines including: history, anthropology, medicine, sociology, biology, evolutionary biology etc etc...This is the type of book that raises the conscientiousness of the reader but it is not without its problems.Many of the observations in the book are intelligent and logical, however much of what he purports is highly subjective, not testable and are examples of logical fallacies. Therefore the book amounts to a number of untestable hypothesis and is highly subjective. This does not stop the book from being wildly entertaining.2 of the logical fallacies consistently made are ad hoc (after-the-fact-explanations) and false cause fallacies. In other words if event A follows event B then A must cause B or A could cause B. To the authors credit he does reference this in the epilogue by stating that it isn't like other sciences where one can perform experiments.Either way this is an excellent book with interesting theories which makes an excellent topic of conversation.

The reason that Eurasia and North Africa evolved more highly developed (technologically anyway) cultures was that there was a wider variety of wild plant and animal species that could be tamed by the humans living in those areas following the Ice Age than there was available to humans in other parts of the world. This enabled people in these areas to develope farming societies (which required more specializations than hunter gatherer societies) more quickly than in other parts of the globe.The close proximity of animals in this farming societies passed on germs from animal hosts to humans and evolved human resistance to pathogens such as smallpox to survivors of the diseases and their offspring. Those areas such as the Americas without large domesticated animals to catch diseases from were decimated by Old World diseases when they were introduced by European Explorers.The premise of the book could have degenerated into White Supremacist or Multi-Cultural nonsense and the fact that it doesn't says a lot about the writing skills of the author. One fact that he doesn't address is how the freedom of expression is a key factor in the development of societies. When that Freedom disappears or is suppressed as in the case of 15 C China or 18 C Holland society tends to stagnant and decline.I would reccomend the book for those interested in History, Anthropology, or Sociology."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"Guns, Germs, and Steel was a fascintaing investigation into the reasons for civilizations' sucess that does its best to avoid raising racial hackles.

Environmental harm, climate alteration, fast population growth, and imprudent political choices were all factors in the ruin of some societies, but other societies found solutions and are surviving. Similar troubles face us today and have already brought calamity to Rwanda and Haiti, even as China and Australia are trying to muddle through in ground-breaking ways.

It is a better read than the majority of Campbell's texts, which reference scientific details but are primarily more abstractly drawn. The scientific information in this generous volume is explained within context that is specific and sequenced such that the theoretical positions are also convincing and easily retained. Jared Diamond is a life and earth science Everyman. His credentials, (Professor of Physiology at Berkley's Medical School), world-reknowned bird expert, field researcher for 30 years in Tasmania, and popular author, have been sufficiently lauded in reviews so I don't need to repeat them here. I have seen this book cited on several Listmania favorites and I agree that it is a worthwhile and unique work. In addition to being remarkably interesting and filled with astonishing bits of information- (for those of us lay readers at least) it is clearly a work of love. The forces that have impacted on the development of civilizations, we learn, are functions of geographic variables, not human ones. By carefully evaluating such variables as the availability of hoofed animals that could be trained, (the zebra, infamously, never being one,) as the pre-existing phenomenon for the 'inspired' concept of the wheel- from which major societal advancements have been generated. Why, in a highly structured South American civilzation, had there been no similar 'invention?' Dr. Diamond draws us to the lack of pack animals suitable for carrying loads or providing transportation. The llama's are hoofed beasts but their very narrow ankles and small hoofs make their service to humans nothing like the Arabian horses that spread through Spain and other parts of Europe. It is by this process of establishing the geographical resources related to planting, animal domestication, travel etc. that one understands why in some areas the people are still primitive and others at a level of such high technical advancement. Diamond has joined many aspects of science to argue against racial determinist theories that are still very much the means by which people explain the disparate conditions of the world. I found the scientific information extremely interesting and the larger concept both persuasive and valuable. Some reviewers, have argued that these facts are already well known and objected then, to the very style I praised above. However I am fairly well-read but- Who knew that infectious diseases like smallpox etc, (and, AIDS, I might add,) were specific to animals and transmitted to man only after the practice of animal husbandry? I would have never guessed that I can tell you! And as Europeans developed resistance to these plagues and outbreaks, the indigenous populations of the newly discovered lands had not. The horrific result was that entire populations were decimated. ... But we must not overlook the provocative challenge to Eurocentric explanations that continue to prevail. Diamond treds onto the sacred ground of racial determinism that despite its denial and politically incorrect condition remains the only answer for many otherwise silent believers. ...If you read this book, you may learn something about yourself as you confront centuries of racial explanations for western scientific method, aka wealth. And if there were not that tease, I'd advise you to read it anyway if you are, as I admitedly am, an interested observer with access to this most compelling point of view."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"In his brilliant analysis of why European societies and culture were and are dominating the rest of the world, Jared Diamond takes into account numerous empirical evidence through the multi-disciplinary fields of anthropology, biology, etymology, sociology, chemistry, evolutionary psychology and others, to find some concrete answers beyond the rubbish of accounting all of Europe's superiority of recent years to genetic IQ and skin color.Starting with carbon dated evidence and historical tracings of domesticable plants and foods, Diamond lays out the factors necessary for a large, sedentary population to develop that supports skilled professions through the storage of surplus foods and the appropriate governance necessary for advances through rules established by a legitimate leader. Linked very closely with religion/spiritualness, these rulers certainly added their own unique take and skills to environmental scenarious, but they got to were they are due to the fortunate circumstances of their initial environments.Outlining the necessary transformation and characteristics necessary for a transformation from wild to domesticated plant and animal species and hence the spread of knowledge due to increased competition, trade, and travel aided by the predominant east-west axiz of temperate climate and similar environments that spread from China to Portugal through Eurasia.Unfortunately (fortunately if your on the lucky side), things didn't pan out similarly and fall into place so that advanced civilization could be created over a vast and spreading area over other parts of the globe. This didn't occur because of something lacking in the inventiveness, drive, ambition, and ingenuity of homo sapiens from different parts of the globe, but from a lack of adequate environmental, climatological, and biological resources available.This book is a bit tedious at times, because it applied it's methodology to other parts of the globe, which is both repetative and necessary to establish consistency, but it still gives you a unique and new perspective on viewing the long-term history of the world and the future evolution of it.Undoubtedly, humans become specialized in special skills from different parts of the globe and what Diamnond doesn't do is go to the next step of establishing whether genetic differences could have and are still occuring and evolving due to the different environmental schema of people's surroundings. Despite this he combines his examples from real-life findings brilliantly to compose a well-established text for future pondering generations wondering why exactly the engagements of cultures led to a European domination of them circa 1500-2000."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"This Pulitzer-Prize-winning work disproves racist theories of human-evolution.

It was obvious to me that he was writing to a general audience, not to people with serious scientific backgrounds. I would be bored by a general text on my specialty, but I wouldn't criticize someone who chose to write such a book. Yes, he can drive a point home too comprehensively. I've read many other non-fiction books, however, in which the author seems to have absolutely no idea how to string the narrative together, so I'm not going to criticize someone who can actually organize his thoughts. (Try reading the Florence Harding biography if you want to experience some horrible writing.)

Basically, it's a world history -- but it would probably be more illuminating to say it's a history of prehistory. It tracks what we tend to know about time periods that precede what we normally learn as \\"history\\" in order to try to build an answer to the book's central question: why did western Europeans sail across the ocean and conquer/exterminate Native Americans, rather than Native Americans sailing over to Europe and conquering it? Obviously, because the Europeans had better technology, but why?When I've seen commentary about this book, I've seen much of it praise Diamond as giving a \\"non-racist\\" account of history -- because Diamond's answer to this question is not \\"because Europeans are more intelligent.\\" It is, roughly: \\"Eurasia is a larger land mass, oriented on an east-west axis (cf. Africa, America) and because it contains more plants with large seeds suitable for domestication, and fewer geographical barriers than Africa/America (e.g., deserts), and because most of the large animals in Africa can't be domesticated and most of those in America became extinct (due to hunting?) about 13,000 years ago.\\"Diamond makes some weak comments about race (to paraphrase one: \\"the average New Guinean I've met seems to me smarter than the average Westerner\\") but really the book isn't about race at all. It's about the factors that led to the world we know, in terms of the distribution of power, but also the processes that led up to \\"history\\" (why was writing developed? what motivated people to grow food rather than continue to hunt and gather? why did European diseases -- the \\"germs\\" in guns, germs, and steel -- overwhelm Native Americans; why weren't there Native American pathogens that infected and exterminated Europeans attempting to settle?).I had no idea how much was known about all this stuff, and it's certainly never been explained to me in any way that I could assimilate it. Diamond did that for me."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"THE BIG QUESTION [Jameson Thottam]OK let's get philosophical shall we? Why are we here? Is there life after death? How did it all begin? These can be described as the A-list questions for humanity since we developed enough intelligence to stop sitting around picking fleas off each and think about such things. A slightly less fundamental question (a B-list question!) but one which probably has much more bearing on our everyday lives and our interaction with other people from different cultures, is \`How did we get from clever apes to where we are today?' And as a follow up- \`Why did a one section of humanity manage to impose itself over the rest?'This is what Jared Diamond attempts to answer in this fascinating book. On the front of my edition it states that this is \`A Short History Of Everybody For The Last 13,000 years' and this is exactly right.HOW DID WE GET HERE? [Jameson L Thottam]Diamond starts by looking at the modern world and asking how is it that Eurasian civilization came to dominate the native American, African or Polynesian civilizations sometimes as in the case of the Spanish in central and south America defying all the odds. In order to answer this we have to look at the possibility that Eurasian peoples themselves are in some way superior to other \`racial' denominations around the world. This argument would state that Eurasians are cleverer, more ingenious more inventive and have the potential to be better organised that other inferior \`races' in the world. This is a very dangerous argument to accept, as it would justify racism, and persecution of less developed societies. In fact this is exactly what happened when European explorers and settlers came face to face with the native populations and the Americas and Africa, leading to violent subjugation and slavery.Diamond quickly and rightly dismisses this false premise and argues that in many cases once native populations have been introduced to new technologies they have been better at exploiting and developing these than the Eurasian originators. Once we have dismissed the idea that there is fundamental difference in the inherent abilities of different racial groups we are still left with the question why is that the Eurasian people developed in to the most advanced technological society in human history while some human populations were still living a stone age existence.Diamond begins to answer this question by taking us back 13,000 years, a point in human development were there were no clear cut differences in different peoples around the world. From this starting point he looks at the four main reasons why this subsequent uneven development took place.HUNTERS AGAINST FARMERS [Jameson Thottam]It is evident from looking at history that there seems to have been a steady developmental progression from nomadic hunter-gatherers to settled communities based on stable food production. Indeed it is safe to say that there as never been an advanced complex civilisation that has sustained itself by the hunter gathering lifestyle.It would seem to be a natural development for all ancient societies to have developed in this way and yet we find that early people in Mesopotamia developed farming thousands of years before peoples in the Americas and in some parts of the world hunter-gatherer groups still survive. Diamond goes on to make the point that in order for hunters to become farmers they need to be able to domesticate crops and animals for food production. Geographical difference climatic differences and the very orientation of the Eurasian continent on a east west axis as opposed to a north south axis of the Americas and Africa all conspire to make these development considerably easier in Eurasia. These factors coupled with a natural abundance of plant and animals species that easily lend themselves to domestication provide Eurasia with a massive advantage. By contrast Africa, America and Australasia have few if any suitable plant or animal candidates for domestication.BIGGER IS BETTER [James Thottam]Diamond argues that as a consequence of stable food production primitive societies were able to increase their populations and settle in bigger permanent communities. These early settlements quickly developed into larges towns and cities. A further consequence of larger communities and stable food production was the greater possibility of certain individuals to concentrate on specialist tasks rather than simply on food production. This gave rise to technological advancement. As the lager population units expanded and came across others such as themselves trade became necessary.The increase in population also made society more potentially violent which then necessitated the imposition of rules or laws leading to a elite growing up to enforce those laws. This increase in complexity also made the societies better able to wage war and gather resources.GERMS [Jameson Thottam]Despite Europe's early advantage over other peoples in other continents we should not imagine that the first European explorer to reach America post 1492 and sub-Saharan Africa a few hundred years later entered sparsely populated continents with only stone age hunter gatherer to oppose them. This is far from the truth; both in America and Western Africa powerful well organised civilisations had developed numbering in the tens of millions. Technologically they might not have been quite as advanced but technology itself cannot explain how for instance a handful of Conquistadors could within a matter of a few years subjugate a powerful warlike empire such as the Incas and Aztecs. An explanation as to how this could have happened can be gained by considering the role of germs and disease.The development of cities and the proximity with which people were living with each other and their farms animals proved to be the perfect breeding ground for new nasty diseases that could never have arisen while a hunter-gatherer lifestyle was followed. Gradually the Eurasian population developed limited resistance to various killers such as smallpox and influenza, unfortunately when contaminated explorers came across the pristine populations in the Americas the natives had no protection and one of the biggest tragedies in human history took place with millions dying from the effects of European diseases.TECHNOLOGY AND RESOURCES [Jameson Thottam]One final aspect is to consider the circumstances in which technology developed at such pace in Europe. Diamond quite rightly points out that the early technological advancements did not actually take place in Europe but in Asia. These advances quickly spread again due to many optimal conditions both geographical and cultural that existed. Differences in cultures and their ability to accept change did also have a part to play but this was not an overwhelming factor. In many cases due to the landscape or climate technological advances were not needed or sought for and in many cases the raw materials were not there to begin with.OVERALL [Jameson Thottam]I found this book compelling both in it's arguments, which are both authoritatively and eloquently made by Diamond but also by his writing style which is very easy to follow and at no time make this vast subject overbearing.Obviously generalisation have to be made, exceptions to the rules are mentioned and lack of reliable data especially when it comes to the dating of early discoveries and civilisation, are not forgotten but at no time while reading the book did I feel that the author was stretching the evidence merely to back his own theory.About the Author [James Thottam]Diamond is an anthropologist who has worked for many years in the treacherous areas of New Guinea and he often uses his experiences there to justify or better explain a point. However in writing this book he show an incredible understanding of many other scientific discipline from geology to medicine and he backs this up with a insightful view of history.The Research [Jameson Thottam]The research carried out for this book must have been extensive to say the least. He uses some incredible examples from the historical records to add weight to his central premise; his style is so persuasive that you find yourself wandering why you had never thought of it in these terms before. It is the sign of a very talented writer (often lacking in a scientist) that such complicated and disparate scientific disciplines can be made to seem easy to grasp and logical to understand. It doesn't surprise me in the least that this book won the 1998 Pulitzer Prize for general non-fiction and the 1998 Rhone-Poulenc Science Book Prize.The Audience [Jameson Thottam]Who should read this book? Anyone interested in history, biology, anthropology or almost any other \`ology' you care to mention. It is a very readable book and provided you have any interest in any of the subject covered you will be fascinated by it.In the end I'm not sure if he has answered the original question completely to my satisfaction but that would be a lot to ask, but importantly he never claims that what he is saying is the only interpretation of the facts just a reasonably good theory. I would say that his arguments are compelling and that he as done as much as anyone in the field of science to produce a unified explanation as to why we are the way we are today.The overall message of the book is that the course of history is far more complex than the history books would lead us to believe. The activities of men and women play only a limited part in explaining why history has been shaped the way it has. Human history is just as much depended on chance events, evolutionary biology, and climactic change as it is on human action. In the long term this realisation might act to make us more humble and give more consideration to our own minor place in the larger scheme of things.This book is a brilliant piece of popular science and should be read by anyone who has ever considered his her place in the modern world. You will not be overawed and you might actually end up a little wiser.Jameson Thottam"},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"Not a page turner, but one of the most compelling books you'll ever read. It's worth the work. If you think you understand the world but have not read this book, you may well have overestimated your grasp of human society. This book is well-argued and brilliant."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"Jared Diamond takes on a daring question in his attempt to form a more inclusive view of human history, \\"how did things get this way?\\". Most human histories focus on major civilizations, and only hit on other cultures when more advanced civilizations come into contact with them. Diamond takes the perspective of talking about what is going on all around the world at the same time, and what happened to make cultures' interactions with the West result in them becoming trading partners, slaves, conquered, subjugated, or just plain eliminated.The three main factors Diamond uses to explain this are, as the title suggests, guns, germs, and steel, or variations thereof.The \\"theory\\" of European genetic superiority has often been used to explain the reasons that Europe became the dominant world culture in the modern world. Diamond steps back and looks at geographical factors as being more causal. For example, the Aboriginals probably were among the first to develop advanced watercraft, as evidenced by their very presence in Australia, but they didn't rule an empire by ruling the seas like the British did. One reason given is that they went to Australia too early. When they got to Australia, they were capable hunters, but had yet to domesticate animals and adopt it as a lifestyle. Australia at the time was full of large mammal and birds ripe for domestication. If these animals had been turned into livestock, the Aboriginals would had controlled a huge source of food, and been able to support a much larger population, that could have supported a large industrial base. Instead, the Aboriginals were adept hunters, and the large mammals and birds that had evolved isolated from such skilled predators proved to be easy prey and were soon extinct.The Africans evolved alongside their animals, and hence the animals were prepared for adept hunters and more wary of humans, making them very difficult to domesticate. The Europeans, however, had the right animals living in the areas they moved into, and they moved to those areas when they were on the cusp of transitioning from hunter-gatherers to farmer-herders. This precise mix of right animals, right climate, and right time, gave the Europeans one key to control food production.Another key Diamond mentions is the fact that that Eurasian landmass's major axis is east-west, as opposed to Africa's and the Americas' landmasses being oriented north-south. With an east-west landmass, domesticated plants and animals are easily transported from one region to another, since the climatic variances aren't as great as they are from north to south. This also allowed plants and animals, once domesticated, to quickly become staple foods throughout these areas.With food production controlled and done so at much higher levels than anywhere else, greater population densities are possible. These greater population densities allow multiple cultures living in close proximity. With multiple cultures in close proximity and competition, technological innovations are much more likely to be exploited. The Chinese invented gunpowder, but they didn't use it to unify an empire like Europeans did. The Japanese made wonderful firearms in the 1600's (probably superior to Europeans since they applied Japanese efficiency and methodical craftsmanship to their construction), but they soon outlawed they as being inconsistent with Samurai culture. If the Chinese and the Japanese had the Germans, French, and Portuguese all nipping at their heels, it is doubtful that they would have walked away from such innovations.Another thing that controlling livestock brings is disease. Many major epidemics start off as animal-borne variants since the Europeans lived with and handled animals for so long, they contracted many more diseases and built tolerances to them. Larger population densities also amplify this factor, considering the lack of civil sanitation at the time. In addition to being unprepared for European guns, other cultures were also unprepared for European germs.Diaomnd makes some great points throughout this very thorough work, but the one that I found both compelling and disturbing is his refutation of the theory of European genetic superiority. Essentially, he says that since the Europeans had centralized food production and later centralized medicine, that anyone could survive and reproduce in Western society. In tribal societies where such things were not centralized, an individual's wits and intelligence were the keys to that individual finding food and surviving, and his health and constitution were his keys to surviving disease. The strong and the smart survived in tribal societies, but the weak and dumb could live in Western society, ending in genetic inferiority, not superiority.Our current civilization would do well to take a cue from the Aboriginals who went to Australia and quickly eliminated all species that could have become excellent long-term food sources. The Aboriginals did so because it was easy, and they lacked foresight. We are doing the same in our total domination of the planet and subjugation of all its resources for human usage, and if we fail to learn from the lessons of the past, instead of a barren continent, we'll have a barren planet."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"Hands down, this is one of the best books I have ever read.

Any student of history can drag up a case or two of this thesis. Baron Montaigne, for example, proposed that Europe's primacy stemmed from its superior government, which could be derived directly from the coolness of its climate.The deep significance of this book is that Diamond's thesis is not simply idle speculation. He proves that the Eurasian land mass had by far the best biological resources with which to develop agricultural societies, and was thus more able to form large, coherent, and powerful social entities.To support this idea, Diamond introduces thorough set of well-researched data on what kinds of plants and animals are necessary to support a farming society. He investigates the biological resources available to potential farmers in all parts of the world. The people of Eurasia had access to a suite of plants and animals that provided for their needs. Potential farmers in other parts of the world didn't-- and so their fertile soil went untilled.After establishing this strong foundation, Diamond falls into repeating ideas about the formation of large-scale societies. These ideas, while unoriginal, are still compelling, and Diamond presents them in a very clear and well-written way.His other major original contribution comes when he discusses the diseases that helped the Old World conquer the New. Building on his earlier chapters dealing with Old-World domesticated animals, he shows that these very animals were the sources of the major plagues (such as smallpox) which virtually annihilated New World populations. The fact that Old Worlders had immunities to these diseases was a direct result of their agricultural head-start."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"Well-researched and very well-presented. A must read for the innately inquisitive. This book really drives the determinism vs. free will debate. Outside factors were probably very much responsible for the development of human culture and techonology in some parts of the world and NOT in others.Diamond explains how the presence of native plant and animal species and their domestication led to the rise of various societies throughout the globe. The presence of such resources gave way to advancement in civilization unparalleled in areas of the globe lacking in plant and animal species that lacked potential for domestication. Domestication led to the production of food by specialists (i.e. all members of a society not producing their own food as in hunter-gatherer societies). This freed other members in the society to specialize in other endeavors: skilled labor, warfare, politics, writing etc. Metallurgy was born and man harnessed the metals in the earth to create new superior metal tools and weapons. The result was a rise in power in some areas of the world with others lagging behind still hunting and gathering as nomads. Domestication led to permanent settlements, population growth and technology explosions. Permanent settlements harboring people and animals in close quarters led to the proliferation of infectious disease. These new higher societies waged warfare on lower societies bringing their metal weapons and germs to the battlefield. The germs, coupled with superior warfare technology secondary to the ability of certain members of society to specialize as full-time soldiers meant the undoing of primitive hunter-gatherer societies and the rise of empires. Eventually, the empires wiped out or pushed lower societies into the remote corners of the globe.A tortuous chain of events leading to the rise of specific civilations is unraveled before your eyes by Jared Diamond, who has spent years traveling and researching his topic. He includes facts from multiple disciplines as well as hypothetical syntheses of the facts. However, he is careful to differntiate between scientific data and logical speculation, cautiously synthesizing his theories without hesitating to point out the gaps in data. In other words, he's a careful thinker who does not attempt to persuade the reader to buy into conclusions based on moot conjecture alone.This is a truly fascinating book. It appeals to many disciplines. I found it to be a blazing page turner."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"I needn't write a great deal about the finer points covered in this book - that has been done already, and a television series has produced a short (but accurate) sketch of the work's primary themes.

Unquestionably this is true, at least to some degree, but the author's position that this is the main and determinative factor certainly raises questions for which he provides no easy answer in the text.He has done a great service in a number of areas by pointing out that:Geography and available foods helps or hinders societal growthDomestic animal potential markedly increases the odds of a civilation's rise to greater influence and power.Latitudinal exchange of information, people and animals was far easier and more likely than any other direction.The book seems to go out of its way in fact the author seems almost obsessed about his insistence that racial and cultural varriables did not have any influence. This may be politically correct, but it left unanswered questions as to why similar societies with similar geography and animals failed to achieve the same results. At some point, especially in similar situations human choices and actions must have had some influence however small, but the author never wants to grant this varriable any credit.Many have accused him of bias, but he strikes me, not so much as bias, as someone totally committed to his conclusion - someone certain he is correct, which is always a danger for any scientist, for there is a tendancy in all of us to see what we expect to see.Over all this book is well worth the read and stimulates thought and ideas even if we don't fully agree, and isn't that the primary purpose of any truly valuable expereince that we are stiulated to greater thought and broader understandings?It is ironic that the author should succeed in stimulating this exposure to considering new ideas in others, while seemingly immune to conflicting ideas himself."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"The sweeping conclusions may not hold up, but the stories covering a wide swath of history makes this book a great read."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"The information contained in the book is thoroughly researched and enlightening.

Diamond never wavers from his thesis even when it has many apparent flaws. He discards the notion of biological/cultural differences affecting the progress of civilizations as \\"racist\\" and goes no further.

In this book, Diamond discussed the rise of complex human societies in the last 13,000 years, seeking to answer one fundamental question; why did some civilizations come to dominate others? Why did the Fertile Crescent and China for instance develop advanced societies with, as the title suggests, guns, germs, and steel, while other areas of the world, such as Polynesia, Australia, and the Americas, did not? Or in those cases where some civilizations were beginning to acquire such things, why did they get off to such a late start? Why did the Spanish conquer the Incans instead of vice versa?In a nutshell, he concluded that societies developed differently on different continents not because of racial differences in attitudes or intelligence, but because of differences in continental environments. Advanced technology, centralized political organizations, writing, and professional armies (or simply put the military advantage of simply having large numbers of people), etc. could only emerge in dense, sedentary populations capable of accumulating food surpluses.Unfortunately, domesticable wild plant and animal species needed for agriculture to arise were very unevenly distributed around the world, with the most valuable species concentrated in only nine small areas of the globe (Southwest Asia, China, Mesoamerica, the Andes and the adjacent Amazon basin, the eastern U.S., Africa's Sahel, West Africa, Ethiopia, and New Guinea), all of which became the earliest homelands of agriculture and thus regions that got a head start on developing guns, germs, and steel.Animals were vital to a society as a source of meat, milk products, fertilizer, transportation, leather, for military use, plow traction, and wool and those areas that lacked suitable animals to domesticate suffered accordingly in terms of societal development. The Late Pleistocene extinctions of large mammals in the Americas and Australia deprived humanity in those areas of potentially very valuable domesticable species. Of the big (over 100 pound) herbivores and omnivores, 148 potential candidates for domestication, they are mostly located in Eurasia (72 candidate species, versus 51 in Sub-Saharan Africa, 24 in the Americas, and 1 in Australia). Further, out of those candidates, only 14 were actually domesticated, 13 of them in Eurasia; what he called the \\"Major Five\\" - sheep, the goat, cow, pig, and horse, and the \\"Minor Nine\\" - the Arabian camel, Bactrian camel, donkey, reindeer, water buffalo, yak, Bali cattle, mithan (wild ancestor the gaur, found primarily in India and Burma), and the one American one, the llama and alpaca (two well-differentiated breeds of the same species). The other 134 potential candidates were eliminated due to problems with diet, growth rate, problems of captive breeding, nasty disposition, tendency to panic, and/or social structure, any one problem enough to preclude domestication even in modern times. Of further interest, Southwest Asia had seven of the wild ancestors naturally occurring, a huge advantage.In the world of plants there were similar disparities in distribution; of the 56 species of grass with the heaviest seeds, at least 10 times heavier than median species, Eurasia's Mediterranean zone had 32 of them, with barley and emmer wheat 3rd and 13th respectively in seed size. In contrast, of the 56 species, only 6 were found in East Asia, 4 in Sub-Saharan Africa, 11 in the Americas, and 2 in Australia.Another set of differences lead to a variation in societal evolution in the case of plant and animal domestications as well as in technological innovations and political institutions, as most societies acquire much more from other societies than they invent themselves (his discussion on the evolution of writing and in particular the alphabet in this regard was fascinating). Diffusion and migration within and between continents played a very important role in the development of a society, and in some continents diffusion and migration was considerably easier, most rapid in Eurasia because of its east-west major axis and its relatively modest ecological and geographical barriers. As crops and animals depended strongly on climate and hence on latitude, huge areas ranging almost from the Atlantic to the Pacific were open to the movement of domesticated plants and animals. Diffusion was slower in Africa and especially in the Americas due to those continents north-south major axes (traveling just a few hundred or a thousand miles north or south can render a society's crops and animals completely unsuitable for use) and much more pronounced geographic and ecological barriers (such as the Sahara Desert in Africa). Similarly, diffusion in the last 6,000 years has been easiest from Eurasia to sub-Saharan Africa, while long completely absent between Eurasia and the Americas (isolated at low latitudes by broad oceans and at high latitudes by geography and by a climate suitable just for hunter-gatherers).The last set of major factors he analyzed related to continental differences in area or total population size. A larger area or population meant more inventors, more competing societies, more innovations that exist to be adopted, and more pressure to adopt and retain those innovations, as those societies that fail to do so tend to be eliminated or absorbed by competing societies. Among the world's landmasses, area and the number of competing societies were greatest for Eurasia, while considerably smaller for Australia for instance. The Americas, despite their rather large total land area, were in effect fragmented by ecology and geography into a series of poorly connected smaller continents.Relating to both population size and the \\"Eurasians' long intimacy with domestic animals\\" was the development of germs. Crowd diseases could not sustain themselves in small bands of hunter-gatherers or slash-and-burn farmers, nor perhaps would they develop at all, as only human association with cattle gave us for instance measles (evolved from rinderpest) and smallpox (evolved from cowpox).Obviously I have just scratched the surface in my review. This is an excellent book that ties together findings in history, archaeology, paleontology, epidemiology, and linguistics in an extremely readable and informative format."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"My main area of interest over the past few years has been in the growth and emergence of ancient civilisations in Europe, Asia, Africa and the Americas, particularly, on how they developed from seemingly simple hunter gatherer societies to large states and empires of considerable complexity and sophistication. This is the first book I have read which has focussed on explaining the basic conditions required for this transformational process, and why these civilizations were able to develop in some places but not in others. The author's motivation (in answer to a question put to him by a politician of New Guinea) is to explain why the great leap forward to our modern civilization occurred in western Europe rather than in Africa or the Americas where many earlier civilizations had developed and flowered before anything similar existed in that region.In his prologue, Jared Diamond, whose scientific research is in molecular physiology, evolutionary biology and biogeography, has written an eloquent essay on the issues and considerations to be taken into account in answering this question, and how and why he has structured his book the way he has. His basic thesis on the factors involved in the development of civilization is summarized in a schematic overview on Page 87 of the book, which includes the domestication of wild grasses, and animals as the first step on the way to developing food surpluses and hence allowing specialization in trades other than those required for the basic needs of obtaining food and shelter. He explains that this step occurred in most continents of the world, but not necessarily at the same time, and not with the same degree of success.In Chapter 9 of the book he explains why some animals can be domesticated and others not, the key requirement being the social structure of the species. He explains that big mammalian species react to danger from predators or humans in different ways with some species (such as deer and antelope) being nervous, fast, and programmed for instant flight when they perceive a threat, while other species (such as sheep or goats) are slower, less nervous, seek protection in herds, stand their ground when threatened, and don't run until necessary. Attempts to domesticate the first type of animal has generally been a failure. The table of the Ancient fourteen species of big herbivorous animals is a very helpful summary of his major points. He also explains that in the Americas and Australasia, such species did not exist, possibly because they were wiped out during the early migrations of man into those continents, and that in Africa, nearly all of the large mammals were of the type of species which could not be domesticated.In chapter 10 of the book he explains the importance of the major axes of the continents in the spread of domestication of grasses and animals, and that it was the East/West orientation of Eurasia which was most suitable for this. Chapter 11 is also very important in that it explains the lethal gift of livestock in the spread of epidemics of disease, which although disastrous for the populations affected, did in the end provide a certain immunity from such diseases as smallpox from which the American Indian was not immune.Having explained these basic facts of life, the rest of his thesis falls naturally into place, and he points out that the European and Asian civilizations came into being primarily because of geographical advantages. He deflates any arguments about intellectual superiority of the Eurasians , and shows quite convincingly how quickly the native peoples of the Americas, Africa, Polynesia, and Australia adapted to the use of the horse, cattle, and other items of civilisation once they had access to themI found this book to be interesting and convincing. There were so many new facts of which I was not aware, that it will take time to absorb and fully understand them, which means it's going to be necessary to read it again. There is an extensive section of further readings with a useful bibliography for each chapter, which clearly demonstrates that Dr Jared's thesis is based on solid foundations. I give this book 5 stars, not only because it gave me a new perspective on how civilisation began, but because it so well written and readable."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"This book is fantastic! Jared Diamond manages to achieve the impossible by somehow covering thousands of years of human history in just enough detail to be fascinating but not overwhelming. He doesn't just touch on, but truly explores such wide-ranging topics as agriculture, technology, politics, psychology, and biology to name a few. These diverse subjects all are interwoven in a fluid, easy to understand style, which manages to explain even the most complex ideas using simple concepts and definitions. I felt smarter with every page turned!His extensive background in anthropology is reinforced by a strong understanding of how things interact and relate with one another, and this is the central argument of understanding the history of modern humanity. I truly enjoyed reading it, and found myself applying knowledge from it in everyday life - rather amazing for a book about societies long extinct and geographically far removed from my current existence!"},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"The great question the book tackles is why today's modern world bears the stamp of western society.The answer is partly found in the book's title: the west rules because the west had guns, germs, and steel. Diamond's insight (not in the title) lies in why the west got these before other societies. The answer is surprisingly simple: geography.First, the fertile crescent, located in modern Iraq, held most of the important domesticable large animal and plant species. Second the east-west orientation of the large Eurasian land mass offered a better environment for spreading societies than did north-south orientation of the Americas or the restricted area of Africa and Australia.The east-west orientation means large areas with more or less identical weather in which domesticated plants and animals could be moved, which in turn favoured the spread of farming and other technologies, including writing. The same east-west orientation also enabled diseases to spread easily along with the cattle that often incubated them. The populations of the Eurasian land mass were thus immunized against most diseases while those of less spacious Oceania and north-south America were not.Ultimately the coastal people (e.g. Spain, England) of the Eurasian land mass were favored over the inland people (e.g. Persia) so that only the Europeans and Chinese were left as possible world conquerors. The Europeans went for it, the Chinese did not. The book resorts to an interesting but unconvincing political explanation for this: China was politically stable so had no need to go overseas to build its empire, while the European nations did. This feels like an oversimplification.Nevertheless, the fundamental insight of geography being the determining factor, rather than genetic or racial superiority, into why the world is as it is, makes this an important book destined to remain on reading lists for a long time to come."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"First a disclaimer; I have not finished the book yet. The five stars are based on what I've read so far. Perhaps I will post again when I have finished.I just thought it would be fun to take a break and get up on Amazon to read a few reviews.I can't help but notice the recurring theme in the critiques here, that Diamond believes that geography is the sole determining factor in why Eurasian people came to dominate, and that other factors (such as cultural, racial, biological...) played no role whatsoever. In fact, this is not what Diamond believes, and he has made this abundantly clear.For example, he fully acknowledges that the tradition of Confucianism was a factor in \\"stifling scientific inquiry in China\\", he just doesn't see this as an \\"ultimate explanation\\", to use his words. Similiarly, he posits that guns, germs, and steel all do indeed play a role in the way things went down. This is how he named the book afterall ! But for Diamond, these questions become, 'why did Confucianism arise in China', ... and 'why were Euroasians the ones to get guns, germs, and steel first ?'... He encourages us to keep asking 'why' until we arrive at the ultimate answers, or a \\"broad pattern\\", which according to Diamond just happen to be geographic in nature.This, in my view, is the brilliance of Diamond's book. If you ask 'why' enough times, won't you inevitably arrive at geographic considerations ? Can you go farther than that ? I mean, you can ask, I suppose, 'why were they there', but it seems the answers to such questions will also be geographic in nature."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"Diamond explicitly sets out to prove that the differing patterns of settlment which occured on this planet were in no way related to the people in the various regions, that it was exclusivly based on local conditions. This thesis can't always hold true, although it certainly generally does.His synthesis of avialable data on the cultivation of plants and animals is nice, and accurate. It explains why some places domesticated critters and plants while others didn't, by looking at locally avialable candidates and evaluating thier suitability for domestication as a whole; do the avialable, readily domesticatable plants and animals come close to providing a decent diet? This is the strongest point of his book, at least in my opinion, and makes the book worth reading. Most of this scholarship has been done before (look at the bibliography for this section), but this is a strong synthesis for those of us without extensive ag experince.He also, however, brings in the lattitude angle, which is fundamentally flawed. His position is that contienents with a east-west axis are better suited for the spread of plants and animals, due to the similar lattitude and thus more similar climates. However, this ignores drastic climaticit variation in the form of elevation and precipiation changes; Lyons France, and Odessa Ukraine, have similar lattitudes and different climates. It is a weak thesis, and he does not truly deal with any of the counterarguments readily avialable, which is truly dissapointing.He may have had some rebuttals to the counterarguments hidden away, but we don't get to see them. Given that this thesis is easily attackable, it's a shame.When it comes to the epidomological section of his book, I am simply too ill-informed to comment much; he maintains that the proximity of early Europeans to animals helped expose them to disease,particularly more virulent ones, making them more immune.I feel this was weakly developed myself; he maintains that European and Asian exposure to these diseases fostered a stronger immune system, but that ignores the exposure of tropical peoples to their diseases (malaria, etc.). If Europeans could develop a better immune system from exposure to germs, why couldn't tropical tribes gain immunity from germs through their own exposure? Why didn't these new germs stop or significantly slow European expansion (which they did, but he doesn't deal with that very much).There were also biases; he maintains that he feels many hunter gathers are more intelligent than most Europeans/Anglos. He also seems too inclined to dismiss any human variable, as is evidenced by the half-baked way in which he deals with the GLARING exeption to his thesis--China. China had all the advantages; huge population base, long unified, early domestication of plants and animals, navigable rivers, etc. Everything that should have conspired against it being divided up at the colonial feast. Yet, China was the play thing of Europe and Japan during the late stages of the great game. He attempts (sort of) to deal with this, but in a confusing and unconvincing manner.This book is not a specialist work, at least as I read it. Most of the scholarship has been done elsewhere, piecemeal (again, look at the bibliography). It is an introductory text to the spread of civilization, and a servicable one. It attempts to spell out prior scholarship in a way that those of us without specialties in all the related fields (e.g. ag, ethnobotany) can understand it. However, one must read this book critically, and apply one's own knoweldge base to the arguments the author makes, as some of them simply seem illogical and/or incomplete. As I said, the section dealing with the domestication of plants and animals, and the implications for society, make the book worth reading, but you have to be careful here; the author treads on dangerous, unproven ground at times, and taking his ideas at face value would be dangerous."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"Diamond's careful analysis of how geography influences the development of societies is one of those ideas that stick in your head and change your thinking on a whole host of other subjects. It isn't so much a new scientific theory, but a new way of looking at things. The feeling I came away from the book with is that the world is really a very small place: we may think that everything has been tried, and what succeeded was the best, but in reality the whole course of human history has been shaped by a handful of accidents, like the shapes of the continents, the social behavior of certain large animals, the nutritional value of certain plants, and so on. Along with Dawkins' The Selfish Gene and Ayer's Language, Truth and Logic this is one of those books I'll force my children to read."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"The question asked is: \\"Why did people from the Eurasian continent conquer the other continents, and not the other way around?\\" Most people would answer \`because they had guns'. Jared Diamond tries to answer why the Eurasians developed guns. What was the prime reason?Diamond has a couple of intriguingly good points related to geography, points completely new to me: that the size and major axis was decisive of a continent's destiny in the big battle for world supremacy. Because Eurasia was the biggest continent, it was most likely to accommodate the most domesticable plants and big mammals. Eurasia also had the longest east-west axis, meaning that the art of food production spread more easily than in the Americas or Africa, where the major axis were north-south. With food production the value of land increased. People became willing to pay for staying at the same place over a long period of time, and political centralization and professional specialization evolved. Particularly: people with food production developed means to protect their property by force. Political centralization also contributed largely to the development of writing, and a lot of other innovations like metallurgy, large ocean going vessels, compasses, armour, religion etc. The size of Eurasia also meant that if one civilization was in the backwater, another was probably innovative. Ideas spread, and ideas spread more easily between rather similar civilizations. The geographical points are well made.In addition to the geographic points, Diamond spends a lot of time elaborating a biological point: domestication of big mammals led to infectious diseases among the farmers, smallpox being the most important one. After a couple of thousands years the farmers develop resistance towards those diseases. Travelling overseas, the diseases became a lethal weapon in the service of the Europeans, killing far more Indians than guns did. This point is not new, and the importance of germs as a cause of successful European imperialism is large overrated in this book. Firstly, germs impossibly played any significant role in the battles between the 150 Spaniards led by Pizarro and the tens of thousands of Inkas. Guns, armour and horses did. Secondly, Africa was also conquered by Europeans, despite that Africans had as nasty germs as Europe. All this said, reading about the development of germs was interesting enough. Another objection towards his theory is the facts of the immense diversity inside the Eurasian continent. At 1500, Western Europe and China were at the technologically forefront. The areas now covered by Ukraine, Poland, Pakistan, Myanmar and a whole lot of other Eurasian areas were not, despite being at the Eurasian continent. A point he pulls far to often is that the wealth of US, Europe, Australia and Eastern Asia today does not originate from superior genes, but from different environments. A hundred years ago it would have been controversial, today it isn't.The main objection towards the book however, is its length. Diamond has a couple of really good points, and some really good stories to tell (example: the Japanese went from being the worlds finest gunsmiths at 1600 to abandoning guns altogether in 1800). The author didn't have to spend 450 pages getting his admittedly good points through, and he didn't spend that many pages either; the last half is mostly repetitions from the first. Chapter 18 (Hemispheres colliding) is a complete revisit to the earlier chapters. But the first part of the book is a winner, and I am will probably read Diamond's next one as well, about why civilizations fail."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"Previous reviewers have explored the author's thesis that geography has shaped history through its effects upon evolution of societies and biota. My review will focus on the author's comments regarding religion, and particularly Christianity.I found this book enlightening and humbling because despite my best efforts, I can't entirely avoid a taint of ethnocentrism in my worldview. I've been well aware of the crimes through which America gained its wealth and power, but at the same time, I've been proud of our many noble accomplishments. I've been distressed at the incongruity between Christianity's positive effects within our society, and its simultaneous role in encouraging our country to sin against less-powerful peoples for our own benefit. Slavery, the Mexican Wars, and the Indian genocides are only a few examples.For this reason, the author's comments on religion are useful. He notes that as larger, better-organized states arose to exploit resources, rulers used religion to strengthen ethnic identity and justify aggressive wars. This was the way of the world for millennia: stronger states robbed and enslaved their weaker neighbors without apology, and religion was usually secular power's cheerleader. Because of this book, I see now that Christianity's ambivalent role in American is nothing new in the world of religion.What's outrageous about this role is that Christ came to change all that. As Paul said, in Christ there is neither slave nor free, Jew or gentile. We're supposed to be Christians first, and citizens of our respective polities second. I believe that Christianity started to go off this track when Constantine made it Rome's state religion. Although we owe secular authority considerable obedience, that obedience does not include giving preference to our own polities' interests over others'. Clearly, in those areas where our Christian faith touches upon relationships with other countries, we've lapsed into religion's traditional role of being secular power's lapdog rather than its watchdog."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies (Norton 1997), winner of the 1997 Pulitzer Prize, is written by Jared Diamond, a professor of Physiology at UCLA School of Medicine, who also writes about ecology and evolutionary biology. Diamond supposedly wrote this book in response to a question posed by a New Guinea politician:\\"Why is it that you white people developed so much cargo and brought it to New Guinea, but we black people had little cargo of our own?\\" Or, put in another way, \\"why did Europe colonize New Guinea, and elsewhere, instead of the other way around?\\"Diamond's theory is that the reasons have little, if anything, to do with biological differences, cultural systems or human effort; it has to do with the location of superior agriculture and domesticable animals. He attempts to prove his theory by examining the world, as it must have looked 13,000 years ago.Diamond examines three paramount factors:A. The shape of the continent;B. The distribution of domesticable wild plants and animals; andC. The geographical barriers inhibiting diffusion of domesticated plants and animals.The location that incorporated these three factors led to the earlier decline of the hunter-gatherer lifestyle and encouraged farming. This, in turn, led to social stability, government, learning, and, eventually, armies and explorers.Diamond identifies Eurasia, which had the good fortune to be situated in an east-west orientation (\\"axis\\"), to be the perfect highway for agriculture to spread. The mid-latitude region of Eurasia, had the largest continuous zone of temperate climates and, therefore, was more conducive to the origination of superior and plentiful plants and animals. Thus, Eurasia was \\"fated\\" to be the center of farming and, indeed, became the birthplace of civilization.According to Diamond, continents with a north-south axis (e.g., Africa, the Americas), was not conducive to the spread of agriculture as plants had to move through different climate zones. There is no discussion of the adaptability of plants, even though that is an essential element of domesticability. The ubiquitous potato now thrives in many areas foreign to its place of origination.Diamond's theory based on the domestication of wild animals is a little stronger. The early domestication of animals in Eurasia eventually led to human resistance to certain diseases acquired from animals. European explorers had developed significant immunities to diseases to which the people in the New World had no resistance. Thus, smallpox wiped out an entire civilization, or at least rendered the people defenseless to invaders.Diamond argues that the contiguous nature of the countries in the east-west axis, as well as their temperate environments, led to rapid dispersion of plants and the domestication of animals. Actually, there are many inhospitable barriers within Eurasia, which, under Diamond's theory would block diffusion. However, Diamond does not address this factor.Diamond also fails to explain, adequately, why Australia, which has a climate similar to the mid-lateral region of Eurasia did not begin farming until much later.Diamond concludes that Eurasia was fated to be the winner in the worldwide historical competition because of geographical and environmental advantages. Then approximately 500 years ago, Europe pulled ahead of China and assumed sole dominance. The lack of competition within homogeneous China was given as the reason Europe became sole victor in the end.There are several major problems with Diamond's theory. The first is the absence of any provable, corroborating evidence. Under his theory if the New Guinean man and his descendants had switched places with the Europeans 10,000 years ago, those people would have become the colonizers, instead of the colonized.The book also is heavily biased by the author's \\"reverse\\" racism views. In response to the question of whether there are any biological differences today between Aboriginal Australians and Europeans, Diamond states:\\"The objection to such racist explanations is not just that they are loathsome, but also that they are wrong. Sound evidence for the existence of human differences in intelligence that parallel human differences in technology is lacking. In fact ... modern \\"Stone Age\\" peoples are on the average probably more intelligent, not less intelligent, than industrialized peoples.\\"The author's choice of the word \\"loathsome,\\" an emotionally loaded word, to describe racism sets the tone for this very politically correct book.This reviewer's impression is that Diamond has a pre-determined conclusion, and he relies on certain theories to support it, but ignores those same theories when they don't support his conclusion. In the end, Diamond does not establish a credible response to the New Guinea man's questions. To the extent the book purports to be a scientific study of history, the author has made a very basic error: he attempts to explain a \\"fact\\" - that there are no biological differences among different groups of people - without first establishing that that indeed is a fact.Guns, Germs, and Steel is an interesting, politically correct story of the evolution of civilization, but I would not recommend it as a scientific study of history. Though fairly easy to read, the book is very repetitive and unnecessarily long to make the author's point. One hundred or more pages easily could have been cut."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"While on a research trip to New Guinea in 1972, evolutionary biologist Jared Diamond was asked by a local politician - Yali, who had never left the island but had much curiosity about the world - why people of Euroasian dissent had much 'cargo', but his people did not. This question struck home to the author and ultimately led to \\"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies\\", an important book in understanding the development of human societies since the last ice age. To answer this question, Diamond looked at the broad factors of environment and geography on all of the regions of the world over the last 13,000 years.Near the end of the last ice age, around 11,000 B.C.E., all of humanity was organized into bands of pre-literate hunter-gathers that relied on stone tools. Over the next 10,500 or so years this changed. By 1492, when European colonization of the North and South America began in earnest, there were still large regions of the planet where hunter-gathers dominated the landscape - Australia, regions of sub-Saharan Africa, much of the Americas, and the islands of the Pacific. But, most of Eurasian societies had iron technology, state governments, standing armies, and quiet often fleets of sailing ships that were exploring the world. These facts became a driving force for Diamond over the next twenty-five years as he explored the answers, an exploration that led to \\"Guns, Germs, and Steel\\".What Jared Diamond found was that much of the course of human history has been decided by the fate of the geography and environment each region's inhabitants were subject to. What fate led to a Eurasian dominance of the \\"modern\\" technology that existed around the middle of the last millennia? Agriculture and animal husbandry played a significant part in this story. Eurasia was the home to an inordinately disproportionate quantity of animals that were easier to domesticate such as the cow and the pig, as well as a large variety of plants that were easier to subdue and control.This head start in food production had its positive and negative effects on these burgeoning civilizations; but, even the negative side effects gave these societies an advantage. This new food supply led to a more hierarchical society that afforded some a leisure time that produced advances in technology and governmental systems and the development of writing and organized religion; but also created a system that oppressed much of the society. These advances often led to more warfare, which hardened these new states. Higher population densities led to new diseases, which, though devastating at times, led to immunity on a large scale.All of these factors led to the inevitable: expanding populations require more land and more resources. This need led to direct contact with areas of the world where societies without these 'advantages' were still operating quite successfully in bands of hunter-gatherers; or where infant civilizations with smaller subsets of these factors were growing and expanding. The rest is, as they say, history.Jared Diamond's \\"Guns, Germs, and Steel\\" presents the progress of human civilizations into the modern world within the context of the land these societies occupied at the end of the last ice age; and, it systematically dismantles any racially or ethnically based theories of human history that have prevailed in the past. Throughout this study of the last 13,000 years, you will visit every corner of the world and learn what geographic and environmental factors played a part in the fate of the human societies that developed within the context each landscape; and you will understand the importance that guns, germs, and steel played in the course of all of human history.>>>>>>>&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;A Guide to my Book Rating System:1 star = The wood pulp would have been better utilized as toilet paper.2 stars = Don't bother, clean your bathroom instead.3 stars = Wasn't a waste of time, but it was time wasted.4 stars = Good book, but not life altering.5 stars = This book changed my world in at least some small way."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"Truly a classic and juggernaut effort of bringing together various disparate scientific & socio-anthropological thoughts into a coherent and fluent theory - and more amazingly in a form that is both accessible and entertaining for the layman reader."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"I do not care if Bill Gates likes this book.

Check for example East Africa where the rainfall is greatest in the interior of the continent, so most people live there, far from ports and international trade routes.

Rural areas therefore remain stuck in a vicious cycle of poverty, hunger, illness and illiteracyThis book is a very inventive, powerful and detailed historical study of human societies. Historical systems are complex and chaotic behavior tends to make history unpredictable, colorful and explosive. But we humans are all the same, capable of hurting, killing, exploiting each other regardless of race or ethnic background. This is how ultimately we tend to compete: exterminating or enslaving our neighbors, using techno and military advantages, spreading at the expense of other groups. This means for example, that complex and advanced society of North America Indians would have been as nasty (murdering, bringing under control, locking in reserves, spreading diseases) as greedy and cruel Europeans, if they had existed at a different geographical location.

In fact, he underscores protein in the diet as being a huge contributor to cultural advancement. It has nothing to do with landscapes that look like paradise and produce a lot of mangoes and bananas. It takes a lot more than fruit and nuts to build a society--and that is precisely his point.As for all the religious and cultural variables--they don't even happen without a basic foundation. Judeo-Christianity emerged in a breadbasket culture and is a product of agricultural society. It evolved as it traveled Westward to more sustainable lands.Read Collapse, if Guns doesn't convince you.

Diamond supposedly wrote this book in response to a question posed by a New Guinea politician:\\"Why is it that you white people developed so much cargo and brought it to New Guinea, but we black people had little cargo of our own?\\"Or, put in another way, \\"why did Europe colonize New Guinea, and elsewhere, instead of the other way around?\\"Diamond's theory is that the reasons have little, if anything, to do with biological differences, cultural systems or human effort; it has to do with the location of superior agriculture and domesticable animals. He attempts to prove his theory by examining the world, as it must have looked 13,000 years ago.Diamond examines three paramount factors:A. The shape of the continent;B. The distribution of domesticable wild plants and animals; andC. The geographical barriers inhibiting diffusion of domesticated plants and animals.The location that incorporated those three factors led to the earlier decline of the hunter-gatherer lifestyle and encouraged farming.

Jared Diamond richly deserves all the accolades (and money), which he has earned! Hey, anyone who can make history interesting to millions of Americans raised on a thin gruel of rote memorization, boring textbooks, and self-serving propaganda (see James Loewen's \\"Lies My Teacher Told Me\\") has got to be doing something right!As far as the critics of \\"Guns, Germs and Steel,\\" at least as indicated by reviews here at Amazon.com, they basically seem to be arguing that the book is flawed because it is (choose one or more): \\"politically correct,\\" \\"left-wing,\\" not \\"original,\\" \\"lacking in concrete evidence,\\" overly deterministic in its focus on natural forces/factors, and -- a related criticism - neglectful of important \\"human variables,\\" particularly \\"culture\\" and \\"religion.\\"OK, then, what about it, is the book \\"politically correct\\" or \\"left-wing\\"? Well, if by \\"politically correct\\" the critics are referring to a hypersensitivity to any criticism of the \\"in\\" group(s) of the day, and/or holding the majority (or an \\"out\\" group, like white males, in some people's view) to a far tougher standard than others are held to, I don't really see how that criticism applies to \\"Guns, Germs, and Steel\\". Reason? Diamond is not saying that Europeans are BAD because they conquered the Indians or Africans or whoever, he's just explaining WHY Europeans conquered the Indians or Africans or whoever. Huge difference there! Really, it's surprising that this book is criticized as \\"PC\\", because as far as I can tell it's basically arguing \\"survival of the fittest\\" on a racial level (although not for any \\"inherent\\" or \\"God-given\\" reason, but basically for totally natural/arbitrary/accidental factors), and I thought that \\"survival of the fittest\\" was an old favorite of many conservatives, even fascists. So, in sum, I just don't understand why this criticism is being made at all.As far as \\"lacking in concrete evidence,\\" I think that's kind of a silly criticism for a book which is written specifically for a mass audience, plus it's wrong anyway. Diamond presents PLENTY of fascinating, thought-provoking, entertaining evidence for his thesis, and if you want more you can read lots more about it all over the place!As far as \\"ignoring human variables\\" (especially \\"culture\\" and \\"religion\\"), that gets to the heart of Diamond's whole argument, and people who make this criticism either don't get Diamond's argument or just don't LIKE it (probably because it implies that THEIR \\"culture\\" and/or \\"religion\\" are not inherently any more wonderful or superior to any others, although they certainly may be more adaptive in a Darwinian \\"survival of the fittest\\" sense).The thing is, this whole question is a \\"chicken and egg\\" paradox. In other words, is northern European Protestantism (for instance) more powerful than, let's say, Native American religions, because it is inherently \\"better\\" in some sense, or is it more that northern European Protestantism HAPPENED to win out (for all kinds of reasons not under their control, like germs, which they didn't even know about), and as the victors they got to write history (and, not surprisingly, portray themselves in the most positive light). Just to take one powerfully intriguing example, what if Europeans had come over to America and been decimated by native American diseases instead of the other way around? That ALONE probably would have stopped the Europeans from defeating the Indians. Imagine if a few survivors had sailed back to Europe carrying these diseases and Europe had largely been wiped out as well. Among many other things, I don't think too many people would be making the argument today that European civilization was superior to any other, that's for sure!Anyway, the bottom line here is that this is a great book.

The argument was nature vs. nurture and, being the 80's, nurture naturally won.Jared Diamond's book is to world history what Trading Places was to the nature/nurture debate---a well thought out but highly subjective treatment. Maybe someday we will be able to dispassionately discuss the issue, but Guns, Germs, and Steel is not the place to get that treatment.The book is as skewed to the belief that only environmental factors affect success---the society with the most varities of domesticatable plants and animals will, over time, prevail over all other societies---as say The Myth of the 20th Century, the infamous guide to Nazism that pre-dated Mein Kampf, is skewed toward the belief that only genetics determines success.

Contrary to the voluminous objections cited in the many of the revisionist historians and anthropologists, the famous biologist Jared Diamond tackles the most important question of global history in one compelling volume: \\"Why did Europeans come to dominate the New World?\\" This question has been answered by others before and Diamond's idea that Europe's geography is the cause geographical determinism has also been proposed before. Any student of history or anthropology can drag up a case or two of this thesis. Baron Montaigne, for example, suggested that Europe's predominance curtailed from its superior government, which could be derived directly from the coolness of its climate. However as an enthusiastic proponent of environmental determinism, Jared Diamond presents a set of premises consistent with evidence provided from a wide range of disciplines, but he does not attempt to answer the question of genetic diversity, including segregated intelligence among racial groups as many reviewers have inferred. If anything, implicitly, the author appears to support promulgations of differentiated intelligences; he sets out to demonstrate intelligence was not the root cause to Eurasian dominance.The deep significance of this book is that Diamond's thesis is not simply idle conjecture. He proves that the Eurasian land mass had by far the best biological resources with which to develop agricultural societies, and was thus more able to form large, coherent, and powerful social entities. In order to back this idea, Diamond introduces a set of well-researched data on what kinds of plants and animals are necessary to support a farming society. He investigates the biological resources available to potential farmers in all parts of the world. The people of Eurasia had access to a suite of plants and animals that provided for their needs. Potential farmers in other parts of the world did not have such access and so, their fertile soil went uncultivated. Beginning 13,000 years ago, the author illuminated the circumstances that may have smoothed growth for some groups and repressed the same for others. Diamond accepts the out of Africa theory for the dispersion of Homo sapiens to the other continents as well as the importance of location that they went. For Diamond, food production is the definitive cause of capricious rates of development for different peoples. He demonstrates how the abundance of wild plants subject to domestication and availability of large mammals served as immediate factors to transition from hunter/gatherer bands and tribes to sedentary agriculturally based chiefdoms and states. In this context, Eurasia was home to important number of crops and animals that readily and successfully domesticated. This domestication resulted in mass food production, which the author claims is the \\"ultimate\\" cause of Western dominance. Food production in turn, led to a number of adjoining causes related to the rise of the West:- farms and animal herds led to stationary populations and excess food to support a specialized class of bureaucrats and soldiers and it also increased population density.After establishing this strong foundation, Diamond falls into reiterating ideas about the creation of large-scale societies. These ideas, while clich&eacute;d, are still enthralling and Diamond presents them in a very clear and well-written way. His other major original contribution comes when he discusses the diseases that helped the Old World conquer the New World. Building on his earlier chapters dealing with Old-World domesticated animals, he shows that these very animals were the sources of the major plagues such as smallpox which virtually annihilated New World populations. The fact that Old World people had immunities to these diseases was a direct result of their agricultural head-start. Finally, Diamond concludes, the unique East-West axis of Eurasia and the absence of any impenetrable geographic barriers fostered the spread of new crops, technologies which gave rise to many competing communities, whose competition further increased the western lead over the rest of the world.These technical details, while complete, are presented in a very easy to fathomable way and Diamond's writing style is fun and engaging. Diamond's arguments are persuasive on the surface, and even the prevalent skeptic will have reason for pause after reading his book.However, I have some concerns with respect to the credibility of this book. I felt that I had to second guess most of his evidence, because it was equivocal, lacking or incorrect. Firstly, Diamond uses the term \\"Eurasian\\" to describe cultures and societies. However, the term is essentially used to describe a geographical landmass or tectonic plates. All the way through the book, he uses the term \\"Eurasian\\" when it supports his hypothesis and replaces the term with European or western Eurasian to support another part of his thesis. He does not separate Europe and Asia to explain societies and cultures even though Europe and Asia contain different religions, cultures and languages. But then again, he separates \\"North Africa\\" from \\"Sub-Saharan Africa\\" even though they are part of the same continental landmass and have more commonalties. On page 161, Diamond attempts to explain his reasoning behind using the broad and vague term \\"Eurasian\\" when he states that: \\"my use of the term \\"Eurasia\\" includes in several cases North Africa, which biogeographically and in many aspects of human culture is more closely related to Eurasia than to sub-Saharan Africa\\". I believe Diamond confuses contemporary North African culture with the cultures that inhabited Northern Africa from 10,000 BC to 8th century AD. For example, from pre-dynastic to the mid-late stages of the Ancient Egyptian civilization, the ancient Egyptians had contact and traded with cultures in Ethiopia (sub-Saharan Africa). The Ancient Egyptian and Amharic language (Ethiopia) belong to the same language group which is Afro-Asiatic, and also belong to the same sub language group, which is Semitic. Diamond makes vague generalities in supporting his thesis and fails to engage significant evidence that challenges his thesis.In addition, when studying the development of different cultures and the spread of food production and technology, he modifies the definition of different terms to fit his hypothesis. Any hypothesis can be supported if you continuously alter the variables you are challenging. I found this to be the most distracting facet of this book. He does this with the terms \\"North African\\" and \\"Sub-Saharan African\\" which are terms that carried little meaning between 13,000 BC until the 7th century, but are used to separate the significant accomplishments of Ancient Egyptians (Africans) with other Africans. On page 92, he states that: \\"the availability of domestic plants and animals ultimately explains why empires, literacy, and steel weapons developed earliest in Eurasia and later, or not at all, on other continents.\\" That statement is false, since written records of the Ancient Egyptian (African) language have been dated from about 3200 BC, making it the oldest and longest documented language. The Sumerian language, as Diamond claims is the oldest language, developed around 3000 BC. Additionally, a recent archaeological discovery has suggested that some Gerzean pottery with early hieroglyphics located in Egypt could have originated since 4000 BC.Ancient Egyptians were also the first to develop mathematic concepts such as the Decimal system and science such as astronomy and medicine during that time period and significantly influenced Greek science and mathematics. Diamond does not mention any of this and I believe that he leaves out noteworthy attainments by non-Europeans to support his thesis. Throughout the book, Diamond also poses the following question in the background: \\"Why were Eurasians, rather than Native Americans or sub-Saharan Africans, the ones to invent firearms, oceangoing ships, and steel equipment?\\" Nevertheless, Diamond does not engage in the most basic question relating to the motivations of these cultures: Did Native Americans or Sub-Saharan Africans have a need for firearms/oceangoing ships? More to the point, did the Native Americans, sub-Saharan Africans, and other so-called non-Eurasians, want firearms or oceangoing ships? The answer would have forced Diamond to research the cultures and religions of Native Americans and Sub-Saharan Africans in more detail, rather than explaining it with geography and/or food production.Also, he does not include the significant accomplishments of Ancient Egypt, including papyrus, an early form of paper that originated in Africa not Europe or Asia. On page 190, Diamond states that: \\"Continental differences in axis orientation affected the diffusion not only of food production but also of other technologies and inventions.\\" It is known that Ancient Egyptian technology including scientific or medical discoveries traveled along the north or south axis towards the Middle-east and eventually to ancient Greece. Diamond doesn't mention any of this, which further questions the credibility of the book. Another problem with Diamond's style is that he seems to negate the influences of Non-Europeans, specifically Africa and China, to the current Western hegemony such as gunpowder from China, natural resources from Africa by either not mentioning them at all or under-emphasizing their importance. It is quite likely that without the influences from non-European civilizations that current Western hegemony would not exist today. He also makes downright false statements such as in page 247 when he states that: \\"Delivered in grenades, rockets, and torpedoes, those incendiaries played a key role in Islam's eventual defeat of the Crusaders.\\" According to historical records, there is no evidence to suggest that grenades, rockets and torpedoes were used during the Crusades.I agree that the domestication of plants and animals could predispose agriculturalists to further development. However, geography and domestication of animals and plants alone is inadequate to support his thesis without explaining the role of the people and societies occupying the geography. Geography might be a factor to explain how Western Civilization became the dominant civilization in the world today. Though, European civilization did not arise in a vacuum. Regardless of the plausible geographic advantage of Europe and Asia, factors such as political intentions, morals, ethics, religion and culture all served to explain why some civilizations were determined to expand and build empires through conquest, while others did not. Diamond claims that his theories offer an alternative explanation to traditional racist dogma. Conversely, I believe his theories do just the opposite. By stating that Europeans developed into the dominant civilization by \\"chance\\" or \\"luck\\" with respect to geography strengthens racist theories that European civilization was \\"destined\\" to become the most powerful.Moreover, Diamond dismisses politics, religion, culture, individuals, and timing. For example, consider Cortez's victory over the Aztecs. Cortez's victory was not assured. Many elements had to be aligned for a few hundred Spaniards to overcome a mighty empire. The odds were really in Montezuma's favor. Even with horses, armor, and guns, the Aztecs were easily a match for Cortez. The Spanish armor was superfluous. According to Keegan, they even shed their heavy armor in favor of the native quilt vests. The firearms at that time were not quick to reload, so sheer numbers could have overwhelmed the Spanish. The Aztecs lost because of politics, religion, and individuals. The brutal politics and religion of the Aztecs made their subjects hate them. The Spanish were immediately supported with armies and food by the smaller nations like the Totonacs that hated the Aztecs for their cruelty. The insatiable appetite of the Aztec gods for human sacrifices insured that Cortez found ready allies. If either Montezuma or Cortez had been composed of slightly different temperaments the war could easily have gone the other way. Had Montezuma been more decisive, he could have had Cortez killed at the coast. Had Cortez not been so incredibly determined to take the country, he could have just returned to Spain with a load of the early gold presents sent to him.History is determined by far more than geography, plants, and animals. Culture, religion, individuals, politics, and timing all play important roles. My criticisms have nothing to do with \\"political correctness\\", but rather I take issue with Diamond's style of revisionist history that does not emphasize the influence and significance of non-European civilizations towards current Western civilization. While reading the book, I was frequently second guessing the facts of Jared Diamond because they were either inexact or vague.In closing, as an introduction to anthropology and a cogent depiction of one school of thought on the rise of the West this book is marvelous. However, it needs to be approached with an open-mind as it has some of its faults. Reflect on the thesis and the supporting evidence, and then draw your own conclusions. Love it or hate it, you owe it to yourself to read this book. As for me, this book is one of the best revisionist histories on the Ancient Civilizations but as the case with revisionist history, it has its share of one sided and extreme arguments. It is a good book but not great. Still, it is very simple to read and very easy to cognize which I think deserves the Pulitzer Prize it won."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"A rich gravy of erudition smothers a thin slice of slightly tainted meat, i.e. the thesis (it's all geography & luck) is undoubtedly wrong, or, at the very best, accounts for tiny proportion of the discrepancies he attempts to explain. For detailed analysis, see the # 1 review by Christopher Smith (whom I don't know). There's more critical thought in that review than in the book itself.On the other hand, the \\"gravy\\" alone, the research and erudition, is probably worth the price of the book. Otherwise, see David Landes, \\"The Wealth and Poverty of Nations.\\""},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"This book while tough to get through at times is meticulously researched and will give you an amazing idea of how societies survived and thrived through the ages. The obvious that we take so much for granted, food, tools, shelter and the animals we raise are the links to civilizations that have disappeared and those that have flourished."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"There are many reviewers here that make great comments on the strengths of this ambitious work; Some others are deeply driven by their obvious political bias. If you approach this text with an open mind and with a notion to keep judgment at a minimum, the book illuminates the inherent forces and pre-conditions that has set societies in motion: Diamond does a superb job of carefully threading through the vagaries associated with developed modern Human society. This is a fantastic piece of scholarship."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"I had to read Jared Diamond's Pulitzer prize winning book because of the rave reviews and acclaim. The thoughts that he introduces in the book are certainly interesting and he presents us with a new way to interpret history which is certainly important. However, there is much overkill in making points about the development of each civilization - crops are the major topic with little discussion on guns, germs (more than the other 2), and steel. Of course the arguement for this focus is that the domestication of crops is how civilizations develop guns, germs and steel. I enjoyed parts of the book considerably, but you would have to have a strong interest in horticulture and botany to truely appreciate the book. I guess I was spoiled by first reading his sequel to GGS, \\"Collapse\\" - a terrific read that should be of interest to everyone -it relates our industrialization to every aspect of the environment and show historically how this has shaped history. It has major rammifications for our situation on this earth right now. -RK"},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"Through an insightful synthesis of clues from diverse fields including archeology, geography, climatology, cultural anthropology, linguistics and ecosystem science, Jared Diamond's lucid and thought-provoking Guns, Germs, and Steel offers a comprehensive \\"bedrock to topsoil\\" explanation of trends in human settlement patterns over the past 13,000 years since the most recent Ice Age. The unifying theme is that the basic geography of the continents has been the key long-run driver behind differences in the rate of innovation and economic progress among societies around the globe.Favorable environmental conditions inherent in Eurasia's latitudinal east-west continental geography fostered a richer, more varied ecosystem that provided higher availability of wild ancestral high-calorie plants and large animals that could be domesticated, thereby predisposing its human inhabitants to develop agriculture and technology, a written language, political organization, weaponry, higher population densities and, inadvertently, infectious diseases originating from mutating animal viruses, all of which gave Eurasian societies a head start and competitive advantage over early inhabitants of the other continents--Africa, North and South America and Australia--each of which has a longitudinal north-south profile or is more isolated from the other continents. Essentially, according to the thesis, geography-based fate, more than any significant difference in raw intelligence or ability across ethnic groups, has skewed the wealth distribution and technical advances towards certain European powers and their offshoots, notably the U.S., and Asian nations, historically China and more recently Japan.The appeal of Diamond's explanation is its foundation in behind-the-scenes natural forces that influence outcomes over broad expanses of time and distance, without having to rely more arbitrarily on one-time events and circumstances that often assign undue importance to individual leaders and \\"great man\\" figures to explain the observed flow of human history. Like a theory in the sciences, Diamond's thesis is constructed to be logically consistent with the past; however, its inherent weakness is its lack of meaningful predictive power over a short enough future timeframe to enable testability. As Diamond acknowledges, in our modern world with same-day air travel to anywhere on the globe and the Internet providing practically instantaneous communication, \\"One might even wonder whether the geographical reasoning employed throughout this book has at last become wholly irrelevant in the modern world. . . .\\"Consequently, although Diamond's explanation of how certain human societies (and, more controversially, ethnicities) have come to dominate others is profoundly satisfying, it provides us with very limited guidance about which continents, countries or ethnic groups are likely to have a relative advantage in the centuries and millennia ahead. My own guess is that, over the past 500 years since Columbus \\"discovered\\" America, human societies have undergone a \\"phase transition\\" which has created greater interconnectedness, placing us all for survival purposes in the \\"same boat\\" on spaceship Earth, so that \\"soft\\" factors, such as cultural values, education and the environmental choices societies make--not \\"hard\\" factors such as geography, germs and territorial clashes of societies against one another--will be the primary determinants of human progress and relative advantage among societies in the 21st century and beyond."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"I was tempted to give Jared 5 stars based on the extent of his information and his strength of his argument. I gave him only 4 stars because, although I think he is 75% correct, I think he has ignored or denies factors that may be important.Early in his book, Kali, an intelligent New Guinean and would-be shaker and mover asks a significant question. \\"Why does the white man have more cargo [goods, stuff, useful things] than we do? Jared, correctly in my opinion, refutes the politically incorrect view that New Guineans must be less intelligent than whites. Quite the contrary, Jared asserts. New Guineans, on the average, are more intelligent than whites.A little like Jared, I've had the opportunity to live with 'primitive' people and have seen their superiority to me in things like bushcraft, tracking, spacial orientation and other things....yet.... they are not necessarily more intelligent than I am. Their experience is simply different than mine. I agree, however, that they are, on the average, intelligent people dealing with problems somewhat different those of 'civilized' individuals.Jared attributes the dominance of Western Man over almost all other peoples of the earth because of our geographical location and because of the fortuitous presence of large wild animals that had the potential for domestication i.e. animals like the auroch, wild horse, ibex, wild sheep etc. In the Americas, for instance--despite the fact that the meso-Americans and Andean peoples may have been superior to Western peoples in terms of agriculture--the only domesticatable wild animal available to them may have been the guanaco and vicuna. Therefore, native-americans were obliged to carry things themselves. Hence Cortes conquered Mexico, rather than Montezuma conquering Spain.BUT....and it's a big 'BUT'....We know, from toys discovered that the ancient Americans understood the wheel. Why then didn't they discover the wheel-barrow propelled by a single person? It multiplies human labor by a factor of 3. It would have made the construction of monuments and almost everything else, a lot easier. Why didn't they make the connection or, if they did, why didn't they carry it to the next logical level and actually use it. I don't know but I rather suspect that the wheel WASN'T used initially in a cart propelled by large domestic animals. Even in Mesopotamia and China, it was likely used by the first and most available 'domestic' animal...that is the human being. Why did the people's of the Old World come up with the idea and those of the New World didn't. For that matter, why didn't Diamond discuss it.Yes, cattle, sheep, goats and a myriad of other creatures were available to the peoples of the entire 'old world.' Despite this, Europeans and Middle Easterners made the most effective use of them. Why?Indeed, why? Let me postulate another couple of scenario. Let us imagine, that human societies spread over the earth are like the atmosphere spread over the earth. Why a storm in one place and not another? Perhaps a very minor, almost imperceptible perturbation, causes major changes down the line. A slight shift in atmospheric pressure over China and there's a devastating hurricane in Louisiana...a slight cultural perturbation, perhaps in now Albania, and Pizarro burns Atahualpa at the stake? Maybe the 'superiority' of Western culture is no more than a happenstance.Also, although now largely discredited, who really knows if there are differences in the way that different brains work? This is not to say that certain brains are necessarily 'better' than others but that they might be different. Also, who is to say that industrialized, 'civilized' society is better than hunter gatherer societies? In many ways, it isn't. Civilized society is ulcerogenic. Hunter-gatherer societies are probably more satisfying and fun. Genesis, in the Bible, talks of man being thrown out of Paradise and having to work by the sweat of his brow. This is almost certainly an allegory about the replacement of enjoyable and care-free hunter-gatherer existence as opposed to the drudgery of early civilization.Why is domination a function of a pressure wave produced by black powder in a pipe propelling a leaden slug? Luck?Ron Braithwaite author of novels--\\"Skull Rack\\" and \\"Hummingbird God\\"--on the Conquest of Mexico"},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"Diamond explores the link between geography, and the way that societies develop, on a grand scale over thousands of years. It's the ultimate history book, in which world events shrink to localised inevitabilities in the grand scheme of things. It's a study that relates to history in the same way that \\"climate\\" relates to \\"weather\\".Most illuminating and thoroughly researched are the relationships between the available species of plant and animal available to early farmers, and the development of farming and with it \\"civilization\\". One uses the word with caution given the extensive discourse that Diamond has upon the subject. Of similar interest is the way that linguistics are used to underpin and cross-reference archealogical data concerning the movement and development of peoples on a global geographical scale.The thing that really brings the book to life is the personal passion of Diamond himself. He has worked at close quarters with \\"primitive\\" peoples - a word whose use he would object to - and he is at pains to debunk the notion of one society being in some way genetically superior to another. He mixes research data with personal anecdotes and experiences in a way that illuminates and illustrates what he is saying, without losing the scientific objectivity of his principal vantage point.The book is well-written, has a clear structure and flows well. At certain points it can be a little laboured, some commonsense points being explained over several pages, but this usually happens when he is tackling some commonly held misperception. He uses the question of a New Guinea friend, basically \\"why do some societies do better than others\\" as opening background, though as an attention-grabber it seemed a little weak and as a \\"red thread\\" came over as slightly contrived. The book really gets into its stride in about the second or third chapter. However, this is a very minor criticism of a work of masterly proportions and execution.I would thoroughly recommend this book. If nothing else, the reader will be able to watch television documentaries about far-flung places and spot the triteness and popular inexactitude of some of the commentary. However, in terms of driving a stake into the ground, and saying \\"this is where we come from\\" and why, this is the defining work, and well deserving it is of its Pulitzer Prize status."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"Pulling together research from a wide variety of fields, Diamond sets out to answer the question of why civilization as we know it developed and flourished in some parts of the world, while other areas were left behind.The gist: it's all about the geography. In order for civilization to develop, people have to be living in large groups, with food plentiful enough so that some people can be spared from the business of survival to specialize in organization and crafts. In order for that to happen, they must have agriculture and livestock. In order to have agriculture and livestock, they must have either native animals that are domesticable or trading opportunities to obtain them. In other words, it all comes down to where they started from.I admit to a little hesitation before I chose this book. I read through several reviews, and quite a few reviewers claimed it promoted the concept of racial superiority, and I really didn't want to end up reading several hundred pages of racist propaganda. Still, the majority of the reviews were positive, and there were also quite a few negative reviews complaining that it overlooked the racial factors, so I was intrigued enough by the question to give it a try.Guns, Germs, and Steel is decidedly not racist propaganda. Diamond bends over backward to ensure that it's not, and even raises the very intriguing question of who's actually smarter--the westerner with the comfortable lifestyle or the jungle native who has to depend on his own knowledge and judgment for survival.What I enjoyed most about the book was how thorough it was, putting together... well, I was going to say all the pieces of the puzzle, but when it comes to human history, that's just not possible--but enough of the puzzle to see the big picture, rather than just the small segments you get by focusing on a single discipline. It's not enough to describe, for example, how the development of language affected civilization--it's put into perspective along with all the other developments happening at the same time."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"It is remarkable and disappointing that Diamond's attempt to discover reasons for industrialization and technological development in certain cultures skirts the history of MONEY."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"From a biology point of view, this book was fascinating. Jared Diamond explained plant and animal domestication and the movement of human populations in a very clear way. His exploration of how different societies developed at different rates was also very interesting in that he claims that this difference is based only on geography. This even involves the east-west and north-south axes of the continents and obstacles to communication. And I use the word claims intentionally. Although he makes a good case for his theory, he does not present any alternatives. Just because his theory seems logical, it does not mean that it is the only possible explanation; it might be one of several. Yet Diamond presented his thesis as a proven fact. Indeed, the only shortcoming of this book was that the author got preachy at times, which annoys me even if he is \\"preaching to the choir.\\" In other words, even if I agree with the thesis, I don't like being beaten about the head with it.
