Lincoln was a marvelous writer from the humblest letter to his great speeches, including his inaugural addresses, the Emancipation Proclamation, and the Gettysburg Address. His sentences were so memorably crafted that many resonate across the years. \\"Fourscore and seven years ago,\\" begins the Gettysburg Address, \\"our fathers brought forth on this continent a new nation, conceived in liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal.\\" In 1940, the prolific author and historian Philip Van Doren Stern produced this volume as a guide to Lincoln's life through his writings. Stern's \\"Life of Abraham Lincoln\\" is a full biography of the man and includes a detailed chronology. Stern has collected all the essential texts of Lincoln's public life, from his first public address a stump speech in New Salem, Illinois, in 1832 for an election he went on to lose to his last piece of public writing, a pass to a congressman who was to visit the president the day after Lincoln went to Ford's Theater on April 14, 1865. Some 275 such documents are collected and placed in their historical context. Together with the \\"Life\\" and the Introduction, \\"Lincoln in His Writings,\\" by noted historian Allan Nevins, they give a full and vivid picture of Abraham Lincoln.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=-GFPijIZDzoC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Human/Nature","description":"From the #1 New York Times-bestselling author of The 48 Laws of Power comes the definitive new book on decoding the behavior of the people around you Robert Greene is a master guide for millions of readers, distilling ancient wisdom and philosophy into essential texts for seekers of power, understanding and mastery. Now he turns to the most important subject of all - understanding people's drives and motivations, even when they are unconscious of them themselves. We are social animals. Our very lives depend on our relationships with people. Knowing why people do what they do is the most important tool we can possess, without which our other talents can only take us so far. Drawing from the ideas and examples of Pericles, Queen Elizabeth I, Martin Luther King Jr, and many others, Greene teaches us how to detach ourselves from our own emotions and master self-control, how to develop the empathy that leads to insight, how to look behind people's masks, and how to resist conformity to develop your singular sense of purpose.

This book distinguishes itself by operating within the framework of the traditional school of thought or  Islamic Traditionalism . In doing so, it draws on Islam s 1400-year-old spiritual and intellectual tradition and its understanding of ethics and virtue, along with truth, justice, freedom, and equality. This book argues that Islam s pre-modern approach is indispensable in creating an organic and integral human rights model for Muslims. The first section argues that the current understanding and implementation of international human rights needs to be more flexible and inclusive if it truly aims to be universal in scope; this is because  The Universal Declaration  and its offshoots are still underpinned by secular-liberal principles, and therefore, are at odds with other cultural traditions. To this end, this section critically explores popular human rights histories and contemporary ethical theories that attempt to justify human rights. The second section of this book provides a general overview on the subject of  Islam and Human Rights . After explaining some of the main problems, this section examines various solutions offered by Muslim academics and scholars, focusing on four different types of Muslim responses to modernity and human rights: liberal, progressive, traditional, and fundamentalist. It concludes that there are  spaces of convergence  between modern-liberal ethics and traditional Islamic virtue ethics while maintaining that there are also fundamental differences and that these differences should be welcomed by human rights theorists and advocates. The book s intended audience is primarily post-graduate students and professional academics in the fields of Human Rights, Ethical Philosophy, and Islamic Studies (modern Islamic thought, Sufism, Islamic theology, Islamic Philosophy, and Traditionalism). It will also appeal to anyone interested in the subject of Islam and modernity in general and Islam and human rights in particular.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=unswEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Fun with Phonics","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=rD5PPgAACAAJ&dq=Fun+with+Phonics&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Into the Early Hours","description":"A great book of inspirational advice on the subject of spiritual and self development.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Qms9BAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Portage to San Cristobal of A.

It relies on rigorous mathematical analysis, but also aims at an intuitive exposition that makes use of visualization where possible. It places particular emphasis on modern developments, and their widespread applications in fields such as large-scale resource allocation problems, signal processing, and machine learning. The 3rd edition brings the book in closer harmony with the companion works Convex Optimization Theory (Athena Scientific, 2009), Convex Optimization Algorithms (Athena Scientific, 2015), Convex Analysis and Optimization (Athena Scientific, 2003), and Network Optimization (Athena Scientific, 1998). These works are complementary in that they deal primarily with convex, possibly nondifferentiable, optimization problems and rely on convex analysis. By contrast the nonlinear programming book focuses primarily on analytical and computational methods for possibly nonconvex differentiable problems. It relies primarily on calculus and variational analysis, yet it still contains a detailed presentation of duality theory and its uses for both convex and nonconvex problems. This on-line edition contains detailed solutions to all the theoretical book exercises. Among its special features, the book: Provides extensive coverage of iterative optimization methods within a unifying framework Covers in depth duality theory from both a variational and a geometric point of view Provides a detailed treatment of interior point methods for linear programming Includes much new material on a number of topics, such as proximal algorithms, alternating direction methods of multipliers, and conic programming Focuses on large-scale optimization topics of much current interest, such as first order methods, incremental methods, and distributed asynchronous computation, and their applications in machine learning, signal processing, neural network training, and big data applications Includes a large number of examples and exercises Was developed through extensive classroom use in first-year graduate courses","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=rC1EEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Fly on the Wall","description":"You would have to be a fly on the wall to learn of the secret love affair between Paige, a divorced English teacher, and Theo, a high school student and star basketball player.

In a celebrity-obsessed culture, when media images of women ( and women themselves ) appear to be driven by unreasonable expectations and demands, how does a 29-year-old woman fill that perfect little black dress? These questions are posed and answered in Roxane Ward s debut novel, Fits Like a Rubber Dress, a hybrid of satire, social commentary, and tragedy. It s the story of Indigo Blackwell, a woman who tries to reinvent herself as someone glamorous, and ends up travelling innocently through the underground world of drugs, fetish parties, and sadomasochistic sex. Indigo is married to Sam, a self-absorbed wannabe novelist. She s bored by her career in public relations. The lives her friends lead are profoundly more interesting than her own limited existence. She realizes, the afternoon of her promotion, that the time has come for change: something bigger than a haircut, less extreme than a divorce. No sooner has she made the leap from financial security to the exhilarating uncertainty of film school, than she walks in the back door of her house, video camera in hand, to find another man s head between her husband s naked thighs. The camera keeps rolling as Indigo s marriage dissolves. Alone for the first time, Indigo finds herself propelled into the kind of intense, urban life she s always wanted. She begins an affair with Jon, a toxic young artist who treats his own life and the people in it as he would a sculpture, as things to manipulate.

The trolley tracks had to be doubled in number, and many more streetcars were added. On Independence Day, 1901, thirty thousand people came to see the fireworks display. Idora Park needed to expand in order to accommodate these huge crowds. And expand it did. By 1915, the park had doubled in size. On April 26, 1984, it all came crashing down.

As a result, human service providers have learned to exhibit greater respect for the needs and legal rights of their consumers, the appropriateness and cost effectiveness of treatment procedures and service programs, and the per sonnel and facilities involved in providing services to consumers. Despite this encouraging trend, many human service agencies are still trying unsuccessfully to meet the two fundamental criteria of effec tive programming: (1) providing services that are effective in meeting the needs of the consumer and (2) equipping consumers to function indepen dently of the human service system to the extent possible. For example, there appears to be a general acceptance of the notion that custodial institutional service programs are needed, despite the fact that they are ineffective in rehabilitating and transitioning clients to the community and that they are difficult to change. In addition, although community based service programs have been developed as alternatives to institu tional placement, there is rarely sufficient transitional planning and pro gramming to facilitate the client's progress from the institution to the community. Although these problems generally are acknowledged, most human service managers and practitioners are ill equipped to deal with them. Specifically, the technology of human service management is in need of improvement. It is more theoretical than practical, and it lacks sufficient field testing and empirical validation.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=8qbSBwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Cases and Materials on Federal Indian Law (American Casebook Series).","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=-MxQAAAAIAAJ&dq=Cases+and+Materials+on+Federal+Indian+Law+(American+Casebook+Series).&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Knopf Guide: Seville And Andalusia","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Xm_BngEACAAJ&dq=Knopf+Guide:+Seville+And+Andalusia&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Death Valley: A Visual Interpretation (A Wish You Were Here Book) (Wish You Were Here Series)","description":"From Dantes View one looks down into the Badwater Basin of Death Valley, with the Panamint Mountains across the Valley and Telescope Peak out of view to the left.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=YJVGDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Words of Love: Romantic Quotations from Plato to Madonna","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=OTiEzQEACAAJ&dq=Words+of+Love:+Romantic+Quotations+from+Plato+to+Madonna&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Miracle at St. Bruno's","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ZXf1oAEACAAJ&dq=The+Miracle+at+St.+Bruno%27s&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Complete Book of Flowers and Plants for Interior Decoration","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=fx_od64PWfQC&dq=The+Complete+Book+of+Flowers+and+Plants+for+Interior+Decoration&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Measure theory","description":"This is a graduate text introducing the fundamentals of measure theory and integration theory, which is the foundation of modern real analysis.

Classical differentiation theorems, such as the Lebesgue and Rademacher differentiation theorems, are also covered, as are connections with probability theory. The material is intended to cover a quarter or semester's worth of material for a first graduate course in real analysis. There is an emphasis in the text on tying together the abstract and the concrete sides of the subject, using the latter to illustrate and motivate the former. The central role of key principles (such as Littlewood's three principles) as providing guiding intuition to the subject is also emphasized. There are a large number of exercises throughout that develop key aspects of the theory, and are thus an integral component of the text. As a supplementary section, a discussion of general problem-solving strategies in analysis is also given.

But although hip-hop has been assimilated and exploited in the mainstream, young black women who came of age during the hip-hop era are still fighting for equality. In this provocative study, Gwendolyn D. Pough explores the complex relationship between black women, hip-hop, and feminism. Examining a wide range of genres, including rap music, novels, spoken word poetry, hip-hop cinema, and hip-hop soul music, she traces the rhetoric of black women \\"bringing wreck.\\" Pough demonstrates how influential women rappers such as Queen Latifah, Missy Elliot, and Lil' Kim are building on the legacy of earlier generations of women -- from Sojourner Truth to sisters of the black power and civil rights movements -- to disrupt and break into the dominant patriarchal public sphere. She discusses the ways in which today's young black women struggle against the stereotypical language of the past (\\"castrating black mother,\\" \\"mammy,\\" \\"sapphire\\") and the present (\\"bitch,\\" \\"ho,\\" \\"chickenhead\\"), and shows how rap provides an avenue to tell their own life stories, to construct their identities, and to dismantle historical and contemporary negative representations of black womanhood. Pough also looks at the ongoing public dialogue between male and female rappers about love and relationships, explaining how the denigrating rhetoric used by men has been appropriated by black women rappers as a means to empowerment in their own lyrics. The author concludes with a discussion of the pedagogical implications of rap music as well as of third wave and black feminism. This fresh and thought-provoking perspective on the complexities of hip-hop urges young black women to harness the energy, vitality, and activist roots of hip-hop culture and rap music to claim a public voice for themselves and to \\"bring wreck\\" on sexism and misogyny in mainstream society.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=GPPwCgAAQBAJ&dq=Check+It+While+I+Wreck+It:+Black+Womanhood,+Hip-Hop+Culture,+and+the+Public+Sphere&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Posers, Fakers, and Wannabes: Unmasking the Real You (TH1NK)","description":"Provides insight into behaving as a child of God, knowing that He loves each person's true self, not the \\"poser\\" who pretends all is well even when life is spinning out of control.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=L1VfvwEACAAJ&dq=Posers,+Fakers,+and+Wannabes:+Unmasking+the+Real+You+(TH1NK)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Legend of Kamui: Perfect Collection, Vol. 1","description":"Living in peace with the fishermen of Saki Island, ex-ninja Kamui considers marriage to a village girl who falls in love with him -- until his idyll is shattered by the arrival of the \\"shark killers\\" and the machinations of a secret assassin.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=E3YLHCEj5EEC&dq=The+Legend+of+Kamui:+Perfect+Collection,+Vol.+1&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Cartoon Book: Hints on Drawing Cartons, Caricatures and Comic Strips","description":"Offers practical advice on drawing cartoons and comic strips, and discusses plot, characters, conventions, speech balloons, and lettering.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=5txrHQAACAAJ&dq=The+Cartoon+Book:+Hints+on+Drawing+Cartons,+Caricatures+and+Comic+Strips&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Dreamweaver MX 2004 Bible","description":"Packed with hands-on instruction and step by step tutorials, the Dreamweaver MX 2004 Bible is everything you need to harness the power of this amazing web development tool.

This book is the revised James Legge translation which has been extensively reworked and restored compared to the freely available Legge translations. The Analects, also known as the Analects of Confucius, is the collection of sayings and ideas attributed to the Chinese philosopher Confucius and his contemporaries, traditionally believed to have been written by Confucius' followers. It is believed to have been written during the Warring States period (475 BC221 BC), and it achieved its final form during the mid-Han dynasty (206 BC220 AD). By the early Han dynasty the Analects was considered merely a \\"commentary\\" on the Five Classics, but the status of the Analects grew to be one of the central texts of Confucianism by the end of that dynasty. During the late Song dynasty (960-1279) the importance of the Analects as a philosophy work was raised above that of the older Five Classics, and it was recognized as one of the \\"Four Books\\". The Analects has been one of the most widely read and studied books in China for the last 2,000 years, and continues to have a substantial influence on Chinese and East Asian thought and values today. Confucius (551479 BC) was a Chinese teacher, editor, politician, and philosopher of the Spring and Autumn period of Chinese history.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ZvJBBAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"If God does not die","description":"Insightful and heart-warming, this classic book is written for those who seek to know God better.

The proponents of this movement embrace a radical position: that all of life should be brought under the authority of biblical law as it is contained in both the Old and New Testaments. They challenge the legitimacy of democracy, argue that slavery is biblically justifiable, and support the death penalty for all manner of \\"crimes\\" described in the Bible including homosexuality, adultery, and Sabbath-breaking. But, as Julie Ingersoll shows in this fascinating new book, this \\"Biblical Worldview\\" shapes their views not only on political issues, but on everything from private property and economic policy to history and literature. Holding that the Bible provides a coherent, internally consistent, and all-encompassing worldview, they seek to remake the entirety of society--church, state, family, economy--along biblical lines. Tracing the movement from its mid-twentieth-century origins in the writings of theologian and philosopher R.J. Rushdoony to its present-day sites of influence, including the Christian Home School movement, advocacy for the teaching of creationism, and the development and rise of the Tea Party, Ingersoll illustrates how Reconstructionists have broadly and subtly shaped conservative American Protestantism over the course of the late-twentieth and early-twenty-first centuries. Drawing on interviews with Reconstructionists themselves as well as extensive research in Reconstructionist publications, Building God's Kingdom offers the most complete and balanced portrait to date of this enigmatic segment of the Christian Right.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=JQrHCQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Harlequin Valentine","description":"In this modern hardcover retelling of a classic commedia dell'arte legend of tomfoolery and hopeless, fawning love, creators Neil Gaiman (The Sandman, the Newbery Medal-winning The Graveyard Book) and John Bolton (Evil Dead) update the relationship of Harlequin and Columbine. A buffoon burdened with a brimming heart, Harlequin chases his sensible, oblivious Columbine around the city streets, having given his heart freely. Consumed with love, the impulsive clown sees his heart dragged about town, with a charming surprise to bend the tale in a modern direction. Gaiman's writing is poetic and as heartfelt as the subject matter. Bolton's art, a combination of digitally enhanced photorealism and dynamic painting, provides sensational depth with bright characters over fittingly muted backgrounds. Those who have spent Valentine's Day alone are aware that the cold February holiday can be hard to swallow. Gaiman and Bolton want you to know that all it takes is a steak knife, a fork, and a bottle of quality ketchup!","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=9hyADQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Composicion: Proceso y sintesis prepack with Sin falta software","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=kP8kPQAACAAJ&dq=Composicion:+Proceso+y+sintesis+prepack+with+Sin+falta+software&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Hong Kong: Hong Kong the Way It Was","description":"Niet eerder gepubliceerde foto's, genomen in 1959 en 1960","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=1f1LAQAAIAAJ&dq=Hong+Kong:+Hong+Kong+the+Way+It+Was&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Winning the Fight Against Diabetes","description":"The government health agencies in America, in analysing the numbers that make up the diabetic epidemic, are predicting that by the year 2020, 50% of all Americans will be diabetic.

You re on the way to becoming a successful, complete investor. But you re only partway there. If the markets are about mood swings, turbulence, and uncertainty, if the herd buys like crazy one day, only to sell off the next, doesn t it make sense for you to have a grip on the way in which your individual psychological makeup and emotional state affect your investing strategy? Doesn t the complete investor need to understand both the facts in his head and the emotions of his heart? Dr. Richard Geist has combined the art and science of the seemingly unrelated fields of psychology and investing. He shows that investing success means both having and using solid information and expertly understanding, monitoring, and managing your emotions. This is the first book directed at professional and individual investors alike, illustrating how they can use emotions to become more effective at meeting the ever-increasing challenges of today s investing environment. Dr. Geist s coverage is stimulating and wide-ranging, including topics such as: ?Recognizing emotional reactions such as confidence and anxiety as clues to making investment decisions ?Avoiding the most common psychological investment mistakes ?Analyzing your psychological risk quotient ?Reacting appropriately when you re caught in a stampeding herd ?Learning how patience or the lack of it influences investing decisions ?Responding in psychologically healthy ways to losing money in the market ?Gaining the psychological skills you need to sell a stock and learning why these skills differ from those needed when making a buy decision ?Understanding the psychological needs of management while obtaining useful, valid information for making informed investing decisions Conventional wisdom says  park your emotions at the door when making investing decisions.  Dr. Geist brings a new, important perspective to show that the conventional wisdom is not only wrong but harmful to your financial well-being. Success lies in understanding your emotional reactions to the market and its participants and integrating an emotional understanding of yourself into your investing strategies.

As a user, you can make any kind of customization you want, from choosing the keystrokes that invoke your favorite commands to creating a whole new work environment that looks like nothing ever developed before. It's all in Emacs Lisp -- and in this short but fast-paced book.GNU Emacs is more than an editor; it's a programming environment, a communications package, and many other things. To provide such a broad range of functions, it offers a full version of the Lisp programming language -- something much more powerful than the little macro languages provided in other editors (including older versions of Emacs). GNU Emacs is a framework in which you can create whole new kinds of editors or just alter aspects of the many functions it already provides.In this book, Bob Glickstein delves deep into the features that permit far-reaching Emacs customizations. He teaches you the Lisp language and discusses Emacs topics (such as syntax tables and macro templates) in easy-to-digest portions. Examples progress in complexity from simple customizations to extensive major modes.You will learn how to write interactive commands, use hooks and advice, perform error recovery, manipulate windows, buffers, and keymaps, exploit and alter Emacs's main loop, and more. Each topic is explored through realistic examples and a series of successive refinements that illustrate not only the Emacs Lisp language, but the development process as well, making learning pleasant and natural.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=-fziMZ3ZdEIC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Rightly dividing the word of truth (2 Tim. 2:15): Ten outline studies of the more important divisions of scripture","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=HCrTtAEACAAJ&dq=Rightly+dividing+the+word+of+truth+(2+Tim.+2:15):+Ten+outline+studies+of+the+more+important+divisions+of+scripture&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Ordinary of the Mass in Eight Languages","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=CdI4AQAAMAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Hillel Builds a House","description":"A young boy who loves to build houses learns that the perfect holiday for him is Sukkot.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ZLoqezlo1zoC&dq=Hillel+Builds+a+House&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The limits of Hitler's power","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Advanced Techniques of Clandestine Psychedelic & Amphetamine Manufacture","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=v2kfIpzXW0IC&dq=Advanced+Techniques+of+Clandestine+Psychedelic&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Stars look Down","description":"The Stars Look Down was A.J.

In American Discoveries, Dudley and Seaborg recount their 14-month, 4,835-mile hiking and biking adventure, fondly remembering the places they encountered and the people who opened their hearts and homes to them along the way. This dual, male/female narrative offers different yet complementary perspectives on the journey. One is that of a fifty-year-old grandmother who overcame a life-threatening illness just a year before. The other is that of mid-thirties writer. The two saw different details, faced different fears, felt different emotions. Join them on their journey, and meet a Native American peace activist, a solitary rancher, a seventy-six-year-old treasure hunter, a cowboy, a High Plains innkeeper, and Appalachian self-described \\"hillbillies\\". American Discoveries is a celebration of people and landscape. The authors blazed a trail across twelve states and into the heart of America.

Jeet Kune Do was a revolutionary new approach to the martial arts in its time and is the principal reason why Bruce Lee is revered as a pioneer by martial artists today, many decades after his death. The development of his unique martial art form its principles, core techniques, and lesson plans are all presented in this book in Bruce Lee's own words and notes. This is the complete and official version of Jeet Kune Do which was originally published by Tuttle Publishing in cooperation with the Lee family in 1997. It is still the most comprehensive presentation of Jeet Kune Do available. This Jeet Kune Do book features Lee's illustrative sketches and his remarkable notes and commentaries on the nature of combat and achieving success in life through the martial arts, as well as the importance of a positive mental attitude during training. In addition, there are a series of \\"Questions Every Martial Artist Must Ask Himself\\" that Lee posed to himself and intended to explore as part of his own development, but never lived to complete. Bruce Lee Jeet Kune Do is the book every Bruce Lee fan must have in his collection.

By examining the role of common beauty practices in damaging the health of women, creating sexual difference, and enforcing female deference, this book argues that they should. In the 1970s feminists criticized pervasive beauty regimes such as dieting and depilation, but some  new  feminists argue that beauty practices are no longer oppressive now that women can  choose  them. However, in the last two decades the brutality of western beauty practices seems to have become much more severe, requiring the breaking of skin, spilling of blood and rearrangement or amputation of body parts. Beauty and Misogyny seeks to make sense of why beauty practices are not only just as persistent, but in many ways more extreme. It examines the pervasive use of makeup, the misogyny of fashion and high-heeled shoes, and looks at the role of pornography in the creation of increasingly popular beauty practices such as breast implants, genital waxing and surgical alteration of the labia. It looks at the cosmetic surgery and body piercing/cutting industries as being forms of self-mutilation by proxy, in which the surgeons and piercers serve as proxies to harm women s bodies, and concludes by considering how a culture of resistance to these practices can be created. This essential work will appeal to students and teachers of feminist psychology, gender studies, cultural studies, and feminist sociology at both undergraduate and postgraduate levels, and to anyone with an interest in feminism, women and beauty, and women s health.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Ash-AgAAQBAJ&dq=Beauty+and+Misogyny:+Harmful+Cultural+Practices+in+the+West+(Women+and+Psychology)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Virtual Reality -","description":"A comprehensive overview of developments in augmented reality, virtual reality, and mixed reality and how they could affect every part of our lives. After years of hype, extended reality augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR), and mixed reality (MR) has entered the mainstream. Commercially available, relatively inexpensive VR headsets transport wearers to other realities fantasy worlds, faraway countries, sporting events in ways that even the most ultra-high-definition screen cannot. AR glasses receive data in visual and auditory forms that are more useful than any laptop or smartphone can deliver. Immersive MR environments blend physical and virtual reality to create a new reality. In this volume in the MIT Press Essential Knowledge series, technology writer Samuel Greengard offers an accessible overview of developments in extended reality, explaining the technology, considering the social and psychological ramifications, and discussing possible future directions. Greengard describes the history and technological development of augmented and virtual realities, including the latest research in the field, and surveys the various shapes and forms of VR, AR, and MR, including head-mounted displays, mobile systems, and goggles. He examines the way these technologies are shaping and reshaping some professions and industries, and explores how extended reality affects psychology, morality, law, and social constructs. It's not a question of whether extended reality will become a standard part of our world, he argues, but how, when, and where these technologies will take hold. Will extended reality help create a better world? Will it benefit society as a whole? Or will it merely provide financial windfalls for a select few? Greengard's account equips us to ask the right questions about a transformative technology.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=a06qDwAAQBAJ&dq=Virtual+Reality+-&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Mona Minim and the smell of the sun","description":"Mona Minim is a house ant about to make her first journey out of the nest.

Publishers Weekly In 1935, Heinrich Himmler established a Nazi research institute called The Ahnenerbe, whose mission was to send teams of scholars around the world to search for proof of ancient Aryan conquests. But history was not their most important focus. Rather, the Ahnenerbe was an essential part of Himmler s master plan for the Final Solution. The findings of the institute were used to convince armies of SS men that they were entitled to slaughter Jews and other groups. And Himmler also hoped to use the research as a blueprint for the breeding of a new Europe in a racially purer mold. The Master Plan is a groundbreaking expose of the work of German scientists and scholars who allowed their research to be warped to justify extermination, and who directly participated in the slaughter many of whom resumed their academic positions at war s end. It is based on Heather Pringle s extensive original research, including previously ignored archival material and unpublished photographs, and interviews with living members of the institute and their survivors. A sweeping history told with the drama of fiction, The Master Plan is at once horrifying, transfixing, and monumentally important to our comprehension of how something as unimaginable as the Holocaust could have progressed from fantasy to reality.  Pringle s engrossing book . . . explores a little-known corner of Nazi history: the story of the Ahnenerbe . . . rich in such bizarre characters, ridiculous theories and colorful anecdotes.

Duemler gives special attention to the utilitarian explanation which concludes that if life did [gnyad throughout the solar system, or even the galaxy, then this would serve to increase the amount of sentient life and, if life in the new world is a balanced positive, is therefore a positive event. Three main issues, drawing upon both science and philosophy, fall at the center of the discussion: supporting evidence not based on questionable dogma nor requiring huge intuitive leaps of faith; it must square with natural selection and have biological plausibility; and it must have inherent value, not requiring underlying conditions for a judgement to pass.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=CWwZDCWR49MC&dq=Bringing+Life+to+the+Stars&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Dictionary of Omens and Superstitions","description":"- What does it mean if a cat sits and washes itself in your doorway?- Why should women have their hair cut only when the moon is waxing?- Why do people from Yorkshire throw caterpillars over their shoulders?Do you avoid anything with the number thirteen and cross the road to avoid walking under ladders?

On a Malaysian trip, Shunichiro promptly framed Shingo for capital drug possession; believing him executed, he later moved to murder an old lover and her daughter who had ended up in the slums of Kuala Lumpur. But, through a quirk of fate, Shingo was not executed; instead he escaped and for three years worked as an assassin under the pseudonym Mayo, meaning \\"The Horse.\\" Here is the second reason for Shunichiro winnowing out his \\"strain;\\" he believes it is dangerous, and that Shingo is an aberrant bad seed who even in childhood stalked human game. Betrayer that he is, Shunichiro may be right about his half-brother, who has won over the men he sent to eliminate Shingo once and for all. And with Shunichiro finding himself betrayed by his erstwhile partners in crime, his schemes may all unravel. The question is: who will tie the skein of \\"strain?\\"\\"--back cover.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=smpQAAAAMAAJ&dq=Strain,+Vol.+1&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Doomsday 1917: The destruction of Russia's ruling class","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The World's Tragedy","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Canada Home: Juliana Horatia Ewing's Federicton Letters 1867-1869","description":"Aged 26 and newly married, Juliana Ewing left England in 1867, bound for Fredericton, New Brunswick, where her husband had been posted to the army garrison.

Princeton Physicist and Professor Dr. Gerard K. O'Neill, inventor of the revolutionary Colliding-Beam Storage Ring technology that is now the basis of all high energy particle accelerators, asked his students if they could come up with a working Space Colony system to permanently and happily house tens of thousands of regular people. They dug into the challenge. Soon his small band of students grew to scores of researchers both young and old, all united in the Big Dream of letting real people have a real choice in their futures. In 1974, Dr. O'Neill put his three-pronged plan of Space Colonization, Space Solar Power and Large Scale Space Construction into easily accessible form with the release of the book The High Frontier. Fourteen years later, The Space Studies Institute, founded by O'Neill, re-released the original text, unchanged except for the doctor's addition of the Appendix \\"A View from 1988,\\" and a new preface by astronaut Kathy SullivanWith this special edition, the Space Studies Institute brings The High Frontier back into print for the 21st Century.This is one of the milestone and timeless classics of Space Habitation, Alternative Power and Human Potential, all made possible with technology we already have.

In 1940 Hitler sent his troops to execute the Fall of France. A six-week battle with lightning 'blitzkrieg' warfare and combined operations techniques, the offensive ended the Phony War and sent the French forces reeling as their government fled from occupied Paris. For the Axis, it was a dramatic victory. But how was this spectacular result possible? In To Lose a Battle Alistair Horne tells the day-by-day, moment-by-moment story of the battle, sifted from the vast Nazi archives and the fragmentary records of the beaten Allies. Using eye-witness accounts of battle operations and personal memoirs of leading figures on both sides, this book steps far beyond the confines of military accounts to form a major contribution to our understanding of this important period in European history. 'Alistair Horne really brings home the pathos and human folly of war, and he writes brilliantly' The Times 'Horne follows his line unfalteringly.

Resisting essentialist tendencies, Valerie Smith identifies black feminist theorizing as a strategy of reading rather than located in a particular subjective experience. Her intent is not to deny the validity of black women's lived experience, but rather to resist deploying a uniform model of black women's lives that actually undermines the power of black feminist thought. Whether reading race or gender in the Central Park jogger case or in contemporary media, like Livin' Large, Smith displays critical rigor that promises to change the way we think about race and gender.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=nDt3fUjkNVIC&dq=Not+Just+Race,+Not+Just+Gender:+Black+Feminist+Readings&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The three mustangeers","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=eMvGmQEACAAJ&dq=The+three+mustangeers&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Mulligan for Bobby Jobe","description":"Bobby Jobe is a pro golfer whose swing is better than his attitude.

Perchance to Dream contains a selection of Beaumont s finest stories, including seven that he later adapted for Twilight Zone episodes. Beaumont dreamed up fantasies so vast and varied they burst through the walls of whatever box might contain them. Supernatural, horror, noir, science fiction, fantasy, pulp, and more: all were equally at home in his wondrous mind. These are stories where lions stalk the plains, classic cars rove the streets, and spacecraft hover just overhead. Here roam musicians, magicians, vampires, monsters, toreros, extraterrestrials, androids, and perhaps even the Devil himself. With dizzying feats of master storytelling and joyously eccentric humor, Beaumont transformed his nightmares and reveries into impeccably crafted stories that leave themselves indelibly stamped upon the walls of the mind. In Beaumont s hands, nothing is impossible: it all seems plausible, even likely. \\"[Beaumont s] imagination, as Perchance to Dream amply shows, was more than most writers enjoy in the longest of lifetimes.\\" -NPR For more than sixty-five years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world.

(Editor) Terms of use The remarkable extension in depth and width of Muslim intellectual life can be fathomed and measured only against the background of what went on immediately before, and simultaneously elsewhere, or it will remain, in any real sense, unexplored. This statement by the late Franz Rosenthal is, in a sense, the uniting theme of the present volume's 35 articles by renowned scholars of Islamic Studies, Middle Eastern Languages and Civilizations, and various allied fields of research in honor of a scholar congenial to Franz Rosenthal and exemplary in his scientific carefulness and integrity: Dr Gerhard Endress, Professor of Oriental Philology and Islamic Studies at the Ruhr University Bochum. Central topics of the contributions include Arabic philosophy and its Greek sources and Latin reception, the history and historiography of Arabic-Islamic science, and Latin reception, the history and historiography of Arabic-Islamic science, and Islamic concepts of language, knowledge, science and pedagogy. Otherarticles deal with koranic studies, Arabic lexicography and linguistics, the history of Middle Eastern civilizations, the medieval translations movements from Greek into Arabic and from Arabic into Latin as well as with political and eschatological theories of medieval Islam. Rooted in different scientific traditions and methodological approaches the studies collected in this Festschrift form a vivid and stimulating synopsis of more than 1000 years of Middle Eastern and Mediterranean intellectual, social and cultural history.

Fed up with his mistreatment, she vows to change her life -- starting by kicking him out that night. The next day, she begins a diet and exercise regime. But more life-changing news awaits: Rosie has the single winning ticket in the Wonderball lottery -- and she's won $302 million. With Kent lurking in the shadows to claim a share of her money, Rosie needs her friends more than ever -- and when Vickie returns to Savannah, Rosie learns the power of forgiveness. As she loses weight and works out under the eye of sexy personal trainer Jack Silver, a new Rosie emerges. This pretty woman is making a fresh start, and no one's greed or bitterness -- or even her own occasional self-doubts -- will stop her from jumping into life and love with a passion she didn't know she possessed.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=J1IA8QmbbN8C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Martial Arts Are Not Just for Kicking Butt: An Anthology of Writing on Martial Arts","description":"Asian Americans are a growing, minority population in the United States. After a 46 percent population growth between 2000 and 2010 according to the 2010 Census, there are 17.3 million Asian Americans today. Yet Asian Americans as a category are a diverse set of peoples from over 30 distinctive Asian-origin subgroups that defy simplistic descriptions or generalizations. They face a wide range of issues and problems within the larger American social universe despite the persistence of common stereotypes that label them as a  model minority  for the generalized attributes offered uncritically in many media depictions. Asian American Society: An Encyclopedia provides a thorough introduction to the wideranging and fastdeveloping field of Asian American studies. Published with the Association for Asian American Studies (AAAS), two volumes of the four-volume encyclopedia feature more than 300 A-to-Z articles authored by AAAS members and experts in the field who examine the social, cultural, psychological, economic, and political dimensions of the Asian American experience. The next two volumes of this work contain approximately 200 annotated primary documents, organized chronologically, that detail the impact American society has had on reshaping Asian American identities and social structures over time. Features: More than 300 articles authored by experts in the field, organized in A-to-Z format, help students understand Asian American influences on American life, as well as the impact of American society on reshaping Asian American identities and social structures over time. A core collection of primary documents and key demographic and social science data provide historical context and key information. A Reader's Guide groups related entries by broad topic areas and themes; a Glossary defines key terms; and a Resource Guide provides lists of books, academic journals, websites and cross references. The multimedia digital edition is enhanced with 75 video clips and features strong search-and-browse capabilities through the electronic Reader s Guide, detailed index, and cross references.

Since its founding in 1802 it has prepared young men--and recently, young women--for careers as officers in the army and for a lifetime of service to the nation. The distinguished record of Academy graduates in war and peace has earned West Point a reputation as one of the world's premier leader-development institutions. West Point celebrated its bicentennial in 2002. In honor of the milestone, the USMA Department of History hosted a multi-disciplinary conference that provided an opportunity for serious study of the Academy and its place in American society. The topics included the Academy's role in developing officer professionalism, its influence on the careers of distinguished graduates, institutional challenges and changes, the experiences of women and minorities at West Point, and the evolution of the academic curriculum. The twenty-four chapters in this volume examine these issues and reflect the rich scholarship of the bicentennial conference. The Academy has undergone dramatic changes during its long history. As it begins its third century, however, continuity--not change-- is what most characterizes West Point and the Corps of Cadets. By perpetuating the noble values of the profession of arms, the Academy continues to accomplish its vital mission of producing leaders of character for the nation. In this regard, the Corps of today still treads \\"where they of the Corps have trod.\\"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=sp7bAAAAMAAJ&dq=West+Point:+Two+Centuries+and+Beyond&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Ibn Saud: King by Conquest","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=iMHRPgAACAAJ&dq=Ibn+Saud:+King+by+Conquest&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"100 Happy Naked New Yorkers (Spanish Edition)","description":"The First World War is a watershed in the intellectual and spiritual history of the modern world. On the one hand, it brought an end to a sense of optimism and decency bred by the prosperity of nineteenth-century Europe. On the other, it brought forth a sense of futility and alienation that has since pervaded European thought. That cataclysmic experience is richly reflected in the work of writers and artists from both sides of the conflict, and this study provides a detailed analysis of two basic themes death and degradation that mark the literature about the war. From their accounts most men entered the war lightheartedly, filled with ideals of patriotism and glory, but these generous feelings were soon quelled as the war settled into a stalemate, its operations reduced to simply grinding away the opposing forces. In these operations, Alfredo Bonadeo shows, men became mere aggregations thrown against one another, wasted with no appreciable effects or gains, save carnage itself. This cheapening and disregard for human life and being Bonadeo finds rooted not only in the conditions of war but, significantly, in a contempt for the common man prevailing in European political and intellectual circles. This attitude is revealed most plainly in his analysis of the Italian literature, which hitherto has received little note. Italian leaders saw the war as an opportunity to expiate a sense of national guilt, and here the inconclusive campaigns made their futility all the greater. Out of the torn fields of the First World War grew the seeds of a second, greater conflict, but, Professor Bonadeo concludes, the flowering of the seeds was aided by the degradation of man's spirit on those fields. The grim focus of this book, the dead voices it evokes, leads to a new appreciation of the meaning of the Great War.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Y0YoEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Lamp Shade Book: 80 Traditional & Innovative Projects To Create Exciting Lighting Effects","description":"Bring the distinction of a stylish, finely crafted lamp into your home or office.

Larry Allen's groundbreaking The Global Economic System since 1945, in contrast, re-evaluates world economic history in a context that recognizes and avoids the inherent limitations of mathematical models. The Global Economic System since 1945 does not shun economic theory, but rather uses it as a tool to reassess recent world economic history. Allen describes how, starting at the end of World War Two, powerful corporations lobbied governments in an effort to reduce the perceived constraints of regulation. In the past twenty-five years these voices have grown increasingly influential, as governments worldwide adopted free-market policies, reduced economic regulation, and promoted the virtues of free-market capitalism. The Global Economic System since 1945 presents a fresh and wide-ranging synthesis of economic history and theory that will be valuable to both scholars and curious participants in today's global economy.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=4YvxAQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Travels in Arabia","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=kgspAAAAYAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Labyrinth of Chaos","description":"From the best-selling author, David Jay Brown comes a spell-binding journey into madness, more hellishly horrifying than your worst nightmares, yet more deliciously satisfying than your wildest dreams, David Jay Brown's science-fantasy thriller promises to completely splatter your brain, and thoroughly melt your mind.

Though already a widely acclaimed novelist, the author of such modern classics as The Orchard Keeper and Child of God, McCarthy had never before written a screenplay. Using a few photographs in the footnotes to a 1928 biography of a famous preCivil War industrialist as inspiration, McCarthy and Pearce roamed the mill towns of the South researching their subject. A year later McCarthy finished The Gardener's Son, a taut, riveting drama of impotence, rage, and violence spanning two generations of mill owners and workers, fathers and sons, during the rise and fall of one of America's most bizarre utopian industrial experiments. Produced as a two-hour film and broadcast on PBS in 1976, The Gardener's Son received two Emmy Award nominations and was shown at the Berlin and Edinburgh Film Festivals. Set in Graniteville, South Carolina, The Gardener's Son is the tale of two families: the wealthy Greggs, who own and operate the local cotton mill, and the McEvoys, a family of mill workers beset by misfortune. The action opens as Robert McEvoy, a young mill worker, is having his leg amputated after an accident rumored to have been caused by James Gregg, the son of the mill's founder. Crippled and consumed by bitterness, McEvoy deserts both his job and his family. Returning two years later at the news of his mother's terminal illness, McEvoy arrives only to confront the grave diggers preparing her final resting place. His father, the mill's gardener, is now working on the factory line, the gardens forgotten. These proceedings stoke the slow-burning rage McEvoy carries within him, a fury that will ultimately consume both families.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=0CUaBAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Whatever Happened To the Promised Land?

Together, the four authors bring a rich blend of theory and practical application to this groundbreaking text. Jeannie Oakes is a leading education researcher and former director of the UCLA teacher education program. Martin Lipton is an education writer and consultant and has taught in public schools for 31 years. Lauren Anderson and Jamy Stillman are former public school teachers, now working as teacher educators. This unique, comprehensive foundational text considers the values and politics that pervade the U.S. education system, explains the roots of conventional thinking about schooling and teaching, asks critical questions about how issues of power and privilege have shaped and continue to shape educational opportunity, and presents powerful examples of real teachers working for equity and justice. Taking the position that a hopeful, democratic future depends on ensuring that all students learn, the text pays particular attention to inequalities associated with race, social class, language, gender, and other social categories and explores teachers role in addressing them. The text provides a research-based and practical treatment of essential topics, and it situates those topics in relation to democratic values; issues of diversity; and cognitive, sociocultural, and constructivist perspectives on learning. The text shows how knowledge of education foundations and history can help teachers understand the organization of today s schools, the content of contemporary curriculum, and the methods of modern teaching. It likewise shows how teachers can use such knowledge when thinking about and responding to headline issues like charter schools, vouchers, standards, testing, and bilingual education, to name just a few. Central to this text is a belief that schools can and must be places of extraordinary educational quality and institutions in the service of social justice. Thus, the authors address head-on tensions between principles of democratic schooling and competition for always-scarce high-quality opportunities. Woven through the text are the voices of a diverse group of teachers, who share their analyses and personal anecdotes concerning what teaching to change the world means and involves.

Now, in The Art of Deception, the world's most notorious hacker gives new meaning to the old adage, \\"It takes a thief to catch a thief.\\" Focusing on the human factors involved with information security, Mitnick explains why all the firewalls and encryption protocols in the world will never be enough to stop a savvy grifter intent on rifling a corporate database or an irate employee determined to crash a system. With the help of many fascinating true stories of successful attacks on business and government, he illustrates just how susceptible even the most locked-down information systems are to a slick con artist impersonating an IRS agent. Narrating from the points of view of both the attacker and the victims, he explains why each attack was so successful and how it could have been prevented in an engaging and highly readable style reminiscent of a true-crime novel.

We would need to look at wholes (organism and ecological systems) prior to parts (fundamental particles). The book examines several theories of  new biology  simply adding new tool to the current definition and a moderately holistic outlook but focuses on an even more radical holistic view which assumes the possible presence of consciousness as an underlying layer of physical reality.

In A Study in Scarlet, the first of Holmes  adventures, Doyle acknowledged his debt to Poe and to  mile Gaboriau, whose thief-turned-detective Monsieur Lecoq debuted in France twenty years earlier. If Rue Morgue was the first true detective story in English, the title of the first full-length detective novel is more hotly contested. Among the possibilities are two books by Wilkie Collins The Woman in White (1859) and The Moonstone (1868) Mary Elizabeth Braddon s The Trail of the Serpent (1861) or Aurora Floyd (1862), and The Notting Hill Mystery (1862-3) by the pseudonymous  Charles Felix.  As the early years of detective fiction gave way to two separate golden ages hard-boiled tales in America and intricately-plotted  cozy  murders in Britain and these new sub-genres went their own ways, their detectives still required the intelligence and clear-sightedness that characterized the earliest works of detective fiction: the trademarks of Sherlock Holmes, and of all the detectives featured in these pages.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=FGmZDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Spoilers","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=UQItAAAAYAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Cut and Thrust Weapons","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ia_hAQAACAAJ&dq=Cut+and+Thrust+Weapons&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Natural Cures from a Real Medical Doctor","description":"Find natural cures for more than 170 health conditions Packed with over 170 remedies for the most common ailments, from arthritis to varicose veins, Natural Cures For Dummies will serve as your complete health advisor.

So the saying goes. But when Margaret reads the shocking headline that Dr. Wolfgang Schug has been indicted for murder in the death of a child under his care, she realizes the passage of time has not healed her heart. The Los Angeles Times reporter has eerily captured Wolf s character traits, the ones Margaret remembers too well. She pictures the man who wanted to be in control, to be seen as the one who had all the answers, the man who was unable to admit any weakness or failing. And that vision brings forth emotions Margaret thought she had buried a long time ago. Memories of the way Wolf callously altered her life, and that of her daughter s, come easily. Upon hearing that now his life is being turned upside down, Margaret admits she is pleased he is in trouble. Wolf, the man she once called lover, then husband, had a disposable approach to problems. And ten years ago, she was the problem. Margaret knows that judgment based on painful memories and a newspaper story is not fair, but she can t help it. Feelings she has apparently been harboring for years take over, and her spirit plummets down into a dark familiar place. She wants out. Pulling an old box down from the shelf in her garage, she is amazed to find it contains her journals, notes, photos, and legal papers all tangible reminders of her years with Wolf. Two keys, the very ones that unlocked his devastating secret years ago, are grabbed from the bottom of the box. Margaret holds them up in the light, mesmerized by the way they shine almost as brightly as the day they were made. You had no right! She quickly glances around, because the memory of Wolf s voice is so imposing, it seems as if he is right there. She shudders, and unwilling to have her heart held hostage any longer, Margaret realizes the time for personal resolution has come at last. If you are looking for a tabloid-style expose, this is not the book for you. The Man Who Brought Me Roses is a sensitive account of three people--a man, woman, and child--beginning and ending their life together. That the man revealed within its pages seems less than admirable is not an attempt to destroy, but to heal. The author is the first to admit that opinions she expresses about Wolf are based in the past, from her experience with him, and have no bearing on what his character may be like today. But for any woman who has ever been blinded by love, this is the book for you. For in it, you may recognize a little bit of yourself and how, by welcoming certain memories, time can heal all wounds.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=mWCDPwAACAAJ&dq=The+Man+Who+Brought+Me+Roses&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The riddle of the dinosaur","description":"This fascinating account traces a history of paleontology in relation to dinosaurs & discusses current theories concerning their extinction.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=TujEQgAACAAJ&dq=The+riddle+of+the+dinosaur&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Men of Iron","description":"Master storyteller Howard Pyle at his best, incorporating fascinating historical information about life in a medieval castle, knighthood, and chivalry into the fast-moving and entertaining story of young Myles Falworth's fight to restore his family's rights and good name.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=2tMRAAAAYAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Insight Guide Japan (Insight Guides Japan)","description":"Insight Guides Japan Travel made easy.

He then began an extraordinary rise from farmboy outsider to the hallowed rank of captain of the Royal Navy, leading three historic journeys that would forever link his name with fearless exploration (and inspire pop-culture heroes like Captain Hook and Captain James T. Kirk). In Farther Than Any Man, noted modern-day adventurer Martin Dugard strips away the myth of Cook and instead portrays a complex, conflicted man of tremendous ambition (at times to a fault), intellect (though Cook was routinely underestimated) and sheer hardheadedness. When Great Britain announced a major circumnavigation in 1768 -- a mission cloaked in science, but aimed at the pursuit of world power -- it came as a political surprise that James Cook was given command. Cook's surveying skills had contributed to the British victory over France in the Seven Years' War in 1763, but no commoner had ever commanded a Royal Navy vessel. Endeavor's stunning three-year journey changed the face of modern exploration, charting the vast Pacific waters, the eastern coasts of New Zealand and Australia, and making landfall in Tahiti, Tierra del Fuego, and Rio de Janeiro. After returning home a hero, Cook yearned to get back to sea. He soon took control of the Resolution and returned to his beloved Pacific, in search of the elusive Southern Continent. It was on this trip that Cook's taste for power became an obsession, and his legendary kindness to island natives became an expectation of worship -- traits that would lead him first to greatness, then to catastrophe. Full of action, lush description, and fascinating historical characters like King George III and Master William Bligh, Dugard's gripping account of the life and gruesome demise of Capt. James Cook is a thrilling story of a discoverer hell-bent on traveling farther than any man.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=K_dfysxsSPIC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Mystery of God's Word","description":"Those who preach the Word, those who proclaim it from a lectern, and those who hear it will all find something to inspire them to greater appreciation of the mystery of God's Word in this collection of reflections.

He called for universities to meet the intellectual challenges posed by the innovation-driven, globally connected needs of industry even as he reaffirmed basic academic values and the continuing need for longer-term scientific inquiry. In Pursuing the Endless Frontier, Vest addresses these and other issues in a series of essays written during his tenure as president of MIT. He discusses the research university's need to shift to a broader, more international outlook, the value of diversity in the academic community, the greater leadership role for faculty outside the classroom, and the boundless opportunity of new scientific and technological developments even when coupled with financial constraints. In the provocative essay \\"What We Don't Know,\\" Vest reminds us of what he calls \\"the most critical point of all,\\" that science is driven by a deep human need to understand nature, to answer the \\"big questions\\" that what we don't know is more important than what we do. In another essay, on the future of MIT, he celebrates MIT's strengths as being extraordinarily well-suited to the needs of an era of unprecedented change in science and technology. In \\"Disturbing the Educational Universe: Universities in the Digital Age Dinosaurs or Prometheans,\\" he describes MIT's innovative OpenCourseWare initiative, which builds on the fundamental nature of the Internet as an enabling and liberating technology. Vest, who is stepping down from MIT's presidency in the fall of 2004, writes with clarity and insight about the issues facing academic institutions in the twenty-first century. His essays in Pursuing the Endless Frontier offer inspiration to educators and researchers seeking the way forward.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=BR4tEAAAQBAJ&dq=Pursuing+the+Endless+Frontier:+Essays+on+MIT+and+the+Role+of+Research+Universities&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Secrets of the heart","description":"George, Duke of Cranwell, and his duchess's separation led to a bitter divorce and social ostracism for Sarah, who, unable to divulge to him the secrets of her heart, told instead the lies he expected to hear.

Against all the odds and wisdom itself, Sarah and George seem fated to fall in love all over again. Yet the old secrets remain and come back to haunt Sarah in the form of the man who destroyed her innocence years ago and now threatens that of George's sister and even of his fianc e. Sarah, it seems, may have to sacrifice her own chance of happiness once more in order to protect that of the man she has never stopped loving.

At that time, 13 of the 15 states that had already granted suffrage were west of the Mississippi River. Women not only received voting rights first in the western United States, but they had meaningful property rights as well. This may seem odd if we consider the Hollywood enhanced images we may have of the wild west where men roamed wild with guns and whisky. So why were women able to achieve such success in equal rights? Why was the first woman governor from Wyoming-now known as the equality state? \\"Evolution Toward Equality\\" explores the many factors that led to these phenomena. Certainly the environment had a facilitating effect. Women were often required to do many of the same outdoor tasks that their fathers, husbands, and brothers performed. They worked side by side and expected to be treated equally. Daughters often spent the day working with their fathers and brothers earning their respect and learning self assurance and independence. When they later left home and married, they expected to be treated in the same manner. Follow this interesting revolution as Neal guides us through the stories and history of women's rights in the western United States during the 19th and early 20th Centuries.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=mbbFFqKTu4AC&dq=Evolution+Toward+Equality:+Equality+for+Women+in+the+American+West&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Some Necessary Angels","description":"Distinguished poet and novelist Jay Parini presents some of his best essays -- both classic and unpublished works -- on topics ranging from baseball to Frost and Emerson to the culture of creative writing.

Out of this skirmish arose a stirring tale of war, which was recorded in the oldest extant epic poem in French. The Song of Roland, written by an unknown poet, tells of Charlemagne s warrior nephew, Lord of the Breton Marches, who valiantly leads his men into battle against the Saracens, but dies in the massacre, defiant to the end. In majestic verses, the battle becomes a symbolic struggle between Christianity and paganism, while Roland s last stand is the ultimate expression of honour and feudal values of twelfth-century France.

Updating an artistic tradition of transgressed childhood innocence (Goya, Messerschmidt) with the visceral brutality of Viennese Actionism, Helnwein's hyperrealistic paintings--as well as his photographs, multimedia works and performances--are truly confrontational, insofar as they permit the viewer no complacency and no escape. His subjects are most often children, usually depicted in a menacingly cold, shadowy light, who are very clearly in emotional or physical pain (or both). Like his near-contemporary Anselm Kiefer, Helnwein has also broached the topic of the Holocaust, mostly famously in his painting \\"Epiphany I,\\" in which a group of SS officers surround a mother and child. The question Helnwein's works dare to pose is: how can such 'adult' violence befall such fragile and unworldly creatures? The most substantial Helnwein overview yet published, this volume marks the artist's 65th birthday, and presents all stages of his artistic development, from landmark works of photorealism such as \\"Peinlich\\" (\\"Embarrassing\\") from 1971 to 1982's \\"Self-Portrait\\" (\\"Blackout\\"), which achieved fame worldwide as a Scorpions album cover, to more recent works such as the disturbing series \\"Disasters of War,\\" which focuses on severely injured children and teens.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=GfZ5mAEACAAJ&dq=Helnwein+(English+and+German+Edition)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Wonderful World of Natural-Food Cookery","description":"Over 300 recipes.

But somehow nepotism prevails; we all want to help our own and a quick glance around reveals any number of successful families whose sons and daughters have gone on to accomplish objectively great things, even if they got a little help from their parents. In this wide-ranging, surprising, and eloquently argued book, Adam Bellow takes a pragmatic and erudite look at the innate human inclination toward nepotism. From ancient Chinese clans to the papal lineages of the Renaissance, to American families like the Gores, Kennedys, and Bushes, Bellow explores how nepotism has produced both positive and negative effects throughout history. As he argues, nepotism practiced badly or haphazardly is an embarrassment to all (including the incompetent beneficiary), but nepotism practiced well can satisfy a deep biological urge to provide for our children and even benefit society as a whole. In Praise of Nepotism is a judicious look at a controversial but timeless subject that has never been explored with such depth or candor, and a fascinating natural history of how families work.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=z8wSCZG9O6AC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Conan the Wanderer (Conan #4)","description":"The epic adventures of fantasy's ultimate warrior continue as Conan the Barbarian confronts bloodthirsty enemies and dark sorcery in his travels across a raw, untamed world.

No philosopher is more important for his careful, critical, and deeply perceptive examination of the grounds for belief in divine powers and for his sceptical accounts of the causes and consequences of religious belief, expressed most powerfully in the Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion and The Natural History of Religion. The Dialogues ask if belief in God can be inferred from the nature of the universe or whether it is even consistent with what we know about the universe. The Natural History of Religion investigates the origins of belief, and follows its development from harmless polytheism to dogmatic monotheism. Together they constitute the most formidable attack upon the rationality of religious belief ever mounted by a philosopher. This edition also includes Section XI of The Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding and a letter concerning the Dialogues, as well as particularly helpful critical apparatus and abstracts of the main texts, enabling the reader to locate or relocate key topics.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=YnsCOwAACAAJ&dq=Natural+History+of+Religion&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Scorn This","description":"Women scorned seem to be willing to sacrifice everything to destroy the men they supposedly love.

In time, he insidiously takes on the role of Margaux's playmate, father, and lover.

Yet his critical scholarship, though beholden to no one, was not dispassionate. James Tracy shows how Erasmus the scholar sought through his writings to promote the moral and religious renewal of Christian society. Tracy finds the genesis of the humanist's notion of a \\"Christian republic\\" of pious and learned individuals in his \\"Burgundian,\\" or Low Countries, roots. Erasmus's vision of reform, Tracy argues, sprung from a humanist tradition focusing on the importance of teaching (doctrina), a tradition from which Erasmus departed in his optimism about human nature and his deep suspicion of the powers that be. Amid the storms of Reformation controversy, he pruned back the \\"dissimulation\\" by which he had thought to convey different meanings to different readers, yet in the end he could not control the way his words were read. If Erasmus's scholarly ideal carries an enduring fascination, so too does his dilemma as a man of circumspection who would also be a reformer.

How can we be sure to say and do the right things without adding to the child's confusion and grief? And what if we are grieving, too? Grief in children may be expressed differently than in adults. In clear, concise language, Dr. William Kroen offers comfort, compassion, and sound advice to any adult who is helping a child cope with death. Incorporating insights and information from the respected Good Grief Program at the Judge Baker Children's Center in Boston, Massachusetts, and weaving in anecdotes about real children and their families, he explains how children from infancy through age 18 perceive and react to death. He offers suggestions on how we can respond to children at different ages and stages, and describes specific strategies we can use to guide and support them through the grieving process from the first devastating days through commemorating the loved one and eventually moving on with life.

Starting at its source near Dijon, writer and engraver Robert Gibbings follows the river's 400-mile course as it develops from a tranquil stream into the mighty waterway that links Rouen to the sea. The journey takes different forms: on foot, in a tiny boat 'hardly more than a coracle', on a barge, and on a boat used for transporting books. Throughout this leisurely voyage during one summer Gibbings records his impressions, visual and verbal, of places and people as well as explaining how the river has played a vital role in French history. In part an evocation of the Seine's changing landscapes and rural beauty, this is also an account of towns and cities-Troyes, Rouen, Paris-and their relationship with the river. Looking at writers and painters as well as historic figures who have left their mark on the Seine, Gibbings presents an affectionate picture of this great river and the people who live and work on its banks. Discussing the vineyards of Champagne, the paintings of Sisley and Utrillo, the rituals of Parisian cafe life, the author conveys a","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=s-t4FlaEMMMC&dq=Coming+Down+the+Seine&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Fourteenth Amendment and the Bill of Rights","description":" The book is carefully organized and well written, and it deals with a question that is still of great importance what is the relationship of the Bill of Rights to the states.

The challenges associated with the struggle for attainment of these goals and objectives are as diverse and complex as the variety of human societies, national conditions and natural ecosystems worldwide. The problems to be addressed range from extreme poverty and pandemics to racism and refugee crises. Some of the best strategies and solutions to these problems emerged from unlikely places, ranging from the corporate boardrooms and halls of administration to the fields of civic engagement and the vortices of crises. Often, a single person is the dauntless driving force behind these innovative programs and courageous experiments that made all the difference to the poorest and most disadvantaged social groups. Somehow, they were able to turn the abstract goals and principles of sustainability into concrete programs and effective action. This book, the first of its kind, offers a platform that shares the individual experiences and personal studies of champions around the world that  make sustainability work  in different contexts. In the trenches of practice, results are far from guaranteed, while sacrifice and obstacles are inevitable. These champions forge the paths forward  advocating ideas, mobilizing support and exercising leadership  in diverse nations, organizations and communities. In their struggle, they develop plans and solutions that inevitably involve adaptation, sacrifice, trade-offs and compromises that address the concerns of competing groups.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=efe-DwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Miss Parloa's new cook book","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=MmPZAAAACAAJ&dq=Miss+Parloa%27s+new+cook+book&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Full House","description":"Full House Janet Evanovich Polo instructor Nicholas Kaharchek senses danger the minute he sees Billie Pearce.

Indeed, it may come as a surprise to learn that animals were a central inspiration to the development of moving pictures themselves. In Animals in Film, Jonathan Burt points out that the mobility of animals presented technical and conceptual challenges to early film-makers, the solutions of which were an important factor in advancing photographic technology, accelerating the speed of both film and camera. The early filming of animals also marked one of the most significant and far-reaching changes in the history of animal representation, and has largely determined the way animals have been visualized in the twentieth century. Burt looks at the extraordinary relation-ship between animals, cinema and photography (including the pioneering work of Eadweard Muybridge and Jules-Etienne Marey) and the technological developments and challenges posed by the animal as a specific kind of moving object. Animals in Film is a shrewd account of the politics of animals in cinema, of how movies and video have developed as weapons for animal rights activists, and of the roles that animals have played in film, from the avant-garde to Hollywood.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=OiaYVXrR90cC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Dancing Country and Other Stories","description":"Short stories for readers of all ages from a modern-day folk writer.

Anyone will tell you that! But for all the rosy sentiments surrounding friendship, most people don t talk much about what it really takes to stay close for the long haul. Now two friends, Aminatou Sow and Ann Friedman, tell the story of their equally messy and life-affirming Big Friendship in this honest and hilarious book that chronicles their first decade in one another s lives. As the hosts of the hit podcast Call Your Girlfriend, they ve become known for frank and intimate conversations. In this book, they bring that energy to their own friendship its joys and its pitfalls. Aminatou and Ann define Big Friendship as a strong, significant bond that transcends life phases, geographical locations, and emotional shifts. And they should know: the two have had moments of charmed bliss and deep frustration, of profound connection and gut-wrenching alienation. They have weathered life-threatening health scares, getting fired from their dream jobs, and one unfortunate Thanksgiving dinner eaten in a car in a parking lot in Rancho Cucamonga. Through interviews with friends and experts, they have come to understand that their struggles are not unique. And that the most important part of a Big Friendship is making the decision to invest in one another again and again. An inspiring and entertaining testament to the power of society s most underappreciated relationship, Big Friendship will invite you to think about how your own bonds are formed, challenged, and preserved. It is a call to value your friendships in all of their complexity. Actively choose them. And, sometimes, fight for them.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=PoC2DwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Tour: A Life Between the Lines","description":"The Tour is a book that will take you on two journeys, one past and one present.

It begins with the shock of hammer blows as the Titan Prometheus is shackled to a rock in the Caucasus. This is his punishment for giving the gift of fire to humankind and for thwarting Zeus s decision to exterminate the human race. Prometheus s pain is unceasing, but he refuses to recant his commitment to humanity, to whom he has also brought the knowledge of writing, mathematics, medicine, and architecture. He hints that he knows how Zeus will be brought low in the future, but when Hermes demands that Prometheus divulge his secret, he refuses and is sent spinning into the abyss by a divine thunderbolt. To whom does humanity look for guidance: to the supreme deity or to the rebel Titan? What law controls the cosmos? Prometheus Bound, one of the great poetic achievements of the ancient world, appears here in a splendid new translation by Joel Agee that does full justice to the harsh and keening music of the original Greek.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=TGA9DwAAQBAJ&dq=Prometheus+bound,&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Detectives inc. in A remembrance of threatening green","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The hill,: A novel","description":"Ty is the grunt.

I thought that making the decision to fit a baby into my busy life was the hard part. I was wrong.\\" After a year of having sex to schedule, Jessica and her partner were diagnosed with \\"unexplained infertility\\", and soon discovered they were not alone. Infertility is a silent epidemic of the modern world. It is currently estimated that one in five couples in the UK have difficulty conceiving and that over 50,000 women a year undergo IVF. Some of them will achieve the miracle baby they are hoping for. Many will not. All of them face a barrage of intrusive tests and treatment, exhilarating highs and devastating lows. The Pursuit of Motherhood takes the reader on a seven year journey, as Jessica makes her way through various different clinics and multiple rounds of IVF. During this time she also goes to many alternative and sometimes absurd lengths to understand her infertility, from visiting a psychic tarot card reader to attending an intense therapeutic process to discover whether her \\"inner child\\" has anything to do with it. She also faces the heartbreak of several miscarriages and a life-threatening ectopic pregnancy. Throughout her journey, Jessica records her day-to-day thoughts and feelings in blog-style entries called The Infertility Diaries, detailing everything from the effect that it starts to have on her friendships, to hearing for the first time that Beyonc  is about to have a baby. And gradually, over time, her attempt to create a life became in itself life-enhancing.

Ranging from Chaucer to H.D. to William Carlos Williams to Louise Gl ck to Shelley (among others), McLane tracks the \\"growth of a poet's mind,\\" as Wordsworth put it in The Prelude. In a poetical prose both probing and incantatory, McLane has written a radical book of experimental criticism. Susan Sontag called for an \\"erotics of interpretation\\": this is it. Part Bildung, part dithyramb, part exegesis, My Poets extends an implicit invitation to you, dear reader, to consider who your \\"my poets,\\" or \\"my novelists,\\" or \\"my filmmakers,\\" or \\"my pop stars,\\" might be.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ydeZAwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Life is Too Short","description":"THE INSTANT NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER \\"A hilarious, tender, and altogether life-affirming gem of a book.\\" --Emily Henry, bestselling author of Beach Read A brilliant and touching romantic comedy about two polar opposites, one adorable dog, and living every day to its fullest. When Vanessa Price quit her job to pursue her dream of traveling the globe, she wasn't expecting to gain millions of YouTube followers who shared her joy of seizing every moment. For her, living each day to its fullest isn't just a motto. Her mother and sister never saw the age of 30, and Vanessa doesn't want to take anything for granted. But after her half sister suddenly leaves Vanessa in custody of her baby daughter, life goes from \\"daily adventure\\" to \\"next-level bad\\" (now with bonus baby vomit in hair). The last person Vanessa expects to show up offering help is the hot lawyer next door, Adrian Copeland. After all, she barely knows him. No one warned her that he was the Secret Baby Tamer or that she'd be spending a whole lot of time with him and his geriatric Chihuahua. Now she's feeling things she's vowed not to feel. Because the only thing worse than falling for Adrian is finding a little hope for a future she may never see.

NPR Pulitzer Prize-winning author and global energy expert, Daniel Yergin offers a revelatory new account of how energy revolutions, climate battles, and geopolitics are mapping our future The world is being shaken by the collision of energy, climate change, and the clashing power of nations in a time of global crisis. Out of this tumult is emerging a new map of energy and geopolitics. The  shale revolution  in oil and gas has transformed the American economy, ending the  era of shortage  but introducing a turbulent new era. Almost overnight, the United States has become the world's number one energy powerhouse. Yet concern about energy's role in climate change is challenging the global economy and way of life, accelerating a second energy revolution in the search for a low-carbon future. All of this has been made starker and more urgent by the coronavirus pandemic and the economic dark age that it has wrought. World politics is being upended, as a new cold war develops between the United States and China, and the rivalry grows more dangerous with Russia, which is pivoting east toward Beijing. Vladimir Putin and China's Xi Jinping are converging both on energy and on challenging American leadership, as China projects its power and influence in all directions. The South China Sea, claimed by China and the world's most critical trade route, could become the arena where the United States and China directly collide. The map of the Middle East, which was laid down after World War I, is being challenged by jihadists, revolutionary Iran, ethnic and religious clashes, and restive populations. But the region has also been shocked by the two recent oil price collapses--and by the very question of oil's future in the rest of this century. A master storyteller and global energy expert, Daniel Yergin takes the reader on an utterly riveting and timely journey across the world's new map. He illuminates the great energy and geopolitical questions in an era of rising political turbulence and points to the profound challenges that lie ahead.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=POY9EAAAQBAJ&dq=Climate+and+energy+of+nations&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Van Richten's Arsenal (Ravenloft d20 3.0 Fantasy Roleplaying)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=TG5yPQAACAAJ&dq=Van+Richten%27s+Arsenal+(Ravenloft+d20+3.0+Fantasy+Roleplaying)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Calculus with Complex Numbers","description":"This practical treatment explains the applications complex calculus without requiring the rigor of a real analysis background.

Seven weeks before the Truce of July 1921, the British presence in County Cork consisted of a total of over 12,500 men. Against these British forces stood the Irish Republican Army whose flying columns never exceeded 310 riflemen in the whole of the county. These flying columns were small groups of dedicated Volunteers, severely commanded and disciplined. Constantly on the move, their paramount objective was merely to exist, to strike when conditions were favourable and to avoid disaster at all costs. In 'Guerilla Days in Ireland' Tom Barry describes the setting up of the West Cork flying column, its training and the plan of campaign, which he implemented. In particular he gives his account of the Kilmichael ambush, one of the most controversial episodes of the War of Independence.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=32e1mgEACAAJ&dq=Guerilla+days+in+Ireland&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Deogratias, A Tale of Rwanda","description":"The 2000 winner of the Goscinny Prize for outstanding graphic novel script, this is the harrowing tale of the Tutsi genocide in Rwanda, as seen through the eyes of a boy named Deogratias. He is an ordinary teenager, in love with a girl named B nigne, but Deogratias is a Hutu and B nigne is a Tutsi who dies in the genocide, and Deogratias himself plays a part in her death. As the story circles around but never depicts the terror and brutality of an entire country descending into violence, we watch Deogratias in his pursuit of B nigne, and we see his grief and descent into madness following her death, as he comes to believe he is a dog. Told with great artistry and intelligence, this book offers a window into a dark chapter of recent human history and exposes the West's role in the tragedy. Stassen's interweaving of the aftermath of the genocide and the events leading up to it heightens the impact of the horror, giving powerful expression to the unspeakable, indescribable experience of ordinary Hutus caught up in the violence. Difficult, beautiful, honest, and heartbreaking, this is a major work by a masterful artist.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=r19rswEACAAJ&dq=Deogratias,+A+Tale+of+Rwanda&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Sickness unto Death: A Christian Psychological Exposition of Edification & Awakening by Anti-Climacus (Penguin Classics)","description":"One of the most remarkable philosophical works of the nineteenth century, The Sickness Unto Death is also famed for the depth and acuity of its modern psychological insights. Writing under the pseudonym Anti-Climacus, Kierkegaard explores the concept of 'despair', alerting readers to the diversity of ways in which they may be described as living in this state of bleak abandonment - including some that may seem just the opposite - and offering a much-discussed formula for the eradication of despair. With its penetrating account of the self, this late work by Kierkegaard was hugely influential upon twentieth-century philosophers including Karl Jaspers, Jean-Paul Sartre and Albert Camus. The Sickness unto Death can be regarded as one of the key works of theistic existentialist thought - a brilliant and revelatory answer to one man's struggle to fill the spiritual void.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=t3ckc5MEJkEC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Conversations with Stoppard","description":"British playwright Tom Stoppard in his own words","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=PubwLmgAcd0C&dq=Conversations+with+Stoppard&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"THE ANTELOPE WIFE","description":" A fiercely imagined tale of love and loss, a story that manages to transform tragedy into comic redemption, sorrow into heroic survival.

Even the most respected scientists today will readily admit that the Big Bang Theory is full of holes. But it takes a new look, like Dark Matter, Missing Planets, and New Comets, to explain not only why the theory is wrong but what to substitute in its place. If you are curious about such things as the nature of matter and the origin of the solar system, but feel inadequately equipped to grasp what modern science has to say about such things, read this book. You will not get the all too common condescending attempt to water down the \`mysteries' of modern science into a form intelligible to little non scientist you, but rather a straightforward new theory, logically derived in front of your eyes, which challenges the roots of many of today's complex accepted paradigms, yet whose essence is simple enough to be thoroughly communicated to the intelligent layman without \\"losing it in the translation.\\"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=BnKYxM4uZ1QC&dq=Dark+Matter,+Missing+Planets+and+New+Comets:+Paradoxes+Resolved,+Origins+Illuminated&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Birding in Venezuela","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=5QdhAAAAMAAJ&dq=Birding+in+Venezuela&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Ultimate Sex Diet: The Super Sex Diet That Works","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Pagan Christianity: The Origins of Our Modern Church Practices","description":"Have you ever wondered why we Christians do what we do for church every Sunday morning? Why do we  dress up  for church? Why does the pastor preach a sermon each week? Why do we have pews, steeples, and choirs? This ground-breaking book, now in affordable softcover, makes an unsettling proposal: most of what Christians do in present-day churches is rooted, not in the New Testament, but in pagan culture and rituals developed long after the death of the apostles. Coauthors Frank Viola and George Barna support their thesis with compelling historical evidence and extensive footnotes that document the origins of modern Christian church practices. In the process, the authors uncover the problems that emerge when the church functions more like a business organization than the living organism it was created to be. As you reconsider Christ's revolutionary plan for his church to be the head of a fully functioning body in which all believers play an active role you'll be challenged to decide whether you can ever do church the same way again.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=cPTBmcHa-i0C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Redthroats","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=52FdAAAAMAAJ&dq=The+Redthroats&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Questions and Answers on Death and Dying","description":"On Death and Dying is one of the most important books ever written on the subject and is still considered the bench-mark in the care of the dying.

A genius for architecture. Photographs by Paul Rocheleau","description":"Constructed over a century ago, the buildings of Henry Hobson Richardson (1838-1886), America's leading architect at the end of the nineteenth century, brought international acclaim to American architecture. During his twenty-one-year career, Richardson drew inspiration from many wellsprings of medievalism, thus placing his work within the Arts and Crafts tradition. His architecture came to be recognized as quintessentially American, and it inspired and greatly influenced the work of others who followed him, most notably Louis Sullivan and Frank Lloyd Wright. Richardson's powerful, unified structures -- in which vernacular, provincial, and primitive sources fuse with an elemental consciousness of natural environment and regional landscape -- expressed the spirit of his own era yet transcended time, and today still stand as an inimitable bridge between the past and the future. This unparalleled publication pairs the research of a renowned architectural historian and the vision of an exceptional architectural photographer, producing the first full-color critical review of this important architect's work. Margaret Henderson Floyd illuminates new and surprising aspects of Richardson's remarkable story, placing his buildings within the architectural ambience of nineteenth-century England and New England, while Paul Rocheleau has photographed most of the significant extant buildings to create a volume as important visually as it is textually. The stunning photographs of Richardson's work -- over two hundred and all in color -- are supplemented with archival photographs and drawings.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=4iCLQgAACAAJ&dq=Henry+Hobson+Richardson.+A+genius+for+architecture.+Photographs+by+Paul+Rocheleau&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Starting Out in the Thirties Hardcover","description":"\\"A stunning book. . . .

However, in my novel, there are also elements of modern genres such as love on an epic scale, and a totally unexpected view of Earth.  What if,  as scientists have speculated for years,  Everything that we send out across the air waves the movies, radio shows, television, news reports all remain intact, exactly the way they were sent? And what if someone on the other side of the galaxy intercepted those transmissions? What would be our message to those strangers?  This is the pretext of this novel. From there, the story goes on to speculate what might happen if someone from the future knew that the end of their own civilization was fast approaching, and tried to change history. What effect would this kind of historical influence have on someone who possessed certain talents, such as telepathy? Knight King Chehada K-braxa is a man possessed of great power and abilities, but not without conscience. He is confronted with a dilemma unlike any other in his illustrious career when he captures an alien spy of unequaled talents and beauty. When she tells him of a coming invasion that could mean the destruction of his kingdom, he must make a decision that could decide the fate of everyone human and otherwise in his Union. The alien woman, Tai sonn, from the hidden planet of K OrSachea has arrived from the future with an ominous mission: To stop  Chehada s War,  which, in her time line, was started by Knight King Chehada himself. It will kill so many that the survivors will not be able to hold off a coming invasion. Tai sonn has seen this invasion, both on the news from Earth, and in an attack on her own home world. The marauding Tregasa, who destroyed the planet Earth centuries earlier, are coming and they know nothing of mercy. But, strangely, the Knight King of Tai sonn s own history is not the same as the man with whom she is now confronted. Having come with the mission to kill the Knight King and therefore save enough people and resources to fight the Tregasa, she must now endeavor to understand the enigma of a different king a wise, charismatic ruler with the power to seduce her. Together they must find a way to work together to decide the fate of the Union of the Known Civilizations. When they do come together, it is with a love strong enough to save worlds. What are the ethical consequences of time travel, if it is possible at all? How do we deal with theories concerning artificial intelligence? What constitutes right and wrong in the rich tapestry that makes up any given society? Bravery and loyalty, cowardice and deceit: they all exist, but do they always look the same? These are the answers that Tai sonn and Chehada must find.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=bbHBAAAACAAJ&dq=Empress+in+the+Wrinkle+of+Time&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"J SCOTT SCHEEL COLOSSAL CASH IN COMMERCIAL PROPERTY","description":"Recent years have seen a dramatic increase in the use of crystal structure information and computational techniques in the design and development of a very wide range of novel materials.

Drawing on a range of theoretical approaches and a wide body of recent research, the book addresses key academic and policy debates about technological change and the future of cities with a fresh perspective. Through this approach, the complex and crucial transformations underway in cities in which telecommunications have central importance are mapped out and illustrated. Key areas where telecommunications impinge on the economic, social, physical, enviromental and institutional development of cities are illustrated by using boxed extracts and wide range of case study examples from Europe, Japan and North America. Rejecting the extremes of optimism and pessimism in current hype about cities and telecommunications, Telecommunications and the City offers a sophisticated new perspective through which city-telecommunications relations can be understood.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=76GIAgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Reckoning (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Heritage of Lancaster County)","description":"Dru, Graves, and a Broken wulf named Ash seek safety at Dru's grandmother's cabin in the Appalachian Mountains, but her wards and enchantments cannot keep Dru safe from a betrayal by the person she trusts most.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=aytRYAAACAAJ&dq=The+Reckoning+(Turtleback+School&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Economic Growth of Singapore: Trade and Development in the Twentieth Century","description":"This book provides a comprehensive overview of the economic development of Singapore, easily the leading commercial and financial centre in Southeast Asia throughout the twentieth century. This development has been based on a strategic location at the crossroads of Asia, a free trade economy, and a dynamic entrepreneurial tradition. Initial twentieth-century economic success was linked to a group of legendary Chinese entrepreneurs, but by mid-century independent Singapore looked to multinational enterprise to deliver economic growth. Nonetheless exports of manufactures accounted for only part of Singaporean expansion, and by the 1980s Singapore was a major international financial centre and leading world exporter of commercial services. Throughout this study Dr Huff assesses the interaction of government policy and market forces, and places the transformation of the Singaporean economy in the context of both development theory and experience elsewhere in East Asia.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=4fVQtMnnn60C&dq=The+Economic+Growth+of+Singapore:+Trade+and+Development+in+the+Twentieth+Century&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"None Dare Call It Education: What's Happening to Our Schools & Our Children?","description":"\\"None Dare Call It Education explains why a once great public school system now graduates students who can't read, write or calculate.

The text is grounded in current research and theory that integrate sociocultural and constructivist concepts and perspectives and provide a framework teachers can use to develop strategies for teaching reading, writing, and thinking to diverse students. The focus on English literacy development does not imply advocacy for \\"English only\\" or ESL as the primary mode of literacy instruction. Rather, the authors take the position that learners need to develop literacy in their native language and that the concepts and skills learned in developing the native language create a foundation of strength from which students can develop English literacy. Part I introduces relevant research and language learning theories. Part II provides research reviews and information about literacy learning within specific culturally and linguistically diverse communities. The chapters in Part III challenge the reader to view the multiple social, intellectual, cultural, and language differences children bring to the classroom as an opportunity for learning and building on the diversity among students. Activities and suggested readings at the end of each chapter involve readers in reflection, observation, meaning making, and the construction of application processes for their new understandings. New in the Second Edition: *updated research and theory on multilingual and second language literacy; *a focus on the interpretation of these research findings to make them useful for teachers and teacher educators in understanding and articulating the research bases for literacy practices; *attention to current intensely debated issues, such as standards, the phonics movement, and high-stakes testing; and *new activities and suggested readings.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=CbQ-eM1Exu4C&dq=Sociocultural+Contexts+of+Language+and+Literacy&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Lucid Dreams in 30 Days, Second Edition: The Creative Sleep Program","description":"Offers daily exercises designed to help readers achieve an out-of-body experience","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=3kE3GY42w6gC&dq=Lucid+Dreams+in+30+Days,+Second+Edition:+The+Creative+Sleep+Program&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Rootabaga stories","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Pilgrim's France: A Travel Guide to the Saints","description":"In this unusual travel guide, the authors show how to reach the shrines, locations of quiet places for prayer and meditation, plus information for travelers with disabilities.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=h6UFAAAACAAJ&dq=The+Pilgrim%27s+France:+A+Travel+Guide+to+the+Saints&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Barley Break: An Elizabethan Songbook with Arrangements for the Appalachian Dulcimer","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=PmcBAAAACAAJ&dq=Barley+Break:+An+Elizabethan+Songbook+with+Arrangements+for+the+Appalachian+Dulcimer&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Theory of the Leisure Class (Modern Library Classics)","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=4LIyAQAAMAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Radical Hope: Ethics in the Face of Cultural Devastation","description":"Presents the story of Plenty Coups, the last great Chief of the Crow Nation.

'This book draws back the curtain on a part of Australian and British history that has been crying out for recognition. All Australians shoud read it' Sir Ronald Wilson 'This story is remarkable. Even more remarkable is the fact that, until now, it was largely untold. This is an important story, an important part of Australia's story and long overdue' David Hill 'Orphans of the Empire is unusually affecting, hard to put down..' Geraldine Doogue An account of the white 'stolen children', who were supposedly orphans arriving in Australia from many countries to a better future, but who in reality simply came from poor families and arrived to uncertain futures and often extremely abusive environments in various institutions. More than 80,000 people were directly involved in this experience as 'orphans', while thousands more have been affected by the experience as children and relatives of the orphans, and as Australian-born children who were also living in the institutions described in this book. Although there were occasional great acts of kindness towards these children there was also systematic abuse of all kinds. Orphans of the Empire is based on hundreds of hours of taped interviews with men and women who came to Australia as child migrants.

An MIT \\"hack\\" is an ingenious, benign, and anonymous prank or practical joke, often requiring engineering or scientific expertise and often pulled off under cover of darkness instances of campus mischief sometimes coinciding with April Fool's Day, final exams, or commencement. (It should not be confused with the sometimes non-benign phenomenon of computer hacking.) Noteworthy MIT hacks over the years include the legendary HarvardYale Football Game Hack (when a weather balloon emblazoned  MIT  popped out of the ground near the 50-yard line), the campus police car found perched on the Great Dome, the apparent disappearance of the Institute president's office, and a faux cathedral (complete with stained glass windows, organ, and wedding ceremony) in a lobby. Hacks are by their nature ephemeral, although they live on in the memory of both perpetrators and spectators. Nightwork, drawing on the MIT Museum's unique collection of hack-related photographs and other materials, describes and documents the best of MIT's hacks and hacking culture. This generously illustrated updated edition has added coverage of such recent hacks as the cross-country abduction of rival Caltech's cannon (a prank requiring months of planning, intricate choreography, and last-minute improvisation), a fire truck on the Dome that marked the fifth anniversary of 9/11, and numerous pokes at the celebrated Frank Gehry-designed Stata Center, and even a working solar-powered Red Line subway car on the Great Dome. Hacks have been said to express the essence of MIT, providing, as alumnus Andre DeHon observes, \\"an opportunity to demonstrate creativity and know-how in mastering the physical world.\\" What better way to mark the 150th anniversary of MIT's founding than to commemorate its native ingenuity with this new edition of Nightwork?","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=3LdNEAAAQBAJ&dq=Nightwork:+A+History+of+Hacks+and+Pranks+at+MIT&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"What You Can Change and What You Can't","description":"If you believe that dieting down to your \\"ideal\\" weight will prolong your life; that reliving childhood trauma can undo adult personality problems; that alcoholics have addictive personalities, or that psychoanalysis helps cure anxiety, then get ready for a shock. In the climate of self-improvement that has reigned for the last twenty years, misinformation about treatments for everything from alcohol abuse to sexual dysfunction has flourished. Those of us trying to change these conditions are often frustrated by failure, mixed success, or success followed by a relapse. But have you ever asked yourself: can my condition really be changed? And if so, am I going about it in the most effective way? Grounding his conclusions in the most recent and most authoritative scientific studies, Seligman pinpoints the techniques and therapies that work best for each condition, explains why they work, and discusses how you can use them to change your life. Inside, you'll discover: the four natural healing factors for recovering from alcoholism; the vital difference between overeating and being overweight, and why dieters always gain back the pounds they \\"lost\\"; the four therapies that work for depression, and how you can \\"dispute\\" your way to optimistic thinking; the pros and cons of anger, and the steps to take to understand it and much more!","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=jlwzDAAAQBAJ&dq=What+You+Can+Change+and+What+You+Can%27t&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The quiet rebels;: The story of the Quakers in America ([Culture & discovery books])","description":"The moving story of the Society of Friends and its unique contribution to the history of this country, from the day in 1656 when the first Publishers of the Truth arrived in Boston harbor to the present.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=SXNsAAAAIAAJ&dq=The+quiet+rebels%3B:+The+story+of+the+Quakers+in+America+(%5BCulture&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"North Star Conspiracy","description":"While working for the Underground Railroad in Seneca Falls, New York, librarian Glynis Tryon is troubled by the suspicious death of a freed slave and uncovers a shocking secret about some of her fellow abolitionists.

But as an arbiter of good and bad taste, as a source of knowledge, and as a gateway to the fabled land of Hollywood and its stars, the American fan magazine represents a fascinating and indispensable chapter in journalism and popular culture. Anthony Slide's Inside the Hollywood Fan Magazine provides the definitive history of this artifact. It charts the development of the fan magazine from the golden years when Motion Picture Story Magazine and Photoplay first appeared in 1911 to its decline into provocative headlines and titillation in the 1960s and afterward. Slide discusses how the fan magazines dealt with gossip and innuendo, and how they handled nationwide issues such as Hollywood scandals of the 1920s, World War II, the blacklist, and the death of President Kennedy. Fan magazines thrived in the twentieth century, and they presented the history of an industry in a unique, sometimes accurate, and always entertaining style. This major cultural history includes a new interview with 1970s media personality Rona Barrett, as well as original commentary from a dozen editors and writers. Also included is a chapter on contributions to the fan magazines from well-known writers such as Theodore Dreiser and e. e. cummings. The book is enhanced by an appendix documenting some 268 American fan magazines and includes detailed publication histories.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=5hDG6auRCJ4C&dq=Playboy+Magazine+/+December+1978+-+Farrah+Fawcett,+John+Travolta,+Vargas+Girls&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Tree Of Life & The Origin Of The Species","description":"\\"It's a tale more haunting and moving than one thinks it can possibly be.\\" --The Village Voice","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ZU1yCOVyxAQC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Biomedical Applications for Introductory Physics","description":"* Can be utilized in either Algebra or Calculus-based courses and is available either as a standalone text or as a supplement for books like Cutnell PHYSICS, 5e or Halliday, Resnick, & Walker FUNDAMENTALS OF PHYSICS, 6e. * Math level is Algebra & Trigonometry; however, a few examples require the use of integration and differentiation. * Unlike competing supplements, Tuszinski offers both a wealth of engaging biomedical applications as well as quantitative problem-solving.

The right to choose means nothing if we don't have the right to prefer. We are all shareholders in the government-Uncle Sam Incorporated. What better source of cash than all you other taxpayers-uh, sorry, I meant to say the government. We want warning labels on everything-from cigarettes to can openers. That businessman may be a greedy multi-millionaire, but by creating jobs he is doing much more for the 'little guy\\" than any politician can do with taxpayer handouts. As an employee we hate to compete with all those imports, but as a consumer we love the competition from all those imports. When we constantly push for minority rights, the rights of the majority inevitably get pushed aside. We need to show the world that America means business, and it is hard to portray a business image with our pants falling down, our arms covered with tattoos and our hair painted blue. It sometimes seems that we, the people, are the pawns in the game of chess that the media are playing.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=RUPzmZo5qMMC&dq=The+10+Most+Popular+Un-American+Attitudes&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Peekaboo Kisses","description":"Offers toddlers a colorful, interactive board book where playful animals of various shapes and sizes are hiding behind numerous lift-the-flaps, and comes complete with a squeaker to press and a peek-at-yourself mirror.

He toyed with playing the Woodstock festival brought to his own front door but it was the Foulk brothers who succeeded where all others failed, luring Dylan 3,000 miles away from home to their Island, to create a Woodstock of his own. Landing the music biz coup of the decade, the three Foulk brothers - a printer, an estate agent and an art student - became pioneers in pop promotion by signing for the world exclusive appearance of the reluctant 'voice of his generation'. For the organisers, short on experience, resources and time, the ensuing public response was almost overwhelming, and the challenge of delivering the most eagerly-awaited musical event of the era daunting. The world's media covered the phenomena, gave the event global coverage and marked it as a suitable climax as the swinging sixties drew to a close. The 1969 Isle of Wight Festival was Bob Dylan's one and only full concert appearance in seven-and-a-half years and played its part in a highly transformative period of the artist's life. Stealing Dylan from Woodstock tells, from a unique perspective, of an extraordinary event which seismically altered the lives of the author, his family, all those involved with it and many of those who attended.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=7bbxrQEACAAJ&dq=Dylan+in+Woodstock&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"JEAN HELION","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=bjFGAQAAIAAJ&dq=JEAN+HELION&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"How to Live Large on a Small Planet","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=5Z2lRwAACAAJ&dq=How+to+Live+Large+on+a+Small+Planet&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Jew Within: Self, Family, and Community in America","description":"Eisen, two of the keenest observers and analysts of American Jewish life, probe beneath the surface to explore the foundations of belief and behavior among moderately affiliated American Jews.\\"--BOOK JACKET.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=8CDZHKrPdk8C&dq=The+Jew+Within:+Self,+Family,+and+Community+in+America&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Master the Law Federal Enfment Exams, 5e (Arco Master the Federal Law Enforcement Exams)","description":"This book is one of the results of the II International Seminar on Research on Mediatization and Social Processes. The II International Seminar on Research on Mediatization and Social Processes had a program developed at two levels: Debate panels, with invited researchers  five tables with the participation of researchers from Sweden (1), Russia (1), Portugal (1), Argentina (1), and Brazil (6). The schedule of the II Seminar and its structure are available at https://www.midiaticom.org/seminario-midiatizacao/grade-de-programacao-2018/. Intotal, there were 15 hours of debates at the five debate panels. This second event gave continuity to the first International Seminar on Research on Mediatization and Social Processes, which also had guest researchers. In the first seminar, the five panels were attended by researchers from France (3), Denmark (1), Argentina (2), and Brazil (4). See: http://www.midiaticom.org/seminariointernacional/programacao-2016/. Therefore, methodologically, the Seminar takes place in the articulation of debate panels with international guests and working groups, with the presence of researchers, doctors, doctoral students, Masters, and master s degree students. We emphasize that, still in the scope of training processes, master s and doctoral students, masters and doctors, post-doctoral students and post-doctors, and members of the organizing Research Group take part in them as reviewers, in a blind evaluation, of the expanded abstracts submitted by graduates with lower titles  under the coordination of researchers/professors of the Research Group on Mediatization and Social Processes. They evaluated (in a group of more than three dozen reviewers) each of the works submitted by colleagues with training at a lower level, with classification grades, which resulted in the approved papers. Then, they were grouped by the organizing committee, successively, until the event s working groups were formed. A total of 237 abstracts were submitted. They were selected in the following proportion of participants: 21% of professors/researchers; 33% doctors and doctoral students; 33% masters and master s students; 13% graduates and undergraduate students, linked to scientific initiation research project and/or with research results of a senior research project. In the first seminar, in 2016, there were 250 submissions by authors and 217 expanded abstracts. Out of these, around 188 works were selected. At both events, half of the participants were from universities in other states (S?o Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, and Minas Gerais, mainly). Among its results, in addition to the training processes in the course of its realization, we emphasize its consolidation in a library of reflections, in the form of complete articles of the presentations in Working Groups and books published in e-book format (with chapters produced by the participants of the debate panels). The expanded abstracts of the event are available at https://midiaticom.org/anais/index.php/seminario-midiatizacao-resumos. The full articles are available at https://midiaticom.org/anais/index.php/seminario-midiatizacao-artigos.

In the mid-fifties Mailer began to develop a 'philosophy' which would be able to account for much of his aesthetic experimentation as well as his thematic concerns and public style. While it lacks rigor, it is a loose discussion of matters that at different points in his life embrace psychological, political, economic, social, aesthetic, theological, mystical, and cosmological concerns, all of which are sufficiently related to allow for systematization. It is a 'philosophy' which changes in amoebic fashion, the original outline continually present but always involving new emphases. He has always stressed the need for the fullest development of the self, a process which can only take place after a long and rigorous inner journey that is continually nourished by perilous transactions in the world at large.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=5wpbAAAAMAAJ&dq=Norman+Mailer:+The+Radical+as+Hipster&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Learned Pigs & Fireproof Women: Unique, Eccentric and Amazing Entertainers","description":"A fun and brilliantly researched history of the strangest entertainers in show business history by Ricky Jay, one of the great magicians working today and the self-styled scholar of the unusual.

The Man in the Iron Mask has all the hallmarks of a thrilling adventure story: a glamorous and all-powerful king, ambitious ministers, a cruel and despotic jailor, dark and sinister dungeons  and a secret prisoner. It is easy for forget that this story, made famous by Alexandre Dumas, is that of a real person, Eustache Danger, who spent more than thirty years in the prison system of Louis XIV s France never to be freed. This narrative brings to life the true story of this mysterious man and follows his journey through four prisons and across decades of time. It introduces the reader to those with whom he shared his imprisonment, those who had charge of him, and those who decided his tragic fate. The Man in the Iron Mask reveals one of the most enduring mysteries of Louis XIV s reign; but it is, above all, a human story. Using contemporary documents, this book shows what life was really like for state prisoners in seventeenth-century France and offers tantalising insight into why this mysterious man was arrested and why, several years later, his story would become one of France s most intriguing legends that still sparks debate and controversy today.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=r7YGEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"History of the conquest of Peru (Everyman's library : History)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=SLx5ngEACAAJ&dq=History+of+the+conquest+of+Peru+(Everyman%27s+library+:+History)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"There's More to Me Than I'Ve Used Yet","description":"Francis Weaver's \\"Midlife Musings\\" are seen regularly on PBS-TV across America.

Public health saved your life today you just don t know it,  is a phrase that Dr. Leana Wen likes to use. You don t know it because good public health is invisible. It becomes visible only in its absence, when it is underfunded and ignored, a bitter truth laid bare as never before by the devastation of COVID-19. Leana Wen emergency physician, former Baltimore health commissioner, CNN medical analyst, and Washington Post contributing columnist has lived on the front lines of public health, leading the fight against the opioid epidemic, outbreaks of infectious disease, maternal and infant mortality, and COVID-19 disinformation. Here, in gripping detail, Wen lays bare the lifesaving work of public health and its innovative approach to social ills, treating gun violence as a contagious disease, for example, and racism as a threat to health. Wen also tells her own uniquely American story: an immigrant from China, she and her family received food stamps and were at times homeless despite her parents working multiple jobs. That child went on to attend college at thirteen, become a Rhodes scholar, and turn to public health as the way to make a difference in the country that had offered her such possibilities. Ultimately, she insists, it is public health that ensures citizens are not robbed of decades of life, and that where children live does not determine whether they live.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=AfT4DwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Pattern Companion: Beading","description":"Beads on cross-stitched treasures; dripping from tassels, braids, and fringes; and elegantly woven with or without a loom: these patterns and pages present so many different ways to enjoy the lovely art of beading.

He takes as his point of departure Nietzsche's conception of the soul as a multiplicity of conflicting drives and personae, and focuses on the task Nietzsche allotted himself \\"to make a cosmos out of his chaotic inheritance.\\" This struggle to \\"become what you are\\" by way of a spiritual politics is demonstrated to be Nietzsche's foremost concern, which fused his philosophy with his life. The book offers a conversation with Nietzsche rather than a consideration of the secondary literature, yet it takes to task many prevalent approaches to his work, and contests especially the way we often restrict our encounter with him to conceptual analysis. All deconstructionist attempts to portray him as solely concerned with the destruction of the subject and the dispersion of the self, rather than its unification, are called into question. Often portrayed as the champion of nihilism, Nietzsche here emerges as a thinker who saw his primary task as the overcoming of nihilism through the heroic struggle of individuation.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=YkT_DwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Sheikh's Revenge (Harlequin Presents, 1604)","description":"Dark Forces by Sara Wood released on Sep 24, 1993 is available now for purchase.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ariF344DpN0C&dq=Sheikh%27s+Revenge+(Harlequin+Presents,+1604)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Camera in the Dales (Writers Club Press)","description":"When he gave up smoking in the 'fifties, John Moore was able to buy a camera with the money he saved.

My brother, J. Rosamond Johnson, and I decided to write a song to be sung at the exercise. I wrote the words and he wrote the music. Our New York publisher, Edward B. Marks, made mimeographed copies for us and the song was taught to and sung by a chorus of five hundred colored school children. \\"Shortly afterwards my brother and I moved from Jacksonville to New York, and the song passed out of our minds. But the school children of Jacksonville kept singing it, they went off to other schools and sang it, they became teachers and taught it to other children. Within twenty years it was being sung over the South and in some other parts of the country. Today, the song, popularly known as the Negro National Hymn, is quite generally used. \\"The lines of this song repay me in elation, almost of exquisite anguish, whenever I hear them sung by Negro children.\\"  James Weldon Johnson, 1935 Pasted into Bibles, schoolbooks, and hearts, \\"Lift Every Voice and Sing,\\" written by J. Rosamond Johnson and James Weldon Johnson in 1900, has become one of the most beloved songs in the African American community taught for years in schools, churches, and civic organizations. Adopted by the NAACP as its official song in the 1920s and sung throughout the civil rights movement, it is still heard today at gatherings across America. James Weldon Johnson's lyrics pay homage to a history of struggle but never waver from a sense of optimism for the future \\"facing the rising sun of our new day begun, let us march on till victory is won.\\" Its message of hope and strength has made \\"Lift Every Voice and Sing\\" a source of inspiration for generations. In celebration of the song's centennial, Julian Bond and Sondra Kathryn Wilson have collected one hundred essays by artists, educators, politicians, and activists reflecting on their personal experiences with the song. Also featuring photos from historical archives, Lift Every Voice and Sing is a moving illustration of the African American experience in the past century. With contributors including John Hope Franklin, Jesse Jackson, Maya Angelou, Norman Lear, Maxine Waters, and Percy Sutton, this volume is a personal tribute to the enduring power of an anthem. \\"Lift Every Voice and Sing\\" has touched the hearts of many who have heard it because its true aim, as Harry Belafonte explains, \\"isn't just to show life as it is but to show life as it should be.\\"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=YvVJrPaq3lgC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Building a New Millennium: Architecture Today and Tomorrow (Specials) (German Edition)","description":"James Wines is a larger-than-life character whose work cuts a swathe through modern architecture.

One that has power with The Lord God Almighty to heal the sick, cause the lame to walk, raise the dead, and lift poverty stricken people to prosperity Well, the answer may well be in one fact which is \\"TRUTH\\". There are many things that are called true. If someone said that the sky was blue, that would be true. But that is not \\"The Truth\\" that has caused apostles, prophets, and other preachers of righteousness to suffer persecution, imprisonment and death throughout the ages. The truth that I refer to causes people to have to see everything God's way. But as the human race grows worse and worse, the truth is the more unwelcome in every facet of today's society. God has ordained me a preacher of His truth to the world at this time. That calling has caused me to be hated as though I were an assassin. The real preaching of the gospel does not get the applauses as do smooth ear candy preaching, not even by most of today's church folk. They have resolved themselves to some denominational preaching that soothes them in their sins. And when Truth enters their arenas it goes against all that they have set before themselves, that is when the fireworks get started. It is self-righteous demons that cause men and women to fight against the truth. Some of the demons cause people to think that they are right because they are rich or because they are grown. Others have demons that cause them to believe that all that they will ever need is within themselves. But I have a mandate from the Lord to speak Truth to America and the world so that some will be saved in this life, and have eternal life in the world to come. While others will stand before the judgment seat of Christ and of God without excuse.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=_LO8wAEACAAJ&dq=Tell%27em+Anything:+Facing+the+Corporate+Idiot!&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Quickening of America: Rebuilding Our Nation, Remaking Our Lives","description":"Examines grassroots movements in America, showing how they are making a difference in the workplace, communities, and schools, and provides practical advice on how individuals can become involved","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=j1fuAAAAMAAJ&dq=The+Quickening+of+America:+Rebuilding+Our+Nation,+Remaking+Our+Lives&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Bits of travel at home","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=32SroAEACAAJ&dq=Bits+of+travel+at+home&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Remasculinization of Korean Cinema (Asia-Pacific: Culture, Politics, and Society)","description":"In one of the first English-language studies of Korean cinema to date, Kyung Hyun Kim shows how the New Korean Cinema of the past quarter century has used the trope of masculinity to mirror the profound sociopolitical changes in the country. Since 1980, South Korea has transformed from an insular, authoritarian culture into a democratic and cosmopolitan society. The transition has fueled anxiety about male identity, and amid this tension, empowerment has been imagined as remasculinization. Kim argues that the brutality and violence ubiquitous in many Korean films is symptomatic of Korea s on-going quest for modernity and a post-authoritarian identity. Kim offers in-depth examinations of more than a dozen of the most representative films produced in Korea since 1980. In the process, he draws on the theories of Jacques Lacan, Slavoj Zizek, Gilles Deleuze, Rey Chow, and Kaja Silverman to follow the historical trajectory of screen representations of Korean men from self-loathing beings who desire to be controlled to subjects who are not only self-sufficient but also capable of destroying others. He discusses a range of movies from art-house films including To the Starry Island (1993) and The Day a Pig Fell into the Well (1996) to higher-grossing, popular films like Whale Hunting (1984) and Shiri (1999). He considers the work of several Korean auteurs Park Kwang-su, Jang Sun-woo, and Hong Sang-su. Kim argues that Korean cinema must begin to imagine gender relations that defy the contradictions of sexual repression in order to move beyond such binary struggles as those between the traditional and the modern, or the traumatic and the post-traumatic.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=_H7PXzAw3kEC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe","description":"C.

Then he meets his potential father-in-law, who turns out to be an ex-cop with a screw loose and a penchant for bean dip. To top it off, he returns home to find his successful clothing shop has just burned to the ground and taken his upstairs apartment with it. Love & Fashion was Nick Fashon and Vince Love's thriving clothing store until it went up in flames -- the work of an arsonist, police say. Suddenly Nick is homeless and disillusioned, and both the insurance investigators and the police want a word with him. Where can he turn for help? He's wearing out his welcome with his archaeologist girlfriend, Gretchen, who's developing her own suspicions about him. His business partner and best friend, Vince, isn't much help either, as Nick discovers more and more disturbing clues that point to Vince as the one who set the blaze. Things begin to look up when Nick finds out his eccentric late grandfather has left him an unusual inheritance: a thriving pet-coffin business and a barn full of peculiar inventions, including one particularly interesting doohickey called the HandyMate. The HandyMate is the ultimate kitchen gadget -- a simple tool that can cut, core, chop, slice, and potentially transform the domestic world. Full of entrepreneurial zeal, Nick is determined to see one in every kitchen drawer in America. But Nick isn't the only one planning to strike it rich with the HandyMate. Yola Fuentes, Nick's grandfather's irresistibly sexy business partner, is so determined to get the HandyMate that she makes Nick an offer he can't refuse. And Robo Fuentes, her jealous ex-husband, has a bullet with Nick's name on it if he takes her up on that offer. Nick quickly finds himself caught in a situation where a twisted thing of plastic might end up costing him his girlfriend, his self-respect -- and his life. With the help of a cast of colorful characters, master storyteller Pete Hautman delivers a stylish and funny mystery with more twists and turns than the HandyMate itself.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=2jdvJr0lps0C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Reason To Live : The True Story of One Woman's Love, Courage and Determination to Survive","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Successful gardening a-z of annuals, biennials, & bulbs (vol. 4)","description":"Discusses selection, planting, and care of hundreds of different plants for the garden","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=VNrXAQAACAAJ&dq=Successful+gardening+a-z+of+annuals,+biennials,&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Secrets For Exceptional Speaking","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=2PLuPQAACAAJ&dq=Secrets+For+Exceptional+Speaking&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Amateur Cracksman","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=8D8gAAAAMAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"When the tide turns;: The Netherlands' struggle against the water","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=FS2-GAAACAAJ&dq=When+the+tide+turns%3B:+The+Netherlands%27+struggle+against+the+water&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Berkeley (Past Masters)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=HwltQgAACAAJ&dq=Berkeley+(Past+Masters)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Helping Your Grandchildren Through Their Parents' Divorce","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=98A2OQAACAAJ&dq=Helping+Your+Grandchildren+Through+Their+Parents%27+Divorce&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Robbins Pathologic Basis of Disease, 6e (Robbins Pathology)","description":"Now in full colour, the new edition of this classic continues to be the most current, comprehensive and practical reference on pathology.

It examines the impact of the revolution on society as a whole on different classes, ethnic groups, the army, men and women, youth. Its central concern is to understand how one structure of domination was replaced by another. The book registers the primacy of politics, but situates political developments firmly in the context of massive economic, social, and cultural change. Since the fall of Communism there has been much reflection on the significance of the Russian Revolution. The book rejects the currently influential, liberal interpretation of the revolution in favour of one that sees it as rooted in the contradictions of a backward society which sought modernization and enlightenment and ended in political tyranny.

In subtle and sensitive language eminently suited to the style and substance of Merleau-Ponty's own writings, Mauro Carbone fashions four essays around a central theme-the relations of the sensible and the intelligible, and of philosophy and non-philosophy-that occupied Merleau-Ponty in his later work. An original and innovative interpretation of the ontology of Merleau-Ponty--and themselves a significant contribution to the field of Continental thought--these essays constitute a sustained exploration of what Merleau-Ponty detected, and greeted, as a \\"mutation within the relations of man and Being,\\" which would provide him with the basis for a new idea of philosophy or \\"a-philosophy.\\" In lucid, often elegant terms, Carbone analyzes key elements of Merleau-Ponty's thought in relation to Proust's Recherche, Hegel's Phenomenology of Spirit, the new biology of Von Uexk ll, Rimbaud's Lettre du voyant, and Heidegger's conception of \\"letting-be.\\" His work clearly demonstrates the vitality of Merleau-Ponty's late revolutionary philosophy by following its most salient, previously unexplored paths. This is essential reading for any scholar with an interest in Merleau-Ponty, in the questions of embodiment, temporality and Nature, or in the possibility of philosophy today.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ZyHis20e16IC&dq=Thinking+of+the+Sensible:+Merleau-Ponty%27s+A-Philosophy.&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The fairies (Enoch Pratt Free Library Poetry Broadsides)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=XLZTHAAACAAJ&dq=The+fairies+(Enoch+Pratt+Free+Library+Poetry+Broadsides)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Twenty Poems","description":"Brilliant English translation of beloved poems by Pablo Neruda, who is the subject of the film Neruda starring Gael Garc a Bernal and directed by Pablo Larra n A Penguin Classics Deluxe Edition, with French flaps First published in 1924, Veinte poemas de amor y una canci n desesperada remains among Pablo Neruda s most popular work.

An essential expos  of our times a work that reveals the deep rot in our financial system . . . Everyone should read this book.  David Grann, author of Killers of the Flower Moon Steven A. Cohen changed Wall Street. He and his fellow pioneers of the hedge fund industry didn t lay railroads, build factories, or invent new technologies. Rather, they made their billions through financial speculation, by placing bets in the market that turned out to be right more often than not. Cohen was revered as one of the greatest traders who ever lived. But that image was shattered when his fund, SAC Capital, became the target of a seven-year government investigation. Prosecutors labeled SAC a  magnet for market cheaters  whose culture encouraged the relentless pursuit of  edge  and even  black edge,  which is inside information and the firm was ultimately indicted and pleaded guilty to charges related to a vast insider trading scheme. Cohen, himself, however, was never charged. Black Edge raises urgent and troubling questions about those who sit at the pinnacle of high finance and how they have reshaped the economy.

Born in 1899 to a family of sharecroppers in Stockbridge, Georgia, Martin Luther King, Sr., came of age under the looming threat of violence at the hands of white landowners. Growing up, he witnessed his family being crushed by the weight of poverty and racism, and escaped to Atlanta to answer the calling to become a preacher. Before engaging in acts of political dissent or preaching at Ebenezer Baptist Church, where he would remain for more than four decades, King, Sr., earned high school and college diplomas while working double shifts as a truck driver and he won the heart of his future wife, Alberta  Bunch  Williams. King, Sr., recalls the struggles and joys of his journey: the pain of leaving his parents and seven siblings on the family farm; the triumph of winning voting rights for blacks in Atlanta; and the feelings of fatherly pride and anxiety as he watched his son put his life in danger at the forefront of the civil rights movement. Originally published in 1980, Daddy King is an unexpected and poignant memoir.  There are two men I am supposed to hate. One is a white man, the other is black, and both are serving time for having committed murder. James Earl Ray is a prisoner in Tennessee, charged with killing my son. Marcus Chenault was institutionalized as deranged after shooting my wife to death. I don t hate either one. There is no time for that, and no reason, either.

The most successful companies are those who are able to reduce their time to market, to launch initiatives before their competitors, to respond very rapidly to opportunities in the marketplace or to change direction in response to a move by the competition or a change in circumstances. All of these business initiatives rely on support from Infor mation Technology (IT). For a business to launch a new product in three months time, the supporting IT processes must be available and working in that three month time frame. In this fast moving environment, late IT delivery is not acceptable and may pose a major risk to the business. The marketplace of 21 st century business measures timescales in months, whereas in the past, timescales of two to three years were more typical. Internet related and e business projects frequently require even tighter timescales, measured in days rather than months. This need for speed puts tremendous pressure on IT departments. Pressure does not just come from the need for speed. There is also an ever-increasing rate of change within business.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=UtepCAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Gettysburg Battlefield: The Definitive Illustrated History","description":"Gettysburg Battlefield is the definitive illustrated history of the largest and deadliest military campaign ever waged in the Western Hemisphere.

He points out that the steady moderation of criminal law has not effected a corresponding moderation in criminal ways or improved the conditions under which men must live. He decries the \\"pious sentiment\\" of those who maintain that criminals need to be rehabilitated. He concludes that the real issue is not whether the death penalty deters crime, but that in an imperfect universe, justice demands the death penalty.

The recent evolution of US airpower offers inspiring, if incomplete, evidence that the conduct of war can become more humane while remaining effective. Technology, adversaries, and the goals of armed conflict will continue to evolve, but the central challenge of humanizing war will endure.

In his seminal study Christianity as Mystical Fact he turned his esoteric genius to interpreting the Christ event as the turning point in the world's spiritual history--an incarnation whose significance he saw transcending all religions.\\" --Bishop Frederick H. Borsch, professor of New Testament and chair of Anglican Studies, Lutheran Theological Seminary, Philadelphia \\"As simultaneously mysticism and fact, Christianity is a breakthrough in the historical development of humanity for which the mysteries, with the results that they brought about, form a prior evolutionary stage.\\" --Rudolf Steiner During the fall and winter of 1901-1902, Steiner gave a series of lectures called \\"Christianity As Mystical Fact\\" to members of the Theosophical Society. The lectures were rewritten and issued as a book later that year. They mark a watershed in the development of Western esotericism. Steiner wrote of the idea behind his book: \\"The title Christianity As Mystical Fact was one I gave to this work eight years ago, when I gathered together the content of lectures given in 1902. It was meant to indicate the special approach adopted in the book. Its theme is not just the mystical side of Christianity in a historical presentation. It was meant to show, from the standpoint of a mystical awareness, how Christianity came into being. Behind this was the idea that spiritual happenings were factors in the emergence of Christianity, which could only be observed from such a point of view. It is for the book itself to demonstrate that, by \\"mystical,\\" I do not in any way imply a vague intuition rather than strict scientific argument. In many circles, mysticism is understood as just that, and therefore it is distinguished from the concerns of all 'genuine' science. \\"In this book, however, I use the term to mean a 'presentation of spiritual reality'--a reality accessible only to a knowledge drawn from the sources of spiritual life itself. Anyone who denies the possibility of such knowledge in principle will find its contents hard to comprehend; any reader who accepts the idea that mysticism may coexist with the clarity of the natural sciences, may acknowledge that the mystical aspect of Christianity must be described mystically.\\" This is a fundamental book, in Steiner's own development, in that of Western esotericism, and for our understanding of the Christ event. Readers will find the evolutionary development from the ancient Mysteries through the great Greek philosophers to the events portrayed in the Gospels. Included are an informative introduction and annotated notes by Andrew Welburn and an afterword by Michael Debus, a priest of the Christian Community, who summarizes the book and places it in context.

By May 1979, the island was cleared of all refugees by Jyoti Basu's Left Front government. Most of the refugees were sent back to the central India camps they came from, but there were many deaths: of diseases, malnutrition resulting from an economic blockade, as well as from violence unleashed by the police on the orders of the government. Some of the refugees who survived Marichjhapi say the number of those who lost their lives could be as high as 10,000, while the-then government officials maintain that there were less than ten victims.How does an entire island population disappear? How does one unearth the truth and the details of one of the worst atrocities of post-Independent India?

Conventional depictions of occupation and collaboration in World War II, of wartime resistance and post-war renewal, provided the familiar backdrop against which the chronicle of post-war Europe has mostly been told. Within these often ritualistic presentations, it was possible to conceal the fact that not only were the majority of people in Hitler's Europe not resistance fighters but millions actively co-operated with and many millions more rather easily accommodated to Nazi rule. Moreover, after the war, those who judged former collaborators were sometimes themselves former collaborators. Many people became innocent victims of retribution, while others--among them notorious war criminals--escaped punishment. Nonetheless, the process of retribution was not useless but rather a historically unique effort to purify the continent of the many sins Europeans had committed. This book sheds light on the collective amnesia that overtook European governments and peoples regarding their own responsibility for war crimes and crimes against humanity--an amnesia that has only recently begun to dissipate as a result of often painful searching across the continent. In inspiring essays, a group of internationally renowned scholars unravels the moral and political choices facing European governments in the war's aftermath: how to punish the guilty, how to decide who was guilty of what, how to convert often unspeakable and conflicted war experiences and memories into serviceable, even uplifting accounts of national history. In short, these scholars explore how the drama of the immediate past was (and was not) successfully \\"overcome.\\" Through their comparative and transnational emphasis, they also illuminate the division between eastern and western Europe, locating its origins both in the war and in post-war domestic and international affairs. Here, as in their discussion of collaborators' trials, the authors lay bare the roots of the many unresolved and painful memories clouding present-day Europe. Contributors are Brad Abrams, Martin Conway, Sarah Farmer, Luc Huyse, L szl  Karsai, Mark Mazower, and Peter Romijn, as well as the editors. Taken separately, their essays are significant contributions to the contemporary history of several European countries. Taken together, they represent an original and pathbreaking account of a formative moment in the shaping of Europe at the dawn of a new millennium.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=6H63q6hN3Z4C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Merry Widow : Complete Score for Piano and Voice in English","description":"Ever-popular masterpiece of light opera in the first affordable, complete score for piano and voice, reprinted directly from the first English translation (1907) published by Chappell & Co., London.

They are Team Alpha, an eclectic band of linguists, tribal experts, and elite warriors: the first Americans to operate inside Taliban territory. Their covert mission is to track down Al- Qaeda and stop the terrorists from infiltrating the United States again. First Casualty places you with Team Alpha as the CIA rides into battle on horseback alongside the warlord Abdul Rashid Dostum. In Washington, DC, few trust that the CIA men, the Green Berets, and the Americans  outnumbered Afghan allies can prevail before winter sets in. On the ground, Team Alpha is undeterred. The Taliban is routed but hatches a plot with Al-Qaeda to hit back. Hundreds of suicidal fighters, many hiding weapons, fake a surrender and are transported to Qala-i Jangi the  Fort of War.  Team Alpha s Mike Spann, an ex-Marine, and David Tyson, a polyglot former Central Asian studies academic, seize America s initial opportunity to extract intelligence from men trained by bin Laden among them a young Muslim convert from California. The prisoners revolt and one CIA officer falls the first casualty in America s longest war, which will last two decades. The other CIA man shoots dead the Al-Qaeda jihadists attacking his comrade. To survive, he must fight his way out against overwhelming odds. Award-winning author Toby Harnden gained unprecedented access to all living Team Alpha members and every level of the CIA. Superbly researched, First Casualty draws on extensive interviews, secret documents, and deep reporting inside Afghanistan. As gripping as any adventure novel, yet intimate and profoundly moving, it tells how America found a winning strategy only to abandon it. Harnden reveals that the lessons of early victory and the haunting foretelling it contained unreliable allies, ethnic rivalries, suicide attacks, and errant US bombs were ignored, tragically fueling a twenty-year conflict. \\"Masterful, complex, and heartfelt, from the deeply personal to the critically strategic. Captures many lessons on many levels.\\"  Ambassador Hank Crumpton, former senior CIA officer","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=jvAREAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Teach Your Tot to Sign: The Parents' Guide to American Sign Language","description":"This pocket-size guide provides parents and teachers the opportunity to teach more than 500 basic American Sign Language (ASL) signs to their infants, toddlers, and young children.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=qiMcnwEACAAJ&dq=Teach+Your+Tot+to+Sign:+The+Parents%27+Guide+to+American+Sign+Language&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Introduction to N Scale Model Railroading (Level 1)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=hkifMwEACAAJ&dq=Introduction+to+N+Scale+Model+Railroading+(Level+1)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Awakening: Complete, Authoritative Text With Biographical and Historical Contexts, Critical History, and Essays from Five Contemporary Critical ...

It began with the bombing of Saddam Hussein's bunker and ended with statues of the Iraqi dictator being toppled in downtown Baghdad, and it marked a turning point in America's relations with its enemies, its allies, and its sense of itself. Yet most Americans experienced the war as impressionistic and often confusing the story of one battle here, one unit there, a report from one city, then another, without the larger context we so urgently needed. Each reporter had his \\"slice\\" of the war, it seemed, but no one had the whole story or the broad view. A Time of Our Choosing fills that gap brilliantly, drawing on the unparalleled resources and reportage of The New York Times. Todd S. Purdum, one of the paper's most gifted storytellers, traces the war in Iraq from the first rumblings after 9/11, to the diplomatic recriminations at the United Nations, to the battles themselves and their aftermath. He deftly rolls out the whole canvas before our eyes, showing how the individual \\"slices\\" fit together into a single, gripping drama. Purdum also explores the complex legacy of America's near-unilateral action. Since the 9/11 attacks, President George W. Bush has vowed that the United States would confront its enemies \\"at a time of our choosing,\\" and Purdum shows in vivid terms what this choice has meant for our now transformed world.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=cz2uAgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Hayy Ibn Yaqzan","description":"The Arabic philosophical fable Hayy Ibn Yaqzan is a classic of medieval Islamic philosophy.

It deals not only with Britain and the United States but also with Australia, New Zealand, France, Germany, Russia, Austria-Hungary and the Scandinavian countries. The chapters trace the origins, development, and eventual collapse of these movements in relation to the changing social formations and political structures of Europe, America and Australasia in the era of bourgeois liberalism. The first part of the book discusses the origins of feminist movements and advances a model or  ideal type  description of their development. The second part then takes a number of case studies of individual feminist movements to illustrate the main varieties of organised feminism and the differences from country to country. The third part looks at socialist women s movements and includes a study of the Socialist Women s International. A final part touches on the reason for the eclipse of women s emancipation movements in the half-century following the end of the First World War, before a general conclusion pulls together some of the arguments advanced in earlier chapters and attempts a comparison between these feminist movements of 1840-1920 and the Women s Liberation Movement.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=o5Ka4cNVEyAC&dq=The+Feminists&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Legend of Snowshoe Thompson : Mailcarrier on Skis","description":"John A. Thompson was born Norway in 1827. His family emigrated to the U.S. just ten years later and by 1851 John was a young man, ready to try his luck in the gold fields of California. While he undoubtedly brought enthusiasm and determination with him to his new home, he also brought with him something the people of that region had never seen before: skis! Unfamiliar with the long thin strips of wood he strapped to his feet, people called them \\"snow-shoes\\" and Thompson acquired a nickname. Of the many interests he pursued in the years that followed-as a farmer, rancher, guide, trader, Indian agent and politician-the thing Thompson is remembered most for was his service as a dependable mail carrier, who made record time traversing the Sierra Nevada on those \\"snow-shoes,\\" carrying the winter mail and keeping the lines of communication open for those who lived in the region. This is his story. Frank Tortorich captures the fortitude and stamina of this legendary Norwegian American whose strength and perseverance serve as a role model for today's youth.\\"Snowshoe\\" and the historic town of Genoa are grateful!-Sue Knight, Friends of Snowshoe Thompson The author's knowledge and understanding of the Sierra emigration era serves as a background for what he has been able to express in this book.

Smith reviews the key issues involved in the twentieth-century critiques of traditional views of human knowledge and scientific truth and gives an extensively informed explanation of the alternative accounts developed by Fleck, Kuhn, Foucault, Latour, and others. She also addresses the various anxieties (e.g., over 'relativism') and 'wars' occasioned by these developments, placing them in their historical contexts and arguing that they are largely misplaced or spurious. Smith then examines the currently perplexed relations between the natural and human sciences, the grandiose claims and dubious methods of evolutionary psychology, and the complex play of naturalist, humanist, and posthumanist ideologies in contemporary views of the relation between humans and animals.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=hcyqBgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Dear Impostor (Sinclair Family Saga)","description":"In order to gain control of her inheritance from her greedy uncle, Psyche Hill invents an aristocratic fiancT and hires an actor to bring him to life, only to end up with gambler Gabriel Sincliar, an imposter in desperate need of a place to hide out from thugs.

It proposed whole language, collaborative learning, active learning, writing workshops, the process approach, student empowerment, portfolio assessment, and the substitution of children's literature for basal readers many years before these cornerstones of enlightened English language arts teaching became fashionable. The book is the centerpiece of life work devoted to curricular innovation and constitutes a truly original approach to the nature of discourse. It is cross-referenced to an equally original collection of anthologies that illustrate with both professional and student writing the reading, writing, talking, dramatizing repertories it stakes out--and to Moffett's other works that build on and extend this one. From the second edition on, the book has profited from the input of Betty Jane Wagner, a master teacher of teachers. Student-centered Language Art, K-12 is arguably the most comprehensive, practically detailed, and original textbook/resource book on English education. It covers theory and practice, elementary and secondary, drama, oral-language activities, and initial literacy as well as general reading and writing. Furthermore, verbal learning is placed in a social context and in the context of nonverbal media and arts that compete with and complement language. The authors have made this edition more compact by shifting some material to a new edition of Active Voice and by abridging matters that no longer need to bedealt with at length because the profession is catching up with the book. They have recast some matters to tie in with current vocabulary and understanding, and some practices have been updated to utilize current technology. In this fourth edition, the book is shorter in length but broader in perspective as it continues to break new ground to integrate language arts with other learning.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=DwwmAQAAIAAJ&dq=Student-Centered+Language+Arts,+K-12&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Art of the Trade; Mastering the Analytic and Intuitive Elements of Successful Trading","description":"Provides information on developing a money management and trading system that integrates the analytic and intuitive aspects of the reader's personality","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=yXyLQgAACAAJ&dq=The+Art+of+the+Trade%3B+Mastering+the+Analytic+and+Intuitive+Elements+of+Successful+Trading&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Queen of Beans","description":"Excellent, healthy bean recipes that are easy to make and that have no sugar, sweeteners, or other questionable ingredients.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=HhQFQgAACAAJ&dq=Queen+of+Beans&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Joshua: The Journey Home : Joshua, Joshua and the Children, Joshua in the Holy Land","description":"These three spiritual parables (\\"Joshua, Joshua and the Children\\" and \\"Joshua in the Holy Land\\") energized millions of readers with a contemporary understanding of the Christian gospel.

It began at a time before radios were found in most American homes, and before the advent of \\"talking pictures.\\" His interest in science was born at an early age, sparked by his mother, as she introduced him to the stars in a dark Utah sky. Early experiences and training were much the same as for any other boy at the time. But with the beginning of war in Europe, and the U.S. response by instituting universal conscription (the draft), he realized the importance of education in fulfilling his military obligation, and enlisted in a Navy training program. Navy service took him to Chicago and Southern California, and eventually to little-known Peleliu Island in the Western Pacific, a foretaste of a life of frequent travel to follow. World War II was followed all too soon by the retreat of the Soviet Union behind an \\"Iron Curtain\\" of secrecy, a massive buildup of conventional forces and armed occupation of neighboring countries. It became essential to know when they succeeded in building the atomic bomb. This book is a first-hand account in non-technical terms of some of the ways in which this was accomplished. This was followed by attempts to ban the bomb, or at least to ban nuclear testing. The author was fortunate to be near the center of U.S. efforts in many of these attempts, and the book describes important activities and events that ultimately led to achieving the lesser of these goals.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=JiejKDqM9S8C&dq=House+Calls:+Recollections+of+a+Family+Physician&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Designing Sociable Robots","description":"Cynthia Breazeal here presents her vision of the sociable robot of the future, a synthetic creature and not merely a sophisticated tool. A sociable robot will be able to understand us, to communicate and interact with us, to learn from us and grow with us. It will be socially intelligent in a humanlike way. Eventually sociable robots will assist us in our daily lives, as collaborators and companions. Because the most successful sociable robots will share our social characteristics, the effort to make sociable robots is also a means for exploring human social intelligence and even what it means to be human. Breazeal defines the key components of social intelligence for these machines and offers a framework and set of design issues for their realization. Much of the book focuses on a nascent sociable robot she designed named Kismet. Breazeal offers a concrete implementation for Kismet, incorporating insights from the scientific study of animals and people, as well as from artistic disciplines such as classical animation. This blending of science, engineering, and art creates a lifelike quality that encourages people to treat Kismet as a social creature rather than just a machine.

Better known as Connie Mack, he cut a dashing figure clad in a business suit and straw skimmer. With an even-tempered manner, \\"Mr. Mack\\" was regarded as a unique combination of coach and father figure by his players who included such all-time greats as Ty Cobb, Lefty Grove, and Chief Bender. This engaging autobiography, written with his characteristic warmth and enthusiasm, reads like a history of baseball during the first half of the twentieth century. Enhanced by seventy photos, Mack walks us through his amazing life and the highlights of his legendary career. He holds the records for most wins and losses by a manager, he won nine American League pennants, brought the A's to eight World Series and won five of them. Plus, there has never been another man who has managed one sports team for fifty years.

The Life of Jesus Christ: Understanding the Story of the Gospels aims to change that experience. Author Russell Shaw weaves together the events of Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John's narratives in chronological order to capture a true and rounded picture of Jesus  life. The Life of Jesus Christ is the scriptural companion you've been searching for. Together, the four Gospels reveal Jesus Christ, God Incarnate, as a man of complexity and depth   compassionate but stern, who knew how to laugh and how to cry, a charismatic leader uninterested in worldly power, a subtle thinker who drew sublime messages from ordinary life. With Shaw guiding you, you'll truly get to know the Son of God in a new way. ABOUT THE AUTHOR Russell Shaw is an author and journalist who has written more than twenty books. For eighteen years, he was secretary for public affairs for the National Conference of Catholic Bishops/United States Catholic Conference.

Arguing that the history of walking includes walking for pleasure as well as for political, aesthetic, and social meaning, Solnit focuses on the walkers whose everyday and extreme acts have shaped our culture, from philosophers to poets to mountaineers. She profiles some of the most significant walkers in history and fiction--from Wordsworth to Gary Snyder, from Jane Austen's Elizabeth Bennet to Andre Breton's Nadja--finding a profound relationship between walking and thinking and walking and culture. Solnit argues for the necessity of preserving the time and space in which to walk in our ever more car-dependent and accelerated world.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=g1jIkcOH18gC&dq=Wanderlust&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Gospel According to St. Mark (Black's New Testament Commentary)","description":"St Mark's Gospel is among the earliest records about Jesus of Nazareth.

In his first novel, the author presents his readers with their first introduction to what would become Berry s life s work, chronicling through fiction a place where the inhabitants of Port William form what is more than community, but rather a  membership  in interrelatedness, a spiritual community, united by duty and bonds of affection for one another and for the land upon which they make their livelihood. When young Nathan loses his grandfather, Berry guides readers through the process of Nathan's grief, endearing the reader to the simple humanity through which Nathan views the world. Echoing Berry's own strongly held beliefs, Nathan tells us that his grandfather's life  couldn't be divided from the days he'd spent at work in his fields.  Berry has long been compared to Faulkner for his ability to erect entire communities in his fiction, and his heart and soul have always lived in Port William, Kentucky. In this eloquent novel about duty, community, and a sweeping love of the land, Berry gives readers a classic book that takes them to that storied place.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=-toREAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"GREAT LION OF GOD","description":"Repeat.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=QeQ_tAEACAAJ&dq=GREAT+LION+OF+GOD&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Penguin Book of French Poetry: 1820-1950; With Prose Translations (Penguin Classics)","description":"The period 1820-1950 is particularly rich for students and lovers of poetry.

On February 2, 2002 McClelland & Stewart Ltd., together with the Government of Canada and exclusive sponsor Alliance Atlantis, offers this book to people on both sides of the border. This is a superbly designed, full-colour coffee-table book containing brilliant photographs of the events immediately following the appalling terrorist strikes and a selection of emotion-laden letters, articles, and messages reflecting the heartfelt responses of Canadians from Vancouver to St. John s. The book is organized as a day-by-day chronicle. It shows in words and pictures what happened when hundreds of commercial airliners were unexpectedly grounded, stranding tens of thousands of people far from their homes. It shows the memorial services that were held everywhere, particularly on Parliament Hill in Ottawa, where 100,000 people gathered. It shows the steps that Canadians took, both as individuals (for example, by assisting in the work at Ground Zero), and as a nation (by mobilizing our armed forces). It has been remarked that the events of September 11 have had a positive effect by bringing out the best in people. Nowhere is this more evident than in the manifest demonstrations of friendship between Canadians and Americans since that consequential day. This superb volume is both a memorial to those lost and a celebration of the spirit shared by the survivors on both sides of the border.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=nEnoAAAAIAAJ&dq=A+Diary+Between+Friends&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Devil's Bargain (Silhouette Bombshell)","description":"Jazz Callender   don't ever call her Jasmine   is an ex-cop with a goal: opening her own private detective agency and proving her former partner is innocent of murder.

This book is written in tribute to the pioneering work of Henry Nelson Wieman, 1884-1975. Dr. Wieman was one of the greatest philosophers produced in America. In Man's Ultimate Commitment he wrote profoundly about his Philosophy of Creativity. This book is a humble attempt to re-state the essential concepts of Wieman's thinking in a manner easily understood and applied in our time. We are in a time when we need to hear Dr. Wieman's work. His ideas may help answer the question \\"what will be the ruling aim of my existence?\\" Special effort is made to show the practical application of Wieman's writing to the many interpersonal troubles pervasive in our modern organizations and institutions. This is a book about bringing integrity and humility, creativity and appreciation, and trust and boundless growth to our relationships, the companies within which we work and the communities in which we live. The authors offer a new \\"experiential communication model\\" and describe the behaviors and outcomes that may result from opposing motivations: hurt-based and worth-based. This is an excellent \\"field guide\\" for developing healthy relationships both at home and at work. Several companies have been using the principles from The Greatest Good to build healthy teams and ethics-centered work cultures.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=VZ1engEACAAJ&dq=The+Greatest+Good:+Rethinking+the+role+of+relationships+in+the+moral+fiber+of+our+companies+and+our+communities&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Brave Men's Blood: The Epic of the Zulu War, 1879","description":"Using accurate contemporary sketches and engravings, 'Brave Men's Blood' is a comprehensive account of the 1879 Anglo-Zulu War.

In 1998, West Point made an unprecedented offer to Rolling Stone writer David Lipsky: Stay at the Academy as long as you like, go wherever you wish, talk to whomever you want, to discover why some of America s most promising young people sacrifice so much to become cadets. Lipsky followed one cadet class into mess halls, barracks, classrooms, bars, and training exercises, from arrival through graduation. By telling their stories, he also examines the Academy as a reflection of our society: Are its principles of equality, patriotism, and honor quaint anachronisms or is it still, as Theodore Roosevelt called it, the most  absolutely American  institution? During an eventful four years in West Point s history, Lipsky witnesses the arrival of TVs and phones in dorm rooms, the end of hazing, and innumerable other shifts in policy and practice. He uncovers previously unreported scandals and poignantly evokes the aftermath of September 11, when cadets must prepare to become officers in wartime. Lipsky also meets some extraordinary people: a former Eagle Scout who struggles with every facet of the program, from classwork to marching; a foul-mouthed party animal who hates the military and came to West Point to play football; a farm-raised kid who seems to be the perfect soldier, despite his affection for the early work of Georgia O Keeffe; and an exquisitely turned-out female cadet who aspires to  a career in hair and nails  after the Army. The result is, in the words of David Brooks in the New York Times Book Review,  a superb description of modern military culture, and one of the most gripping accounts of university life I have read. . . . How teenagers get turned into leaders is not a simple story, but it is wonderfully told in this book.

Death comes easy to no one...especially to those who are left behind. In 1999, I lost my husband to cancer. I was 47 at the time, and it took awhile to sort through my emotions and gather the strength to face daily living again. A year and a half into widowhood, I realized how alone I felt going through all those first experiences: taking off my wedding rings, figuring out which side of the bed to sleep on, and getting through our anniversary. I then launched a Web site that generated feedback from other widows and widowers - so they could share their stories and experiences with grief and loss. The response was overwhelming. From Singapore to England to South Australia, I gathered and organized my Web site's library of material into a book that pays tribute to the millions of people who lose a partner and have to reinvent their lives and try to move forward. The After Journey is a collection of people's thoughts and words of wisdom based on their experiences after suffering a great loss in their lives. Each section begins with my own story and leads into the reflections of others on the same topic, some of those voices drawing tears from readers, while others conjuring sheer laughter and a sense of relief. The book is simply a friend that can hold our hand when getting through the first year alone. It proves that you're not alone in this very personal journey, and that you have every right to do it your own way - embracing every step as one movement closer to finding joy again in life.

Dix, who was a ranch boy with no formal education but whose father and uncle were successful writers, became the town's unofficial historian. Edited and introduced by award-winning poet and nature writer Peter Wild, this is Dix Van Dyke's account of how the twentieth century arrived in a California frontier town. Located a hundred miles outside Los Angeles and just east of Barstow, in the Mojave Desert, Daggett attracted a rich assortment of settlers lured by the wealth of nearby silver mines or the promise of cheap farmland conjured up by dubious irrigation schemes. With wit, humor, and a writer's eye for telling details, Dix describes the delicate beauty of the desert and the human hopes that often ended in folly there. Dix also reveals the Van Dyke ranch as an unlikely crossroads for intellectuals, some of them famous. Conservationist John Muir's visits included one memorable argument with Dix's Uncle John. Muir admirers may be surprised at the tangle of family relationships begun when Muir's daughter Helen married Daggett resident Buel Funk - a story never told in print before.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=sOl5AAAAMAAJ&dq=Daggett:+Life+in+a+Mojave+Frontier+Town+(Creating+the+North+American+Landscape)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Estimator's Electrical Man-Hour Manual, Third Edition (Estimator's Man-Hour Library)","description":"Makes accurate, reliable man-hour estimates for electrical installation.

When the lines you thought existed simply vanish? How do you plant your feet to make a stand when you no longer know what side you re on? The war has come home. For over forty years, Art Keller has been on the front lines of America s longest conflict: The War on Drugs. His obsession to defeat the world s most powerful, wealthy, and lethal kingpin?the godfather of the Sinaloa Cartel, Ad n Barrera?has left him bloody and scarred, cost him the people he loves, even taken a piece of his soul. Now Keller is elevated to the highest ranks of the DEA, only to find that in destroying one monster he has created thirty more that are wreaking even more chaos and suffering in his beloved Mexico. But not just there. Barrera s final legacy is the heroin epidemic scourging America.

In some of those situations, for a variety of reasons, including coercion, poverty, or the seductive nature of violence, children become killers before they are able to grasp the fundamentals of morality. It has been only in the past ten years that this component of warfare has captured the attention of the world. Images of boys carrying guns and ammunition are now commonplace as they flash across television screens and appear on the front pages of newspapers. Less often, but equally disturbingly, stories of girls pressed into the service of militias surface in the media. A major concern today is how to reverse the damage done to the thousands of children who have become not only victims but also agents of wartime atrocities. In Child Soldiers in Africa, Alcinda Honwana draws on her firsthand experience with children of Angola and Mozambique, as well as her study of the phenomenon for the United Nations and the Social Science Research Council, to shed light on how children are recruited, what they encounter, and how they come to terms with what they have done.

The entries, one per page or spread, are chosen for their depth of feeling, beauty of expression, spiritual intensity, and sense of the universal. The book is organized into broad categories of praise, entreaty, contemplation, mourning, and grace; and two indexes one by authorship, and the other by topic make it immediately accessible.

Despite the worldwide attention the atrocities received at the time, the massacre has not remained a part of the world's historical consciousness. The parallels between the Jewish and Armenian situations and the reactions of the Jewish community in Palestine (the Yishuv) to the Armenian genocide, which was muted and largely self-interested, are explored by Yair Auron. In attempting to assess and interpret these disparate reactions, Auron maintains a fairminded balance in assessing claims of altruism and self-interest, expressed in universal, not merely Jewish, terms. While not denying the uniqueness of the Holocaust, Auron carefully distinguishes it from the Armenian genocide reviewing existing theories and relating Armenian and Jewish experience to ongoing issues of politics and identity. As a groundbreaking work of comparative history, this volume will be read by Armenian area specialists, historians of Zionism and Israel, and students of genocide. Yair Auron is senior lecturer at The Open University of Israel and the Kibbutzim College of Education. He is the author, in Hebrew, of Jewish-Israeli Identity, Sensitivity to World Suffering: Genocide in the Twentieth Century, We Are All German Jews, and Jewish Radicals in France during the Sixties and Seventies (published in French as well)","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=BasttAEACAAJ&dq=The+Banality+of+Indifference+(Zionism+and+the+Armenian+Genocide)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Practice in Christianity : Kierkegaard's Writings, Vol 20","description":"Of the many works he wrote during 1848, his \\"richest and most fruitful year,\\" Kierkegaard specified Practice in Christianity as \\"the most perfect and truest thing.\\" In his reflections on such topics as Christ's invitation to the burdened, the imitatio Christi, the possibility of offense, and the exalted Christ, he takes as his theme the requirement of Christian ideality in the context of divine grace. Addressing clergy and laity alike, Kierkegaard asserts the need for institutional and personal admission of the accommodation of Christianity to the culture and to the individual misuse of grace. As a corrective defense, the book is an attempt to find, ideally, a basis for the established order, which would involve the order's ability to acknowledge the Christian requirement, confess its own distance from it, and resort to grace for support in its continued existence. At the same time the book can be read as the beginning of Kierkegaard's attack on Christendom. Because of the high ideality of the contents and in order to prevent the misunderstanding that he himself represented that ideality, Kierkegaard writes under a new pseudonym, Anti-Climacus.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=9BdnzMOcoaAC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A New Land Beckoned: German Immigration to Texas, 1844-1847","description":"German Immigration to Texas, 1844-1847.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=1G0hq9kbsaYC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Martian odyssey (Lancer science fiction library)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=XzoIAQAAIAAJ&dq=A+Martian+odyssey+(Lancer+science+fiction+library)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Sailor Jerry Tattoo Flash, Vol. 1","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=htmMKQAACAAJ&dq=Sailor+Jerry+Tattoo+Flash,+Vol.+1&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Holiday Party Ideas For Kids","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=NIPAAAAACAAJ&dq=Holiday+Party+Ideas+For+Kids&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Mourt's Relation: A Journal of the Pilgrims at Plymouth","description":"Presents an account, first published in 1622, of the Pilgrim's journey to the new world.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=OEzGCrVmUssC&dq=Mourt%27s+Relation:+A+Journal+of+the+Pilgrims+at+Plymouth&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Remote Viewing: The Science and Theory of Nonphysical Perception","description":"Remote viewing is the mental ability to perceive and describe places, persons, or events at distant locations in the past, present, and future. This book describes the science and theory of the remote-viewing phenomenon. The reality of the remote-viewing phenomenon is not in dispute among a large body of respected researchers ? both inside and outside of academia ? who have published an extensive collection of high-quality investigations over the past few decades. But profound mysteries remain. This volume breaks new ground by resolving some of remote-viewing?s greatest enigmas. In these pages, new research and new theories explain why remote viewing works, and why it is scientifically possible. These investigations utilize remote-viewing methods that are derivative of those used for decades in well-documented U.S. government funded psi research sponsored by the Central Intelligence Agency (C.I.A.) and the Defense Intelligence Agency (D.I.A.). Filled with descriptions and analyses of highly original experiments, here is an investigation into the fascinating characteristics of time and physical reality using remote viewing as a tool of exploration, offering evidence that the past, present, and future truly exist simultaneously. The idea of differing future and past time lines is not just science fiction.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=d3Yz-GqNWhMC&dq=Remote+Viewing:+The+Science+and+Theory+of+Nonphysical+Perception&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Social sciences as sorcery","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=yPtwwgEACAAJ&dq=Social+sciences+as+sorcery&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Composition Made Easy (How to Paint&Draw; Series)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=fG--AAAACAAJ&dq=Composition+Made+Easy+(How+to+Paint&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The outlaws of medieval legend (Studies in social history)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Bl7QPAAACAAJ&dq=The+outlaws+of+medieval+legend+(Studies+in+social+history)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Path to Attainment, the","description":"\\"Attainment is the goal of the spiritual path.

What was the genius that enabled Lenin to create and sustain a revolution that constantly hovered on the brink of utter chaos? It was his incredible strength of will and personality, his fantastic organisational ability and complete dedication to the goal of revolution which enabled him to surmount domestic dissension and disorder, political rivalries, and economic ruin. It was his supreme ability to adapt, to change, to pursue any means to achieve his ends that enabled the revolution to survive.Louis Fischer's book is based on meticulous sifting of the Soviet sources.

Whereas the first and older one, FORTWIHR, the Bavarian Consortium for High Performance Scientific Com puting, had put its main emphasis on the supercomputing aspect, this new initiative was now expected to focus on the mathematical part. Consequently, throughout all of the five main research topics (A) adaptive materials and thin layers, (B) adaptive materials in medicine, (C) robotics, aeronautics, and automobile technology, (D) microstructured devices and systems, and (E) transport processes in flows, mathematical aspects play a predominant role. The formation of the SFB 438 and its scientific program are inextricably linked with the name of Karl-Heinz Hoffmann. As full professor for applied mathematics in Augsburg (1981-1991) and in Munchen (since 1992) and as dean of the faculty of mathematics at the TV Munchen, he was the driv ing force of this fascinating, but not always easy-to-realize idea of bringing together scientists from mathematics, physics, engineering, informatics, and medicine for joint efforts in modern applied mathematics.

He relied on her judgment on his writing, and readily admitted that she not only edited his work, but also edited his public persona.Until now, little has been known about Livy's crucial place in Twain's life. In Resa Willis's affecting and fascinating biography, we meet a dignified, optimistic women who married young, raised three sons and a daughter, endured myriad health problems and money woes and who faithfully traipsed all over the world with Twain--Africa, Europe, Asia--while battling his moodiness and her frailty.Twain adored her. A hard-drinking dreamer with an insatiable wanderlust, he needed someone to tame him. It was Livy who encouraged him to finish his autobiography even through the last stages of her illness. When she died in 1904, Twain's zest for life and writing was gone. He died six years later. A triumph of the biographer's art, Mark and Livy presents the fullest picture yet of one of the most influential women in American letters.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=FlJx9qSBcJMC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Sea Story","description":"Following the success of his #1 New York Times bestseller Make Your Bed, which has sold over one million copies, Admiral William H.

It was a work as well informed as Xavier Rynne's Letters from Vatican City and probably more influential. \\"No reporter knew more about the council,\\" said Michael Novak. \\"In the English-speaking world, at least, perhaps no source was to have quite the catalytic effect on opinion outside the council and even to an extent within it.\\" This is a different story. It is the tale of an intrepid reporter who is so intent on covering the Vatican beat better than anyone else that he doesn't notice that one of his best informants is playing around with his wife. When Kaiser blows the whistle on the man, a charming Irish Jesuit named Malachy Martin, Martin persuades Kaiser's clerical friends (including Archbishop T. D. Roberts and John Courtney Murray) to send him to a psychiatric clinic. The story is at once hilarious (Martin was one of the great clerical con men of all time) and sobering. The \\"clerical error\\" - the refusal to see what Martin was up to - was as much Kaiser's as that of his clerical friends, who defended their fellow priest simply because he was a member of the club. Their naivete and blindness simply mirror the church's inability to update the ancient institution called priesthood or to deal realistically with any issue touched by sex: birth control, remarriage after divorce, priestly celibacy, clerical child abuse, or the ordination of women.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=WKzlFLeNLLoC&dq=Clerical+Error:+A+True+Story+(Handbooks+of+Catholic+Theology)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Power in Movement: Social Movements and Contentious Politics (Cambridge Studies in Comparative Politics)","description":"Unlike political or economic institutions, social movements have an elusive power, but one that is no less real. From the French and American revolutions through the democratic and workers' movements of the nineteenth century to the totalitarian movements of today, movements exercise a fleeting but powerful influence on politics and society. This study surveys the history of the social movement, puts forward a theory of collective action to explain its surges and declines, and offers an interpretation of the power of movement that emphasises its effects on personal lives, policy reforms and political culture. While covering cultural, organisational and personal sources of movements' power, the book emphasises the rise and fall of social movements as part of political struggle and as the outcome of changes in political opportunity structure.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=1-VHOc4XpDAC&dq=Power+in+Movement:+Social+Movements+and+Contentious+Politics+(Cambridge+Studies+in+Comparative+Politics)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Charismatic Challenge: 4 Key Questions","description":"Charismatic Challenge is a biblical and reasonable demonstration, based on sound scholarship, that the sign and revelatory gifts are not for today.

Utterly lacking in rhetoric or dogma, this manual relies instead on bare fact, frank description, and a spare question-and-answer format. Hedges allows U.S. military documentation of the brutalizing physical and psychological consequences of combat to speak for itself. Hedges poses dozens of questions that young soldiers might ask about combat, and then answers them by quoting from medical and psychological studies. ? What are my chances of being wounded or killed if we go to war? ? What does it feel like to get shot? ? What do artillery shells do to you? ? What is the most painful way to get wounded? ? Will I be afraid? ? What could happen to me in a nuclear attack? ? What does it feel like to kill someone? ? Can I withstand torture? ? What are the long-term consequences of combat stress? ? What will happen to my body after I die? This profound and devastating portrayal of the horrors to which we subject our armed forces stands as a ringing indictment of the glorification of war and the concealment of its barbarity.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=tzIz61vqr38C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Christopher Marlowe; (The Mermaid series; the best plays of the old dramatists.

A century ago, soda fountains on almost every Main Street in America served as the heart of the community, where folks shared sundaes, sodas, ice cream floats, and the news of the day. A quintessentially American institution, the soda fountain still speaks of a bygone era of innocence and ease. When Brooklyn Farmacy & Soda Fountain opened its doors in 2010, it launched a revival of this great American original, capturing the hearts of a new generation. Featuring abundant full-color photography and vintage illustrations and advertisements, The Soda Fountain explores a rich history from the origins of seltzer in the nineteenth century, through the transformation of soda during Prohibition and the Depression years, right up to today s fountain renaissance. Featured recipes range from classics like the Purple Cow and Cherry Lime Rickey to contemporary innovations that have made Brooklyn Farmacy famous, like The Sundae of Broken Dreams (topped with caramel sauce and broken pretzel bits) and Makin  Whoopie! Sundae (with hot fudge and mini chocolate whoopie cakes). Recreating beloved treats like egg creams and milkshakes with local, seasonal, and artisanal ingredients, Gia Giasullo and Peter Freeman, the sibling cofounders of Brooklyn Farmacy & Soda Fountain, teach you how to resurrect the proud American soda fountain tradition at your own kitchen counter. With its fascinating anecdotes, mouth-watering pictures and easy-to-follow steps,this nostalgic cookbook proves that the soda fountain is a culinary and cultural institution that continues to delight.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=tdAPAgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Buckners of Virginia and the allied families of Strother and Ashby,","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=h0obAAAAYAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Famous Jerks of the Bible","description":"Profiles men and women of the Bible whose actions or behaviors had disastrous results and consequences, and offers readers the opportunity to look within themselves to correct similar flaws.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=WoDeJp1SEfwC&dq=Famous+Jerks+of+the+Bible&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Blackfly Season","description":"Red Bear stood close to the fire and stretched toward the sky, every muscle in his body straining. The veins in his neck stood out like electrical cords. His voice had gone thin and raspy and the words came streaming out of him with a terrible urgency. The words if in fact they were words  collided with one another. [Blackfly Season, page 94] According to Detective John Cardinal, the truly diabolical thing about blackflies is their stealthy silence; there is no warning and no chance of a pre-emptive strike. Every year at the beginning of May, the blackflies take over Algonquin Bay, swarming in clouds out of their winter wombs in the standing water of lakes, creeks and swamps. But this year, the blackflies aren t the only ones to make their way into town. A self-proclaimed shaman and card-carrying member of the Chippewa First Nations has also arrived. Known only as Red Bear, the mysterious figure has recruited three young men from town who share a history of drug use and living on the fringe. And Red Bear isn t the only mysterious visitor. At the World Tavern, the oldest but perhaps least reputable bar in the city of Algonquin Bay, OPP officer Jerry Commanda is enjoying his regular Friday night Diet Coke with a squeeze of lemon. He meets a young red-haired woman who is unable to tell him her name, where she lives, or how she came to be at the World Tavern. It s not until a hospital X-ray reveals a bullet lodged in her brain that the reason for her amnesia becomes clear. When John Cardinal and Lise Delorme are called in to take over the case from Commanda, they don t have a lot of leads on who this mysterious redhead is, let alone why someone would want her dead. And when the mutilated body of a member of the local biker gang the Viking Riders is discovered near long columns of bizarre hieroglyphics, Cardinal and Delorme begin to suspect that it is isn t just Viking Rider justice. Despite the climbing body count, Cardinal is distracted. His wife, Catherine, has left to go to Toronto with a group of her photography students and Cardinal is convinced that the stress and excitement of the trip will push her to the breaking point. His worst fears are confirmed when a call reaches him from a student concerned by Catherine s erratic behaviour. Cardinal speeds to Toronto to reach his wife before she unravels. When Cardinal returns, a third body turns up with a bullet from the same gun that shot the redhead. Linking the three murders and finding out who s responsible becomes an intricate game of unravelling the secrets of families and decoding the mysteries of an ancient form of African voodoo.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=dJ2fgNWyuJEC&dq=Blackfly+Season&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The swing (Enoch Pratt Free Library Poetry Broadsides)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Rc8cwgEACAAJ&dq=The+swing+(Enoch+Pratt+Free+Library+Poetry+Broadsides)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Hadrian Vii","description":"The titlular character of Hadrian the Seventhis inextricably entangled with his creator, Frederick Rolfe, the self-titled Baron Corvo. Both were Catholic converts and unsuccessful candidates for priesthood, who led bitter, misunderstood lives, betrayed (they thought) by friends, bishops and prelates. Both were at times struggling writers and failed inventors, their brilliance (they believed) insufficiently recognized, who lived alternately extravagantly and in squalor. Rolfe put all his obsessions, all his hate and suffering, his dreams and fantasies into George Arthur Rose, the outcast who through a bizarre sequence of events is elected Pope. Hadrian VII, the first English pontiff in five centuries, is a mass of contradictions- infallible and petulant, ascetic and corrupt, humble and despotic, he empties the Vatican's coffers to feed the poor and reshapes nations in a bid for world peace. With this blend of satire and self-knowledge which runs through the pages of this, his finest novel, Rolfe both vindicates and condemns himself. A new introduction by Richard Davenport-Hines untangles the many deceptions of this most autobiographical of fictions, and those which surround its author.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Fq57tAEACAAJ&dq=Hadrian+Vii&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Public Relations Ethics","description":"Providing a framework for understanding important ethical concerns in the field of public relations and corporate communications, this book helps the reader to clarify their own principles and values and acknowledges the ethical dilemmas inherent in public relations.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ARRDoLW641sC&dq=Public+Relations+Ethics&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Maze Golf","description":"Play new and exciting Maze Golf.

Had anyone told Ben Malcolmson that he'd someday be a wide receiver on the national champion USC football team--after not playing football since an unfortunate fifth-grade Pop Warner experience--he would have called them crazy. As a reporter for The Daily Trojan, in the spirit of George Plimpton, he participated in walk-on tryouts for the team and was dumbfounded to find himself listed on the roster. His position on the team never amounted to much in a game-time contribution, but Ben felt strongly that his faith was inextricably linked to his purpose. He felt called to anonymously place Bibles in each USC teammate locker on Christmas Eve--to resounding indifference and rejection from his friends. It wasn't until three years later, when his role at USC had led to a role with Coach Pete Carroll at the Seahawks organization, that an old friend connected with Ben and told him that one of the Bibles had captivated the heart of a teammate in the three days before his death. With a humble spirit dedicated to consistent acts of discipleship, Ben Malcolmson is an authentic voice for the power of simple obedience and trust, for what can happen when a believer allows God to work in a life. Walk On is the result of God using his faithful people to work in the lives of others.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=HOs6DwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Dog Soldiers, a Novel","description":"Three people caught in the world of drug dealing attempt to realize their idle dreams","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=tVpRFvZZ0FkC&dq=Dog+Soldiers,+a+Novel&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Meet The Hormones","description":"Foreword by Professor John Wass, Professor of Endocrinology at Oxford University Did you know that you have thousands, perhaps millions, of hormones in your bloodstream?

September 12, 1642) was a favourite of King Louis XIII of France who led the last and most nearly successful of the many conspiracies against the king's powerful first minister, the Cardinal Richelieu. Cinq-Mars was the son of Marshal Antoine Coiffier-Ruz , marquis d'Effiat, a close friend of Richelieu, who took the boy under his protection on his father's death in 1632 ... In 1639 Louis XIII had no favourite. Richelieu had introduced the young Cinq-Mars to Louis, hoping the king would take Cinq-Mars as a lover, apparently with success: Tallemant des R aux in his Historiettes (chapter on Louis XIII) cites Fontrailles, who relates a scene where the king and his minion Cinq-Mars went to bed together. The cardinal believed he could easily control Cinq-Mars. Instead, Cinq-Mars pressed the king for important favours and tried to convince the king to have Richelieu executed. Cinq-Mars brought some French nobility into revolt, but the effort failed. He also tried to get support for the rebellion from Philip IV, the king of Spain; Richelieu's spy service caught him doing so. Richelieu then had Cinq-Mars imprisoned and beheaded in the Place des Terreaux in Lyon.\\"--Wikipedia.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=RbsAAAAAMAAJ&dq=The+King%27s+minion:+Richelieu,+Louis+XIII,+and+the+affair+of+Cinq-Mars&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"I NEVER SAW","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Sea battles in miniature: A guide to naval wargaming","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=kTR8QgAACAAJ&dq=Sea+battles+in+miniature:+A+guide+to+naval+wargaming&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Story of World Religions","description":"This comprehensive collection of timeless and powerful stories puts the wisdom of world religions in the hands of young readers.

Even the definition of organization is changing and evolving. In this monograph, the authors apply their academic and professional experience to address the notion of \\"organization,\\" setting forth communication as the essential modality for the constitution of organization--explaining how an organization can at the same time be both local and global, and how these properties which give organization continuity over time and across geographically dispersed situations also come to be manifested in the day-to-day of human interpersonal exchange. As a radical rethinking of the traditional discourse approaches in communication theory, this book develops a conceptual framework based on the idea that \\"organization\\" emerges in the mix of conversational and textual communicative activities that together construct organizational identity. Applying concepts from the philosophy of language, linguistics, semiotics, system design, sociology and management theory, the authors put forth a convincing argument demonstrating the materiality of language and its constructive role in organization and society.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=8yaQAgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The universal elixir and other computing projects which failed","description":"The practice of building software is a  new kid on the block  technology.

Parul Sehgal, New York Times Bridging women s history, the history of the South, and African American history, this book makes a bold argument about the role of white women in American slavery. Historian Stephanie E. Jones-Rogers draws on a variety of sources to show that slave?owning women were sophisticated economic actors who directly engaged in and benefited from the South s slave market. Because women typically inherited more slaves than land, enslaved people were often their primary source of wealth. Not only did white women often refuse to cede ownership of their slaves to their husbands, they employed management techniques that were as effective and brutal as those used by slave?owning men. White women actively participated in the slave market, profited from it, and used it for economic and social empowerment. By examining the economically entangled lives of enslaved people and slave?owning women, Jones-Rogers presents a narrative that forces us to rethink the economics and social conventions of slaveholding America.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Q5osEAAAQBAJ&dq=Personal+Property:+Wives,+White+Slaves,+and+the+Market+in+Women&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Sleeping Beauty and Other Fairy Tales from the Old French","description":"The Sleeping Beauty and Other Fairy Tales from the Old French contains a collection of stories, adapted and translated by Sir Arthur Thomas Quiller-Couch. Quiller-Couch was a Cornish writer, who published under the pen-name of Q. Originally penned by such famed folklorists as Charles Perrault and Madame D Aulnoy, these stories proved to their original seventeenth century readers that such works were important, enjoyable, as well as thought-provoking. The stories in this particular text encompass favourites such as  Sleeping Beauty,  Blue Beard ,  Cinderella, or the Little Glass Slipper , and  Beauty and the Beast.  This edition of Sleeping Beauty and Other Fairy Tales further contains a set of dazzling coloured illustrations by a true master of the  Golden Age ; Edmund Dulac (1882  1953). A French artist himself, Dulac had a particular affinity with these Old French tales as well as a rigorously painterly background. The end result was beautifully coloured images which further refined the wonderful stories of Perrault, D Aulnoy  retold by Arthur Quiller-Couch. Appearing alongside the text, his illustrations enhance and elucidate the enchanting narratives.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Dst9CgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Tyranny: The Collapse of Traditional Law in America","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Discovering Washington's Historic Mines, Volume 1: The West Central Cascade Mountains","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Golding's Lord of the Flies (Cliffs Notes)","description":"Golding s iconic 1954 novel, now with a new foreword by Lois Lowry, remains one of the greatest books ever written for young adults and an unforgettable classic for readers of any age.

Revised and expanded in 1568, Vasari s monumental work comprises more than two hundred biographies; for centuries it has been recognized as a seminal text in art history and one of the most important sources on the Italian Renaissance. Vasari s biography of Michelangelo, the longest in his Lives, presents Michelangelo s oeuvre as the culminating achievement of Renaissance painting, sculpture, and architecture. He tells the grand story of the artist s expansive career, profiling his working habits; describing the creation of countless masterpieces, from the David to the Sistine Chapel ceiling; and illuminating his relationships with popes and other illustrious patrons. A lifelong friend, Vasari also quotes generously from the correspondence between the two men; the narrative is further enhanced by an abundance of colorful anecdotes. The volume s forty-two illustrations convey the range and richness of Michelangelo s art. An introduction by the scholar David Hemsoll traces the textual development of Vasari s Lives and situates his biography of Michelangelo in the broader context of Renaissance art history.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=4PI9DwAAQBAJ&dq=The+life+of+Michelangelo+Buonarroti&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Children's Book of Faith","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Statistical Process Analysis","description":"A major tool for quality control and management, statistical process control (SPC) monitors sequential processes, such as production lines and Internet traffic, to ensure that they work stably and satisfactorily.

Now - as the limits of individual freedoms are increasingly unrestrained - Gangi sees a parallel but perhaps more fundamental peril. He challenges the reader to pick up any newspaper and find in it judges telling lawmakers what to do and how to do it. Gangi does not doubt the good will of the reformers; in the short term, recent expansions of rights are beneficial. But, he argues, abuse of judicial power is eroding a more basic American freedom: the people's right to self-government.\\" \\"Gangi is concerned that present justices no longer understand American structures as set up by the framers of the Constitution, and he gives an exhaustive summary of The Federalist Papers, a classic defense of the original document written by Hamilton, Jay, and Madison under the pen name \\"Publius.\\" Conservatives and liberals alike are guilty, he says. Recent Supreme Courts are an embarrassment to the American political tradition.\\" \\"Troubled by the shadow of a new tyranny, the author does not pull his punches. Where he sees bias masquerading in legal garb, he names it, and he urges activists to stop the \\"unseemly scurrying to the courts every time a public policy battle is lost.\\" Gangi concludes that if Americans are to regain control of their government, they must first rediscover their faith in democracy. Not everyone will agree with the views espoused in this provocative book, but all who read it will understand a great deal better the critical issues with which it deals.\\"--BOOK JACKET.Title Summary field provided by Blackwell North America, Inc.

This first integrated survey of the mystical dimension of Taoism disputes the commonly accepted idea of such a hiatus. Covering the period from the Daode jing to the end of the Tang, Livia Kohn reveals an often misunderstood Chinese mystical tradition that continued through the ages. Influenced by but ultimately independent of Buddhism, it took forms more various than the quietistic withdrawal of Laozi or the sudden enlightenment of the Chan Buddhists. On the basis of a new theoretical evaluation of mysticism, this study analyzes the relationship between philosophical and religious Taoism and between Buddhism and the native Chinese tradition. Kohn shows how the quietistic and socially oriented Daode jing was combined with the ecstatic and individualistic mysticism of the Zhuangzi, with immortality beliefs and practices, and with Buddhist insight meditation, mind analysis, and doctrines of karma and retribution. She goes on to demonstrate that Chinese mysticism, a complex synthesis by the late Six Dynasties, reached its zenith in the Tang, laying the foundations for later developments in the Song traditions of Inner Alchemy, Chan Buddhism, and Neo-Confucianism.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=N4T3DwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The life of Pasteur","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=myoPAAAAYAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Aim for a job in automotive service (Aim high vocational series)","description":"Describes the opportunities and training requirements of such automotive service careers as diagnostician, body repairman, diesel technician, and car-radio specialist.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=lA2VOQAACAAJ&dq=Aim+for+a+job+in+automotive+service+(Aim+high+vocational+series)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Tales from the Wheelhouse: Adventures Aboard the Denali","description":"A humorous short story about an adventure undertaken in Alaska on board a 200-foot processing ship where, among the endless hours of work and no sleep, two deckhands still found time to play tricks on some unsuspecting crew, making their summer on board the Denali a job they would never forget.

Yet few Americans realize the crucial role that generosity plays in keeping that fragile balance. And now, with gated communities, oppressive personal debts, shrinking government, and tax and welfare reform crusades, that essential moral glue is at risk of melting away. A leading voice for community development, former Connecticut College president and scholar Claire Gaudiani explores all these issues as she examines American prosperity from the Constitution to the New Economy bust. She traces the push and pull of the robber barons and the progressive movement, the New Deal and the postwar boom, and the Me Decade and the technology revolution, finding that altruism powerfully invests in people, property, and ingenuity. Rather than pitting the capitalists against the populists, Gaudiani brings both sides to the table to reseal this fundamental social contract and provide a blueprint for a just future. The Greater Good is a passionate, pragmatic, and, finally, optimistic manifesto for revitalizing the promise of the American economy.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=lUJoEx7uVWEC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Tails","description":"A simple introduction to some different animals that have tails.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=lYtx8Ybxc-IC&dq=Tails&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Henrik Ibsen's a Doll's House & Hedda Gabler (Barron's Book Notes)","description":"The play is combined with a full commentary on the plot, context, themes, characters, language and critical reception.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Yyr2E4bpWC8C&dq=Henrik+Ibsen%27s+a+Doll%27s+House&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Friday the 13th (Friday the Thirteenth)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ceKyGAAACAAJ&dq=Friday+the+13th+(Friday+the+Thirteenth)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A copybook for Japanese ink-painting: Edited by Reiko Chiba","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=W2BRvQEACAAJ&dq=A+copybook+for+Japanese+ink-painting:+Edited+by+Reiko+Chiba&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Christmas,","description":"Here is the wonderful new version of the classic poem every family should own.

Pages: 23. Chapters: An Unearthly Child, The Massacre of St Bartholomew's Eve, The Reign of Terror, The Crusade, The Myth Makers, The Gunfighters, The Romans, Black Orchid, The Highlanders, The Aztecs, Marco Polo, The Smugglers. Excerpt: An Unearthly Child (also referred to as 100,000 BC) is the first serial in the British science fiction television series Doctor Who. It was first broadcast in four weekly parts from 23 November to 14 December 1963. Written by the Australian writer Anthony Coburn, it introduces William Hartnell as the First Doctor, Carole Ann Ford as Susan Foreman, Jacqueline Hill as Barbara Wright and William Russell as Ian Chesterton. The first episode deals with Ian and Barbara's discovery of the Doctor and his time-space ship TARDIS in a junkyard in contemporary London. The remaining episodes are set amid a power struggle between warring Stone Age factions who have lost the secret of making fire. In the first episode, \\"An Unearthly Child,\\" the four main characters are introduced, vague background information about the Doctor is given, and the TARDIS travels to the Stone Age. The first episode starts in a junk yard in contemporary London and introduces the four characters who were to form the core of the first year's production. Schoolteachers Ian Chesterton and Barbara Wright are concerned about one of their pupils, Susan Foreman, who seems to have a very alien outlook on England. She is precocious but seems to have strange gaps in her understanding of the world. They have come to her listed address to investigate. The programme's main prop, the TARDIS, is also introduced, when the teachers hear Susan's voice apparently coming from inside a police box. At the time, such boxes were a fairly common sight on the streets of London, but only police officers held a key to open them. The TARDIS proves to be no ordinary...","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=NuYYngEACAAJ&dq=The+Massacre+(Doctor+Who)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Dark Side of the Street","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=EUU2HAAACAAJ&dq=Dark+Side+of+the+Street&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Moon in a Dewdrop: Writings of Zen Master Dogen","description":"Eihei Dogen (1200-1253), among the first to transmit Zen Buddhism from China to Japan and founder of the important Soto School, was not only a profoundly influential and provocative Zen philosopher but also one of the most stimulating figures in Japanese letters.

S. Presman, has reviewed not only the extensive Russian literatur!;\\"l, but also al most equally comprehensively the non-Russian literature, dealing with biological influences of these fields. Treated also is literature shedding some light on possible theoretical foundations for these phenomena. A substantial, rapidly increaSing number of studies in many laboratories and countries has now clearly established bio logical influences which are independent of the theoretically pre dictable, simple thermal effects. Indeed many of the effects are produced by field strengths very close to those within the natural environment. The author has, even more importantly, set forth a novel, imaginative general hypothesis in which it is postulated that such electromagnetic fields normally serve as conveyors of information from the environment to the organism, within the organism, and among organisms. He postulates that in the course of evolution or ganisms have come to employ these fields in conjunction with the well-known sensory, nervous, and endocrine systems in effecting coordination and integration.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=UfoICAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Daddy's Girl","description":"NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER ? In Danielle Steel s riveting novel, three women raised by their father on a sprawling California ranch now confront difficult truths about their past. Decades ago, after the death of his wife, Texas ranch hand JT Tucker took his three small daughters to California to start a new life. With almost no money, a will of iron, and hard work, he eventually built the biggest ranch in California. But when he dies suddenly at the age of sixty-four, the ranch is inherited by his three daughters each of them finding it impossible to believe that this larger-than-life figure is gone from their lives. JT s relationship with each daughter was entirely different. Caroline, the youngest and most reserved, was overlooked by her father for her entire life and fled to become a wife, mother, and writer in Marin County. Gemma, his declared favorite, sought out Hollywood glamour and success and became a major television star. Kate, the eldest, stayed at home with her father to do his bidding as a ranch hand, without thanks or praise, forsaking marriage and a family of her own for the love of him. Now, upon JT s death, the paper trail he leaves behind begins to reveal much more than the three sisters ever guessed about who he really was. It will turn their world upside down, and each of them must grapple with a new reality, strengthening their relationships with one another, and discovering who they are now as grown women, in spite of him. Set against the magnificent backdrop of the West and the drama of a family in turmoil, Daddy s Girls is the story of three remarkable women and their unique bond to each other the daughters of a complex, many-faceted, domineering father who left his mark on each of them.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=syWxDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Forest of Eagles","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Church Is a Whore, but We Love Her","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=GEVFAAAACAAJ&dq=The+Church+Is+a+Whore,+but+We+Love+Her&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Flexing Your Soul: Moving with Energy and Consciousness","description":"Energetic Movements and Exercises to Energize and Integrate Body, Heart, Mind and Soul. \\"Finally, a book that takes you through the entire body, integrating physical body sections with the energetic processes of the chakras.

You may also know that knitting as a hobby can verge on obsession be it the compulsive purchasing of stunning hand-spun wool, the desire to rip out nearly finished sweaters because you dropped a stitch, or the need to knit wherever, whenever, or however you can. Most important, though, knitting offers a camaraderie, a society of women and men who converse in a language all their own, flock to yarn stores with religious devotion, and can recite the time and place where they first learned to purl. These feelings are what KnitLit is all about. In this charming collection of stories, essays, anecdotes, and recollections, knitters of every  color  celebrate their hobby and share with you the joy it brings into their lives. From the touching tale of a caring woman whose hand-knit dolls bring security to young hospital patients, to the hilarious story of a woman scorned who sends her ex-boyfriend a scarf knit with wolf hair only to have it torn to shreds by his dogs, to the moving recollection of a man whose grandmother s dying wish was to knit all the wool in her knitting stash, to the finely wrought account of a man who keeps alive the memories of his companions and friends who have succumbed to AIDS by wearing the sweaters they left behind, KnitLit is a gift from knitters to knitters crafted with as much love and care as an afghan or a wool scarf.

What is the legacy of Clintonism? What is there in Hillary Clinton's background, talents, or record of achievement that qualifies her to represent New York in the U.S. Senate? And, most important, what will happen if Hillary should win this fall? Where will her ambition lead her next? Peggy Noonan, one of our most astute political observers and a speechwriter for the Reagan White House, argues in this passionate and compelling book that everyone in the United States--not just New Yorkers--must look closely at Hillary and the implications of her Senate bid. The Case Against Hillary Clinton offers an eye-opening assessment of the scandals, and failures of the Clinton years, from Whitewater to health care to the Filegate and Travelgate affairs--casting a revealing light on the first lady's motives and behavior. It poses searching questions about the difference between the citizens of New York and the Clintons of Arkansas; between public service and lip service; between the whole truth and the shameless parade of evasion and spin the first couple has marshaled throughout their White House years. And finally, in these pages Noonan calls on us to consider the climate of deception and disgrace the Clintons have left in their wake--weakening our nation's moral standing and damaging our political process in ways that will take years to heal. Never before has the character of a first lady been so integral to the fate of a presidential administration and no writer before Peggy Noonan has had the courage to offer so uncompromising an estimation of Hillary Clinton as the one contained in this book. The Case Against Hillary Clinton takes the measure of the woman, the candidate, the striving politician--and offers a convincing argument that her calculated bid for power will be the first truly important election of the new millennium. I thought, seven years ago, that the Clintons might turn out to be inspiring. They had guts, came from nowhere, were bright and hard-driving; he was educated, credentialed, a political moderate but not a boring one; she appeared to be something new and interesting, a modern woman who operated with confidence in all the circles of the world.... Hillary could have been a strong and encouraging presence, maybe continuing to work in the world as a lawyer, as Cherie Blair has in Great Britain--a judge, working mother, and \\"first lady\\" who is everywhere a figure of respect. What a presidency this would have been. What a legacy they would have left . What did the Clintons do with their two administrations? They left behind a country more damaged, more removed from its old, rough idealism; a country whose children live in a coarser and more dangerous place; a country whose political life has been distorted and lowered.... And for this reason, for all of these reasons, Clintonism should not be allowed to continue. And if it is not to continue, the next great battle may prove to be the decisive one, and that is the battle of New York. -- From The Case Against Hillary Clinton","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=N-eImG5AwWUC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Babe Ruth (Heroes of America: Illustrated Lives)","description":"Babe Ruth became the idol of millions of people.

An accomplished poet and artist, she dedicated her life to counseling children and families affected by child abuse. While writing this memoir, Nancy was diagnosed with Lou Gehrig's disease. Suddenly faced with devastating illness, she became determined to complete this work in order to spread her message that child abuse is as likely to be found in a mansion as in a mobile home. Eternal Improv is an inspiring work of profound courage and hope. \\"What an accomplishment! Nancy Davenport's searing, raw, witty account of a deeply disturbing childhood and brave escape from an abusive father is marked by the wisdom of reflection and the grace of forgiveness. Rising above homelessness and starvation to achieve academic and professional success against tremendous odds, Nancy has written her memoir while struggling daily to live with the invasive consequences of Lou Gehrig's disease. Completing this book demonstrates a strength beyond words, for as she has lost her ability to speak, so her voice booms from the page.\\"-Jacqueline Winspear, author of Maisie Dobbs, Birds Of A Feather, and Pardonable Lies \\"Nancy Davenport's recollections reveal a writer with a clear eye, a dry wit, and a crusty, resilient spirit. Reading them makes the heart ache.\\"-Linda Hunt, Academy Award-winning actress \\"Nancy Davenport writes about her childhood abuse, homelessness and debilitating disease without ever dipping into self-pity, victimhood or easy platitudes. Her memoir crackles with wit, irony and wisdom.

The Forrest Gump of journalism ... Incredible.' Madrid in the Spanish Civil War Prague during the Munich crisis Berlin the day Germany invaded Poland Helsinki as the Russians attacked Moscow betrayed by the Nazis Paris as it fell to the Germans London on the first day of the Blitz Virginia Cowles has seen it all. As a pioneering female correspondent, she reported from Europe from the 1930s into the Second World War, watching 'the lights in the death-chamber go out one by one' from the frontline - always in the right place at the right time. Flinging off her heels under shellfire; meeting Hitler ('an inconspicuous little man'); gossiping with Churchill by his goldfish pond; dancing in the bomb-blasted Ritz; reading The Intelligent Woman's Guide to Socialism on a Soviet train; eating reindeer with guerrilla skiers ... Introduced by Christina Lamb, Cowles' incredible dispatches will make you an eyewitness to the twentieth-century as you have never experienced it before. 'Passionate and vivid ... A brave reporter and fine writer.' Lindsey Hilsum (Channel 4 News, International Editor, and author of In Extremis; the Life of War Correspondent Marie Colvin) What readers are saying: The Forrest Gump of early World War II The queen of historical name-dropping Holy cow! What a wonderful find!! Most unexpectedly great book that I have read in years. Reads like a novel [but] this is real life. The best book I've read this year ... Exquisitely written [day-to-day] drama of history ... Breathtakingly fresh. I can't recommend this book enough. Cowles' voice and humanity are her greatest assets, but her willingness to be where the action was - and always find trouble - paid off. A marvel. Her ability to capture anecdotes and dialogue that offer surprising insights into historic personages and events is a frequent source of wonder. It was difficult for me not to drive my family crazy wanting to read them quotes. The intrepid Virginia Cowles was in the right places at the right times and connected to the right people.
