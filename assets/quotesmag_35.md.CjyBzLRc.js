And you don't know the whole truth about the first two until you finish the third. This again is consistant with the Continental Op's relationship with the truth...the knowledge that you are basically given only lies and must concoct your own lie to find the truth.The primary female character is not very sympathetic for the most part until you get to the third episode when you realize why she seems so drab and uninteresting during the first two episodes.I would suggest reading other Hammett novels first, especially &quot;Red Harvest&quot; as an introduction to the Continental Op. And while this may be the weakest of his novels, it is still superior crime fiction."},{"Title":"The Dain Curse","review":"This novel featuring (and narrated by) Hammett's anonymous Continental Op is able to offer a more complex plot than his short stories. It features the Op's usual dogged approach to the case (\\"You've got to sit down to all the facts you can get and turn them over and over till they click.\\"), but does not revolve around Hammett's usual set of underworld denizens and trench-coat-clad gunslingers. Overall: another entertaining \\"hardboiled detective\\" yarn, but I personally prefer the more corruption-filled underworld feel of \\"Red Harvest\\" (the Op's other novel-length case)."},{"Title":"The Dain Curse","review":"Dashiell Hammett not only helped create the detective novel genre, but his writing style impacted the entire writing profession. Lee Child, Robert Parker, Michael Kennedy et al, can all trace their lineage to him."},{"Title":"The Dain Curse","review":"The Dain Curse is my second excursion with the Continental Op. I read Red Harvest about a year ago and really enjoyed it. In Red Harvest, the Op is battling gangsters in a mess of a town. Part of me expected the same sort of thing from the Dain Curse. While there were similar gangster-like elements, the overall plot structure was fairly different.The Dain Curse plot is, at its heart, what you might expect from a robbery/murder mystery story. It involves a lot of intrigue, misdirection, suspense, etc. At the same time, it's not your standard mystery novel a la Sherlock Holmes. It's definitely gritty and \\"hardboiled\\" in the same style as the earlier Hammett I'd read.One thing I noticed quickly was just how twisty the path was along the story arc. Things start out simple enough with our Op investigating a small scale jewel robbery as a representative for the insurance company who will have to pay the claim on the missing diamonds. The Op's detective nature shines as he questions the surface value of the facts and doesn't accept the \\"easy answer\\" that the suspects and the insurance company would like him to take. Instead, he keeps digging and before long, the jewel theft gets forgotten as murder becomes the primary crime...and then another murder...and another.The language, imagery and pacing of Hammett's novel was fabulous. It was very easy to get caught up in the action and the adventure of the story. The depth and intrigue of the mystery was very impressive. In the end, I could follow the unraveling of the mystery but there were constant wild cards thrown from seemingly out of nowhere that threw into a spin any theories I had already come up with.The biggest downside of the book were the times when everything was spelled out. While it was very interesting reading the entire plot unraveled so the whole mystery was exposed, the segment where this happened was a somewhat drudgerous read. Still, I was compelled to read it to make sure I didn't miss anything. The main drudgery of the explanation was due to its length and intricacy. The final mystery had layer upon layer of detail and a whole stage of characters. As a result, the wrap up took a long time to get out and part of me wanted to skip past it, while the other part wanted to make sure I understood everything.While not as action packed as the gangster hunting events of Red Harvest, the mystery and intrigue level of The Dain Curse were taken up a notch. Once again, I found myself really enjoying the minimal, course, gritty, blunt style of Hammett and I look forward to reading more.****4.5 out of 5 stars"},{"Title":"The Dain Curse","review":"Dashiel Hammett, along with Raymond Chandler, reinvented the detective genre in the 1930's and 1940's. They moved the genre away from the amateurish and simple parlor detectives that had previously dominated the genre to hard-boiled action characters who knew what was what and didn't mind taking a beating to get the bad guys. And along the way they produced some very memorable literary characters as well. Nick Charles, Sam Spade and Phillip Marlowe are well known exemplars of the action detective. However, on the way to creating these literary works of art Hammett did journeyman's work at the detective genre in various pulp detective magazines. The Dain Curse seems to be at the tail end of that period.The unnamed universal Continental Operative who is the central character of the story (and others, as well) is the prototype for Hammett's later named detectives. He has all the characteristics that mark a noir detective-tough, resourceful, undaunted, and incorruptible with a sense of honor to friend and foe alike that sets him apart from earlier detectives. However the plot line here is not as strong as in his latter work. Oh sure, there is murder and other crimes and plenty of sub-plots on the way to the solution and some less than savory although otherwise bourgeois characters to muddle up the Op's well laid plans. However, unless you are fairly familiar with 1920's \\"lost generation\\" hijinks there is less sympathy here for victims and villains alike than the later work. Religious cults, drugs, ennui, etc. have lost their cutting edge as material for dramatic tension. Still anytime you can get your hands on a Hammett book-do it.Needless to say you need a scorecard to tell who is on the level and who is not, including the people who hire said average private detective. The twist and turns as Op tries to mix and match with the various interests at play drive the drama of the film. As I mentioned in a recent review of Hammett's Red Harvest if you want a well-thought out story, although not as memorable as The Maltese Falcon or the The Thin Man, that is also well-written, although without the numerous unforgettable lines of the above-mentioned novels, from a member of the second echelon of the American literary pantheon, this one is for you."},{"Title":"The Dain Curse","review":"Perhaps the least acclaimed (and least read) of Hammett's five full-length novels, \\"The Dain Curse\\" is still loads of fun. Each of its three parts is a crime story unto itself, unveiling the convoluted pasts of a couple who die in the first act and of their oddly dull-witted daughter.The always-unnamed Continental Op arrives on the scene to investigate the disappearance of eight imperfect diamonds from the home of Edgar Leggett, a soon-dead scientist who was trying to develop a method for tinting the jewels. This section is the most traditional of the three--a rather formulaic detective story where many of the whodunits seem to be solved by the end.But it's the unsolved (and incorrectly solved) aspects of the mystery that provide the fuel for the next two parts. After the Op moves on to another case, he is called back to protect the Leggetts' daughter, Gabrielle, who is holed up--and doped up--with a religious cult. The Op stays in the Temple of the Holy Grail and observes both its strangely lethargic inhabitants and the charmingly plastic husband-and-wife team who leads the cult; his odyssey is one of the more atmospheric and bizarre adventures in Hammett's oeuvre. These four chapters alone are worth the price of admission.From there, the action moves to the beachfront town of Quesada, where Gabrielle and her new husband have secreted themselves to recover from the prior series of traumatic events. The twists and turns--and the climax--are satisfying indeed, but what's lacking throughout the novel becomes apparent at last: Hammett's bizarre ambiance and the plot surprises fail to compensate for cardboard characterizations that aren't quite believable.Nevertheless, \\"The Dain Curse\\" is a brisk page-turner, and fans of crime novels and of Hammett in particular are sure to enjoy the ride."},{"Title":"The Dain Curse","review":"The Dain Curse begins with a routine insurance investigation. Some moderately valuable diamonds were stolen and the Continental Op is put on the case to find the culprit. Not soon after, the Op learns that something larger is going on. The family he is investigating has some deep secrets and maybe even a curse follows them. The story takes place in three parts with three different mysteries, but they culminate to solve the Dain Curse, which is at the center of all the action.I was introduced to the Continental Op a few years ago in short story form and loved the character quite a bit. I've been saving the novels for a few years and it was worth the wait. Hammett became famous for Sam Spade and the Thin man, but the Continental Op is deserving of more attention. He's not typically handsome and he's even short and fat, but he has enough brains an no how to get the job done.A shame that Hammett got sucked into revolutionary politics and spent the last 30 years of his life writing nothing of value, because his early stuff is nothing less than Great American Literature."},{"Title":"The Dain Curse","review":"The most interesting aspects of this work are the method by which Hammett chooses to tell the tale and the fact that it shows the development of Hammett as a writer. The reader learns the details of the case as they unfold and are experienced through the eyes and ears of the nameless operative of the Continental Detective Agency. We encounter, with the op, the same truths, half-truths and untruths while moving toward a solution. The problem is we do not always seem to be moving fast enough."},{"Title":"The Dain Curse","review":"I think this is the weakest of Hammet's novels. It is a bit predictable and the whole curse thing is a little silly. Nevertheless, you should read it if you are a big Hammet fan, because he wrote so little."},{"Title":"The Dain Curse","review":"In the middle of THE DAIN CURSE the scene shifts to the temple of a San Francisco cult started by Joseph and Aaronia Haldorn, a couple of mediocre actors. The cult is a revival of an old Gaelic church dating from King Arthur's time. The end of the temple episode is probably where Hammett should conclude the story. Instead, he takes it eighty miles outside San Francisco where it begins to drag. Another limitation of this novel is that the heroine, Gabrielle, is not especially attractive. Hammett does not repeat this error in his next book."},{"Title":"The Dain Curse","review":"Give it up, bunky.

The excessive plot twists are propped up by awkward explanation opportunities that inhibit what little flow there is and dispel any suspension of disbelief that the reader may have enjoyed.Hammett's reputation is deserved, but this novel is not worthy of that reputation."},{"Title":"The Dain Curse","review":"Of all the protagonists Dashiell Hammett created -- Sam Spade, Nick and Nora Charles, Ned Beaumont -- the Continental Op, for my taste, is the most enduring and compelling. Professedly amoral, &quot;only a hired hand with a hired hand's interest in your troubles,&quot; this 'middle-aged fatman' demands that you take him at face value . . . and yet Hammett's genius is such that you're pulled to look beyond that self-description, to look under the &quot;calluses on the calluses&quot; on his soul.The Op beat, bludgeoned and shot his way through countless short stories, several of which Hammett later &quot;cannibalized&quot; (to use Raymond Chandler's term for a process he himself would employ) into two novels, one of which is &quot;The Dain Curse,&quot; originally serialized in Black Mask magazine before its book publication.Melodramatic in tone, ranging from San Francisco's Pacific Heights to the semi-fictional town of Quesada (an interesting blend of Monterey and Half Moon Bay, in actuality), the novel follows the Continental Op as he solves several seemingly disparate mysteries before he realizes that those &quot;solutions&quot; are bogus and that he can only get to the true bottom of matters and achieve a genuine resolution by &quot;lifting&quot; the &quot;curse&quot; which 20-year old Gabrielle Leggett is convinced dooms her.She has a drug habit. Through a mixture of cajolery and bullying, the Op sets out to cure her. And Hammett's true genius begins to show itself:Throughout the first half of the novel, Gabrielle is, frankly, insipid and easily dismissed. Yet once the Op begins to focus on her as the key to everything else, she emerges as a sympathetic and compelling individual, and this has everything to do with the question of motive: Is the Op simply helping her as the means to an end (i.e., his refusal to be manipulated into a false resolution), is he motivated rather by a refusal to allow her to be victimized any further, or . . . are his feelings not quite so impersonal as he claims? Tantalizingly, his statements to her and his subsequent comments at the novel's end are contradictory and -- in the latter case, at least to this writer's sensibilities -- not altogether convincing. Which, I'm completely convinced, are exactly as Hammett intended. Each reader is called upon to reach his or her own conclusion.Suffice to say, without spoiling anything here, that justice is ultimately done (and how!) and the Continental Op continues on in his -- supposedly -- cold-blooded way. A &quot;sleuth&quot; or &quot;manhunter,&quot; to use his terms. A &quot;thieftaker,&quot; to use the 18th century British expression.And yet, ever so much more. Whether he chooses to admit it or not. Ever so much more."},{"Title":"The Dain Curse","review":"&quot;The Dain Curse&quot; originally appeared as 4 serials in &quot;Black Mask&quot; magazine, 1928-1929, and was reworked and published as a novel shortly thereafter. The novel impresses me more strongly as a soap opera in three acts than a detective story. Yes, there is a detective, the always nameless Continental Op. And there is certainly a mystery. There are a lot of mysteries, in fact. But &quot;The Dain Curse&quot; is the most far-fetched of Dashiell Hammett's works that I've read, and the least cynical of his novels. I wouldn't call this book well-written, but it's a page-turner. The plot is so convoluted that the reader is even more anxious than usual to read to the end in order to find out what our detective will make of it. And that's the heart of the novel's problems: We keep reading because we are curious to know how the Op will unravel this messy, incomprehensible case. We don't keep reading because we are interested in the characters, the story, or the language. Those elements are far less intriguing than I have come to expect from Hammett. Perhaps it's because Hammett strayed from the world of gangsters and thugs that he knew best, but &quot;The Dain Curse&quot;'s conglomeration of religious cults, drug addiction, melodrama, and bourgeois murder just isn't credible on any level. The central female character in the book, Gabrielle, is more of a damsel in distress than a femme fatale, and she is rather unattractive, physically and intellectually. There's nothing wrong with these things, in themselves, but they typify &quot;The Dain Curse&quot;'s departure from Dashiell Hammett's traditional themes and style. Unfortunately, if this novel was an experiment, it wasn't a very successful one. But I don't deny that it's entertaining on a certain level. &quot;The Dain Curse&quot; is quite a jigsaw puzzle, even if it isn't a credible one. And it gives the reader an opportunity to see another side of the Continental Op, for better or worse. I don't recommend it to those not already familiar with Hammett's work, though, because it's distinctly atypical."},{"Title":"The Dain Curse","review":"Dashiell Hammett brought the noir detective into the limelight with &quot;Maltese Falcon,&quot; but it wasn't the first or only novel he wrote about hard-edged, hard-boiled detectives. Among his early works was the Continental Op in &quot;The Dain Curse,&quot; a scattered but interesting three-tier mystery.Diamonds have been stolen, and the Continental Op has been called in to find out what has happened. But he finds that the whole story that is given to him has a &quot;wrong&quot; feeling to it -- mysterious men, a diamond he finds on the ground. When the Op digs further, he finds a web of murder, jealousy and hate that spreads back over young Gabrielle Leggett's life.After the trauma of her father's murder, the Op takes Gabrielle to the Temple of the Holy Grail, a San Francisco cult. At first it seems like a slightly goofy but harmless little pseudo-religion -- until a hideous specter in the Op's room, and a murder that seems to have been committed by Gabrielle, shows that something sinister is lurking there. And finally, the &quot;Dain curse&quot; seemingly strikes again when Gabrielle's young husband is found dead...Before anyone knew about Sam Spade, Hammett was churning out pulp fiction about the Continental Op in his trademark spare, sharp prose. &quot;The Dain Curse&quot; feels like three loosely connected short stories -- only Gabrielle Leggett ties them together, and the idea of the &quot;Dain curse&quot; (which is never fully dealt with -- though it makes an enticing title) which supposedly kills everyone around Gabrielle.Hammett's writing is as dry and spare as always. However, the stories sometimes seem too short, especially the second one, which ends on a hurried note (we're only told of Gabrielle's marriage as a sort of postscript). And the types of stories are uneven: one is a smart mystery, one is a thriller with a freako cult, and one is more a character study.Gabrielle is hardly a compelling character at first; she's pretty helpless and dull. Hammett doesn't give her a lot of attention for the first and second stories. But she's given some good expansion in the final story, where her &quot;dope&quot; addiction is dealt with. At the same time, the seemingly amoral Op is given further depth. Though even he may not know it, the intense conversations in the last third show that he's a lot more than he seems.&quot;The Dain Curse&quot; is a somewhat uneven mix of lurid mystery and practiced, intelligent suspense. Hardly Hammett's best, but worth checking out."},{"Title":"The Dain Curse","review":"Unlike most people, I feel that THE DAIN CURSE was one of the best novels that Hammett has written. After reading THE MALTISE FALCON, and THE THIN MAN, this novel seemed to keep my attention more than the other two. It had action at every turn, and seemed not to dwell on one point, but investigate the different aspects of the case. This was a great novel, and was worth reading."},{"Title":"The Dain Curse","review":"When you think of Hammett, you probably think only of The Maltese Falcon and The Thin Man. The (great) movies probably play a role in that. But don't overlook The Dain Curse. It's fine reading for any crime novel fan.And a note to those whose reviews described the plot as choppy: this novel was originally published in three separate parts in one of the pulp magazines (anyone know which one? I don't recall) so all three parts were written to be part of a bigger story, yet be complete and self-contained in their own way."},{"Title":"The Dain Curse","review":"&quot;The Dain Curse&quot; is a great read ; the dialogue is crisp and the story zings along at a great pace. The main problem with the book is the disjointed storyline ; the plot is subdivided into three sections, each with a self-contained storyline, linked up by the supposed curse around the leading female character, Gabrielle Leggett. The denoument of the book feels contrived ; I felt that Hammett had probably thought up the three separate plots and had (not completely successfully) attempted to link them together. However, this is a minor quibble ; the book is a great read and I would recommend it to all fans of detective fiction, although this may be a disappointment to those who have previously read &quot;Red Harvest&quot; or &quot;The Maltese Falcon&quot;."},{"Title":"The Dain Curse","review":"The Dain Curse contains Dashiell Hammett's typically marvelous writing style, complete with his superb characterization, atmosphere, and narrative technique. However, the novel suffers in that the actual plot is rather weak, and the flow of events is choppy. The book appears, at first glance, to be three loosely connected short stories involving the same characters. Although events from each sequence lead into the next, the progression of action is uneven because of the multiple climaxes that occur throughout the book. Additionally, the apparently tenuous links between the three sections of the novel are not at all ideal for maintaining the reader's interest. Events do finally come together in the last chapter, and Hammett explains how these seemingly disparate events tie together. Nevertheless, until that point the reader might well be wondering just what is going on.If you enjoyed Hammett's other works, you will probably like this one. Casual or first-time readers, however, might very well find The Dain Curse to be off-putting."},{"Title":"The Dain Curse","review":"Today, of course, Dashiell Hammett's reputation rests largely on the legendary novel THE MALTESE FALCON, but this does not mean that his other work isn't worth a look, and THE DAIN CURSE is a case in point: tightly written in a merciless tone, Hammett's second novel clearly sets the stage for much that was to follow.Hammett first made his reputation as a pulp magazine author, churning out a series of short stories in a lean, mean prose that drew numerous fans and built critical attention. One of the most popular characters of his short story work was known as &quot;the Continental Op&quot;--an insurance detective (&quot;Op&quot; being short for &quot;operative&quot;) whose various adventures would ultimately form the basis for this, Hammett's second novel-length effort.Although some will disagree, I personally consider THE DAIN CURSE an noticeable improvement over Hammett's first novel, RED HARVEST. Like most of Hammett's work, both works are noteable for their hard-hitting prose, both offer convoluted plots, and both provide us with archetypical characterizations--but where I find RED HARVEST a strangely flat and slightly up-hill read, THE DAIN CURSE hooks you with the first few pages and holds your attention with ease throughout the entire course of the novel.The story is, as previously stated, convoluted. The Op is called in to investigate stolen diamonds--but strangely enough, these diamonds are not really precious: they are imperfect stones loaned by a jeweler to scientist/artist Leggett, who experiments with them in an effort to improve their quality. Leggett seems as surprised as everyone that any one would actually go to the trouble of stealing them--but suddenly the tone of the characters shift, and those who first welcomed the investigation seem to resist it while those who originally opposed it seem to encourage it. Clearly, there is something more going on than a simple burglary, and it short order it becomes clear that the &quot;something&quot; is murder.While THE DAIN CURSE is an entertaining read, it does have its flaws--and they are flaws that Hammett would take some pains to correct in his future work. Given that the novel is largely based on various short stories Hammett had previously written, it is hardly surprising that the movement of the plot has an episodic feel; there are actually points in the book where you feel the story has ended long before you've run out of pages, only to have Hammett spin off the plot into an unexpected direction with a somewhat awkward joining of the elements involved. The characters also tend to be inconsistent, and while this actually forms part of the plotline, Hammett does not entirely succeed in carrying off the effect.Perhaps the single most oft-leveled accusation against the novel is that its heroine proves a largely unsympathetic character who lacks either the power of THE MALTESE FALCON'S perfidious Bridgett or the snap and spark of THE THIN MAN'S Nora. For myself, I did not find this the major flaw that so many others do; what is an issue, however, is the very limited attention Hammett offers the character in the first third of the novel, where she reads as a minor supporting character--and rather than build the role in a way that places her front and center, Hammett simply shifts gears and suddenly puts her at the forefront. The result is an extremely awkward transition that undercuts one's suspension of disbelief.But whatever its flaws, THE DAIN CURSE is a truly entertaining read, written in the developing Hammett style that would peak with THE MALTESE FALCON. It may in some respects be a &quot;developmental&quot; work, but it is no less the worse for that, easily outclassing the vast majority of Hammett imitators that sprang up as the author rose to fame. Recommended to fans of the classic hard-boiled fiction school.--GFT (Amazon.com Reviewer)--"},{"Title":"The Dain Curse","review":"An overlooked treasure, THE DAIN CURSE is usually overshadowed by Dashiell Hammett's better known books, THE MALTESE FALCON and THE THIN MAN. This is unfortunate. Perhaps I am in the minority, but I think this book holds its own very well against its better known brethren.Perhaps it is the structure of the book, broken into three sections loosely tied together, THE DAIN CURSE features Hammett's best detective, the portly and nameless Continental Op. Called in to investigate diamonds stolen from the elderly Edgar Leggett, the Op soon learns of the curse which mysteriously follows the family and which also, incidentally, leaves a lot of people dead.The Op also recognizes that Leggett's beautiful daughter, Gabrielle, holds the key to the mystery. That Gabrielle is, plainly put, crazy, doesn't make the situation any easier. An apostle of a hocus pocus religious cult in San Francisco as well as a heroin addict, Gabrielle ties the three self-contained stories of THE DAIN CURSE together, providing an edgy line of continuity for the Op to follow.From cult houses to breezy seaside towns more dangerous than they appear, THE DAIN CURSE provides Hammett plenty of opportunity to show off his skills at producing maximum effect with a minimum of words. Like all of his works, Hammett writes with the effect of short powerful jabs, constantly forcing the reader to keep his guard up while producing, paradoxically, beautiful images that capture the reader's imagination despite (indeed, because of) their brutality. In the hands of a lesser writer, the three stories of THE DAIN CURSE would have felt disjointed and artificial. Hammett, though, makes the best of both worlds, producing enjoyable shorter works and tying them together into a whole greater than the sum of its parts."},{"Title":"The Dain Curse","review":"I have read the overwhelming majority of Hammett's fiction, and I really think this is as good as any. It is different, granted, but it is not wholly unlike some of his earlier stories. I think a mistake a lot of people make is in comparing this book to RED HARVEST, the Op tale which just preceded this. But they are about different things. THE DAIN CURSE has a similar feel to early stories like \\"The Tenth Clew\\" or \\"The Golden Horseshoe\\", but is, of course, about strange things. But I think it displays some of the most intense \\"moments\\" of the Op's life; e.g., his mock-rescue of Gabrielle from the Temple with Eric Collinson in Part 1 and subsequent automobile accident; the discovery. of Eric Collinson's corpse in Part 3. Subtle, but still intense.Furthermore, the way it's divided up, far from making it a \\"disconnected\\" novel, makes me think of it as a kind of trilogy of novellas. Each part is somewhat self-contained, but the later ones depend on the first one. Also, as Steven Marcus noted parenthetically in his Introduction to the collection, THE CONTINENTAL OP, the CURSE is the book in which Hammett fleshes out a lot of his going back and forth between what's reality and what's fiction, how they overlap, contaminate each other, and so forth.But you can see, definitely, that he's leaning toward the mythic element he was searching for and found in THE MALTESE FALCON. Anyways, I think that, with the FALCON, the CURSE is one of Hammett's most intellectual (in the sense of philosophic, abstract) works."},{"Title":"Nature's Pain Killers: Proven New Alternative and Nutritional Therapies for Chronic Pain Relief","review":"Once again Carl Germano brings us an excellent book filled with useful information and easy to follow ideas, nutrition suggestions, and encouragement.

Considering the centrality of issues regarding violence and society -not to mention identity politics, religious affiliations and the right to autonomy (only a few of the issues discussed here) today, a contribution by a group of important scholars and philosophers is very welcome. But this volume excedes most expectations. While its affiliations are for the most part deconstructive (cf. Hamacher, Derrida, Weber), its methods of analysis are diverse and pertinent -in other words, not limited to a 'strictly textual' analysis lacking connections to a 'real' world.The rigour of most essays ranges between good and excellent -except for Ali Behdad's erotism/colonialism and Caruth's (whose argument is rehearsed all over the place). Especially notable on an intellectual level are the de Vries' essay, which follows the Derridian attention to sacrifice (see the latter's &quot;Eating Well&quot; as well as the book dissected by de Vries, 'The Gift of Death'), and Hamacher's argument on multiculturalism. Gourgouris is also very smart -you might want to contrast the Enlightenment's political loci evoked in his essay to Agamben's explosion of the concentration camp's theme. Note also that his piece concerns explicitly and extensively the Declaration of the Rights of Man and Citizen. Samuel Weber's essay centers on Freud's writings during the First World War - though perhaps his best work on Freud is in his book The Legend of Freud.Further attention: issues of religion and the theological turn in philosophy; the relationship between state, law and violence; messianism and the individual subject.I first read this book a couple of years ago and i continue ot go back to it -and not simply for reasons of scholarship. It is an essential reference point for anyone interested in contemporary non-analytic philosophy and on a rigorous approach to the political-judiciary realm.

My wife loves romantic ethnic type novels and I assume that's why she bought this. I like baseball so I decided to give it a try. I am not really into romantic type novels but this book was compelling enough. In the northeast we have lots of Gypsies here so that to sort of got me curious.It is what it says it is. It is basically what this guy Austin is dreaming to be in the future. He goes through Vietnam, his own problems to finally get the chance at his dream and the story follows along well enough.There is one chapter that goes a little too long. The ending is not a \\"normal\\" ending as it is not what I expected at all. But still it was entertaining and a quick read. It makes you think differently about Gypsies."},{"Title":"Gypsy Dreamer","review":"This book is truly a dream for the Author.As he and his family are very special friends of mine and are very caring and loving people. Kevin has always,and I have known him all his life,been a giver, and gone out of his way to help a lot of people.I have not read the book since its release from the publisher. I do have it ordered!

We need to dream and hope! I cannot wait to read the edited book.This is truly a story of dreams,hope and love.

Who else would know what dreams are all about and how it feels when they come through.A sweet story with lots of love, dedication and commitment portrayed. It demonstrated that it does not matter who you are and where you come from dreams can come true: A simple story of genuine emotions, easy to read and emphasize. It seams so real.For those who know nothing about Gypsies, it gives you a beautiful insight of a gypsy's life. I was enlightened.I agree with a comment that another made. There is one chapter that is indeed a little too long; but this is his first book and I am sure there are lots more in store. I am looking forward to them. I do not agree that the ending was not \\"normal.\\" I think it ended well. Sad but it would have not been realistic but rather, more \\"fairy-tailish\\" if Austin did not die.LN"},{"Title":"The Mockingbird's Ballad","review":"There are two quotes on the back of the book from lead staff at the the General Joe Wheeler House and Museum; which suggests that this is indeed historical fiction related to General Joe Wheeler, and it is. Wheeler, while not a lead charachter, is a re-occuring subplot. A nice touch is the Universalist minister who shows up in the middle of the book - historicaly very accurate, just not much done in fiction. The war material also seemed right. So, historicaly it does seem accurate. The few famous walk-ins seemed right (nice to see Pingree and Rogers, but where's Clayton, Andrews, and Fuller?)It was a fun read, I enjoyed it."},{"Title":"Training Christians to counsel: A resource and training manual","review":"I have used Wright's book over the years and have found it to be the most thorough approach to training Christian's to counsel.

However, this book towers above any others in one respect. It is literally a pictorial biography of the theatre's greatest choreographer. From his birth to his death in 1998 the man is revealed in every aspect. Rare photos of the shows he has worked on and photographs reflecting his private life are throughout the book. Conrad does not go into excruciating detail on the problems some of his productions face: his well known temper; upbraiding actors in front of the cast; or the tantrum he had while &quot;West Side Story&quot; was trying out in Washington DC and Robbins, in a fit of pique, backed up and fell into the orchestra pit much to the delight of the actors. However, she does include all the highlights of his career and his early childhood. The book blew me away with the bevy of photographs. It is beautifully laid out and edited. A bit spendy but worth every penny. Any musical theatre fan will want this book on their shelves. Put your order in now"},{"Title":"Jerome Robbins: That Broadway Man, That Ballet Man","review":"Sure, Jerome Robbins was one of the few genius innovators in theatre and ballet. But, perhaps, a book written by someone interested in the man's flaws as well as his accomplishments, his failures as well as his triumphs, might have been better reading. Cristine Conrad says in her author's note that she was Robbins' friend for more than 30 years. To my way of thinking, her friendship gets in the way of good reporting. I'm not necessarily looking for a hatchet job on Robbins, but a writer less interested in (what we used to call) brown-nosing, would, most likely, have written a richer book.Why did I give it even four stars? The huge, varied collection of photographs in this book is fascinating and invaluable for anyone interested in Musical Theatre or 20th Century American Ballet.The real, full version of Robbins' life is yet to be written/published."},{"Title":"Jerome Robbins: That Broadway Man, That Ballet Man","review":"What an amazing tribute this book is -- not only to the genius of one of the greatest choreographer's in the history of dance and theater, but to the process of creativity as well. In this brilliant biography of Jerome Robbins, Christine Conrad has given us a work that can speak to every artist, working in every medium, about the passion and commitment it takes to create. Robbins is so eloquently captured on these pages, both in images, and in his own words, that I came away from the book feeling as if I had known him. And, feeling nothing but admiration for his courage, and his determination to excel. He truly was THAT BROADWAY MAN. It was so refreshing to read a biography about a famous person that focused on his work, and his success, instead of just dishing the dirt. I was not particularly interested in his failures; we all have them. I was interested in how he pushed through them and kept going...to give us a body of work so entertaining, and innovative, it literally takes your breath away. The book is absolutely fascinating. Cheers to Ms. Conrad for her intimate, insightful, and intuitive presentation of this extraordinary man."},{"Title":"Jerome Robbins: That Broadway Man, That Ballet Man","review":"If a picture -- in that old clich&eacute; -- is worth a thousand words, this gorgeous book is worth any number of doorstop-sized biographies. Using hundreds of never-before-seen photographs of Jerome Robbins and his friends, family, and associates (Leonard Bernstein, Aaron Copland, George Balanchine, Mary Martin, Irving Berlin, etc. etc), Christine Conrad has put together a stunning visual record of a great life in the theater, the first about Robbins ever to appear. Here are backstage and rehearsal pictures, family snapshots, rare clippings, production photographs, even reproduced pages from Robbins's own illustrated journals, with captions drawn from Robbins's published quotations; all are given context and coherence by Conrad's spare and perceptive text, which takes the form of introductions to the chronologically-arranged sections of the book. Her privileged, inside view of Robbins (she was, she tells us, a close friend of more than thirty years' standing) is never mawkish, cloying, or self-important; but in the end it is moving the way Robbins's own art, from &quot;Dances at a Gathering&quot; to &quot;On the Town&quot; to &quot;West Side Story,&quot; is moving -- because it is funny, tender, and beautiful."},{"Title":"Jerome Robbins: That Broadway Man, That Ballet Man","review":"Jerome Robbins is brought to vivid life in this amazing and stunning pictorial biography. Using hundreds of rare, fascinating, never-before-seen photographs; Robbins' personal journals; Robbins' own words about work; combined with Conrad's insightful narrative, this book shines a light on the man behind the image and takes us inside his working process and his daily life. He was obviously a very private man who shielded his personal life, but Conrad takes us behind the austere public image. Because of her longstanding relationship with Robbins, Conrad was given access to previously unseen early childhood and early dance photographs and Robbins' own drawings and writings. Any creative person in any field will be grateful for the descriptions of his unique working methods. Conrad doesn't gloss over his disappointments or personal failures - the story behind his firing from the film of West Side Story is fascinating - but she chooses to concentrate on illuminating his artistic process and bringing the man to life, with all his quirks, his humor, his fierce dedication to work -- and the great personal sacrifices he made for that work.

Not an encyclopedia. In fact, I had to wonder what Anne was thinking when she allowed this to be printed.

Unless you like reading the encyclopedia or the dictionary, there's really no reason to purchase this book. Fans of Ms. Rice already know these facts."},{"Title":"The Vampire Companion - The Official Guide To Anne Rice's The Vampire Chronicles","review":"I bought this book having already read each of the vampire chronicles, as well as several of the &quot;New Tales of the Vampires&quot;. It was probably a good thing too, as it's quite possible that if you haven't read all the books, the Companion will give away some very important plot twists.However, the book is obviously meant as a guide and reference point for people who are already very familiar with Rice's vampires, and not for people who are too lazy to read the books. A mind-bendingly comprehensive &quot;encyclopedia&quot; of everything you could possibly want to know about anything to do with the first 5 vampire chronicles.This book is made even stronger by the fact that it was written in conjunction with Anne Rice, and as such contains many asides and comments from her on the development of her characters, how she feels about them, and of course, the much-publicised parallels between the child vampire Claudia and her own daughter, who died of leukaemia at the age of 5.While there are many people who think Rice is extremely long-winded and a trifle strange to boot, those of us who thoroughly enjoy her fantastic novels and seductive characters will wonder how we ever made do without the excellent Vampire Companion."},{"Title":"The Vampire Companion - The Official Guide To Anne Rice's The Vampire Chronicles","review":"\\"The Vampire Companion\\" is a very exhaustive encyclopedia of most of the terms, characters, locations, and events in the Vampire Chronicles series. It only covers the first five books in this series, though (\\"Interview With the Vampire\\", \\"The Vampire Lestat\\", \\"The Queen of the Damned\\", \\"The Tale of the Body Thief\\", and \\"Memnoch the Devil\\"), which may bother more die hard Vampire fans. Information on the other four books (\\"The Vampire Armand\\", \\"Merrick\\", \\"Blood and Gold\\", and \\"Blackwood Farm\\") is obviously missing since they were published after this book.Just about everything's included in this mammoth 500+-paged book: maps, illustrations and photos, bits of Anne Rice information, a time line, in-depth character biographies, etc. Even the unpublished short story of \\"Interview With the Vampire\\" is included, which originated the novel one year later.If you're an Anne Rice fan--and especially if you enjoyed the Vampire Chronicles--then I highly recommend this official reference guide to her popular vampire series, even though it only covers half the books in the series. (Hopefully, there will be another revised edition published soon.) But for what it does cover, \\"The Vampire Companion\\" is very thorough and worthwhile to Vampire fans.

It was the title that drew me in, but the story is fascinating. Marilee Pierce Dunker does a just presentation of her father and mother's life in ministry with World Vision from its beginnings right through till her father's death.This biography was gripping for me; towards the latter half, I didn't put it down till it was all over. A very sobering true story of the stress and pressures that famous Christian leaders face, and it's effects on their families, it's a good find among biographies because it balances out the fantastic with the tragic and real issues that often get glossed over in other accounts of people's lives. The author, daughter of Bob Pierce, does in no way disrespect her father or mother, while portraying their difficulties, and I came away from the book wowed by the family's perseverance, challenged to look with a less critical eye on those who are \\"big names\\" in the Christian community. Everybody's human, and we all make both sacrifices and mistakes, but God's grace and power to change us is the main message that I believe Pierce-Dunker delivers in this book. A worthy read (I want to read it again) if you can weather the storm that you witness by reading of the Pierce family in this powerfully moving account."},{"Title":"An Almost Perfect Summer","review":"This is a great book.I've read it 3 times since I bought it.I could really relate to the main character in the book.I laughed when she laughed, I got mad when she did ,and I could feel her embarasment when she got humiliated.The book is about a girl that has a summer job as a babysitter and during the summer she goes through many traumatizing,and maybe even funny, experiences"},{"Title":"The Trampling of the Lilies","review":"This is a good, sound, albeit early and somewhat weak, Sabatini novel. It's his first in the setting he handled best, revolutionary France. The style is mostly vintage Sabatini, though the plot is somewhat weak by his later standards; the ending works both intellectually and emotionally, though the mature Sabatini would have come up with something more satisfying. The plot, as usual, is assisted by coincidences and characters acting in the one way they would obviously avoid; but it avoids the unacceptable holes of most of his earlier novels."},{"Title":"Redefining European Security (Contemporary Issues in European Politics)","review":"Hodge's &quot;Redefining European Security&quot; does not even dwell upon the fundamentals of defense and military strategies. Its a hodgepodge of basic definitions cut and pasted from some of Europe's local newspapers and from &quot;un-named sources.&quot; Truly, the European experiment, most notably Britain, while less drastic in it's security failures, was discouraging. This is in complete contrast to Hodge's Conservatist bias."},{"Title":"Cookies And Kisses (Zebra Bouquet)","review":"I was delighted with this book. It was funny and sweet. For once it wasn't centered around a baby or sex. Although, eventually the book had both. It was romantic to see the simplicity and love that goes into building a family. Neil is lonely and Taylor is the perfect friend and a great mother figure for Neil's kids. The Kids love Taylor, the town loves Taylor. Taylor is in love with Neil, but he wants to keep it just friends because he has been hurt badly by his ex-wife. Taylor is a very perceptive woman and understands Neil's pain and does not play any games, although it is hard for her not to show how much she loves him. The town, Neil's kids, even the dog Ollie loves Taylor. It was a lot of fun to see if Neil can conquer his fears to love Taylor back the way that she deserves. The cookies were a good touch. Taylor bakes cookis and is good at it. Even I was wanting to try them and was delighted to find the recipe in the back of the book. This is a great book that will indeed warm the heart."},{"Title":"Rock magnetism","review":"A 1961 publication, some in the MKS system, but unfortunelay mostly CGS, but still good basics.

I asked an antelope in the front yard what she thought and she agreed with me."},{"Title":"The Social History of Art (4 Volume Set)","review":"kalinin@terra.com.brWhen I purchased The Social History of Art I had never intended to read it from cover to cover. It is, in fact, a bulky book, which covers the history of art from pre-historic to contemporary times. I thought it would be one of those books you place on your bedside table and from time to time, have a look at it, and read bits and pieces when you are sleepless in the small hours. Surprisingly, I started reading it from the very beginning and couldn't stop till I reached the final sentence. I still cannot make out how a single author managed to cope with such an ambitious project.Unlike other books of art, which stick to the description of each style, and some artists' works as something divorced from other events that took place at the time when they were produced, this book contextualises all the art productions according to the philosophical principles that underlie them, establishing the necessary link with the historical panorama and the social and political backdrop at the time that each artist lived and produced his/her works. Above all, Hauser's The Social History doesn't stick to the analysis of the visual arts as most art books do, but on the contrary, his broad scope extends to literature, drawing, paintings and even films. Never had I dreamed of understanding art as I could understand after reading Hauser's book.Besides, as an amateur admirer of art, I was thrilled to realise that I could read and grasp his meaning with no extra effort; even so, he never patronises the reader. After reading this book, I realised that concepts I had always taken at face value and had never disputed, had gone down the drain. To my surprise, artists such as Shakespeare and Michelangelo are, in his book, not Renaissance artists but Mannerist artists. So, you learn to evaluate the artists and classify them using a different criterion. Well, this book is good value for money!"},{"Title":"The Social History of Art (4 Volume Set)","review":"I have had the four volumes of Hauser's \\"Social History of Art\\" for many years. I picked them up while studying art history in college. I had refered to the books on specific topics but had never read the entire series of books. I finally got around to reading the first volume of four. Hauser's prose is densely inert. It's a very hard read. The books were translated from the Hingarian in 1950 and that may be part of the problem. I appreciate the comprehensive knowledge of Hauser but this is an academic work and not a stylistic success. It will probably take me months to complete the other volumes."},{"Title":"Blueberries for Sal","review":"My daughter and I both adore this book.

Sal was nowhere in sight! Apparently the mother had picked berries for some time thinking that the little bear following her was Sal. More alarmingly, when the mother found Sal, Sal reported having followed a large bear around for some time. Probably the cub's mother who had also mistaken Sal for her own cub. Alarming! Confusing! But Sal said it was fun! Fortunately no one was hurt, but parents should keep close track of their children when picking berries for the winter on Blueberry Hill!Author/illustrator Robert McCloskey has created a delightful set of images to bring his timeless tale of mistaken identity to life. My son, Christopher, had a hard time deciding which was funnier: \\"Blueberries for Sal\\" or \\"Curious George Takes a Job.\\" Sal is definitely more charmingly life-like, bringing back the by-gone era of canning fruit for the winter.

Older children could read it themselves, younger ones could have someone read it to them."},{"Title":"Blueberries for Sal","review":"This is a story of a young girl picking blueberries with her mother and a young bear picking blueberries with its mother. As they amble along picking berries and eating them, the bear gets seperated from its mother as does Sal get seperated from her mother. The story is gentle from beginning to end. It brings back many memories of picking blueberries and eating them faster than you can pick them. This is a classic that I grew up with and my children are growing up with now.

Or are they really that different? With McCloskey's incredible eye for natural detail from a child's point of view, this story tells a hilarious tale about a human mother and child (the eponymous Sal) who go blueberry hunting and run into their bear counterparts, who are storing up food for hibernation. Not only are the sound effects hilarious (my son loves to chant the KERPLINK! KERPLANK! KERPLUNK! part along with me) the story also teaches a lot about comparing and contrasting characteristics in the natural world, and the striking and original blue-and-white illustrations make this book unique.

What I mean by that, is that each element of the book (story, illustrations, lessons, morals, entertainment value) is all equally displaced and of the highest quality. You can really tell as an adult that a lot of care went into putting this book out, and I remember as a child rereading this book over and over again, which definitely means in my mind that the book is good, or at least entertaining.The story is about little Sal, who goes with her mother to help her pick berries. Sal loves berries and ends up eating all of hers, so she wonders off away from her mother to find more. Along the way, she runs into a bear. That bear has a cub, and that little bear is put into a similar situation with Sal's mother. I won't spoil the rest, but I assure you it is very grabbing for young readers and generates appreciation for caring parents.I'd also like to point out that this book is appropriate for both boys and girls, as I read it countless times when I was young (I'm a guy), and my young daughter loves it now.Darien Summers, author ofThe Mischievous Hare, a children's book."},{"Title":"Blueberries for Sal","review":"This is a simple book of a Little Sal, and Little Sal's mother, and Little Bear, and Little Bear's mother, who get mixed up with each other on Blueberry Hill.It's very realistically written and illustrated, and the exciting part isn't too scary for little ones.I will note that it's a bit long - maybe better for kids with longer attention spans than shorter ones.

My 2 1/2 year old boy loves, loves, loves this book. It has a bit more of a plot than someone his age is used to. The first time we got to a point where the story switches for the moment from the story of Sal and her mommy to the story of Little Bear and his mommy, he stopped me and paged back to look at the pages abiout Sal some more. Once we got past that, he came to love BLUEBERRIES FOR SAL. We read this one over, and over, and over. I have the sense that this book stretched out how much story he could manage, as it is longer and more complex than any storybook we had tried previously.BLUEBERRIES FOR SAL has also been a great seasonal story for us in fall and early winter. The book is set in fall, and it has allowed us to talk about seasons. Our boy is quite interested in the idea of winter and how the people and the bears are both getting ready for winter.BLUEBERRIES FOR SAL was one of our bedtime stories tonight, and I have a promise now to make blueberry pancackes for breakfast again.

The story has some funny turns when both mother and child get separated and wind up finding the wrong family member. Imagine that! Well, all's well that ends well. And, guess you wondered what happened in the end don't you? You'll have to see for yourself. McCloskey sadly passed away on June 30, 2003 most of his life he illustrated and wrote children's books. He wrote eight books during his life. All the book reflect on family experiences, small-town life, and life in Boston. His story, 'Make Way for Ducklings' is set in Boston. McCloskey is one of the few authors that depicted Americana in a light-hearted vision through his illustration. He will be sadly missed.

And jam. And muffins. This delicious tale has aged beautifully -- how right the Caldecott people were when they chose to give this book an honorable mention. From that mouth-watering first scene, to the peaceful panorama of the hilly blueberry patch on a fine warm day, McCloskey\`s sweet (but not cloyingly so) tale and charming drawings of a little girl, a little bear, and their mothers, who mix themselves up while picking (and eating) blueberries, is a delectable reminder of the simple pleasures in life. My little boys empathize with Sal\`s sincere intentions, and thrill to the excitement of such a close encounter with the bears."},{"Title":"Blueberries for Sal","review":"Robert McCloskey is a well known children's writer and this book is one of the reasons why (the other is Make Way for Ducklings).

The appreciation of this book grows with age - making is a perfect gift/hardcover selection."},{"Title":"Blueberries for Sal","review":"Robert McCloskey, author of the classic \\"Make Way for Ducklings\\" is one of the greatest American children's authors. Blueberries for Sal is a great introduction to this author for the younger listener who might not have the patience or understanding for \\"Ducklings\\" or \\"One Morning in Maine,\\" another beautiful McCloskey book. My two-and-a-half year old just adores this story and could hear it over and over. Here, little Sal (who is much older in \\"Maine\\") goes with her mother to pick blueberries to can for the winter and finds herself all mixed with a bear mother and child who have come to gorge themselves on blueberries. Sal's and Little Bear's frustration at being expected to keep up with their busy mothers rings true with toddlers and they adore the hilarious mother-child mix-up that ensues. Every child should read this one, if only so that children learn that people used to can their own food!"},{"Title":"Blueberries for Sal","review":"The classic, very old picture book from 1948 has lost nothing of its charm, and the illustrations are very laboriously drawn with great eye for the detail (little Sal's too big bib'n'braces falling from her small shoulders, for example). The inside cover illustration where Sal plays with the rubber rings for the preserve glasses reminded me of my own childhood when my mum made jellies and preserves.There's lots of text so I recommend from 3 years up and probably more for girls (as they tend to have a longer attention span). Also, I'd rather get the hardcover version because really, besides being a beautiful picture book, this little gem could be a perfect hand-me-down for generations to come."},{"Title":"Blueberries for Sal","review":"That's the only way to describe the illustrations in this classic children's book.

I think I'm going to have to renew it because it's all he wants to listen to in the car! On one side is a nice reading of the story, and on the other, little songs, games and comments from the readers. Some are familiar, such as \\"Teddy Bear, Teddy Bear, Turn Around\\" and \\"The Bear Went Over The Mountain\\" and some are new, such as \\"No Bears Out Tonight\\".

THEY WERE COOL."},{"Title":"Blueberries for Sal","review":"I was skeptical about the McCloskey classics and have to admit was surprised when my 26-month-old really enjoyed the book. It's simple and easy to follow - the text and story are perfectly suitable for a read-a-loud for 2 year olds. Also the simple but easy to follow drawings engaged his interest and were a nice alternative to the flashy and elaborate colorful pictures usually found in children's picture books and a great simple alternative to our flashy fast-paced media culture. I also thought it was a great opportunity to help develop attention span. The length and complexity of the text was just the right level of challenge - beyond what he was used to hearing but he didn't tune out because the story line itself was one he felt he could understand or at least figure out. I'm finding all of McCloskey's books great for word choice. Most of the words are within our 2 1/2 year old's range but there are always some that are quite new and challenging so I'm glad that the text isn't dumbed down. It gives him exposure to more and unusual words that he's not likely to come across in everyday conversational language. Additionally, the comprehensible story line and the pictures can provide the support that he needs to be able to figure out the meanings of some of the novel words. So actually, I thought this was an excellent book for transitioning to more challenging text and more detailed story lines, which 3 months later at 29 months, he has done - now he's listening to \\"Make Way for Ducklings\\", another great and more complex McCloskey book for the toddler/preschool crowd. From a diversity viewpoint, it's important to be ever so slightly cautious. The book was written in the 1940s and it reflects the gender, race and class stereotypes of the time but not to an extent that makes it objectionable as long as it is only one of a few of such books in the child's collection. The story itself is very, very cute and a good book about respecting other animals and seeing them as having feelings and needs as well as humans. Because there's a sequel with an older Sal, it's also a great opportunity to introduce the child to the concept of a continuing story (which they will encounter at a later age in chapter books and series)."},{"Title":"Blueberries for Sal","review":"My granddaughter absolutely loves this book, and why not? It is a warmly conceived tale of mothers loving their children...beautiful drawings and prose. But, as a biologist now retired and living in wooded Appalachia, I can't help feeling some discomfort with the story line. I know I would not let any small child wander off during berry picking season. Yes, there are bears...and many of them have cubs. It's a simple fact that needs to be respected and heeded. Many children's books are full of fanciful animals serving as characters with human charms and emotions. I have no problem with all of those. Perhaps it's because McCloskey otherwise draws so carefully from nature that I squirmed a little as I turned the pages. I wonder if he thought this through as he wrote."},{"Title":"Blueberries for Sal","review":"I love these classic books and I remember it from being a kid myself. Such a simple story and well done.

Ranking right up there with Dr. Seuss and Frog and Toad Are Friends, the illustrations and writing in this wonderful story make a special time out of story time.Sal sneaks some berries out of Mom's bucket, and then wanders off for a nap. Waking up, she follows \\"Mom\\" pushing through the underbrush...who turns out to be a kindly Mother Bear. Little Bear, meanwhile, has done the same...ending up following Sal's Mom!Sorting out the children and Moms, with both families leaving full of blueberries, helps us all to understand just how alike we are -- all beings who inhabit this lovely earth.Told with humor and great illustrations, this is an excellent gift in hardback for the new baby, or for any child's birthday or going-away gift, ages 1-10. Highly recommended. I've read this book to my children probably 35 times over the years, and I look forward to reading it to my grandchildren as well."},{"Title":"Blueberries for Sal","review":"Of the thousands of stories I read my daughter as she grew, this was my favorite.

Brings back great childhood memories :)"},{"Title":"Blueberries for Sal","review":"This was the first book my kindergarten teacher read to our class on the first day on kindergarten in 1970. The story centers around McCloskey's own daughter, Sal and his wife picking blueberries on a hill in Maine. While picking blueberries Sal and her mother become separated but are unaware of it. Instead each unknowingly ends up picking blueberries with a member of the bear family. Sal's mother and Mother Bear both discover they have been picking blueberries with the wrong child and go in search of their own children. Each mother finds her child and so ends the day of blueberry picking on the hill. McCloskey's illustrations for this book are done in blue ink and are superb! This book is not only my favorite from childhood but my daughter's as well."},{"Title":"Blueberries for Sal","review":"Kuplink, kuplank, kuplunk. This is the sound that Little Sal makes as she follows behind her mother dropping blueberries into her perennially empty pail. Why does the pail remain empty even as Sal keeps dropping (kuplink) in (kuplank) blueberries (kuplunk)? Because she withdraws and eats them equally fast.Hustle, hustle. This is what Little Bear does as he tries to keep up with his mother. They are also out for blueberries, coming up the other side of the hill.Sal and Bear (both Little) are so engrossed in eating berries that they become separated from their respective mothers. Before you know it their paths are crossed - Little Sal encounters Little Bear's mother and vice versa. And how do things get sorted out? Each mother listens for the distinctive sound - by now you know which one - and in the end is reunited with her cub.This vintage book, over fifty years old, is a timeless classic. My daughters never tired of it, and neither did I!"},{"Title":"Blueberries for Sal","review":"This picture book originally was published in 1948, but it's depictions of small children are timeless. A bear cub goes on a berry-picking outing with his mother at the same time that a human child also goes on a berry-picking outing with his mother. Soon the respective parties are engrossed in eating blueberries. Their sweet tooths and greed for more berries lead them to get mixed up and eventually follow the wrong mothers, so that a bear cub is following behind a woman and a child is following behind a bear cub. But it is the symbol of \\"mother\\" that gives the small ones their sense of security no matter who or what, which allows for the plot twist to succeed and reach its resolution. At the same time, it made a universal observation about \\"mother\\" while providing insight into young children.This book is best read aloud to youngsters in order that its literary qualities may captivate the listener's imagination. The dramatic plot with a twist is engaging in well-ordered progression. This imaginative picture book should sit on your child's shelf beside a copy of another great Robert McCloskey picture book - \\"Make Way for Ducklings\\"(1941)."},{"Title":"Blueberries for Sal","review":"Love the McCoskly books.

A book for all ages to enjoy."},{"Title":"Blueberries for Sal","review":"This book is one of the most unforgettable children's books of all time. Its simple drawings, charming story, and lovely blueberry imagery make it a delight for children, especially young ones. The pacing is slow and deliberate, easy for young children to follow. The story is vividly told--you can almost hear the sound of Sal's blueberries dropping into her bucket. The encounter with the mama and baby bear give it a bit of excitement. Make sure obtain a hard cover copy of this classic as you will be reading it to your young ones over and over again."},{"Title":"Blueberries for Sal","review":"Great value to include a read along CD with this book.

I can't wait until she is old enough to sit on my lap and really understand the story when I read it to her. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Blueberries for Sal","review":"My kindergarten teacher had also read this book to me and now I'm reading it to my kids, but really to my son because he's 4 and my daughter is 8. She listens to it when it comes time for me to read it to him because she would find it amusing. Blueberries for Sal preserve a distinct since of life when tin pails and wood smoke, bobby pins and rambling dirt roads were routine. At the same time it is a timeless portrayal of curiosity and maternal instinct as Sal and her mother find themselves sharing their berry patch with a hungry bear cub and its mother. The words flow in a natural rhythm, creating patterns that build anticipation.Although the illustrations appear a bit outdated the story is an excellent account of the misadventures of children, human & animal alike. Every mother with a small child (s) can relate to the mischievous & innocent thoughts of wanting to eat more than they care to pick.\`Blueberries for Sal' is a delightful book that will hold your child (s) interest to the end. Not too long and not too short, just right! If this book appeals to you I would also recommend. \`Millions of Cats,' \`We're Going On A Bear Hunt,' and \`Hats for sale.'"},{"Title":"Blueberries for Sal","review":"My daughter loved this book from the age of six and continues to love it now that she is just about eight. This book doesn't hold my six year old son's interest as long as it did my daughter's but he does like it. Makes a nice gift for any that age group."},{"Title":"Blueberries for Sal","review":"The story is sweet, set in an earlier time but does not come across dated. There is an opportunity for math lessons (Sal keeps eating her berries = subtraction; tremendous mouthful = size/proportion) here. Beyond that, kids just love this story. I don't know if it is that there is one main character, a child, and another prominent character, a bear, or what, but I have given this as a gift and it is always a favorite."},{"Title":"Blueberries for Sal","review":"This book originally found it's way to our house in an old box of kids books that were my husband's as a child. This book has become the favorite book of my 3 year-old. The story is so simple and sweet, and she never tires of it. I've read our tattered old copy over a hundred times, and I still think it's a GREAT book."},{"Title":"Blueberries for Sal","review":"Being from Maine, I may be a little biased, but I think this is one of the best children's books ever written. It combines wonderful illustrations with a fine story that blends humor and drama as the blueberry pickers get mixed up. The story has been a childhood favorite for years and remains as fresh as it did at its first release in 1948."},{"Title":"Blueberries for Sal","review":"I loved this book as a child because I saw myself in Sal who was curious and spunky and had a serious independent streak. She was and is what is called a Tom Boy. And like Sal and her Mom, my Mom and Aunt Ann would take me with them to pick blueberries or what we call huckleberries here in the west coast, and on the hillsides of Mt St Helens, Mt Rainier, Mt Shasta etc.Knowing that we saw black bears and always had to be prepared if cubs were around, made this story &quot;real&quot; to me. And I love stories where the girl isn't a whimp, but is allowed to be herself and is shown doing both normal activities but activities that show a more rural or self sufficent idea.I also like the story because it is a great Mother and daughter tale and shows that even the human animal like the bear and her cub, have such caring personalities. Oh and I also indetified with the eat more berries than you pick theme.Unless someone has tasted a sweet freshly picked blueberry or strawberry etc they have no idea how wonderful the taste and smell is and that you really cannot stop at just one. I wonder how many parents who have taken the kids along to pick berries have done so knowing that the kid will probably not produce much fruit for canning or baking, and may even come home with a tummy ache. But that it is a great outing and make for great memories."},{"Title":"Blueberries for Sal","review":"I bought this hardback version to replace the cheap little paperback ordered from my sons preschool (yep- its a keeper!) I love the size & quality. It comes with a nice dust jacket but we always remove those since they get ripped & damaged so easily. The hard cover is just as beautiful, pictorial & glossy. I was pleasantly surprised to find it was made in USA. Its a huge book that is perfect for sharing with your child. No disappointments."},{"Title":"Blueberries for Sal","review":"Beautiful symmetry of nature, family, and Nurture! The delicateness of this book begins with its cover: a young girl sitting in a bush picking blueberries. Interestingly, this book only has two colors on its cover-royal blue and taupe, the rest of illustrations are in royal blue. Although the book lacks color, Robert McCloskey did not lack imagination. The book explains how a mother teaches her young to save food for the harsh winter to come. It is a valuable lesson of love, patience, and staying together. The children (little Sal and a baby bear) ignore their respective mothers and wander off, eventually are reunited and continue their task of blueberry hunting. The quantity of writing allows room for discussion of images, cause and effect and possibilities as you turn the page. The book also implies the wisdom that comes along with being an adult, \\"She was old enough to be shy of people (bears), even a very small person like Little Sal (Little Bear)\\". Of course, my chest pouted out as I told my boys that moms know best. I enjoyed this book and would recommend it to any mother as a perfect bedtime story. There are no dangers presented in reading besides being whisked away in a charming tale."},{"Title":"Blueberries for Sal","review":"Blueberries for Sal depicts the love and protection of mothers in a sweet, down-to-earth way. Sal and her mother pick blueberries to freeze for the winter, while Little Bear and his mother traverse another part of the hillside eating blueberries to prepare for hibernation. When Sal and Little Bear end up following each other's mothers instead of their own, the story and its illustrations only get cuter.As with all of McCloskey's books, the illustrations are charming and speak as loudly as the well-written words.To read more of my children's book recommendations, visit larsenreviews.org."},{"Title":"Blueberries for Sal","review":"Little Sal and her mother go to Blueberry hill to pick berries, and they plan to can them as preserves for the winter. Little Sal soons starts eating all the berries she picks, plus some from her mother's pail. Encouraged to go off to find berries to pick by herself, mother and Sal become separated. On the other side of the mountain, Little Bear and his mother are coming to eat all the blueberries they can to get as fat as possible so they can survive the winter. They, too, get separated.Soon, Little Sal stumbles onto following mother bear and Little Bear is following Sal's mother. Eventually, the mothers discover the mistake, back away in shyness from the other's child, and look for their own offspring. Along the way, the children run into bird mothers and their families as well. Everyone goes home with the correct mother, and the last drawing has Little Sal with her mother in an old-fashioned kitchen with a wood stove working on the preserves.The story is gently and beautifully told, and wonderfully complemented by the illustrations (also drawn by Mr. McClosky).It is a good introduction for children to the way that all human and animal families work, the need to prepare for the future, and that one has to pay attention to where one is going. It will also interest them in blueberry picking, which is a wonderful family occupation. It is also very heart-warming the way Mr. McClosky has taken the potential fright out of a situation where a child has wandered off and run into a mother bear. The child can draw her or his own lesson that they would not want that to happen to them, rather than having the story provide terror.Mr. McClosky has expressed a benign but significant role to nature that will serve families well. I wonder if he ever visited the Galapagos, because the animals there and the people act much like in this story.Overcome your disbelief stalls about how children can learn from stories with this outstanding book. I rate it one of my top five of all time for younger children. It was a favorite of all four of our children. I hope it will be for you and your children and grandchildren, as well.Think of this story the next time you eat some blueberry preserves."},{"Title":"Blueberries for Sal","review":"A children's book about a little girl named Sal who goes up into the hills to pick blueberries with her mother and eats as many blueberries as she puts into her pail! She encounters a mother bear and her cub also picking blueberries; but, soon the little cub is trailing Sal's mother while Sal is trailing the mother bear. McCloskey's blue and white illustrations are perfect for this story and it resulted in the book being a 1949 Caldecott Honor book (i.e., a runner-up to the Medal winner) for best illustration in a book for children. It is a must for the shelves of any parent of a preschooler or the shelf of any serious student of children literature."},{"Title":"Blueberries for Sal","review":"Famed author Robert McCloskey (\\"Make Way for Ducklings,\\" \\"One Morning in Maine,\\" and others) wrote and illustrated this gently humorous parallel tale of two moms and their daughters on a blueberry hunt. One pair is human, and the other pair is bear!. As they proceed up opposite sides of rolling hill covered in blueberries, each member of the species copies the other: The moms focus on the task at hand, remembering the harsh winter ahead; the children (\\"Little Sal\\" and \\"Little Bear\\") focus on the immediate pleasures of eating blueberries--so much so, that each gets lost.In a deftly portrayed switch, McCloskey shows the Little Bear following Little Sal's mom, and Little Sal following the Little Bear's mom. The two lost children are unafraid of following the mismatched grown-ups (ok, so McCloskey takes some liberties in this very light book). Eventually the two moms turn around and see who is following: Little Bear's mother discovers Sal and turns away: (\\"She was old enough to be shy of people, even a very small person like Little Sal.\\") Meanwhile, Little Sal's mom discovers Little Bear, and the mother back away: (\\"She was old enough to be shy of bears, even very small bears like Little Bear.\\") Each pair reunites and returns home, with an adventure and berries to savor over the winter.McCloskey's deep blue-black drawings complement the appealing symmetry and innocence of the book, and the period furnishings, uncluttered landscape, and fashions add to the book's sentimental and enduring attraction. This is a very good bedtime story for little ones who can appreciate an affectionate and tender book."},{"Title":"Blueberries for Sal","review":"Blueberries for Sal is a favorite book from childhood and is still one of my favorite books to this very day. This book is about a young girl who finds herself caught in a wild adventure while she is picking blueberries with her mother. It is a perfect book to sit down and read together as a family, and is a story both children and parents can relate to. I will never forget listening to my mother read, eating blueberries, and singing kurplink, kurplank, kurplunk."},{"Title":"Blueberries for Sal","review":"OK, I have to admit that my review is probably completely unnecessary in view of the fact that there are already 55 positive ones but... I have vowed to make notes on all of the library books we check out each week so that, should I have a book faintly perched on the edge of my mind, I will be able to scan back through my reviews until I find the one I am remembering. That said, this book has been the naptime request of my 4 year old for several days and she \\"read\\" it to a pillow on the sofa just yesterday. She especially loves the phrase \\"Where, oh where, is my child?\\" She got that one dead-on. This is an excellent book for retelling and could be acted out very successfully in a short dramatic play in kindergarten. The plot is simple and fun and leads to great discussions about how humans prepare for winter (gathering the harvest, preserving foods by canning them) vs. animals who hibernate (that would be the bear). This book is, of course, need I say it???? A winner. You won't be disappointed if you purchase this one. And little Sal (Sally? It's a girl) is as cute as a button. With such wonderful 1940's illustrations, and a warm message, this book is a cozy reminder of days gone by."},{"Title":"Blueberries for Sal","review":"My daughters and I love this book. I've been a fan of McCloskey since I was a kid myself, and I was pleased to be able to find this book re-released for my own children. It's a classic, and one that belongs on the shelf of any parent with wee ones.The story is simple, two mothers (human and bear) take their children out berry picking, where the children wander off, and manage to switch places. The pictures are charming, the plot is lovely, the text suitable for a young reader to read themselves, or for younger ones to have read to them. All in all a wonderful children's classic, don't hesitate to buy it."},{"Title":"Blueberries for Sal","review":"Blueberry Hill must be a wonderful place. Sal and his mother get to go blueberry hunting there, to find enough to can for the following winter.Sal, a little girl of about five or six years, goes up the hill in search of the blueberries. Along the way, she tends to eat more than she finds, knowing a good thing when she tastes it.Meanwhile, Little Bear and his mother are doing the same thing, on the other side of the hill.Sal wanders off, looking for her mother. Little Bear, too, strays from the path. Both lost, they each go hither and far. Their two separate adventures converge as they discover the mother of the other, surprising the mom.\\"Blueberries for Sal\\" shows how all mothers are concerned for their children, and how all will look for them when they are lost. In typical Robert McCloskey fashion, the pictures are richly detailed, illuminating the imagination as he tells a gentle story.Readers who loved, \\"Make Way for Ducklings,\\" will see this as a good partner book. Unlike \\"Make Way for Ducklings,\\" though is that in \\"Blueberries for Sal\\" there is more storytelling and less poetic sounding text. Both work marvelously.I fully recommend \\"Blueberries for Sal\\" by Robert McCloskey.Anthony Trendleditor, HungarianBookstore.com"},{"Title":"Blueberries for Sal","review":"This is the story of a little girl that goes blueberry picking with her mother. She is helping her pick blueberries but she is more concerned with eating them then she is with keeping them so her mother can make things with them.

The cub and Sal did not follow their mothers. They just wondering off eating there merry way around the mountain. Eventually Sal and the cub end up all mixed up and with the wrong mothers and they set out to get with the right ones again.I love this book. It is a great tale and it is so much fun to read over and over again. The pictures are great and so realistic.

This is definitely a book that I want for my class collection and I think the author did a really good job at making this book fun and full of adventure."},{"Title":"Blueberries for Sal","review":"The original \\"Are You My Mother?\\" book and a classic through and through. In this classic tale the ever androgynous looking Sal and her mother go blueberry picking in the wild outdoors. Sal, voracious for blueberries, loses her mother and attaches herself to a mother bear, just as the bear's child loses its mother and attaches itself to Sal's. The swap is easily cleared up and in the end no harm is done. Sal's mother, seeing that her child is a baby bear and not her own kid, doesn't seem particularly alarmed by the odd turn of events. She is wary of the bear (a wise thing to be) but finds her own child quickly and easily. This is a charming little story. Sweet and simple. McCloskey's illustrations and text have lasted for at least fifty years, and will undoubtedly last another fifty. Some scenes are absolutely entrancing as well. As Sal walks around a large boulder in search of her misplaced parent, McCloskey's lines display a real sense of human movement. This is such a charming story that I would recommend it to anyone anytime. It is rare to meet the ageless text, but in this book you have exactly that."},{"Title":"Blueberries for Sal","review":"Having grown up in the part of Maine this book is set in, and having had many days as a child Sal's age picking blueberries and eating them, I can tell you that this book captures perfectly the feeling of such a day.

I can hear the clink of berries in a nearly empty pail, as Sal did. I never ran into a bear, but I can almost feel like I did, from reading this book.

It lets you use you intuition to discover the meaning of each card by using graphic illistrations."},{"Title":"Fantastical Tarot: 78-Card Deck","review":"&quot;I love this deck!&quot; Well almost everyone says that in these reviews so there is nothing new there.There is a darkness here in many cards, but it is usually tempered with light. For example the Ace of Swords shows a sharp, medieval hilted sword half buried in a mound of dirt in the foreground. There is a less than friendly castle in the distance with darkly foreboding sky. Do I want to &quot;go&quot; there? No way. I am 'stuck' where I am, no promising place to go, no easy way out. BUT, there are small flowers nearby and a vine gently wraps the sharp edges of the sword showing that there is still softness my current situation and beauty nearby. That was not my card, but a friend's and it was VERY true [smile].I think the most important thing about picking a deck -- and you will here this often -- is to take your time and make sure the deck speaks to you. This is my second deck. Another was giving to me many years ago. It didn't work for me even though I enjoyed looking at the symbols. When &quot;I&quot; look at the Rider-Waite deck, by far the most popular it seems, I get NOTHING! Yet I have friends that would use nothing else. So some research is a good thing. I spent many, many hours at the Aeclectic Tarot website doing research and looking at the cards. Then I used her link to come to Amazon and buy the deck that seemed right for me.I am a new tarot 'reader' and found that memorizing the past ideas of others was neither fun nor productive. With THIS deck, because it resonates to me somehow, I can look at the cards and know the answers. As an artist, I appreciate the beautiful work of the paintings. That is what they really are -- paintings that you can journey into -- and find your answers."},{"Title":"Fantastical Tarot: 78-Card Deck","review":"The artwork in this tarot deck is very strange, similar in type to the elongated and angular figures of the Londo Tarot, but if anything, these are more stylized and eccentric. The colors are very rich and very dark, and despite the overall angular extravagance, the figures seem beautiful in an anorexic sort of way. Very few of these cards are overtly happy, but there are quite a few that are serene, and the brooding aspect is more often meditative than pained.There is no blood and gore, and nudity is occasionally present but not explicit or inappropriate. Some of the pictures can be construed as threatening or scary, but there are also little flashes of sweetness here and there. The pictures are pleasingly framed in gold and black. The card backs have a fully reversible dragon design that is quite lovely and at first glance looks abstract. The card stock and printing are of good quality and the cards shuffle well.Suits are traditional Swords, Cups, Pentacles, and Wands. The Fool is unnumbered and Strength is VIII, Justice XI. All the cards have full scenes, many of them depicting very different ideas than their counterparts in other decks. The deck's divinatory meanings are mostly but not entirely similar to the meanings used in other more traditional decks like the Thoth or the RWS. For example, in most decks the fives are uniformly difficult, while here only the 5 of Swords and the 5 of Cups are hard. In most decks the 8 of Wands is about swiftness, here it's about peace and quiet. The new meanings suit the new pictures and should be easy to adjust to. The LWB is more useful than most and gives both upright and reversed meanings.This is a deck that gets more inviting the more one looks at it, and should read well once one gets over the initial shock over the art style. I wouldn't use this as my only reading deck (fat chance!), but it's a terrific little change of pace, and may well turn out to be suited to those more dreamy existential episodes most common in early adulthood. These sullen little cards can get quite endearing if you give them a chance."},{"Title":"Fantastical Tarot: 78-Card Deck","review":"This is a lovely, somewhat unique interpretation of the standard Rider-Waite. This is -not- a Rider-Waite clone, but I'd say the majority of things are the same. All of the people are incredibly pale (except two, I think), and their features are sharp and angular. The art style is similar to the Londa deck and the Tarot of a Moon Garden deck . . . sort of a mix, actually. Strength is VIII and Justice is XI. The cards are edged in a metallic gold and black frame, which gives more of an elegant look to the already enchanting art. They're glossed, which made me a little afraid to use this deck for fear of scratching it up and making the shine go away, but with proper care, I don't see how this would be too much of a problem. The cardstock is nice and seems firm enough not to bend easily.One gripe is that although the Pentacles suit was not renamed, the &quot;pentacles&quot; are almost like gold CDs. It would have been more appropriate to call the suit &quot;Disks.&quot; Most of the symbolism ought to jump right out and grab the reader, but not all cards have outright symbolism. However, working with the cards, there shouldn't be too much difficulty with readings.The little white booklet is much nicer than the usual and offers two different spreads: one is the Celtic Cross, and the other is called the Venus Spread for emotional concerns. All of the Major Arcana have descriptions of the cards as well as the divinatory and reversed meanings. The Minor Arcana interpretations do not include descriptions, but they aren't necessary, anyway; it's just an added bonus for the Majors.Although some would term the style of art &quot;gothic,&quot; it also has some very bright pictures. Of course, I feel that even the lighter cards have a dark feel to them -- but this is a charming, intriguing dark, not a frightening one. The Minor Arcana are full scenes, not pips. Nudity in the deck is a rarity, but be aware that it is there. For clients, this deck may be a little too dark, but it would be good for personal reflection or for friends. The back design is two connected whitish dragons and is reversible.One other note: all of the beings in the deck do -not- have their eyes closed, although it sometimes appears that way. They do not have pupils or irises; their entire eyes are the color the iris would be. For instance, if someone has brown eyes, their -entire- eye (except the lid, of course) is brown. You will be able to tell if the eye is closed by the color and if you can see lashes resting against cheeks.This is a lovely deck, and although it creeped me out at first, I've been drawn to it over and over again. If you don't want it as a reading deck, it's a beautiful collectible, as well -- although it is completely useable. Even the box is fairly sturdy. This artist also has another deck coming out called the Vampire Tarot, which I'm eager to see."},{"Title":"Fantastical Tarot: 78-Card Deck","review":"I recently purchased this tarot after giving my original copy to a friend a few years ago. It is relatively new-published in 1999. I found the artists other work, Vampire Tarot a silly example of a good idea. This deck has a little more depth than that one. It is not based on one theme that tends to throw many artist a curve. The cards are rather vague, non the less, original as far as style. One could almost keep it as an art deck. There is more to it, however.The backs are one of the best I have seen! White dragons that fit together nicely. Very effective. The major trumps are based on the Rider-Waite standard, making it easy for learners or advanced to master. The accompaning booklet is comprehensive as far as the basic meanings are concerned.The artistry is dark, but not evil. A new concept for the time. The whole idea of getting in touch with your \\"shadow\\" evolved in the 1990s. This deck appeals to this subject. It goes down to the depth of one's feelings; depression, rejection and failed efforts are adressed here. The trumps that stand out are Strength, the Lovers, Death and the World. Weaker cards are the High Priestess and the Tower.Overall an interesing deck for the collector and those with a gothic appeal."},{"Title":"Fantastical Tarot: 78-Card Deck","review":"\\"Enter a world at the edge of the senses, a dreamscape barely reachable by the mind.\\" - Nathalie HertzMy first encounter with the Fantastical Tarot was after taking a \\"Which Tarot Card Are You?\\" online quiz. The automatic results generated The Moon, which was supposedly \\"my\\" card based on my answers.Intrigued by the mesmerizing image, I decided to buy this deck based on that card, as well as an online review displaying six cards from the Fantastical Tarot.Unfortunately, that site shows six of the most attractive cards in the deck!After getting this deck from Amazon, I was greatly disappointed at the bizarre imagery. For example, the insectile The High Priestess has a horizontally elongated face, which makes her look like the queen of an alien race. The eye-less faces of all the humanoids are disconcerting, as is the literal rendering of The Hanged Man.Granted, there are some attractive cards in this deck--including Death, The Tower, 9 of Cups and, yes, The Moon. I also love the star-filled indigo sky behind each of the Knights.However, the over-exaggerated bone structure and eyeless sockets of the humanoids is a bit too bizarre for me.When I first opened the Fantastical Tarot, I noticed that there were gold flecks of paint on some of the cards. There is a dull gold border on these glossy cards (not gilt edging, mind you--actual borders) and I assumed the small chunks I found were merely remnants from the factory.To my surprise, as I shuffled them for the first time, I realized that this \\"flaking\\" was actually paint peeling from the borders! From ONE shuffle, some of the cards now have spotted borders (as if water got to them) because the golden paint has flecked off!The LWB that accompanies the Fantastical Tarot is decent, providing brief upright and reversed meanings. The card backing is fully reversible and has a surprisingly attractive motif: a pale double-imaged dragon with soft blue and green highlights with an indigo background.If you're into anime and comic-book fantasy art, you may very well like Fantastical Tarot. For me, I feel theUniversal Fantasy Tarotis a MUCH better fantasy deck; in fact, that deck is one of the most beautiful that I own!(To see 10 images from this deck, visit the Reviews--Decks section at [...])Janet Boyer, author of The Back in Time Tarot Book: Picture the Past, Experience the Cards, Understand the Present (coming Fall 2008 from Hampton Roads Publishing)"},{"Title":"Fantastical Tarot: 78-Card Deck","review":"When I saw these cards were for sale, I knew that I had to have them!The artwork is distinct and beautiful (both on the faces of the cards as well as on the card backs) and the size of the cards is perfect for shuffling--not too big--not too small. The texture of the cards also contributes to the ease with which these cards may be manipulated.To any collector of Tarot decks I would advise the Fantastical Tarot deck by Nathalie Hertz will be a welcome--and well-used addition to your Tarot deck collection.With this Tarot deck as well as Amazon.com's unbeatable prices, how could you go wrong?"},{"Title":"Fantastical Tarot: 78-Card Deck","review":"I have always been a fan of Natalie Hertz.

Chesterton, a criticism","review":"We are fortunate that, a century later, a flood of writings by British author G. K. Chesterton have appeared in print, (all the more as the copyrights lapse). Given how few have still read him, or heard of him, although the number grows daily, why would anyone read his brother, Cecil? Simply because readers of a hundred years ago did not know this anonymously published \\"Criticism\\" was by his brother (although they may have soon so divined). Those wishing to dip their toe, as it were, into the waters of GKC, are directed elsewhere, to the warm beaches of his fiction and mysteries, and his most accessible and inviting non-fiction, namely his riotous 1908 book with a stuffy title, \\"Orthodoxy\\".But \\"A Criticism\\" was written just before that book slipped out to the reading public. Since Cecil was a soldier, later killed in battle, he could not write a follow-up, and this portrait is, as it were, frozen in time. The most fascinating thing about it is that Cecil takes two then well-known poems by GKC, and comparing the ideas in them, explores the changes in his brother's thinking, from, for instance, a Socialist, which is what Cecil was, to the writer of \\"Why I Am Not a Socialist\\", included here as an appendix; from an atheist to an anglo-Catholic (Church of England) to a Roman Catholic, although he did not join this last until years later in 1922; from an implicit believer in what Cecil would call \\"the doctrine of Progress\\" to someone \\"reacting against it\\".Were I reviewing Cecil's book a century ago, I would only give it four stars. However, this centenary edition may rate a five. Inklings Books publisher Michael W. Perry provides a great many \\"helps\\", some better than the book itself. These include seven appendices, editorial remarks necessary to put the book into context, a foreword and introduction, as well as copious footnotes. The best of these are five pieces that ran in a newspaper called \\"The New Age\\" in 1908, in which the first, by G.K. Chesterton, is answered in the second, by H.G. Wells, to which GKC, in the third, responds, to which in the fourth George Bernard Shaw replies, to which in the fifth GKC at last retorts. The GKC bits, \\"Wells and a Glass of Beer\\" and \\"The Last of the Rationalists\\" are amoung the best he's ever written, which is saying a lot.Cecil wonders aloud what history will make of GKC; where, if anywhere, he will have a place in literature; what he will yet write, with all his road, as it were, before him. I don't agree with all of Cecil's assessments, at that time more like forecasts, when GKC was mainly known for his early poetry, the novels (or mysteries, as Cecil would tag them, \\"The Napoleon of Notting Hill\\"The Napoleon of Notting Hill (Dover Books on Literature and Drama), \\"The Club of Queer Trades\\"The Club of Queer Trades, and \\"The Man Who Was Thursday\\"The Man Who Was Thursday: A Nightmare (Annotated Edition), and continual prolific output in various papers. This would, of course, be enough to cement his reputation in the current era. But yet to come were the handful of novels that are today his most read, including \\"Manalive\\"Manalive (Hilarious Stories), \\"The Ball and the Cross\\"The Ball and the Cross, and \\"The Flying Inn\\"The Flying Inn, not to mention the Father Brown mysteriesFather Brown: The Essential Tales (Modern Library Classics). And all the later non-fiction, including \\"Orthodoxy\\"Orthodoxyand \\"The Everlasting Man\\"The Everlasting Man.That said, this book is amazingly quotable, culling any number of sparkling epigrams of GKC, and filled with lucid, ringing prose, as in his essay \\"The Patriotic Idea\\" to give one example (here cited on page 44). The other helpful source in understanding this period is GKC's own autobiography, published much later, in 1936, and here often cited by the editorThe Autobiography of G.K. Chesterton. Cecil's book is not the place to first encounter GKC. But for those who already have met him it provides a fascinating journey back to the the millieu of a century ago, and helps explain why this unique and delightful writer, who in many ways stood outside of his own time, some hundred years later speaks to ours."},{"Title":"The Jungles of Chult","review":"The Jungles of Chult is an excellent Forgotten Realms accessory/adventure, as good as Old Empires, Dreams of Red Wizards, Dwarves Deep and Moonsea! It sheds light on the exotic southern land of Chult and its inhabitants. Their distinct culture, history, and civilization will win you over for sure!Ranging from background history, to city and social descriptions, to important people and characters, to the respective gods and pantheons, to adventure hooks and encounter tables, to magical items and artifacts, to new spells and monsters, this accessory has it all and more.For other FR references/adventures, I STRONGLY recommend: the Old Empires accessory on Chessenta, Mulhorand, and Unther, Dreams of Red Wizards on Thay, Dwarves Deep, Draconomicon, the Moonsea accessory, the Ruins of Myth Drannor Box Set, and the Ruins of Zhentil Keep Box Set (they are Second Edition AD&D;, out of print and it will take a bit of searching, but it's well worth it). For updated editions of events in Chult, see the Third Edition Forgotten Realms Campaign Setting, which even though is quite expensive, is still very useful to all FR fans. Moreover, The Ring of Winter, being the only novel set in the Jungles of Chult is a \\"must.\\"In short, if you like tropical jungles, dinosaurs, exotic goblins, and would like a change of scenery to break the routine, try and get your hands on a copy of The Jungles of Chult.

I'm a trained kaizen facilitator and 6 sigma black belt, just background for my review.Having read the book, I found it is a sound introductory read for those looking to understand how lean and 6 sigma can transform a business. The target audience for this is managers and executive contemplating initiating this process.The authors do a great job of providing war stories of successes within thier client base. They present the basics of the tools involved. They explain what is expected of management to make an implementation successful.If you are loooking for the details on how to get it done, I'd go to other books (anything by Shingo, or go to Productivity Press). As with many consultant books, this has the feel of a marketing tool to promote their consultancy. TBM is regarded and one of the best if not the best in \\"Lean\\" in this country.Things that Anand pointed out, but some one with little experience may not pick up on are:*Continuous improvement is a journey and not a destination*Senior management MUST be directly involved for success*Use the gains to grow the business*Standard work IS the discipline in the process*Everything must be looked at from the customer's perspectiveThese may not be new or exciting, but very true and often difficult maintain.

(Initially, I was.) It was probably selected for marketing purposes. Sharma and Moody know better than to claim that the system they propose (what they call \\"LeanSigma Transformation Process\\") is in all ways -- and will remain forever -- a \\"perfect engine\\" by which to achieve \\"profitable growth that serves all the constituents of an enterprise.\\" Any system is only as effective as those involved within it. We all know how many perfect workers there are. What Sharma and Moody present in this volume is a cohesive, comprehensive, and cost-effective system by which to meet all manner of challenges by \\"building to order with fewer resources.\\" Presumably they would be the first to point out that any such system, presented in a book, must be modified to accommodate the specific needs, interest, objectives, and resources of a given organization. Moreover, although the primary focus is on manufacturing, the principles are so sound that they can also be of substantial value to non-manufacturing enterprises such as those in retail merchandising, management consulting, banking, accounting, legal, insurance, and even advertising. All organizations need to improve cycle time and first-pass yield. Also, all organizations must do that with finite (sometimes severely limited) resources. Finally, all organizations most become (literally) obsessed with kaizen: constant improvement. Therefore, I highly recommend this book to decision-makers in all organizations (regardless of size or nature) but with the single caveat that appropriate modifications of the LeanSigma Transformation Process first be made.Sharma and Moody carefully organize their excellent material within ten chapters. In the first, they suggest and then explain \\"A Better Way\\"; in the last, they shift their attention to \\"The Future.\\" Throughout their book, they make effective use of the \\"journey\\" metaphor, correctly asserting that, once begun, the LeanSigma Transformation Process never ends. \\"This is a journey that concentrates the energy of an entire enterprise and focuses efforts to serve customers better, faster, with better quality products and responsiveness, ultimately leading to gains in market share.\\" Several dozen mini-case studies (e.g. Maytag) demonstrate precisely HOW such objectives can be achieved. In the final chapter, Sharma and Moody offer these thoughts: \\"Keep the long-term perspective. This journey is part of a larger movement, just as kaizen breakthrough is the the enabler of LeanSigma Transformation, and Design for LeanSigma revolutionized process and product design for increased responsiveness and mass customization. [The current business circumstances worldwide] create a long-awaited window of opportunity, and it is our responsibility to be prepared, to have the best workers, the best tools, and the energetic leadership required because an opportunity like this comes only once in every hundred and fifty years.\\"Those who share my high regard for this book are urged to check out David Maister's Practice What You Preach, Michael Hammer's The Agenda, Larry Bossidy and Ram Charan's Execution: The Discipline of Getting Things Done, and James O'Toole's Leading Change."},{"Title":"The Perfect Engine: How to Win in the New Demand Economy by Building to Order with Fewer Resources","review":"This book contains clear and practical guidance that anyone can use to turn a company around.

I first saw the book in a local book store, and the photo of the white gyrfalcon on the cover caught my attention even before I saw the title or contents.Many of us admire the spectacular beauty of large falcons, such as gyrfalcons and peregrines, but we know that we will never have opportunity to visit the northern breeding grounds in places like Greenland and Iceland. Tim takes us there and lets us feel what it is like to set foot in such faraway places and his photographs also help us visualize the stark environment some of these magnificent predators survive in.Other spectacular raptors are mentioned, too. The ferruginous hawk is the largest non-eagle in North America, and one of the species experts is Dr. Joe Schmutz of the University of Saskatchewan. I loved Tim Gallagher's discussion of some of the factors affecting ferruginous hawk population dynamics, and how Dr. Schmutz analyzed the ecological factors involved.I loved reading about Pete Bloom's feelings after trapping the last wild California Condor, and about Dave Garcelon's joy in seeing adult bald eagles in places where he had released juveniles into the wild. I enjoyed hearing about trapping and banding of migrant peregrine falcons at Padre Island, Texas.Tim Gallagher has been privileged to visit wild places most of us will never travel to. And he has been able to visit top raptor researchers carry out their work. Usually the only access we have to this sort of information is limited to scientific texts, which are interesting, but not as colorful as the stories in this book.I found this book an easy read, but captivating and enjoyable at the same time. I think raptorphiles, falconers, and bird lovers in general will enjoy hearing Tim Gallagher's stories in this collection."},{"Title":"Parts Unknown: A Naturalist's Journey in Search of Birds and Wild Places","review":"Who knew that birdwatching could be so exciting? Tim Gallagher goes on lengthy voyages through stormy, iceberg-infested waters in northern Greenland. He crawls around on thousand-foot cliffs in Iceland while huge gyrfalcons dive at his head. In his essays, he captures all the flavor and feel of each place's history (both natural and human) and culture. And the writing is so vivid, I felt like I was right there with him. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes to read about the outdoors and nature and also to share vicariously in an adventure."},{"Title":"Parts Unknown: A Naturalist's Journey in Search of Birds and Wild Places","review":"You know, I thought I'd been on some wild adventures in search of raptor nests.

But everything I've done seems tame compared with Tim Gallagher's feats of daring in PARTS UNKNOWN. I recommend it highly to anyone who loves birds of prey and adventure."},{"Title":"Parts Unknown: A Naturalist's Journey in Search of Birds and Wild Places","review":"This book is a collection of essays written by Tim Gallagher, currently editor-in-chief of _Living Bird_ magazine, published by the Cornell Lab of Ornithology, as well as an avid nature photographer (several of his nice color photographs grace the book), birder, and wildlife aficionado. The articles were written from between the late 1970s into the year 2000, and apparently most if not all have been published before elsewhere (not saying I have read any of them mind you, but it is possible others who would be interested in this book have).The articles center around birds, though occasionally other animals are briefly discussed, and range from focusing on issues of research to conservation to some other topics such as law enforcement and research integrity. Many of the articles focus on birds of prey, particularly Peregrine Falcons and the epic fight to save them from near extinction due to DDT (a passion of his), but also Gyrfalcons, Prairie Falcons, Bald Eagles, the Ferruginous Hawk, and California Condors (also the subject of an intensive effort to save them from extinction, one that involved using the closely related Andean Condors among other things and seems to have paid off handsomely, with California Condors now back in the wild not only in California but in Arizona as well). Other birds are covered as well, sometimes in relation to being food to birds of prey, such as Dovekies, ptarmigans, and Red-necked Grebes. Though most of the essays dealt with bird-watching and research in the United States, he described those researching Gyrfalcons in Iceland (which often involved rappelling down sheer cliffs and wading through glacial streams that had claimed lives in the past) and both Gyrfalcons and Peregrine Falcons in Greenland (working in some very rugged arctic conditions) as well as the Ferruginous Hawk in Alberta.If I had any real complaint about the book was that some of the essays were entirely too short, almost seeming to me that just as they were really getting interesting they were at an end. Some essays were only five pages or so, though most were longer.I did enjoy the book though, as he is a both a knowledgeable and personable writer and while passionate about conservation was not preachy about it. He did seem to have a wide-ranging interest in other animals, noting in some of his essays a little bit about some of the other animals that share the habitats with birds, such as ground squirrels, beavers, and whales, among others.I did learn a great many interesting things for which I am grateful. Gallagher relates how well-regarded the Gyrfalcon or falki is in Iceland, that even schoolchildren can identify them and that farmers who have them nesting on their lands are quite protective of them. Once exported to Europe as a prime bird for the sport of falconry, the favored prey of falconers in the Middle Ages using these birds was the Grey Heron (similar in appearance to the Great Blue Heron of North America), hunts involving them often involving miles of pursuit but generally ending in the heron's capture and then release with a copper band noting the name of the falcon's owner and the year captured. He writes quite a bit about the Dovekie, a starling-sized sea bird of arctic waters that looks in some ways penguin-like (though can fly). Studied intensively by researchers from the Peregrine Fund (important as a food source for birds of prey in the area and as a barometer of overall environment health in Greenland's waters), they are becoming known as amazingly long-lived birds, tremendously loyal to particular nesting sites (though preferring nesting on cliffs that have had recent rockslides as opposed to ones thickly covered in lichen), and the guano that they excrete on land important in a food chain that provides nitrogen for plants that musk oxen and arctic hairs feed on. In one of his chapters on reestablishing the Peregrine Falcon in eastern North America we learn that the famous urban releases of the falcon was do in part because young falcons that have been bred in captivity and released into the wild were too often falling prey to Golden Eagles and Great Horned Owls, birds that would not be present in an urban setting (though plenty of other birds such as feral pigeons and starlings, which could serve as prey items, were). In a chapter on Peregrine Falcon research he discusses findings unearthed by those studying migrating birds at Padre Island, Texas; in a break from their usual hunting habits, plummeting a high speed from a lofty altitude at prey, Peregrines would perch on any available spot on the island, even on crates and pieces of driftwood, where they would wait for other migrants (songbirds, shorebirds, waterfowl, and even other, smaller birds of prey) and take off from ground level and intercept them.My favorite chapter was the one on researching the night-time calls of flying, migrating songbirds, the results of one tireless, self-financed researcher by the name of Bill Evans, who lacked even a master's degree. He set up recording stations using hi-fi VCRs at eventually seven different areas of New York State out of his own pocket, working odd jobs to support himself, and recorded nine hours of audio a night, analyzing the tapes himself and recording and verifying the sound of migrating birds such as warblers and thrushes using later visual observations. Putting together a data-base of such calls, the songs shorter and quite different from songs heard on the ground during mating, and publishing his findings, he pioneered a new field of studying migrating birds, a vast improvement over prior efforts which could count birds migrating at night but not identify species. Gallagher writes that more and more of these stations are being set up but are now using sophisticated audio equipment and pattern recognition software, the information being made available online and an invaluable tool to researchers and conservationists."},{"Title":"In a Fine Frenzy: Poets Respond to Shakespeare","review":"I am in this book, so I will say that right up front!! I used to be an actor, doing lots of Shakespeare, so my poems in the book speak from the point of view of several characters.But there are lots and lots of poems in this book that respond to Shakespeare in a marvelous variety of ways. At this terrific price, under $5, I would snap this book up--for fun, for love of Shakespeare, for love of poetry! OR buy lots of copies and share it with a creative writing class, a theatre class, or a Shakespeare class, using the poems as examples and having students write their own poems in response to Shakespeare plays they read or see."},{"Title":"In a Fine Frenzy: Poets Respond to Shakespeare","review":"I bought this for an honors project I had to do for my Shakespeare elective class (I'm a senior in high school) on Othello. I found it very useful and have since lended it to my classmates to use for their Honors projects. It has poems from many, many of Shakespeare's plays as well as his sonnets. It is true, there are some plays that have more than others. However, not every one of Shakespeare's plays is in here. The poems mainly address: The Sonnets, Romeo and Juliet, Twelfth Night, The Tempest, King Lear, Othello and Hamlet. There are also a couple poems about Shakespeare himself in between the Parts of the book that divide the poems and sonnets by their categories (Sonnets, Comedies, Tragedies, Hamlet, and Romances).I would reccommend this to anyone who enjoys Shakespeare, Poetry, or Poetry about Shakespeare! Students and Teachers especillaly, there's alot one cna do with these poems so for students it's great for a project and teachers, it's great because for a lesson, you could have your students pick out a poem and try to disect it. It's really fantastic and I would reccommend it."},{"Title":"Radicals, Rabbis and Peacemakers: Conversations with Jewish Critics of Israel","review":"I am appalled at what Saul Freidman said about this book. Clearly he did not read the book. Norman Finkelstein has not been tormenting holocaust survivors.This is a cruel thing to say as both of Professor Finkelstein's parents were themselves Holocaust survivors. Both were in the Warsaw Ghetto and his mother was in Auschwitz. His parents lost all their surviving relatives in the holocaust. Dr Finkelstein was angry because although many Jewish organizations got rich from reparations from the holocaust, virtually none of the survivors got one penny, including Finkelstein's parents. If Freidman had read the interview with Professor Finkelstein he would know this.Instead he accuses this poor man, who has only tried to honor the memory of his parents, of tormenting Holocaust survivors. Shame on you, Saul Freidman! That is no way to treat a fellow Jew- just because he does not agree with you about Israeli policies. Friedman also lies--or has not read any of the book--on the issue of \\"suicide bombers.\\" Not one of the people interviewed defends suicide bombing. Farber, Shapiro, Finkelstein, Quester and others specifically condemn the suicide bombing conducted by groups like Hamas. But they also condemn the murder of defenseless Palestinian women and children by the Israel Army--5 times as many as Israelis murdered. Steve Quester, a Jew who lived with a Palestinian family, witnessed Israeli soldiers shooting at little Palestinian children. As Jews we have to be honor our greeat ethical and religious tradition. This means we must condemn injustice even when it comes from our side. This means we must face the fact that the Israeli government has treated the Palestinians like dogs. The Jews in this book are brave enough to demand justice for all people. Dr Farber has done a great service by putting this book together. He did this out of love for the Jewish people--he wants them to live up to the high standards of justice upon which our religious tradition is based. And this book convinced me that we Jews can do that. But we must first start treating the Palestinians as our brothers and sisters. We must demand that Israel withdraw from the West Bank and remove the Jewish settlements, so that the Palestinians can have a decent amount of land to create their own state. As Americans we must tell our own government that it must say to Israel that it will reduce the billions of dollars of grants given to it every year unless it ends the Occupation. If you read this book with an open mind it will completely change the way you look at the situation in the middle east.It changed my mind. It made me realize that the Palestinians are human, it made me ashamed of what Israel has done--and it made me feel that in the name of the great tradition of Judaism (which believes that all human beings are equal--see Isaiah)I must work to help end the occupation of Palestinian land. Dr Farber's has his own perspective which he explains in the last chapter. He believes strongly in the teachings of the Biblical Jewish prophets. As Micah said in the Bible: \\"Act justly, love mercy and walk humbly with thy God.\\" Farber has done that.Kudoos. He has put together an important book. Every Jew, every American, should read it."},{"Title":"Radicals, Rabbis and Peacemakers: Conversations with Jewish Critics of Israel","review":"This is a brilliant book. Before I read it I thought both Jews and Palestinians were equally to blame for the quagmire in Israel. After reading Dr Farber, Noam Chomsky, Mezvinsky, Finkelstein and the account of his experiences by Steve Quester who spent 3 summers in the West Bank risking his life to protect Palestinians, I changed my mind. I realized that what the Jewish settlers did and are doing to the Palestinians in 1948 and today is exactly what Europeans settlers did in America to the Indians--dispossessing a native people of their land, rendering them homeless, herding them into the modern reservations. In Israel the reservations are rufugee camps in the West Bank and elsewhere. Finkelstein's account of Palestinians' expulsion and dispossession in 1948, laced by Farber with accounts by observers of the 1948 war, made me want to cry.What have we done to the poor Palestinians? What have we become as Jews? We were a moral spiritual people and now most of us spend our time trying to deny that we have done anything wrong, inventing rationalizations for Israel. We claim the Palestinians were always bad, Arabs are always bad, or that there were no Palestinians in Palestine! Finkelstein--whose parents were both Holocaust survivors--demolishes this last myth. The scholars in this book are top of the field.And the book is praised by first rate scholars, as well as by the great Daniel Berrigan. It is fascinatating to get a glimpse into the souls of those Farber interviews--because his questions are probing.Marc Elis the theolgian says we should apologize to the Palestinians, we should confess our sins. They were expelled and not allowed to return--in violation of the UN and international law. In our greed for land we HAVE sinned. In our disregard for justice and God we have sinned. Nor,as Farber shows,can the conflict be blamed solely on the the Holocaust.Most of the holocaust survivors did not want to go to Israel but to America, but Ben-Gurion opposed that.American Jewish organizations refused to fight for the right of Jews to come here. Further as Chomsky and Farber show there were other Jews like Martin Buber and Judah Magnes who proposed solutions that would enable the Jews and Arabs to share the land but the hard core Zionists would have nothing of itI was surprised to learn that Steve Quester, an American Jew, was welcomed with open arms by the Palestinians. Quester went to Palestine with the ISM, a movement that knee-jerk Zionists disparage as pro-terrorist but his dedication to non-violence could not be clearer. The reviewers who puts down the ISM probably did not read the interviews with Quester and Adam Shapiro. Or she read them with a hardened heart.Why are the people Farber interviewed speaking out on behalf of the Palestinians when the Jewish community is trashing them for it?? One young woman in the book, Ora Wise, is the daughter of a conservative rabbi. Her entire family is furious at her for supporting Palestinians rights to self--determination.Her father won't talk to her. It cannot be easy for these people to take the positions they do. They do it out of a sense of moral obligation. The theologian Marc Ellis says in Farber's book that many Jews of conscience choose to take positions that lead to their ostracism by the organized Jewish community. This is a lonely position to be in--hated and despised by family and friends;Ellis says they are entering into a \\"new exile\\"--from the Jewish community in the diaspora. Why? Why do they risk their lives by going to Palestine where Israeli soldiers shoot bullets over their heads or beat them with sticks? (Several, like Rachel Corrie, were even murdered by the Israeli Army.) There can be only one reason. The call of conscience is so powerful among many Jews (albeit a minority) it overwhelms the lure of security. Marc Ellis a theologian says that by standing up for the Palestinians they are saving the Jewish covenant itself, Jews' covenant with God to serve all of humanity, to serve as a light unto the nations.They carry the covenant with them into exile. It is lonely but the lives of the Jewish prophets were lonely. Farber states that he worships the God of justice rather the idol of the Jewish state.One reviewer claimed that Jews were a majority in the part of Palestine granted.Does she not understand that is irrelevant: Jews were a minority in Mandate Palestine. They were only 30% of the population and had purchased only 6% of the land. Not everything can be bought with money. These scholars show that the Palestinians were attached to their homes and their land. Ben-Gurion, Israel's first prime minister and architect of the Jewish state, knew that a war was necessary in order to ethnically cleanse Palestine of its Arab inhabitants. He said so in 1937:\\"... we have to stick to compulsory transfer of the Arabs from the projected Jewish state..\\"In the end Farber demonstrates that prophetic Judaism and Zionism are incompatible. Jews cannot worship power and serve the cause of justice, the God of justice. I think his last chapter is one of the most powerful statements in the book.It is a powerful affirmation of Judaism. In fact he argues that the hard-core Zionists are self-hating Jews because they have repudiated the heart of the Jewish tradition--its prophetic core. He srgues the only way to recover this tradition is to enter into solidarity with the Palestinians, and to divorce ourselves from our modern role of defending the crimes of the powerful Jewish nation-state. That is what Isaiah would have done. For it was Isaiah who exhorted all peoples to beat their swords into ploughshares---and foresaw a time of peace when the earth would be full of the knowledge of the Lord. Farber's book is a contribution to the goal of Isaiah."},{"Title":"Radicals, Rabbis and Peacemakers: Conversations with Jewish Critics of Israel","review":"Criticism of Israel and its policies is verboten in polite company in the US. Those who doubt this need only look to the reception accorded President Jimmy Carter's tepid bookPalestine: Peace Not Apartheid. Carter makes no controversial claims. Yet we are repeatedly told that Carter is an anti-Semite and wants to destroy the state of Israel! Or consider the shameful attacks on Prof. Norman G. Finkelstein for daring to document that the Nazi genocide was being exploited, and not for the benefit of survivors, in his bookThe Holocaust Industry: Reflections on the Exploitation of Jewish Suffering, New Edition 2nd Edition: we are to believe he is a minimizer of the Nazi genocide, even though it is well known that both his parents were survivors of the concentration camps. All this even as toasts are raised to the plagiarist, torture-condoner, arch-Israeli-apologist Dershowitz."},{"Title":"Radicals, Rabbis and Peacemakers: Conversations with Jewish Critics of Israel","review":"I thought this book was excellent as far as it goes: interviews with prominent anti-Zionist Jews about the Israeli-Palestinian mess. I was especially interested in the Daniel Boyarin piece, which explained Boyarin's thesis about the contrast between the gentle, nonviolent, \\"feminized\\" Jewish male of the European Diaspora, and the violent, hypermasculine Israeli male. There was also a piece about Israel having developed a \\"Constantinian\\" Judaism comparable to Christianity as the Roman state religion following Constantine, and then throughout the medieval period. These are things that have always bothered me about Israel, though I'm not certain I would go so far as to call myself an anti-Zionist. And the material on how the Zionists cynically used the Holocaust to further their cause is pretty shocking. I'd like to learn more about that.The only thing I thought lacking in the book was an interview with Rabbi Michael Lerner, a Zionist who is critical of Israeli government. The author most likely decided not to include his voice as the Zionist position is often heard, while anti-Zionists are mostly silenced outside of left circles. However, he does articulate a left perspective on Zionism and his position is critiqued throughout the book; it seems to me under those circumstances he should have been given the opportunity to have his say. As I noted before, I'm not certain where I stand on the issue and would like to hear multiple perspectives from the left."},{"Title":"Radicals, Rabbis and Peacemakers: Conversations with Jewish Critics of Israel","review":"The preface of this book should warn us all about what is coming. In it, the International Solidarity Movement (ISM), which I feel is a major opponent of human rights, is praised and is portrayed as supporting human rights! Universities are advised to divest from Israel, an act which I consider a blow not only to peace, justice, and human rights, but also a racist attack on truth and scholarship. Israel's \\"failure to comply with United Nations resolutions\\" is used to condemn not the UN, but Israel.There's an interview with Noam Chomsky, who seems to feel that just because America conquered some land which is now part of our country, and just because Israel defended itself against some attacks, it is unjust for America or Israel to exist today. That is totally absurd. A better way to analyze such situations is simple: ask who would own what if nobody had committed any crimes or acts of violence. The obvious answer should come as a shock only to a few fanatical antizionists: Americans would own America and Israelis would own Israel. We Americans got into fights over land that we would have bought anyway, sooner or later. And Israel got into fights over land it either already owned or would have bought, and it lost some of that land in those fights.This arbitrary treatment of the Arab war against Israel reminds me of a test proposed by Edward Alexander: are those who demand rights for others willing to demand the same rights (not more, not less) for themselves, or for their own people?One after another, Chomsky, Steve Quester, Joel Koval, Norton Mezvinsky, Ora Wise, Norman Finkelstein, Phyllis Bennis, Adam Shapiro, Daniel Boyarin, David Weiss, and Marc Ellis join Seth Farber in flunking this test. Some are explicit about it. For example, Boyarin says one has to \\"take care of the poor behavior of your own people before you worry about the poor behavior of other people.\\"If anyone who called me one of their people said that \\"we\\" should ignore violent attacks on me and instead investigate accusations (probably by my attackers) of bad behavior on my part, I might start to question my relationship to that person! But whether I did so or not, that person would be taking a completely arbitrary stand. A total outsider would be exposed as being arbitrary at once for ignoring crimes by one side in a dispute. Claiming to be a member of one of the two sides does not grant one immunity from any of this. Refusing to consider the crimes of one of the sides is arbitrary no matter who does it.Still, arbitrariness is not the only problem with the book. Even the advantage of being able to describe a war as though only one of the sides is actually fighting is not enough for the contributors to this book. In addition, they simply come up with outright misinformation. And that bothers me. This book is unscholarly. It is antischolarly. And its falsehoods serve to support terrorism.Such an approach absolutely destroys any faith I might have that I am dealing with people who are willing to sincerely deliberate issues of public policy. Basically, unless they stop feeding me intentional untruths, I won't consider any of their recommendations.If there were just a few mistakes or exaggerations, I might let that go. But that's not the case. The book is misleading almost all the time. I'll give what looks like an innocent example. It would be innocent if it occurred just once or twice. But not when it is one of many famous untruths that have been heavily cited and criticized by honest people. Norman Finkelstein talks about the fact that Jews only owned 6% of some land when Israel became a state. He implies that Arabs owned the other 94%. Hmm, 94% sounds bigger than 6%. Maybe the Arab claim to the land was even better than that of the Jews!But this is all nonsense. Jews outnumbered Arabs in the portion of the British Mandate that the United Nations put in the Jewish partition. It wasn't 6% Jewish. The majority were Jews (in spite of enormous efforts made by Arabs and British to keep Jews out of land the League of Nations had given Jews a right to settle in). And while only 6% of the total British Mandate soil was Jewish private property, most of that soil was state land! The Arabs didn't own much of the land either. You may want to check for yourselves what the actual amounts were, both in the entire Mandate and in the Jewish partition.Almost every sentence is like that. The contributors know what they are doing. They feel that if they tell the truth, they have no case. That may not stop them from coming up with books like this one, but it certainly ought to stop us from recommending them."},{"Title":"Radicals, Rabbis and Peacemakers: Conversations with Jewish Critics of Israel","review":"This is a collection of the worse writing on Israel imaginable by the most immoral people imaginable.

I think Evanovich writes to women who like romance and amusing humor and who don't care that much about a plot. Munger writes to men and women and while she is very, very funny, her plots are always excellent. She does not sacrifice the conventions of the PI genre to be cutesy, in fact, she pulls them off better than almost anyone else I've read. Her characters are well-rounded, motivations plausible, the tone perfect. Plus she is one the few writers who can write about the south in a real way, she doesn't ignore the redneck element but she doesn't make it sound like that's all there is either. Some people read her because she is funny in a scathing, sometimes scary way (literature majors will recognize some major puncturing of ego going on). Some people seem to read her because they like Casey getting it on with guys or think she's a good role model. Others read her for the mysteries and the twists and turns she throws in.

This one is the best because her characterizations are top-notch, but the other two are incredibly entertaining as well."},{"Title":"Money to Burn:: A Casey Jones Mystery (Casey Jones Mysteries)","review":"Where I wouldn't exactly say Katy Mungar is up there with Janet Evanovich, she is not that far behind. Each book is getting better. I thoroughly enjoyed this one and look forward to her next."},{"Title":"Money to Burn:: A Casey Jones Mystery (Casey Jones Mysteries)","review":"Munger is a five-star writer, but this story that revolves around tobacco is one I couldn't get into for the subject matter. It also involves a poor little rich girl, which is a plotline that's never appealed to me, not when the girl's old enough to change her own life.But the plot is a solid one, the characters varied and real and mean when they need to be. Casey Jones is a great lead character. I worry about her drinking (and driving) and eating habits. 170 pounds of muscle? Tell that one to the guy behind the Krispy Kreme counter, Case. And she's got a fascinating romantic lead in this volume. (So glad to see he stuck around for at least one more book!)Of the four Munger books I've read so far, this is the only one that really didn't grab and hold me until I couldn't put it down... but I still give it four stars for tension and style."},{"Title":"Money to Burn:: A Casey Jones Mystery (Casey Jones Mysteries)","review":"Although I certainly enjoyed reading Money to Burn, Katy Munger is not ready to become one of the greats of mystery fiction. On the book's positive side, Munger does deliver a very funny book with a fairly convincing and innovative plot. Since the book deals with the tobacco industry, which is an easy target these days, I was surprised that Munger avoided a cliched industry corruption tale. As always in this series, humor was at the forefront of the narrative.The disappointing aspect of this book comes with Munger's too frequent use of trite stereotypes. While it may be true that stereotypes become stereotypes because they are so often true, characterizations which are too dependent upon these stereotypes come off flat and underdeveloped. Although Munger does not use stereotypes to criticize, she does use them to avoid finding a character's inner motivations. Too many of her characters act and react because of some societally projected motivation. Munger needs to explore her characters more closely to produce a book with more real people. A great mystery novel delivers insight into the human condition just like any other great book. This cannot be accomplished with such underdeveloped characters. I have also been disappointed that Casey Jones's character has not grown through the series. I know no more about her now that I did after reading the first book in the series. For example, in this book, Casey has a very difficult and potentially life-altering decision to make. Instead of allowing the readers to follow Casey's self-exploration, she just suddenly makes up her mind. We, the readers, do not know why. Munger's sense of place is also somewhat flat. After reading a series, I like to feel that I have \\"been\\" wherever the book is set, and even though I live quite near this book's actual setting, the place does not seem at all real. With the exception of the Southern stereotypes, this series could happen anywhere. (North Carolina is important in this particular book because of the tobacco industry's role in the book.)Overall, however, I found this an enjoyable book to read, and I do recommend it. I don't think a book should be avoided because it isn't what it never tried to be. It is lightweight fun. Munger just shows so much potential that I would like to see her make this an even better series. Its engrossing plot and likable Casey Jones provide good escapist reading. If you can enjoy a book just because its fun, you should like this one. If you're looking for great depths, read elsewhere."},{"Title":"Money to Burn:: A Casey Jones Mystery (Casey Jones Mysteries)","review":"This is the 3rd book in the series.Casey is the best PI character in the mystery genre and is an great character to read.

I write business and technical material for a living, so when I read for enjoyment I prefer fiction, and mysteries are my favorite. I read (and enjoy) my share of Kellerman, Sandford, Pearson, Harris, etc. AND Munger! I disagree with anyone who says she doesn't develop her characters. I definitely feel as though I've gotten to know Casey Jones and I look forward to each new adventure. Casey is an overweight, overbearing female private eye whose thoughts and actions are not what you'd expect if you're used to following the males of the mystery genre...and they shouldn't be! Munger's stereotypes of southerners are surpassed only by her own stereotypes of northerners, and from what I've read of the author, who should know these stereotypes better than someone who was born in the south but spent considerable time in the north. It's true, I pick up Munger's books when I want a \\"lighter\\" mystery to read, and \\"Money to Burn\\" was just the ticket. When I finished it, I was already looking forward to her next book."},{"Title":"Money to Burn:: A Casey Jones Mystery (Casey Jones Mysteries)","review":"This series gets better with each book. Keep them coming, Katy!"},{"Title":"Rockets into Space (Frontiers of Space)","review":"Most books about the space program I've read recently focus on Project Apollo or some other element of the space program. This one takes a different tack, going into the background and means for getting into space: the rockets.It begins with an overview of the big three pioneer theorists: Tsiolkovsky, Goddard, and Oberth. Winter decides to give most of the credit to Oberth, who was a big influence on von Braun and therefore the V-2. Tsiolkovsky was brilliant but unfortunately no one realized it until well after the fact. Most interestingly of all, all three writers were inspired by the writings of Jules Verne and H.G. Wells.After that high point, it's never quite as good. It is a detailed, technical discussion of the various rockets, both Russian and American, that have made space exploration possible, and I learned a good bit from it (for example, that the rocket that launched Sputnik I and many following satellites was stronger than anything we could send up until we had the Saturn IB). However, it seems that a few good diagrams showing the genealogies of the rockets and what engines they used could have saved many pages of text. Instead, there are long and tedious descriptions of where each rocket came from, how big they are, how much thrust they have, etc. Even then there are startling exceptions: there's talk of the aforementioned Saturn IB, but no information on the first stage at all.At the end there are an obligatory couple of chapters on the present state of things, discussing the rockets currently in use, and the future, which skims quickly over nuclear, ion, solar, laser, and a few other means of propulsion.In addition, there are some actual or seeming inaccuracies: the explanation of specific impulse seems to contradict the units it's expressed in (seconds), and one of the space shuttles is referred to as &quot;Discoverer&quot; rather than &quot;Discovery.&quot;So it is a moderately useful book, but I was somewhat disappointed with it."},{"Title":"Rockets into Space (Frontiers of Space)","review":"I'm a student and I used it in my research. It's a very good source that explores the various facets of space science and technology. I love how he dedicated the book to Jules Verne, who pointed the way. He's a good author too. Because of this, more and more teens are interested going to Space Camp. I love this book and I hope others can learn from it as I had. I'm a science fiction freak, which means I love anything that is out of this world. I hope others feel as I do."},{"Title":"Horse Owners Guide to Natural Hoof Care","review":"This book on natural hoof care for your horse is a revelation to all of us who have blindly followed the tradition of shoeing our horses. Being a relatively new horse owner (two years) I had no idea letting my horse go shoeless could be possible. He's one of these sensitive types that can barely walk due to excessive sensitivity when his shoes are removed. Mr. Jackson says this is not natural but has been created by the use of shoes on the horse. This has caused the soles of his hoof to be sensitive and the walls of his hooves to be too thin. This can all be corrected by removing the horses shoes and trimming them properly, something Mr. Jackson describes in his book as power trimming. The goal is to eventually have the horses hooves resemble that of wild horses which Mr. Jackson has studied extensively. He describes in this book how to accomplish this, with lots of pictures and background information. He has chapters on what a natural hoof looks like and what an un-natural (shoed) one looks like, as well as chapters on tools required, how to handle difficult horses, how natural hoof care can conquer problems like laminitis, navicular, hoof contraction, sole abscesses, white line disease and others. There's also a good appendix in the back on where to get addtional info on learning more about this exciting process. I'm really excited about the possibilities for my horse, I'd love him to be in a more natural state and not have to rely on shoes for the rest of his life and with Mr. Jacksons guidance, I think it might be possible. I'd recommend this book to anyone looking for a more natural alternative to shoeing. Happy trails! Buff C.

I've made well over half of the recipes, my favorites being Shrimp Won Tons with Orange-Basil Sauce, Potato-Calamata Cakes on Tomato-Saffron Sauce, Romaine Salad with Pumpkin-Seed Dressing, Sour Cream-Mango Pancakes with Candied Pecans, and Mango-Raspberry Napoleons. While there are a few meatless entrees and many meatless side dishes and salads that can be combined to create a meal; meat, poultry, and fish are the rule. Chapters include Breakfast Dishes, Starters, Soups, Salads, Fish and Seafood, Meat and Poultry, Vegetables and Side Dishes, and Desserts.Although great for guests and special occasions, this is not the book to turn to for a quick dinner. Many of the recipes take long to prepare (as much as a few hours including all of the sauces and side dishes), and the ingredient lists often stretch onto a second page and require a trip to an international grocer. The Authentic Cafe is (was) a restaurant, and thus the recipes produce restaurant food -- excellent taste, beautiful presentation, and high fat/sodium content."},{"Title":"Dinner at the Authentic Cafe","review":"Ditto to other reviewers concerning the originality and flavor of these recipes. They make the book a 5 star but the ingredients are listed in a light lime colored ink which makes them very difficult to see under the best of conditions. The book would be a keeper if it weren't so difficult to use because of this."},{"Title":"Dinner at the Authentic Cafe","review":"The recipes in this cookbook aren't just the usual recipes a bit re-done, but really unique recipes that combine a kind of east/west sensibility with dishes like papaya noodle salad and catfish on cheddar grits with a chile sauce. Mexican or Latin American seems to be the underlying foundation but the dishes go all over the place from that beginning. Recipes are long and usually include a full meal as opposed to individual dishes. This is a great way to plan for meals for a dinner party when you don't want to try to figure out what to pair the catfish with.Most recipes are long and include unique ingredients like harissa or thai fish sauce (although these are easier to find now then they were when the book was written. However there are some easy pantry friendly choices like the warm breakfast couscous and quick dishes like szechwan peppercorn new york steak (if you don't make the tomato and ginger salsa to accompany it). One of the best ways to use the cookbook if you aren't doing dinner parties is to just select part of a dish, make that and then purchase a salsa to go with. Or, make the salsa a day ahead and finish up the dish when you are ready to serve it. Desserts tend to be lighter like bananas in phyllo (which is very simple and can be prepared ahead). If you want to extend your cooking repertoire beyond the usual, this is a great book."},{"Title":"Dinner at the Authentic Cafe","review":"I found this cookbook at a yard sale a couple of years ago. At first, it seemed like a passport to the exotic, but, soon after it became a guaranteed good meal any time I opened it's pages.

However, I live in a small town and still was able to find most of them nearby or online. The soups and entrees in this cookbook are sure to please.

She manages to crawl back to her home, and collapses.When his beloved cat runs out into a storm, and fails to come back, Antonius is distraught. When he hears a scratching at his door later that night, Antonius finds an unconscious, naked woman curled up on his doorstep. She is the epitome of his perfect woman, and the lonely Antonius begins to fall in love with her, even though he does not know where she is from, or why she has such odd, cat-like mannerisms.Pussyfooting Around by Ashley Ladd: Eddie's cat Diamond sees the huge alligator that lives in the canal attack a neighborhood child. Diamond charges the alligator and succeeds in distracting the alligator from the child. Unfortunately, she dies in the attempt. Because of her bravery and goodness of heart, the goddess Venus decides to grant Diamond her wish to return to earth as a human female, so she can try to win the love of her master in that form. But can Diamond overcome her feline reactions to the world around her, and become human in all ways?These are two cute short stories (each about 80 pages long) based on the myth of a bet between Jupiter and Venus as to whether a being can really change its nature. In these two stories, the gods change a cat into a human being, and the authors illustrate what happens next in each case. The love scenes are quite explicit, including male/female and oral sex. I found these interpretations very amusing, and quite a satisfying way to while away an hour or two. -- Jean, Fallen Angel Reviews (courtesy of Fallen Angel Reviews)"},{"Title":"Sex Kittens","review":"This is an erotic book, the authors fantasize for the reader about women who are animals at heart.

He is not a historian which for this subject is both a blessing and a curse. The upside is that he looks at much of vaudeville's past through contemporary eyes. Performers are described by their modern day counterparts so that the Cherry Sisters are described as being wonderfully bad in the way that Larry \\"Bud\\" Melman was on the Letterman show. He views vaudeville as merely an early form of an American show business that is still with us today. This is an important point that older books on the subject ignored. They were so enthralled with the sad demise of this vibrant form of entertainment that they didn't really understand that it hadn't really died.However, a historian would look at vaudeville for its social significance within the America of the early 20th century. What role did vaudeville play in the lives of its audience? How did the business culture of those years contribute to the transformation of vaudeville into a corporate monolith? How did the massive immigration movement of the last decades of the 19th and the first of the 20th shape the business, the acts, the performer and the audience for vaudeville? Did the successful integration of these groups into the mainstream of American society assist in vaudeville's demise? These are questions Mr. Steward really doesn't address which given the scope and intentions of his book is understandable. Its just that those questions are so interesting that it's a shame not to hear Mr. Stewart's thoughts on them."},{"Title":"No Applause--Just Throw Money: The Book That Made Vaudeville Famous","review":"This book gives a wonderful annology how vaudville evolve.

As bold a writer as he is performer, Trav S.D.'s book is all the better for it. Critics have commented that it is amusing-and it is-very, but it also affords, within its 300 plus pages, a solid survey of vaudeville history from its roots through several stages of growth to its blossoming and institutional decline.One of the book's greater strengths is the cultural context Trav S.D. provides without losing his story in academic meanderings. The marrying of high and low purpose in this book reflects vaudeville's eclectic (some might say indiscriminate) embrace of art forms, a formula that made it the most popular mass entertainment of its day--fit for both toffs and toughs--ladies and children invited.One can quibble about several particulars-this is true of every book written about vaudeville, but Trav S.D. has captured the shape, size and feel of vaudeville by examining it as a business as well as an entertainment form peopled by beloved performers.Trav S.D. is producer/performer with American Vaudeville Theatre and a writer whose work has appeared in various periodicals including The Village Voice, American Theatre, Time Out New York, and Reason.Frank Cullen, merican Vaudeville M useum, \\"fcullen'"},{"Title":"No Applause--Just Throw Money: The Book That Made Vaudeville Famous","review":"In the last five years, three unrelated books, the subject book, together with Seriously Funny by Gerard Nachman and Comedy at the Edge by Richard Zoglin, have been published which, together, comprise the history of American comedy since the American Civil War. All of them have their merits, but No Applause - Just Throw Money (NAJTM) is the best of them.It is not just that vaudeville is broader than comedy alone and the vaudeville era was a lot more interesting in show business history than the periods that followed it. The other virtue to NAJTM is that, while the other books try to capture an age by induction - focusing on the lives of a handful of performers and drawing universal conclusions - NAJTM discusses the era and illustrates the author's points with references to individual performers. The result is that the uniqueness of each act, its independence and individuality is honored.And unique and independent and individualistic they were! What a wonderful collection of oddballs, tyrants and crackpots and what a talented, original and creative bunch as well. As one surveys modern entertainment - the intellectual wasteland that comprises theater, television and, especially, American cinema today, one longs to slip into the Palace for just one day to see this bunch walk the boards one more time."},{"Title":"No Applause--Just Throw Money: The Book That Made Vaudeville Famous","review":"The whole book is informative and very, very funny, with the first third concentrating on the ancient history of vaudeville and its beginnings, the middle third concentrating on its heyday, and the final chapters dedicated to its decline. However, the text does contain some glaring errors with regard to Buster Keaton's life and abilities (probably owing to the author's unfortunate use of Marion Meade's atrocious \\"Cut to the Chase\\" as a resource). For the record, Buster Keaton was neither functionally illiterate nor abused. The final chapters are bogged down a bit with the author's own philosophy as to what is needed in vaudeville, rather than a straight telling of what has happened to it in the last 40 or 50 years. This is a shame, because the first two thirds of the book are uproariously funny and page-turningly readable, and I would have like to have seen this continue through to the conclusion. Even the acknowledgements are entertaining - not always the case."},{"Title":"No Applause--Just Throw Money: The Book That Made Vaudeville Famous","review":"Like the History Channel on TV -- Trav S. D. certainly brings the history of vaudeville to life in this book!! His knowledge and storytelling is akin to sitting in the parlor listening to tales of a bygone era from your grandfather or favorite wise old uncle who himself lived through it! He leaves you smiling, laughing and always wanting to hear and read more.If anything, the only thing found missing and lacking was in regards to what Trav calls \\"The New Vaudeville.\\" Back in the early \`70s was a bloke by the name of Roy Radin, who did his part in bringing vaudeville shows back to the masses. In Roy Radin's Vaudeville Review, which toured the country appearing in auditoriums, college campuses, and virtually anywhere the venue could be set up -- Many thousands of people, yours truly included, had their chance to meet the likes of Milton Berle, Donald O'Connor, Georgie Jessel and other great stars of the illegitimate stage up close and personal. These vaudeville shows were a great success for the time they ran; although Radin himself as it turns out would end up a mostly forgotten about and very tragic figure in the history of entertainment.Hoping Trav could've given us some further background and more insight into Radin's touring follies would've made this whole vaudeville story that much better. Perhaps though, when and if the book comes out in paperback, he can/will go back and include some of these tales for us. Nevertheless...Final Analysis: Do throw money at this book and this author.

Trav S.D.(aka Travis Stewart) has been the head of the American Vaudeville Theater in New York City for nearly a decade now. He is also a very accomplished writer which is quite evident in this book. Trav S.D. introduces us to the legendary performers of the vaudeville circuit. We have all heard of the Marx Brothers, Burns and Allen, W.C. Fields and Buster Keaton, but I really appreciated learning about so many of the acts I had never even heard of before. It was also interesting to learn about the men who would emerge as the moguls of vaudeville. Tony Pastor is generally credited with having much to do with putting \\"vaudeville\\" on the map. His seemingly revolutionary insistance on variety shows that offered \\"fun without vulgarity\\" would prove to be a winning formula for five decades. Now women and children could attend these shows and as a result the potential audience for such offerings expanded dramatically. Over the next several decades savvy businessmen like B.F. Keith, Edward Franklin Albee, F.F.Proctor and the Hammersteins would come to dominate this growing industry. It seemed that Americans could not get enough of \\"vaudeville\\". This would continue to be the case until the early 1920's when new technologies like the phonograph, radio and movies would gradually erode the appeal of \\"live\\" entertainment.I really appreciated the meticulous research Trav S.D. did for this book. There were so many interesting tidbits of information sprinkled throughout \\"No Applause--Just Throw Money: The Book That Made Vaudeville Famous\\". I particularly enjoyed learning the origin of so many of the terms associated with the vaudeville scene. A few days after the author appeared in my city I was talking to an elderly Catholic priest about the book. It turns out that he had actually appeared many, many times in a vaudeville venue here in town some 70 years ago. Without having actually read the book at that point I strongly recommended that he pick up a copy. Now having read it from cover to cover I strongly urge anyone who is even remotely interested in this subject to get themselves a copy of this book. I can assure you that you will not be disappointed. Very highly recommended!"},{"Title":"No Applause--Just Throw Money: The Book That Made Vaudeville Famous","review":"This book is full of information, laughs, and a several \\"OH-MY-GOSH\\" responses to surprising tidbits I'd never heard before.

Vaudeville was the first major American equal opportunity employer, and it allowed even immigrants easy access to American culture: chapters trace major players, acts, and influences.Diane C.

Written with a sly sense of humor, the intro and background is really complete and wonderful, and the middle section about the heyday and performers is great reading. The last quarter strays into a great deal of opinion from Trav's own finely-honed Vaudeville sensibility; but all the same, it is a fabulous book, absolutely big time. I really appreciated that Trav gave us a lot of reading about the acts and actual performing. (Many books and info sources don't - concentrating more on the Managers and the business end.)

While that acclaim is certainly deserved, to my mind, this is a major, major piece of work. Writing of the highest order, grandly entertaining and audacious, maybe the reason that this book isn't more widely read and studied is that it doesn't wear its craft on its sleeve in some showy way, but instead simultaneously tells three parallel but certainly quite different stories in a clear and accessible way. That said, as the reader progresses through it, certain connections between the stories -- the death of Freud, a Broadway musical about Trotsky, and the actual end of the world -- begin to emerge and the book becomes a deep and deeply entertaining consideration of the question, what does it mean for the world to end? If TEOTWN continues to stay out of print, one of these days I really will grab a bunch of used copies from the internet and give them to everyone I know who appreciates and treasures such a thing. Think of any of the crop of current writers who tell seemingly disconnected stories and let you connect the dots (Infinite Jest, anyone?) and realize that Anthony Burgess wrote this back in 1982, and I have to believe that it's been a huge and sadly hidden influence on many. There's an old line about the Sex Pistols -- very few people actually saw them perform, but those who did went out and started their own bands. That may be similarly true of this book -- few have read it, but I'm guessing that just about any influential author of the last twenty or so years has a dog-eared, lovingly-read copy on his or her bookshelf. You know someone who wants to be a writer? Give 'em a copy of this and tell them,\\"You want to write? Here, kid, here's how it's done.\\""},{"Title":"The End of the World News: An Entertainment","review":"I was lucky enough to stumble upon this book in a used book store during a class field trip.

Her book is inspiring and convicting at the same time. Truly a book inspired by God.Reminded me of the phrase, God never wastes a hurt. Linda proved that with God on our side, our crosses are a blessing given to help us grow spiritually.

She does not gloss over, as most of us would, her own failings or where she might have gone wrong.Her own sufferings as a child and young person gave her great insights into the kids in crisis whom she worked with and it must have been like a cup of cold water to them to have her around. In fact, she has received great insights into people's longing to be loved. This book shows how, through Christ, we can come close to people, 'touch' them, and help them to know Him.I look forward to reading the book again, slowly and carefully, and to absorb the deep understanding of Jesus and of living in His way - insights born in the fire of suffering and now leading the reader into the light of Jesus."},{"Title":"Why Surrender Is Not A Four Letter Word","review":"Reading Linda Russell's book feels like having a conversation with an old friend. It's intimate, refreshingly honest, hilarious and at times heartbreaking. Throughout her book, Mrs. Russell uses the timeless truths of the fruits of the Spirit as the keys to living a life of complete surrender and freedom. Mrs. Russell's book not only shares her trials and triumphs but also provides encouragement to anyone who has felt the weight of a life burdened with guilt, low self esteem and doubt.After reading this book, you will feel enlightened, encouraged and empowered to break free of life's burdens."},{"Title":"Why Surrender Is Not A Four Letter Word","review":"First of all, I'm just not in the habit of reading any book that might fall into the categories of Christian or \\"self-help.\\" But a dear friend of mine gave me a copy of this book, and I read it, really just to make her happy. MUCH to my surprise, I LOVED this book!! Linda Russell's story pulls you right along, and is entertaining, warm and funny - even if you weren't necessarily in the market for a message from above!Mrs. Russell puts God's love in perspective. Her story takes something that (at least for me) is intangible and elusive, and makes it feel concrete. Perhaps because the author herself seems like someone you know (or would like to know!), her story becomes very easy to relate to. She is a normal person with normal problems and struggles, who works very hard in her every normal day to have an extraordinary relationship with God. That's something I can believe in!"},{"Title":"Why Surrender Is Not A Four Letter Word","review":"\\"Why Surrender Is NOT A Four Letter Word\\" is a book everyone can enjoy and relate to, no matter what your relationship is with God.

She challenges us to let God into our reality and to be open to the miracles the Holy Spirit can work in and through us."},{"Title":"Why Surrender Is Not A Four Letter Word","review":"I loved the book - when I got it out of the mailbox I began to read it right away and did not put it down for the next week. (I am a slow reader!) At the end of each chapter, I felt invited to read more as there was so much to glean from Linda's story. The anticipation of what was going to happen next along with being able to easily enter into Linda's story made it an enjoyable read. There were many times when I knew that God was using her story to teach me something. I learned more about the fruits of the Spirit in Galatians and more about how much God deeply and sincerely loves me. There were tough, truthful moments in the book that stretched me to believe and trust more in God in all circumstances. I can see why people would think surrendering is a four letter word but after reading Linda's book, I can see where surrendering to God and His good and perfect will for my life is the best thing that I can do."},{"Title":"Why Surrender Is Not A Four Letter Word","review":"The next best thing to talking with Linda is reading her book. She is a funny, deep and compassionate woman of faith, and the tone of her book is true to her wonderful personality.

This one is devoted solely to UFO story segments from the show. (To clarify: The actual cover to this book is red in color and features flying saucers, an alien face, and a highway. In some cases on Amazon, the wrong book cover is shown or no cover is shown.)In some ways this book is more professionally presented than the first one: the design inside looks slightly better and the photos are in one section now, instead of two. Like the first book, it is well-written and a good read. Henry Winkler (yeah, \\"The Fonz\\" and producer of the \\"Sightings\\" show) wrote the foreword, which is interesting to read.I have a few criticisms that keep me from giving the book a perfect score: 1) the photos should have been in color; 2)the small boxes of info after every story in the first book are not present here; 3)some of the stories seem to be more skeptical than the first book (they seem to favor the government technology angle over alien space craft). Also, there is only one topic. It IS my favorite topic, but the variety of paranormal topics presented in the first book more closely resembles the TV show's presentation. Therefore, I enjoyed the first book a little more than this one.Still, it is a good read and worth buying."},{"Title":"Sightings: UFO's","review":"The second Sightings book, this one is devoted solely to the UFO phenomena. As with the first book, it's actually quite good. The writing is excellent, and the stories convincing.

I still think that the vast majority of these stories are bogus--but do I think that we haven't been visited by beings from outer space?

Gillette at first said her death was an accident, then that it was a crime of passion, but it turned out he'd murdered her in cold blood because he didn't want to marry her or support their child.If you want a good grounding in any of these cases but don't have a lot of time, this book would be a good place to start.

Unlike the various movies we have seen, Allende starts the story before Diego is born and tells of the union of his parents Alejandro de la Vega, the Spanish grandee, and Toypurnia/Regina, the half-Indian warrior queen. The story covers Diego's tutelage in Indian mysticism, swordplay, acrobatics, magic and gambling as a child and young man. Along with his milk brother, Bernardo, he perfects the skills which enable him to get out of sticky situations during his stay in Barcelona as a love-struck young man, then later as the avenging spirit Zorro upon his return to California."},{"Title":"Zorro - A Novel","review":"I'm not much for current fiction authors, especially if they don't write in English, but as a baby boomer, I'm an old Disney Zorro fan, so I decided to give this book a try. I was really surprised at how well this \\"literary\\" author constructed a backstory for what is, in essence, a pulp hero. Allende begins with a look at Diego de la Vega's father, not-yet-Don Alejandro, as a young military man in 1790 Spanish California, and his meeting with his future wife, a half-Spanish, half-Gabrieleno-Indian warrior woman and the daughter of a female shaman. Given a land grant by the Governor, Alejandro resigns from the army and sets to work to develop a rancho (along with a soap factory and a formula for preserving meat in a tasty way). In 1795 his only child, Diego, is born. Allende constructs a plausible boyhood for the future Zorro, showing how he acquires many of the skills and secrets that will later serve him so well, and painting a picture of his relationship with his \\"milk-brother,\\" the mestizo Bernardo (who in Allende's version is not born mute, but shocked into it by his mother's rape and murder when he is 10), and his championing of his schoolmate, the future Sgt. Garcia. Deeply affected by the bullying Garcia undergoes at the hands of other boys, by the ill-treatment often visited on the native Indians by his father's neighbors, and by the mystic experiences connected to his Gabrieleno vision quest (in which he learns that his spirit guardian is El Zorro, the fox), his later experiences in Barcelona, where he is sent to school at 15, only solidify his sympathies for the underdog. In Barcelona he is exposed to the progressive philosophy of his host, Don Tomas de Romeu, as well as to the reforms and brutalities of the Napoleonic occupation of Spain (some of Allende's best prose lies in her descriptions of the strange juxtaposition of medievalism and modernity that is Barcelona at this time in history); he learns to fence, and is initiated into La Justicia, a secret society dedicated to helping the oppressed. He also falls head-over-heels in love with Juliana, Don Tomas's elder daughter--while her cross-eyed tomboy sister, Isabel, becomes equally, though silently, devoted to him. He fights a duel with Juliana's suitor, Rafael Moncada; he rescues political prisoners, has a love affair with a much older Gypsy widow, warns her tribe of a French prosecution, and after the occupation ends he gets Don Tomas's daughters and their duena all the way across Spain and onto a ship bound for America--only to run afoul of the infamous Jean Lafitte and his pirates, among whom he sees slavery and becomes even more devoted to helping the weak. Finally returning to California at 20, he begins his true career as Zorro by again besting Moncada, who has been sent as a royal envoy to Spain and has not only arrested Don Alejandro and confiscated his rancho, but has embarked upon a pearl-harvesting program that flies under the government's radar and exploits the Indians in the process. Wry humor and flashing action abound, and Diego's development from innocent yet mischievous child (including a splendidly described campaign to capture a live grizzly) to the dashing and compassionate Masked Avenger of Los Angeles is portrayed with skill, pace, and believability. (My only question is whether, as Allende asserts, the Spanish Crown took 90% of all wealth harvested from its colonies; I had understood that its share was 20%, \\"the King's fifth.\\") It's been some time since I read the Johnston McCulley original, so I can't vouch for how well the book dovetails into the situations described there, but Allende's version stands well on its own, reads quickly, and is compelling and exciting. Even if you don't read \\"literary\\" or non-American authors, if you ever watched a Zorro movie or TV episode (or wore a mask and cape and flourished a toy rapier), you'll enjoy this novel."},{"Title":"Zorro - A Novel","review":"In this book, Isabel Allende very adroitly manages to bring together all of the threads of the Zorro legend. Details and nuances from the old movies, the new movies, the old TV series, and the original Johnston McCulley books are all combined and explained very neatly in this story, together with the addition of some appropriate and fascinating history of the times. One of the delights of this story is the way that Allende uses the Bernardo character as Johnston McCulley originally imagined him. This and his mother's history help explain the closeness between Zorro/Diego and the local indians, and also the absence of his mother.If you have some interest in the story of Zorro you will probably enjoy this book. Remember that it is written in a style that is more akin to the early and mid 1900s. If you are a lover of Zorro you will find this to be a very satisfying explanation of the origins of Diego de la Vega and his family and friends. I hope you enjoy it as much as I did!"},{"Title":"Zorro - A Novel","review":"This is a novel of the early life of Zorro (Spanish for Fox). Most of us are familiar with the legend of this champion of the poor and oppressed from previous books and movies. But who was he and where did he come from? In this book Isabel Allende creates a tale about how, Diego de la Vega, the son of a rich landowner in Spanish California during the early 1800s transformed into the caped and masked adventurer. The first 90 pages deal with his childhood, the next 200 or so with his youth and only the last 60 find him back in California, which to most of us is the familiar setting for his exploits. This is an interesting approach. On the one hand, it drags in some sections, as the early life of what is after all a fictional character is chronicled in loving detail. One wishes some biographies were this exhaustive. On the other hand, a rewriting of Zorro's known adventures would likely have been unsatisfying (either a mere retelling of something already familiar or in conflict with an established version of the story). Isabel Allende has avoided this trap by exploring fresh territory. Thus we are entertained with Diego de la Vega's escapades in early life and his childhood bond with the local Indians so we are able to understand his empathy for the oppressed. Then we witness his coming of age in Spain, where his personality is shaped by the injustices he sees while his sword arm is trained by a famous fencing master. On the way back to California he is captured by the pirate Jean Lafitte and taken to New Orleans. From him he learns to be the charming rogue. Finally, the denouement and confrontation with his nemesis (one Rafael Moncada) takes place back in his native California.On the whole this is an absorbing tale. I only wish it were a little faster-paced and had less emphasis on speculative childhood experiences and more on the adult adventures."},{"Title":"Zorro - A Novel","review":"I wanted to sink my teeth into a good book this summer and this was it.

His evolution into Zorro, and the beginning of his legendary fight for injustices takes him to Spain, to Jean Lafitte's legendary Barataria and back to California.I usually prefer to read books with female protagonists but since Allende wrote Zorro, I thought I'd give it a try.

Let's hope that Isabel will write the continuing story to this brilliant novel about the fox - ZORRO."},{"Title":"Zorro - A Novel","review":"Author Isabel Allende has re-imagined the childhood of Don Diego de la Vega, the man who would one day become Zorro, in an entertaining and ultimately provocative book. She takes an unlikely topic and imbues it with her signature style of \\"magical realism\\", the same approach that made her 1982 novel, \\"The House of the Spirits\\", so eminently readable. In fact, she has a unique gift of humanizing her mythic protagonist in a way that reminds me of the way the origins of Batman have been rethought for a contemporary audience. In Allende's hands, Zorro is a conscientious revolutionary whose sense of duty and justice comes from the accidental miscegenation of his birth. His father is a Spanish officer, his mother a Shoshone Indian woman. The combination gives Diego an increased consciousness of how California's native people were persecuted by the marauding Europeans.Allende expands her perspective to recount the region's growing pains as the native population is forced off their land and become Christians as mandated by the Spanish-ruled Catholic Church. During this horrific period, Diego decides to take on his vulpine identity-zorro is Spanish for \\"fox\\"-after a fox delivers him from danger. But interestingly, the most engrossing parts of the book take place in Spain where Diego learns the art of fencing at Maestro Manuel Escalante's Fencing Academy. It is here that Diego is invited to join \\"La Justicia\\", a vigilante group with a mission statement that has them seek justice, nourish the hungry, clothe the naked, protect widows and orphans - all the duties we have come to expect from all our darker heroes, whether it is Zorro, Robin Hood or Batman. Allende does not shortchange fans of the original Zorro as she brings back and adds dimension to Diego's beloved companion Bernardo, and Zorro's faithful Tornado. The author effectively details how Bernardo and Diego grew up together and how Bernardo became mute after a horrifying childhood trauma. But Allende does not get completely caught up in her protagonist's upbringing, as she conjures up an adventuresome and romantic spirit befitting the legend without stooping to clich&eacute;s.There are plot twists, prison rescues, and even the obligatory jealousy-inducing flirtations between Zorro's true love and a pirate. This may not be her most profound book, but Allende is entitled to write a picaresque novel, particularly one imbued with swashbuckling, swordplay, honor, hidden desire, unlikely coincidence and a good old-fashioned villain. The novel is not perfect, even as a beach read, as Allende engages in her interests such as a New Age Machisma through the Wise Woman With Herbs. Regardless, this is a fun read with even a surprising post-modern ending."},{"Title":"Zorro - A Novel","review":"This book was amazing! Allende has a true gift for story telling as she keeps you interested even though there isn't very much suspence. This book is about zorro's childhood, and is not like the movie at all. The wrting is as if the author were sitting across from you and is smooth and seemless."},{"Title":"Zorro - A Novel","review":"I liked the novel (I listened to it on audiobook). I didn't give a \\"love it\\" rating as I enjoyed Allende's Daughter of Fortune better. But this was a very light-hearted adventure story in a time and place when everything was very very bad (just look at Goya's works to see that). I also liked that it covered an era in history that I knew little about (Spanish colonization and role in the Napoleanic Wars). It was a modern dime novel and I enjoyed it for its light heartedness and the fact that nobody dies."},{"Title":"Zorro - A Novel","review":"One of the first \\"superheroes\\" to appear in fiction was Zorro, the masked avenger who served as an inspiration for various other characters such as Batman. In comic book terms, Isabel Allende's Zorro is an origin story which discusses the early life of Diego De La Vega and what made him become the hero he would be.I admit I approached this book with some trepidation. I am not overly familiar with Allende's work, but always pictured her as being a very serious, literary type of author. My initial thought was that her book on Zorro would be an ironic, rather revisionist take on the character that would make him seem more like a villain than a hero, perhaps a 19th century terrorist upsetting society. It was to my delight that I found this was not the case; her book is a well-written adventure story which solidly embraces the traditional, heroic Zorro.The story begins with the courtship of Diego's father, a Spanish soldier and his mother, an Indian version of Joan of Arc, leading her troops in battle. Unlike Joan, however, she will have a happier (though by no means totally happy) fate. Diego winds up being raised on a vast estate in the Los Angeles area, growing up with his best friend and \\"milk brother\\", the Indian Bernardo. Together the two will go as teens to Spain for further education at the time of Napoleon's dominion over the country.It is in Spain that Diego begins to develop his Zorro persona, an identity taken from the Indian rituals he went through as a child. It is also where he crosses swords for the first time with his arch-enemy Rafael Moncada, an unpleasant individual who is also Diego's rival for the affections of Juliana de Romeu. Zorro, however, would not be fully developed until Diego's return to California.This story has all you could want out of an old-fashioned adventure novel: heroes, villains, romance, action and exotic settings (not to mention war, pirates, gypsies and secret passageways). Allende's writing (or at least the translation) is high caliber, making this easily a five star book and a really fun read."},{"Title":"Zorro - A Novel","review":"\\"Zorro\\" is the story of the epic adventures of a young man and his friends during the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. Diego is the son of a Spanish hidalgo and a Native American. His father, sent to Spanish California to serve as mayor of the colony, met his mestizo mother during a raid she lead to free captured Native Americans from the catholic missionary that held them. Moved by Toypurnia's beauty and bravery, Alejandro helps Toypurina escape from prison and releases her to the wife of one of Spain's most elite citizens and governor of the colony. Under years of Eulalia's tutelage, Toypurnia is renamed Regina, and is taught all the ways and manners of the Spanish elite. Meanwhile, Alejandro's love for the Indian beauty grows with her absence. When the two meet again, Regina's refined mannerisms and Alejandro's growing love result in a marriage that produces an only son, Diego. Born on the same day as Diego is another boy, son of an Indian servant to Alejandro and Regina. The two boys, Diego and Bernardo, become fast friends and consider themselves brothers, their social status and the roles it dictate being the only thing that separate them.As the boys mature, their bond grows stronger. Both endure the horrors of a pirate raid on the family hacienda and right of passage trials from which they emerge as men. As is customary with the Spanish elite, Diego, accompanied by Bernardo as his servant, is sent to Spain during his adolescence to study. While being educated in the School of Humanities, Diego also studies fencing under the guidance of the most notable dueling instructor of the time. It is during Deigo's years in Spain that his eyes are opened to the injustices of the rich at the expense of the poor; the corruption of the Spanish government and the violent punishments dispensed by catholic inquisitors. It is also in Spain that Diego declares his undying and unrequited love for the beautiful and delicate Juliana.As the novel unfolds, the author pulls the reader from one adventure to another. Like all Alllende novels, this story is filled with the magic and mysticism of ancient cultures. The characters are richly drawn, my favorites being Bernardo and Isabel; the later of whom I will not mention much about in this account, better that you come to know her on your own. I especially appreciate that in Allende's retelling of \\"Zorro\\", characters that would typically be marginalized to create a wider space for the hero, have been given full and interesting lives. This novel was a great escape and an incredible adventure that spanned fifty years and two continents. Love, honor and justice are at the center of the story while freedom and the mysteries of the human spirit hover at the edges. Allende has never let me down and \\"Zorro\\" is one of her finest accomplishments. Highly Recommended."},{"Title":"Zorro - A Novel","review":"I can think of very few novels that teenage boys would like and that also have true literary merit: Twain's _Huckleberry Finn_, Salinger's _Catcher in the Rye_ and now Allende's _Zorro_. This novel touches on the timeless themes of race, class, and spirituality but all within a wonderful adventure story. In the same way that Beethoven and Handel would take drinking songs and other popular tunes and use them as the basis for hymns and symphonies, Allende has taken a story with characters and plot outlines already familiar to most readers from pulp novels, movies and TV shows and has turned it into a wonderful work of literary art.In the course of the novel, we learn how Diego de la Vega took the name Zorro, where he learned swordsmanship and the the use of disguise, why his faithful friend Bernardo doesn't speak and why they both champion the poor and dispossessed. By giving motivation and context for Zorro's actions, he becomes a real human being not just a two-dimensional action hero. In my favorite passage from the book, after the evil Moncada attacked Bernardo without provocation, Diego challanged Moncada to a duel and asked his fencing instructor, Manuel Escalante, to serve as a second.\\"A duel is a serious matter that concerns a gentleman's honor. It has a very strict etiquette and norms. A caballero does not fight a duel over a servant,\\" said Manuel Escalante.\\"Bernardo is my brother, maestro, not my servant. Bet even if he were, it isn't fair to mistreat someone who is unarmed.\\"\\"Not fair you say? Do you truly believe that life is fair, Senor de la Vega?\\"\\"No, maestro, but I plan to do everything in my power to make it so,\\" Diego replied."},{"Title":"Zorro - A Novel","review":"I started off reading this in hopes that the Antonio Banderas/Catherine Zeta Jones style of Zorro would be here, It took me 50 pages to get used to the narrative, and once I did I was hooked. The playful spirit of the story gathered me in and transported me back to the swashbuckling era from whence the character came. Learning Allende's version of Zorro's origin was a great way to spend time, and I recommend this book highly."},{"Title":"Zorro - A Novel","review":"I have always enjoyed Zorro from the classic movies to Guy Williams' TV show. So I was already pretty sure that I would enjoy Isabel Allende's retelling of the Zorro legend. However, I was surprised about how much I enjoyed it. The author doesn't just retell the legend but expands on it by bringing in Native American mysticism and tales of court intrigue in Napoleanic Spain and pirates in the caribbean, to boot. These expansions aren't just filler but help us to understand Zorro's motivations. If you have never heard of Zorro, this book is as acessible as to the fan who owns his own mask and cape. There are some portions that seem to run on too long but generally, it is a great read."},{"Title":"Zorro - A Novel","review":"I was quite excited to read this novel when it came out. I had never read a Zorro novel (or an Isabel Allende novel) but had seen movie adaptations, and the critics assured me this would be a summer beach read with a brain.While this is certainly a serviceable story, it left me disappointed. Brain or no, it's certainly a beach read with a social conscience. Oppressed native peoples good, clueless European colonizers bad: I get that. But how conventional! After a while, the target becomes too easy and one begins to sympathize with supposed villains, just because modern literature is always picking on them.The most disappointing aspect of the book, however, is that the titular character barely shows up. A better title might have been Zorro, The Prequel, or Everything You Never Really Wanted to Know about Zorro and Didn't Ask. Diego's boyhood \\"adventures\\" read like Tom Sawyer and Huck Finn if they lived in Spanish California, which is fine as far as it goes but not what you expect when you pick up a book called Zorro with the masked, caped & besworded one on the cover. At one point, I noted that my bookmark was more than halfway through the pages and lamented to my husband, \\"He's not even Zorro yet!\\"Once Diego does don the mask and cape, the action picks up considerably. The episode where his party ends up in New Orleans with pirates is just what you expected for the price of admission. But by that point, the number of remaining pages is dwindling, and you realize that's about all you're going to get.There's too much demythologizing of the legendary Zorro for me. I don't want to know that a great deal of his exploits are accomplished by employing doubles and with the backing of a tribe of Indian warriors, any more than I want to hear that Zorro is getting bald and fat. I like my superheroes larger than life, and Allende cuts Zorro down to size too much for my taste."},{"Title":"Zorro - A Novel","review":"I bought this book never having read anything else by Isabel Allende, but I had high expectations given the generally positive feedback from my friends about her other books. I am a huge fan of historical fiction, and I have to say that this book has been a major letdown for me compared to the quality of the novels of Bernard Cornwell, Eiji Yoshikawa, Larry McMurty, and other greats. Allende's style annoyed me greatly because she seems to enjoy writing long descriptive passages with only brief snatches of simplistic dialogue that does nothing to enchant the reader. There is no period immersion; I never got the impression of being in 19th century America/Spain. Spain and America seem to be pretty interchangable, with the characters having no trouble adapting to new exotic locales. I never could garner any sympathy for the protagonist Diego, or any of the other two-dimensional characters for that matter, because they fit into easily-defined stereotypes: Diego - dashing, handsome hero; Bernardo - wise Native American who doesn't take risks; Juliana - beautiful but ditzy blonde; Isabel - ugly duckling of the family who makes up for her lack of beauty by being brave and clever. One can immediately understand all of the characters and their motivations with a one sentence description of each. The one villain who had potential, Monconde (forgive the spelling, read the book a while ago), does hardly anything for most of the book. The scene at the pirate's island seemed to be totally unneccesary except as a device to get rid of Juliana. Once I found out who the narrator was...I didn't care. The narrator's occasional interjections try to be clever in an offhand way but they just come off as cliched. I had high hopes for an interesting read after noticing the blurb hinting at Diego's schizophrenic personality, and was expecting some psychological development in the protagonist struggling not to let the Zorro personality take over. I was wrong. If you absolutely must read a new novel of Zorro, at least wait for the paperback edition."},{"Title":"Zorro - A Novel","review":"It's taken me months to read the Spanish version of Zorro because I can't get interested in the characters or the plot. Her writing is heavily narrative with little character development. For instance, she'll introduce a scene that describes in great detail the location or activities of her characters while only briefly stating what they are feeling.I was surprised by the very dry style of Zorro because I'm also reading her novel, \\"Portrait in Sepia\\", in Spanish. In \\"Portrait\\" she writes very expressively and imaginatively. Perhaps in Zorro she got caught up in trying to produce a historically accurate novel at the expense of the rest?"},{"Title":"Zorro - A Novel","review":"I love good adventure tales but this one was just pedestrian. Someone else here wrote that the author engages in too much telling and not enough showing. I think that is a fair, albeit unfortunate, assessment. The story is slow and plodding and the character of Diego de la Vega is rather tiresome. We follow the boy Diego and his 'foster' brother Bernardo (they shared the same wet nurse, Bernardo's mother) as they grow up in old Spanish California, endure hardships and are sent packing to Barcelona, Spain where the precocious young Diego is to complete his education.En route, Diego and Bernardo perfect their acrobatic skills on their ship's rigging (having previously learned the secrets of the local Indian tribe from which they hailed -- Diego being one quarter Indian through his warrior Indian mother and Bernardo being full Indian). On board ship, our ever receptive young Diego learns magic tricks from an Italian seaman and perfects his skill with cards. In Barcelona they fall in with gypsies, of course, and learn even more skills. Meanwhile, Diego, besides getting an education suitable for a young scion of the Spanish nobility (and sharing all he learns with Bernardo of course) manages to become the prize student of the fencing maestro of the age, one Manuel Escalante who, it turns out, is also a member of a secret society dedicated to righting wrongs and helping the suffering into which our young Diego is promptly inducted!In all of this, Diego continues to enjoy playacting and, especially, dressing up in a black costume, complete with mask, to scare or just amaze those around him. He first does it in public while performing in a gypsy circus. In fact, it's all a bit much and by the time Diego is forced to flee Barcelona (after the denunciation and execution of his host to the restored Spanish throne by way of the Inquisition) with two beautiful young damsels and their duena in tow, I had pretty much had it.None of the characters are well drawn, the adventures are sparse and predictable, the narrative tension barely identifiable. Had it not been for the solid research and the craftsmanship of the prose (though I didn't much care for the self-conscious voice adopted by the author), I'd have been hard pressed to rate this one above two stars.As it happens, though, it had enough to redeem it to warrant three, at least as I see it in my current state of mind. But I was sorely disappointed with the lack of excitement, vividness, characterization and dramatic tension. Perhaps this will please fans of Ms. Allende. I doubt it will please adventure lovers more generally and am surprised that aficionados of Zorro seem to find it satisfying as some reviews here have indicated.SWM"},{"Title":"Zorro - A Novel","review":"This book includes a great historical background of the Spanish and Indian population and how they blended together through love. It also includes accurate historical backgfrounds on Panama before the days of the canal.I enjoyed the discriptions of Spain during the 1700 & 1800's in this novel and how people lived during trying times when the French ruled this country. The mistery of Zorro is unvieled piece by piece preparing the reader for what is to come when Diego de la Vega returns to his home and realizes what his calling in life really was when he first saw the little fox (zorro) following him in the woods one day."},{"Title":"Zorro - A Novel","review":"I picked up this book expecting swashbuckling adventure and humor. What I got was a well-written, though occasionally verbose, romantic biography of Zorro up to the age of 20.Ms Allende tracks the hero's life from birth through his boyhood, through his years in Barcelona and then his return to California.From a historical background view, there is a lot here. The author captures the times well and her descriptions of the times and settings are very good. There are clear 21st century views here, especially in the portrayal of Indians and their plight, women and the Spanish Inquisition. The viewpoints are not overwhelming, it is just a politically correct view of the early 19th century.Unfortunately, there is so much other \\"stuff\\" in the book that the characters get lost. It is almost unfathomable that in a biography of Zorro the reader hardly gets invested in the main character. There is a curious detachment in the telling. It is almost as if the narrator only observes the actions of our hero from afar (even though we learn late in the book that the narrator is a close confidante). Zorro and Bernardo are cardboard cutouts and their actions and thoughts are extremely predictable.The book is told in the third person, although the narrator occasionally interjects in the first person. Those interjections were usually incongruous and were somewhat feeble attempts at humor.The swashbuckling scenes one would expect were rare and short. Although well-written, they were so brief they failed to build any excitement. I found myself interjecting memories of movies and TV Zorro to imagine the scenes because the author did not put enough description into her action scenes. That is a shame because she is clearly adept at description.All in all this was a romance historical fiction more than an adventure book. If that is what one is looking for, this fills the bill. If you are looking for action-packed exciting scenes, you will have to go back to the movies for that Zorro."},{"Title":"Zorro - A Novel","review":"I picked this book in the library and borrowed it on an impulse. All I read was Zorro and that was it.Personally I expected better from the author and the story. I feel that while Allende had a pretty good idea w/ the story -the whole take on indian roots was a nice change- the way it was narrated left a lot to be desired. The whole story is told in third person, from another character's view. And while even w/ that the story could've been salvaged, there was something that turned it off completely for me. Allende tells you the story; she doesn't put you there inside their head with their ideas and feelings, she just tells you what they did. Even the action was dulled by the telling. There was a lack of connection between the reader and the story. The narrative didn't quite reach you. The narrator tried to be funny but succeeded so little in doing it, because you didn't feel engrossed in the story.So, if you love the story of Zorro don't be too fooled by this one. At least don't buy it on impulse. Read it first, borrow it from library or even read the first few pages; see if may be you like it. People's taste varies. This may be just what you wanted and expected, but if not you can save yourself the time and money!"},{"Title":"Zorro - A Novel","review":"Isabelle Allende, author of the magnificent The House of the Spirts, as well as Daughter of Fortune (An Oprah Book Club selection) has succeeded in producing an interesting chronicle of the beginnings of the masked hero.Transporting us from late 18th century California to Spain and back, Allende's ability to recreate times and places for the reader is masterful, with historical details that increase the story's realism. The narrative style is witty and engaging--for this reader, the most entertaining aspect of the novel!And what would an Allende work be without at least a little magic? Zorro does not disappoint in this regard. Both Indian and African are represented as the supernatural exerts its influence over natural forces.However, the author's usual depth of character seems lacking in the title character himself. You are never able to feel fully in tune with or empathize with Diego de la Vega/Zorro. While the childhood chapters are finely drawn and absorbing, much of rest of the book seems rushed, and de la Vega, superficial.Perhaps Allende is not as adept in revealing the soul of a male, as opposed to a female? Not so--the persona of Bernardo, the Shoshone \\"blood brother\\" of de la Vega, is beautifully crafted and touchable. But for this reviewer, Diego de la Vega/Zorro remains no more substantial than the legend.While still a favorite author of this reviewer, Allende disappoints with this book.A.R., Southern California"},{"Title":"Zorro - A Novel","review":"I have read with mixed emotions the different reviews by my fellow readers. Now, The Raven is known for a picky review. But bear with me on this. I found the story at times very exciting, at times full of scenes I felt were not really necessary, and somewhat overwhelming in details. So then, why do I rate it four stars? Because the book deserves four stars!1. Notice the title page. See the words, \\"Transalated from the Spanish by Margaret Sayers Peden\\"? Allende wrote for her intended audience. And I remembered reading Don Quixote, Cervantes' classic, and encountering the same problems. Therefore, the fault lies not in the writing, but in Anglo failure to appreciate the same things Spanish people cherish. It's a cultural thing. I then could enjoy the story, as I did Don Quixote, by trying to understand cultural differences. Expand your horizons. Don't be narrow-minded.2. When Johnston McCully created Zorro, he worried more about the heroic character, not historical accuracy. As a student of old West history (which you don't find in most history books!), I agree that Allende's Spanish California is more accurate.3. Zorro became more than a fictional character, he became legend. Did you think that Zorro entered the world in full costume, sword in hand, already astride Tornado? All heroes have to have a birth, parents, and a point at which they decide to become said hero, and a cause for which to fight. Allende finally gives us the true tale, and wonderfully done. Bravo! Ole!One last point, Senorita Allende. Nice artist conception of yourself as the Isabel of the story! Or did you really think we were all loco, and would fail to catch on, eh? Quoth the Raven..."},{"Title":"Zorro - A Novel","review":"\\"Out of the night, when the full moon is bright,Comes the horseman known as Zorro...\\"As a kid, I was obsessed with Zorro. I dressed as Zorro in a home-sewn costume complete to the cape and a sword I made myself, and not just on Halloween. He was one of the inspirations who caused me to learn how to handle fine steel. This Spanish answer to the legends of Robin Hood and the Scarlet Pimpernel wasn't at all a bad hero for a solitary boy to have. However, having access to him only through television and the Whitman books and not having read the original novels, to me he sprang full-grown and with skills fully developed from the brow of Walt Disney.Isabel Allende's novel goes far in filling in Zorro's backstory and explaining how he learned his skills; what forces went into the shaping of his character; exactly how and why Bernardo fits into the picture; and why Don Diego did what he did as Zorro. Allende does a superb job of fitting the man into the context of his times and the culture of Spanish California. She has obviously done her research well. There are no inconsistencies with history and all the techniques Don Diego learns are correct in context. She makes Zorro more nearly akin to Batman in terms of training and discipline than most people would realize without stopping to think about it. All this is well and good.However, when it comes to the story, I regret to say that in my opinion the pace rarely gets above a sitting trot. Most of the time it is a slow walk; and at other times one gets the feeling that Zorro is leading Tornado on foot by the reins with a scowl on his face, wondering why he can't simply mount up, spur in and gallop over the plotline. Attention to detail and reasoning out aspects of training are all well and good, but with an action hero like Zorro sooner or later you have to shake up the reins and let him go; and this, I am sorry to say, Allende never does. The story line does not benefit in the slightest from being kept on a check-rein.The bottom line is that it is not a bad read and it is a valuable addition to the Zorro canons; but it's a read-once. The principal value of the novel is as a reference work, not as entertainment. If you know that going in, perhaps you will not be as disappointed as I was by the novel. Even so:\\"Hail to the Fox, where'er he be;May he live long, and merrily!\\""},{"Title":"Zorro - A Novel","review":"This book is wonderfully written, extensively researched, and contains vivid character portrayals. I have read Allende's prior novels and she does not disappoint her audience in this book. Her writing talent flows through the story as events, characters and plot are intriguingly integrated. Allende shows tremendous range as she carries the story through two continents, over a twenty year time span, and weaves the events of the times into the fabric of her tale.The story fleshes out the Zorro legend. It is in the tempest of the early 1800's that Diego (Zorro) tries to come to grips with his Indian and Spanish heritages. He displays his inner conflict by changing demeanor from gentlemen to adventurer. All around him and throughout the book this duality rages: it is Christianity vs Indian Spiritualism; it is European Civilization vs Indian Culture; it is Old World vs New World values; it is rich vs poor; it is beauty vs intelligence; it is right vs wrong.I feel that that Allende ties up these conflicts beautifully with her surprise ending. At all times this book was entertaining.The problem with the book is that Zorro is already an icon of sorts. The author's depiction of the character is just so different from my pre-conceived notions of him. The protagonist is now depicted as a Zorro from a romance novel, or simply on an estrogen overdose. He is not the swashbuckler I remember (and want) him to be."},{"Title":"Zorro - A Novel","review":"It is almost inaccurate to describe \\"Zorro\\" as the tale of, yes, Zorro. This novel, aiming to be a retelling of a fun, exciting adventure tale, doesn't quite achieve that status and instead heads into another section of legend retellings - other stories. Allende, in a well-written chunky book tells the story of making of Zorro, rather than his subsequent adventures and galavanting. This leads to a different sort of read than what one might expect of such a boldly titled book.\\"Zorro\\" is the story of Diego de la Vega. The book sets itself up as though Diego's childhood will only be a short section, but soon, pages are flying by and Diego is still a little boy, running around and attempting to make mischief. It is not particularly frustrating, though it is at first bizarre. It takes a good 200+ pages to realize that child-Diego is not going anywhere and this is the pace of the story. From that point on, the reading becomes easier and more exciting - now I found myself awaiting Diego's emergence as Zorro more and more, and the fight scenes that should emerge.On that front, I leave \\"Zorro\\" slightly disappointed. There's no doubt that Allende's book is a fun read and though it does not have quite enough energy to keep the blood pumping, it does keep a reader fairly hooked to the general story. The story is not meant to be mysterious but rather intriguing, exciting, and in a sense it is. For certain readers. Diego's frequent lamentations about his love get slightly tedious at times but it's on the whole enjoyable and in good fun.As nice as it is to read a well-written, fun story about \\"Zorro\\", some facts are hard to overlook. Take, for instance, the occasionally stiff dialogue. There's accounting for the time period and then there's awkwardness. For the most part, everything is good... but the occasional sticky phrase emerges. And then the adventure issue. I have no problems with the fact that \\"Zorro\\" centers on Diego's early life and coming-to as Zorro, but it feels strange to have such a story with so little sword fighting and intense bad-a[...]ness. Characters are endearing but left at a distance, for the most part, another slightly frustrating aspect that is resolved only in the case of a few select characters.Ultimately, I cannot pretend that I didn't enjoy reading \\"Zorro\\". It's a fun book, not particularly heavy and enjoyable on many levels. It has a few issues with the lack of energizing action, but once the reader accepts that this is simply an introduction to the legend and not a book on the legends themselves, these problems are easier to swallow. A pleasant read, not much beyond that. 3.5 stars."},{"Title":"Zorro - A Novel","review":"I've never been disappointed by an Isabel Allende novel. I've read them all, and so it was with great anticipation that I picked up Zorro: A Novel. It did not let me down. From the beginning I was hooked, finished it in five days, it was that hard to put down. True, it may not have the fast pace of Johnston McCulley's original Mark of Zorro, but Allende masterfully blends a little magic realism with some good old fashioned swashbuckling action.Set against wonderfully detailed backgrounds, Allende gives new depths to classic characters while also creating some new unforgettable ones. She certainly adds a few refined, ironic literary touches, and touches on interesting political thought. I could go on and on with specific examples, but I hate to give anything away to future readers, it kind of detracts from the joy of discovery. I can guarantee that those that enjoyed Captain Alatriste by Arturo Perez-Reverte will find a lot to love in this novel. It's a great escape into an excellent adventure."},{"Title":"Zorro - A Novel","review":"Since its creation in 1919 by pulp writer Johnston McCulley, the character of Zorro has captured the hearts and imaginations of young and old alike. The infamous, romantic hero has been played by numerous actors through the decades, from Douglas Fairbanks Jr. in the 1920's to Antonio Banderas in the late 1990's. Now, Isabel Allende, born in Peru and raised in Chile, bestselling author of highly acclaimed literary works such as The House of the Spirits (1985), adds intricate texture and a new dimension to the legend by blending the two things she is best known for, magic realism and historical fiction.Born to Alegandro de la Vega, a Spanish aristocrat, and Toypurnia, a Shoshone Indian warrior, Diego de la Vega (a.k.a. Zorro, or \\"fox\\" in Spanish) is a product of his mixed heritage. His grandmother, White Owl, a healer and shaman, plays an enormous role in the formation of his character. At an early age, while witnessing the injustice committed against Indians, his alter ego begins to show as he becomes increasingly obsessed with justice. Together with his inseparable, mute friend and \\"milk\\" brother Bernardo, Diego is initiated into manhood in the Indian tradition and it is during this experience that he comes into contact with his spirit totem, the fox.At sixteen, Diego is sent to Barcelona for a classical education and, while perfecting the art of fencing with Manuel Escalante, becomes a member of the secret society La Justicia, where he pledges \\"To seek justice, nourish the hungry, clothe the naked, protect widows and orphans, give shelter to the stranger, and never spill innocent blood.\\" During this time, Zorro falls hopelessly in love with Juliana de Romeu, becomes best friends with her sister Isabel, has a duel with Rafael Moncada, and organizes several rescue missions in the midst of political upheaval. Eventually, together with Juliana and Isabel, he's forced to leave Barcelona in disguise. They walk across Spain, live with Gypsies and are captured by pirates. To Diego's chagrin, Juliana succumbs to pirate Jean Latiffee's charms. Eventually Diego and Isabel make it back to California, where Diego's father has been imprisoned on charges of treason. As if this isn't enough, his mortal enemy Rafael Moncada has followed him here seeking revenge.There's no doubt Allende is a gifted, consummate teller of tales. Under her pen, Alta California and Napoleonic Spain come alive in their most vivid, historical detail. From the modest adobe houses and exotic war paint on Indian faces to the filthy, excrement-filled dungeons and the black eyes of Gypsies to the sparkling diamonds against the plump, white d&eacute;collet&eacute; of Spanish belles, Allende offers us a vibrant saga dripping with adventure, romance, history, politics and a touch of magic.It's a pity, though, that Allende spends a large part of the book in the trivial, Barbara Cartland-style romance between Juliana and Jean Latiffe, while Zorro assumes a secondary, nearly silent role, to the point where one has to wonder whose story is being told.Like many other Latin American writers, Gabriel Garcia Marquez among them, Allende uses the omniscient point of view and her paragraphs are long and almost entirely devoid of dialogue. This evokes a magical quality, the sensation of sitting in front of a bonfire while listening to an old and wise storyteller, but at the same time causes a lack in dramatization. One can't help thinking that Allende has so many stories to tell that if she added dialogue, the book would easily turned into a one-thousand page manuscript. Of course, the lack in dialogue, and so much \\"telling\\" rather than \\"showing\\" pertains to style and not to a lack of literary skill. Another interesting aspect of Allende's writing is the power she gives to most of her female characters. Damsels in distress? Not in this novel! The women here are wilful, intelligent individuals to be reckoned with. Allende also keeps the identity of the narrator a mystery until the last chapter.Though Allende ultimately fails in lifting Zorro from his place as a two-dimensional, comical character, her remarkable prose and action-packed story make this book a pleasure to read."},{"Title":"Zorro - A Novel","review":"I wanted to enjoy this book very much. I am a huge Zorro fan, as the \\"Z\\" tattooed on my arm will attest. The book drowns a fairly fun and adventurous story in hokey pseudo-mystical Indian hoodoo. Other than Diego fighting against the persecution of natives I wish that the Indian angle had not been done (or at least not beaten us over the head with it). Also, Diego goes from firebrand to fop within the space of a scene, in front of the same characters. It would not be hard to deduce the guise of the dandy was false. I mean he calls out the villain for a duel, hardly the act of a perfumed popinjay. Diego's relationship with the Gypsy was out of left-field and could easily been dropped, as it added nothing except to get him some action. If Bernardo is full-bloded Indian (based on his features I'm assuming) why is he given a spanish name? The natives are nothing if not fiercely proud. Though most not to the extent of Mowgli, er, Toypurnia or Grandma White Owl. Did you know Diego and Bernardo were \\"Milk Brothers\\"? Since she tells you on almost every page after they're born, you will. Oh, by the way, they have a form of telepathy between them. Right. Read it if you're a fan, though if you aren't you may enjoy it more.

Allende stalks the most famous legend in California: Zorro!

Zorro (Diego) is transformed by a Native American vision quest into a superman. His milk brother, Bernardo, is too. Boys become men. Diego's totem animal becomes the fox (El Zorro).The new men, Diego and Bernardo, are sent to Barcelona to be educated. Spain was in the middle of a war with the occupation army of France at the time. There, Diego falls i love with the beautiful Juliana de Romeu and joins a secret society: La Justicia. The oath is: \\"To seek justice, nourish the hungry, clothe the naked, protect widows and orphans, give shelter to the stranger, and never spill innocent blood.\\" (p 154)Diego meets a Gypsy widow and satisfies all but his heart. His heart belongs to Juliana whose father, a French sympathizer, is arrested, jailed in La Ciudadela and executed despite everyone's efforts to save him.After further adventures including a thrilling sword fight, the author explains she has run out of ink (quills).

He is one of the very few pulp fiction creations, who has been able to escape the confines of the genre and cross over into movies, television, comic books, video games and even a London musical. In \\"Zorro: A Novel\\" the noted Chilean American novelist Isabel Allende takes her shot at the Zorro character.Allende had a great idea in trying to put meat on the bones of the Zorro legend. To do this, Allende places him squarely in Alta California and French occupied Barcelona. The novel is at its very best in recreating the historic details of this era. Unfortunately, where Allende fails is in acknowleding that Zorro is a creation of pulp fiction. Isabel Allende is a world class novelist but unfortunately she is not pulp writer. Pulp writing is its own genre and requires a special exuberant aesthetic which Allende unfortunately does not have.Another example of an excellent novelist who cannot make this transition is Michael Chabon whose \\"Gentlemen of the Road\\" is absolutely dreadful. The only contemporary world class novelist that I know of who is able to make this cross over is Arturo Perez Reverte in his Diego Alatriste series. The adventure story is its own genre and serious novelists need to enter this territory with appropriate respect and caution."},{"Title":"Zorro - A Novel","review":"Now, I have the original Zorro novel, \\"Curse of Capistrano\\", and although all the basic elements are in there, the character of Zorro was truly brought into being by Douglas Fairbanks. His silent 'Mark of Zorro' established everything we know about the character, right down to his now-iconic look. Now, Isabel Allende takes the last step: making this pulp fiction character seem like a flesh and blood human being. Her Zorro is viewed through the sometimes jaundiced eye of the narrator, coming off as both a true hero and at the same time, an overgrown adolescent who likes playing dress-up and swashing his buckle. He seems more human than ever, rather than just an invincible hero who triumphs because his cause is just. I was a bit startled at first by the idea of Zorro's mother as an 'Indian' who barely tolerates her husband's white man's world, as it seemed like having Zorro really close and in tight with the natives is just a tad Lone Ranger, you know, but it works within the context of the book. I guess I'm more used to Mrs. Diego from the Tyrone Power remake of the movie, as just another senora, wife of the Don. This is a stronger and more interesting portrayal. I particularly appreciate the handling of genuine historical events and settings, which lends an extra verisimilitude. All in all, I've read this thing three times in less than two months, and it just made me hungry for more Zorro. Sorry, Antonio Banderas, but this is the real deal."},{"Title":"Zorro - A Novel","review":"Isabel Allende is a terrific writer and while I enjoyed the book I did not feel the title of Zorro was justified.

Plenty of interesting detail strung to a frame made of more detail. If you want to know general history about early California, what it was like to cut across Panama in the days before the canal, the Spanish Inquisition, and so on, then it is okay. But it is generally told from such a distant and obtuse point of view that the characters lack any zest. Thus, the encyclopedia analogy.

It has much action and swordplay, Diego's background is fleshed out in an interesting way, and his development into Zorro is believable- as well as his realization that sometimes he isn't sure if he is Don Diego or Zorro or something in between. However, there were a few times Diego acted out of character for both his identities, which I didn't appreciate since his intelligence should've interceded for him in those circumstances. Also, about three-quarters of the way through the book Zorro gives a young lady a kiss that is referred to as being \\"a very good kiss that would've been perfect except for the smoke\\" and he promises to visit the girl on her balcony sometime later. I was quite disappointed when that scene never materialized, and in fact we never see any relationship- or any further meetings of any kind- between him and this woman who was supposed to have captured his heart at long last. It is only alluded to at the very end of the book where we are given a quick epilogue telling how he came to marry her and how she died shortly thereafter. I didn't appreciate that epilogue and almost wished I hadn't read it as we readers have no idea how our hero fared. Instead of that epilogue I believe Ms. Allende should've written another hundred pages or more and fulfilled the promises she'd previously made the reader. In any case, these are not the adventures of Zorro, this is the background story on how he became the legend. It is still worth reading, still much fun, just keep in mind there were decades between the last scene here and the epilogue that follows- and that missing space of time is where the substance of the Zorro most of us have come to appreciate really lies."},{"Title":"Zorro - A Novel","review":"A well written gripping book. It was so good I bought it for my neighbor. The detail on the time period is well worth reading."},{"Title":"Zorro - A Novel","review":"Isabel Allende reinvents the character first introduced by Johnston McCulley in his \\"The Mark of Zorro\\" many years ago. Here we have a Zorro firmly planted in his own time, but relevant to our time and sensibilities. Through Allende's masterful prose, Diego de la Vega, aka Zorro, becomes a hero of flesh and bones, courageous and human. She vividly recreates him and other characters we can believe in. I found myself able to overshadow the overpowering memories of Antonio Banderas, Tyrone Power and Errol Flynn in the role as I read. She also describes the landscapes and settings and makes them important characters in their own right. The story is intriguing and hard to set down when other responsibilities beckon you away and back into regular living.More often reinterpreted on the movie screen than in literature, this book, along with a few other recent treatments of Zorro, will hopefully inspire more authors to explore this interesting character, one of the United States' own Robin Hood characters.The novel has wide appeal, literary and well-written for those wanting a richer reading experience while exciting and heroic for those wanting a light summer read. It's a healthy reading indulgence."},{"Title":"Zorro - A Novel","review":"Historically, whenever and wherever oppression exists, the people who are subject to it look for a heroic figure to defend them and to punish their persecutors. Such a paladin was Robin Hood, another is the legendary Zorro. One of my favorite authors, Isabel Allende, has reached deep into her ample well of talent and brought forth a hero who is more human than demigod. She has breathed fresh life into the Zorro of myth, and gifted him with a heart, a soul, a good mind, an indomitable spirit and human fallibilities. This beautifully told tale of adventure and classical romance is chock-full of swashbuckling swordplay, ocean voyages, pirate attacks, Native American lore and rites, detailed fencing episodes, social injustice, secret underground societies, evil villains, duels at dawn, damsels in distress, unrequited love, gypsy camps, noble drawing rooms, drama, rollicking humor, vivid characters, tremendous energy...and so much more. The story's narrator is even a mystery person whose identity is not revealed until the conclusion. Ms. Allende's \\"Zorro\\" is a glorious literary adventure which will provide hours of entertainment for young and old alike.Don Diego de la Vega was born in Alto California at the end of the 18th century to a Spanish aristocrat, and the daughter of a Shoshone shaman and a Hispanic soldier turned deserter. Diego is raised alongside Bernardo, the son of his Indian wet nurse, and the two milk brothers remain inseparable throughout their lives. Although born into privilege, Diego becomes aware of social injustice at a very early age because of his mestizo blood and his bonds of friendship and brotherhood with Bernardo. European settlers continually perpetrate acts of violence against the Native American population and the two boys are helpless to come to the defense of their people.The two receive a multi-faceted education. The Shoshone teach them how to hunt and fight like Indian braves. White Owl, the shaman and Diego's grandmother, instructs them in indigenous lore, sends them on individual quests for a vision and their totems, and brings them through the rites of manhood. After a fox saves Diego's life, the small animal, el zorro, becomes his emblematic animal. White Owl tells him, \\"Zorro is your totemic animal, your spiritual guide. . . You must cultivate its skill, its cleverness, its intelligence.\\" Don Alejandro de la Vega gives his son lessons appropriate to a young Spanish grandee, including fencing, and instructs him about all things necessary to run their enormous rancho. Whatever Diego is taught, he passes on to Bernardo. The first part of the novel is about life and politics in California, Mexico, and Europe during the Napoleonic Wars, along with vignettes of the events and traumas which touch and effect the lives of the boys, and their families, as they move into adolescence.Diego is sent to Barcelona to receive a noble's education, like that of his Spanish ancestors. Bernardo accompanies him, as a servant, even though he is no such thing. They stay with a close friend of de la Vega's, a Francophile, Tomas de Romeu, who has two daughters, the beautiful Juliana, and the spunky, younger, cross-eyed Isabel. The girls and their duena Nuria, are to play important roles in this tale. All of Spain is under Napoleon's control and the Spanish are rebelling. Guerilla fighters attack the French forces everywhere. Meanwhile, Diego enrolls in the School of Humanities, and is mentored by the famous fencing master, Maestro Manuel Escalante, who literally wrote the definitive manual on the art of swordplay. Escalante recruits Diego into the secret society, Justicia, whose members' are pledged, \\"To seek justice, nourish the hungry, clothe the naked, protect widows and orphans, give shelter to the stranger and never spill innocent blood.\\" It is in Barcelona that the revolutionary character Zorro is born.The novel's final chapters deal with the return of Diego, Bernardo, their traveling companions, and Zorro. And in Alto California, Zorro confronts his enemies at last, the homegrown kind and those who have pursued him from abroad.As always, Isabel Allende's narrative is a delight to read. Her descriptive passages bring to life the local color, sounds and smells of Indian villages, the hacienda, the California countryside, Barcelona, gypsy camps, the sea, and a pirates' island. Her characters brim with life. \\"Zorro: A Novel\\" is better than the stuff of legend and a book I highly recommend for an adventure-packed read.JANA"},{"Title":"Zorro - A Novel","review":"Isabel Allende's enchanting new novel, \\"Zorro,\\" traces the origins of the legendary folk hero, who evolved from a privileged and foolish young man into an intrepid warrior. Zorro's mission was to use his wits, agility, and formidable fighting skills to defend the poor and downtrodden in early nineteenth century Spain and California. Allende laces her narrative liberally with humor, irony, wit, and dozens of colorful characters.The story begins with the birth of Zorro's alter ego, Diego de la Vega, in Alta California. We follow Diego to Barcelona, Spain, where he changes from a playful and callow youth into a passionate young man. The author enlivens her story with intrigue, sword fights, romance, treachery, adventures on the high seas, prison breaks, and fascinating historical background about the relationship between the Native Americans, the Spaniards, the French, and the Catholic Church during those turbulent times. There is never a dull moment in this nearly four hundred page book, and the translation from the Spanish by Margaret Sayers Peden is excellent.Without compromising the spirit of fun that permeates her tale, Allende makes it clear that the Indians in North America were victims of genocide. The Spanish conquerors came to the New World, greedy for land and treasure, and they murdered the Indians, burned their villages, and enslaved those who survived. Allende creates a number of unforgettable Native American characters. Bernardo, Diego's devoted \\"milk brother,\\" becomes mute after his mother is brutally assaulted; White Owl, Diego's grandmother, is a respected shaman and medicinal healer who teaches her grandson to be faithful to his spiritual guide, the fox; and Toypurnia, Diego's mother, is a fierce warrior who cannot be tamed, even by the love of the handsome hidalgo, Alejandro de la Vega.\\"Zorro\\" works so well because Allende goes back to storytelling basics. She puts interesting people in exotic settings, and she has them contend with nasty villains who will stop at nothing to get what they want. Finally, she features a brave, albeit flawed hero, who risks his life, with panache and style, to fight for justice. If this sounds like a Spanish \\"Star Wars,\\" that's not far off the mark. Although the characters, the setting, and the time frames may vary, well-told stories about the battle of good versus evil will always find a place in people's hearts."},{"Title":"Zorro - A Novel","review":"This is the first time that I have read anything by Isabel Allende. Initially, her narrative style put me off a bit. I'm used to a lot on dialogue that describes the situations rather than a lot of narration telling me what is happening. HOWEVER, within a couple of chapters, I was completely pulled into the story by Isabel Allende's tremendous ability to invite her reader into the world that she so adroitly creates. I found myself smiling as each piece of the puzzle that makes up the story I know so well fell into place. Allende allows her readers to observe young Diego De La Vega as each of his skills, personality traits and burning desires snap neatly into place. None of the characters motivations are left to chance, which makes for wonderful story telling.Her detailed descriptions of early California, Barcelona and Panama make the reader believe that Alende actually has seen and experienced the 18th century world that she describes. Also, she pulls no punches when it comes to her description of the indians and their mistreatment by early European aristocrats. The deep rifts between the upper class and lower class that is currently still in place in Mexico is made clear.Although the world of 18th century California is detailed, this story is character driven. Diego De La Vega (Zorro) is an extremely three dimensional character that runs the gamit of human emotion and Allende allows her readers to see his flaws as well as his attributes (as is so often true, the two are one and the same). Bernardo, who in previous incarnations of the Zorro story is a typical \\"sidekick\\", is anything but a \\"sidekick\\" in this novel. Bernardo is a complex, spiritual young man that in many ways is the moral superior of Diego. He is a brother, but also a wise guide, keeping the brash young man on his life's path. Rather than serving Diego because he is of \\"higher\\" caste, Bernardo serves out of love and a deep sense of destiny. In Yogic terms, these two men have found their darma, their purpose in life.\\"Zorro\\" is an interesting look at the legend as well as a wonderful, non-judgmental description of a world of the near past. \\"Zorro\\" is fiction, but Allende fills this story with historical fact as well clever analysis of the ramifications of many of the political decisions made at the time. Every dollar you spend on this one is an investment in thought and entertainment."},{"Title":"Zorro - A Novel","review":"A very different book for Ms. Allende. Based on the fictitious, though widely known, legend of Zorro, Ms. Allende creates a character that we get to know so well, his unusual childhood, his doubts, ambitions and thirst for justice that one has to stop to realize that this is not a biography!! Diego de la Vega's father is a Spanish officer and his mother a Shoshone Indian. He eventually is sent to Spain for a European upbringing and education.Characters are described in depth and are an incredible mix of Indians with their legends and beliefs, his \\"milk brother\\" Bernardo whom he is fiercely bonded to, radicals fighting for justice for the poor in Spain, a fencing master who teaches Diego everything he knows and a woman whose love he cannot have.I think the weakest part of this book is the first third, unfortunately, as the reader must have the desire to \\"stick through\\" the first 100 pages or so; but once they do will be nicely rewarded.A great book for anyone who loves an adventure; particularly those who grew up in the 50's and watched the TV series and/or has a fascination for this character."},{"Title":"Zorro - A Novel","review":"I never read The Mark of Zorro, but if the original was anywhere near as good as this recreation, then I look forward to reading it some time in the future. Allende takes the reader into an enriching journey full of precise history and keen storytelling with Diego de la Vega -- a man torn between the customs of his heritage and doing the right thing. We see how Diego grows up in a somewhat corrupt society in which Europeans torture and abuse Native Americans. He starts off by joining a group called La Justicia, a group of Robin Hood types who help the poor. And through various adventures and turns of history, Diego becomes el Zorro -- a legendary hero that we will not soon forget...As said earlier, I have not read The Mark of Zorro and therefore cannot compare that book with this one. However, this novel is one of the best books I have read in a long time. Isabel Allende has been one of my favorite novelists for as long as I can remember and she has done a wonderful job with this novel. Zorro is a bit of a change from her usual work, but the different angle in her standard writing style is a welcome one. The most impressive part of this novel is the historical reference. Her descriptions of European landscapes and architecture and customs are vivid and breathtaking. We also get a lot of subplots centered on the times in which French military commander Napoleon Bonaparte ruled and corrupted a major part of Europe. All of the aforementioned things make for a literary, enlightening read. I only wish I had taken the incentive of reading the original Spanish version, for I am sure that many things were lost in the translation. Alas, it is difficult to write a summary without giving away important details or spoilers, which is why I have made mine brief. I simply suggest that you get this book and savor its pages like fine wine because historical novels based on legendary heroes don't get better than this!"},{"Title":"Zorro - A Novel","review":"Isabel Allende's skill as a storyteller is once again demonstrated in this never-dull and always fascinating adventure story based on the legend that has long intrigued many writers and thousands of filmgoers through the years. This is a story of the fight for good over evil in the person of a masked man dressed all in black who fought for justice in the early days of Spanish California.Most of this book is about Zorro's early years, and Allende has used her imagination and literary skill well. The basic legend makes him the son of a wealthy Spanish landowner but Allende went further than that in her narrative. She makes his mother a half-breed Indian warrior, and she has him spend his early manhood in Spain, where he learns to fence, meets up with gypsies and falls in love. There are violent politics going on all around him too. There's Napoleon's occupation of Spain, and then the violent hand of the inquisition after Napoleon's defeat. Injustices and villains are everywhere. But there is never a doubt that Zorro will try to change that. As a boy he sees the injustices against the Indians in California. Later, he sees the injustices of the slave trade. These are horrible wrongs. But Zorro fights for justice.There are no subtleties in this book. Everything is right or wrong, good or evil. There is also no doubt that Zorro will survive victorious from his many adventures. And so I just sat back and let the narrative take me where I knew it would go. I let myself be carried along with the story and became Zorro myself, a young man of great athleticism, physical strength and high intelligence. His motives are always for the good of all and there is no doubt he will be victorious.A book like this is a big departure for me. I usually like nuances of emotion and books that have no easy answers. But once in a while it is completely refreshing to let myself get caught up in an adventure story. Isabel Allende is a master of her craft and doesn't waste a word. It's great escape fiction that's fun to read and easy to follow. I could open the book and read for ten minutes and know that those ten minutes would be a welcome change from whatever I was doing at the time.This is not great literature. The words are simple. The story is straightforward. I winced at the horrors of the time and yet found them fascinating. And, I also knew that Zorro would somehow find a way to overcome seemingly insurmountable obstacles. This was a great read. And definitely recommended."},{"Title":"Zorro - A Novel","review":"You should know two things before you start reading this book. First, Isabel Allende's memories of Zorro are of the Disney version. There is a Bernardo in her book, but Tyrone Power did not have a Bernardo backing him up in the movie - but then again, neither Power nor Guy Williams (the TV Zorro) had an Isabel or a Lolita as a love interest.Second, while this is an extremely good novel, don't read it with the expectation that it's similar in any way to any of Allende's other books. \\"Zorro\\" is completely unlike anything else she has ever written. The other Allende novels I've read have been more similar to, say, Gabriel Garcia Marquez in tone and plot, although Allende's other novels never had the mysticism of Garcia Marquez's wonderful tales.For this book, Allende has gone off in a completely different and enchanting direction. Where she borrows from the known Zorro legend, she borrows accurately - the characters of, for example, Moncada and Garcia were completely accurate, and I could picture them in my head as they were in the TV series. Where she goes off on her own, her story is totally believable and logical.I find myself hoping that Allende will write a sequel, but I know that it will never happen. I do hope, though, that this book will bring about a resurgence of interest in Zorro."},{"Title":"Zorro - A Novel","review":"In the 1960's, a sociologist claimed that many first and second generation youths found themselves caught between the U.S. culture and the culture of their family's origin. The sociologist referred to this person as a \\"marginal man.\\" That is, the person was unable to integrate fully into either culture and this cultural confusion affected the person's psychic development.Allende's resurrection of the Zorro classic, intentionally or not, uses this theme of marginalization to explain the personality of Diego de la Vega, who was to become known as Zorro (the fox).De la Vega was born from a strong Indian mother and a proud Spanish father. Each were passionate warriors. Neither parent could completely accept the other's culture and this polarized upbringing is passed on to their only child. The hero of our story is not emotionally crippled by the family dynamics, but the cultural factors explain the hero's character as noted in the book's short epilogue.As to the story, the author is loyal to the original story lines, but gives the various characters much more depth. Zorro's mother is not an ornament and his friend Bernardo is not just a silent sidekick. The women and Native Americans are refreshingly strong and intelligent. The author also gives historical context to the story that was interesting without being burdensome to the reader. My only criticism is that the second person narration was sometimes tiresome, but this was minor and probably only a matter of my taste as opposed to most other readers. For an intelligently written adventure story, the reader could do little better than Zorro."},{"Title":"Zorro - A Novel","review":"Zorro has recently emerged as a popular figure. Antonio Banderas portrayed him in 1998's \\"The Mask of Zorro\\" and in its recently released sequel. There is also the classic TV Zorro from the 50's and 60's whose character is etched in our minds. This Zorro, is however, Chilean author Allende's creation. Zorro here is a historical figure, though his life does indeed border on artificial operatic adventures. However, far from being pulp fiction, it is well-written story, graphically realistic and accurate to its time period. It is set in old California, back when it was Mexican-owned land. Despite the historic elements, it never never becomes dull or a history lesson. The engaging adventure is composed of thrilling swordfights, oceanic voyaes, pirates (Yes, pirates), Native American culture, romance, and heroism. The 18th century milieu is wonderfully realistic, complete with social mores and drawing room etiquette, courtly behavior. The villains are the villains we love to hate and the heroes are the kind we root for and dream of becoming ourselves. Zorro is also a bit of a mystery in some portions. This is a great book and I'm surprised at how different it is from Allende's magic realist/human dramas."},{"Title":"Zorro - A Novel","review":"If you love the character of Zorro, no doubt you will enjoy this book, despite its flaws. Allende follows the formula of combining a fictional character with both imaginary and authentic historical events. The result is a book of genre fiction, and it is on that basis Allende's Zorro must be judged.Allende's primary inspiration are the screen incarnations of Zorro, rather than the Johnston McCulley originals, which (to judge from the first, The Curse of Capistrano, anyway), were rather aimless second-rate pulp stories with little idea of the historical context of early California. Allende draws on the beloved 1950s Disney television series, and such favorite characters as the chubby Sergeant Garcia are emulated in the novel. Indeed, one reason for that series's immense popularity in the Latin American market was the correct perception of its formula, and indeed that of the entire swashbuckler genre, as concerned with correcting social-political injustice and promoting the belief that governments are to protect their citizens, rather than abuse them. (See my book, The Romance of Adventure: The Genre of Historical Adventure Movies, for further analysis of swashbuckler themes.) But Zorro is more than Robin Hood in a cape: his locale and time, Spanish tyranny in early 19th century California, allow exploration of of a decidedly different context. Unlike Robin Hood, Zorro's era is one of awakening recognition of human rights and citizen's need to control their own destiny.Allende utilizes these themes, taking Zorro through his childhood and formative years that develop the young man born Diego de la Vega who returns to California to battle injustice. Her book is nearly over where most Zorro stories begin, and in his odyssey there are four principal experiences, ending in the first episode in which he forces a tyrant from power. As a child Diego sees the mistreatment of Indians; his mother is Indian, and his grandmother is the shaman of her tribe. He was reared alongside his Indian brother Bernardo, realizing with anger the point at which origin was intended to separate their familial bond along racial lines. Sent to school in Spain, he observes the influences of the French, as opposed to the conservative monarchical Spanish tradition. Developing the persona of Zorro, he clashes with the Inquisition, joins a secret underground organization, and befriends the Gypsies. Returning to California, penniless, he is waylaid by Jean Lafitte, to whom he loses the woman he has loved for five years, and notes the democratic, more egalitarian society among the pirates of Barataria. If some of these elements sound familiar, well they should. Lafitte is presented only months after the incidents which formed the crux of the movie THE BUCCANEER (1938 and 1958). Diego's European encounter with the Inquisition, escape with the help of the lower classes, and the appeal of the New World as a place of opportunity, follow the trajectory of Pedro de Vargas in the novel and film of CAPTAIN FROM CASTILE, and indeed Samuel Shellabarger's fiction influenced Allende's book.However, it is much more aptly the oeuvre of Rafael Sabatini which Allende has evoked, most particularly his classic Scaramouche. Diego's training, and the adoption and formation of his disguise as an alter ego, is clearly indebted to this novel. However, this is also Allende's weakness. Sabatini not only wrote the swashbuckler better, but handled the shifts between didacticism and action, history and fiction, more adroitly. Allende's book, written some 80 years after his heyday, should reflect more evolution in the genre-and it does not. The telepathic abilities of Diego and Bernardo, and the critique of the colonialization of native peoples, were evident in the work of other writers of Sabatini's time, the 1920s and 1930s (most particularly in the novels of Talbot Mundy). So too, Allende has not realized the possibilities for a feminist infusion of the Zorro myth, a shift superbly achieved in a 1990s television series, QUEEN OF SPADES, that sadly ran but a single season.Especially disappointing in Allende's novel is her failure to give the villain, Rafael Moncada, a single redeeming or humanizing characteristic. This is a mistake Sabatini would never have made, as witness his adversaries in Scaramouche and the ultimately tragic turn it gives his stories. It is that element that gave the novel (and the 1952 and especially the 1923 film versions) a depth that Allende fails to achieve, and allows Scaramouche to remain a superior, classic account of many of the same themes Allende utilizes here.While acknowledging Sabatini, when placed in the context of recent additions to the Zorro myth, such as THE MASK OF ZORRO, the convincing, gripping variation Allende has created are evident. (The book's dust jacket is copied almost directly from that 1998 movie's advertising art.) As a tale of the formation of a hero's character, and how he was impacted by his time, Allende has contributed a most enjoyable addition to the durable, timeless genre of the swashbuckler."},{"Title":"Zorro - A Novel","review":"If you are a Zorro fan for as long as I have been, you probably bought this book looking for fun, light reading of swashbuckling adventure and the colorful characters we all know and love. If that's the case, you really won't like it. I mean... Senora De la Vega was a Spanish noblewoman, and we all know it - not a native Anerican or a lady of mixed birth. To think of Diego and Bernardo as brothers is almost laughable, and even annoying. Diego is so unappealing that he makes me sick. Why does everyone want to try and fix what ain't been broke? Forget this."},{"Title":"Zorro - A Novel","review":"The word I'm looking for here is 'horrible'. There are others, such as 'boring', 'plotless', 'politically-correct' and 'ugly', but let's just go with 'horrible'.Zorro deserves better than this astonishingly bad novel. In the interests of postmodernist sensitivities, Allende takes the ultimate well-bred dashing rogue and turns him into someone we neither care for, like, nor enjoy reading about.Zorro is not a 'realistic' character and he does not have a 'realistic' story. He never has. He was always unashamedly swashbuckling, unashamedly upper-class and blue-blooded, suave and charming--even in the new movies about Alejandro Murrieta, he's unable to become Zorro unless he has mastered the art of being a courtier--or pretending to be. Making him the surly, lecherous son of an even surlier Indian mother and a wimpish Spanish father, motivated by being in touch with his mystical Indian roots, goes against everything the idea of the swashbuckler stands for. It would be just fine in any other novel, but Zorro is a completely different character altogether.The book has no action. It has precisely two scenes which try to be classic swashbuckling but fail. The rest is boring decription of tensionless journeys, of years going by. It's ponderous and completely unexciting. It bored me out of my wits and made me want to scrub out the inside of my brain. It made me wonder if Allende has ever read a real swashbuckler in her life, that makes her so very woefully unprepared to write one.Again, it would be fine in the hands of a better novelist or about another character, but when you read about Zorro, you want to hear about sword-fights, beautiful and spirited women, black horses, adventure! Instead, we get this mess, with repressed, surly, hopeless characters milling around being neither individual, nor memorable, nor exciting, nor a pleasure to be around.In another book I might accept this. But there comes a time when you tire of Serious Reality and go off to read a good escapist swashbuckling yarn--and this book disappoints so completely and comprehensively that I never see Isabel Allende's name in the bookshop without a shudder. Read Dumas, read Sabatini, read Rider Haggard, read the historical novels of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, but avoid this book!"},{"Title":"Zorro - A Novel","review":"Zorro has its moments. It's a slowly-paced story where we see occasional glimpses of the dashing hero to come. However, much of the praise here for Isabel Allende's writing is lost on me. I often found it awkward; I didn't see the brilliant turn of phrase for which Ms Allende is lauded. To be fair, though, this is a translation from Spanish, where the writing may well be more lyrical.While I had a hard time picking this one back up after setting it down, I found that struggling to the half-way point had rewards. The pace picked up somewhat, and the story found some purpose. As Diego de la Vega started to become Zorro, the narrator found her voice, and my eyes didn't grow so weary."},{"Title":"Zorro - A Novel","review":"Isabel Allende is a wonderful, magnetic author. Zorro is a must read (or hear via audio). Beginning with Zorro's childhood Allende develops a magnetic character in a hero-in-process. Zorro's life and development into a folk hero take us into many vibrant \\"historical\\" situations, and we meet marveious and intriquing characters in the Native Americans of California, the gypsies of Spain, pirates of New Orleans and just plain rogues of early California. Like the other Allende books I've read, Zorro moves quickly; it was very hard to \\"put down.\\" I listened to the audio version and shared it with three others who thought it equally marvelous. The print version was purchased for my grown son who was completely swept up in the story. I will read Zorro again some day."},{"Title":"Zorro - A Novel","review":"Initially, I shied away from Zorro, having purchased it as a gift for my wife, who never read it. I have always liked Allende, but mostly her earlier novels. And I figured it had \\"chick book\\" written all over it (too many associations with Antonio Bandeiras). But I was pleasantly surprised by this entertaining, Dumas-esque, Sabatini-esque, historical novel based mostly on the fictional life of Diego de le Vega and the antecedents to the Zorro character. The passages taking place in Barcelona and the descriptions of the Napoleonic era there were very well done. There was way less swashbuckling, and blood-letting than I expected, and I would not characterize it as an especially \\"action\\" oriented novel. Still, it held my interest most of the way through, with a definite lag toward the end as the setting of the novel moves to New Orleans and Jean Lafitte takes center stage. I would have gotten the scissors out for that 75 pages or so. Otherwise, it found Zorro intriguing and fun."},{"Title":"Zorro - A Novel","review":"Having found Allende's most recent works of fiction to be lifeless, I purchased Zorro with more than a little trepidation. But, to my pleasant surprise, Zorro proved that Allende still has good fiction to share with her readers.Two qualities made this book stand out from her other recent fiction offerings. First, Allende made a smart choice by focusing the story on Zorro's origin. By writing about these early adventures, Allende was able to take the reader into new territory with a character whose potential for original tales was seemingly exhausted. Second, she had fun with the character by finding that emotional connection she needs to write effectively. That fun was easily conveyed onto the page, thereby providing the reader with an entertaining, emotional story.There is still room for improvement in this book. It gets more than a bit monotonous when every female character is portrayed as a strong, noble creature whose talents are unappreciated by insensitive males. And, the portrayal of Native Americans seemed a little too politically correct. But, these shortcomings don't overcome the book's energetic narrative and strong pacing. By providing a fresh, enjoyable take on a classic character, Zorro is the best fiction that Allende has written in several years."},{"Title":"Zorro - A Novel","review":"As usual, Isabel Allende sweeps us up into a world of adventure while she chronicles the life of Diego de la Vega, a.k.a. Zorro. One of my favorite parts was the \\"pilgrimage\\" to Santiago de Compostela. The textbook in the Spanish class I use refers to this famous site. I told my students they could make the pilgrimage and get a glimpse of the countryside by reading Allende's novel--much cheaper and less tiring than buying airplane tickets, finding lodging, etc."},{"Title":"Zorro - A Novel","review":"My husband and I don't read the same books usually.

If you've seen the newer version of Zorro, this book is even more fun to read as it goes into the history of the character.

Thus the legend of Zorro is born. I watched many of these episodes on Walt Disney when I was a child and loved the hero as I loved this book.

I gave this book 2 stars because I expected a lot more from Isabel Allende. This book is very put-downable. There is no exciting development as far as I'm concerned. She's definitely got the talent but the story just flows so effortlessly in her previous novels that this one seems very far-fetched. But then again, I didn't like the Daughter of Fortune either, so I guess it's not just that I don't like a male hero. Although Diego does seem a little too narcissistic for me, and sometimes, laughably naive. To summerize it, I didn't like the main characters, there was nothing outrageously intriguing and everything seemed all too familiar."},{"Title":"Zorro - A Novel","review":"This book is very well-researched, and I can't fault the writing. However, it's very dry reading. A certain excitement is missing. Maybe it's because the book was translated from Spanish? I found myself wishing there were illustrations."},{"Title":"Zorro - A Novel","review":"I've never read anything else by Isabel Allende, but I find it hard to believe that she is so critically acclaimed.Zorro is actually a fun read, despite being stuffed with cliches, groaningly obvious motivations, two dimensional characters, and choppy rhythms (the last of which may be the fault of the translation.) This Diego de la Vega is so astoundingly bright that he has to actually think in the middle of a duel, \\"Hey, I have two personalities! That's kinda weird!\\"Zorro's love interest is a ditzy romantic with no complexity whatsoever. And her rebellious, ugly little sister with lots of spirit? Just guess who she ends up with.In other words, this novel is on par with trashy high-budget movies like the recent Zorro films, Van Helsing, and The League of Extroardinary Gentlemen. There are no suprises--the opressed people are pure good, the Spanish are mostly evil, etc etc. There's even a Princess Bride-like scene where our hero repays our villain with an identical wound! And whenever the story drags, there's an inevitable attack by pirates.This Zorro is enjoyable, but by no means a well-written or thoughtful book."},{"Title":"Zorro - A Novel","review":"I had read \\"Daughter of Fortune\\" previously, and while I didn't think it was among the greatest novels ever written it certainly wasn't terrible. I picked up \\"Zorro\\" looking for light summer reading with some adventure and a little romance. This book simply failed on so many levels, and that is so very unfortunate.Where to begin? First, it is a pet peeve of mine when an alleged writer cannot use proper grammar while writing. It just bugs like nothing else. Now, granted, I realize that Ms. Allende writes in Spanish because that is her first language. (and not because her intended audience is another country - she lives in the U.S.) And I do not read Spanish all that well, so I am not sure if the errors are from the Spanish or if her translator is simply that bad. However, I would think Ms. Allende would take enough pride in her work to make sure the translation was properly translated. Or at least her editor would do so.In an action novel one would expect, well, action - yes? There is very little of that here. Mostly the reader is subjected to page after page of \\"and then this happened and then this happened.\\" To make action appear to happen, fresh and alive, an author should include dialogue - lots of dialogue. The charactors should be talking to each other. Ms. Allende simply doesn't do this. It is simply....narrative. Page after unending page of narrative. Dull.And for the few swashbuckling scenes Ms. Allende does include for the reader, they read as a fencing lesson. Yes, so we are impressed she took fencing lessons - Brava, Ms. Allende! But that's not how to write a scene! The men faced each other, swords drawn already brings forth an image. One does not have to include, \\"...knees bent, right arms at a ninety degree angle to their body, other arm high in the air.\\" Yeah, we already had the picture in mind, thank you! Instead of describing the scene, why not include some dialogue between the charactors to make it seem real? Dull.Another tiresome aspect in this novel was the lack of historical accuracy. Now, I understand that in romance/adventure summer reads reality can sometimes be suspended a bit. But, really, pirates invading the coast of California to attack Pueblo de los Angeles? That is more than a stretch. And I really think Ms. Allende needs to re-study her take on New Orleans society - it was dismal. Creoles are NOT \\"free people of color.\\" Not exclusively, as she portends.I realize that Zorro is all about justice and fighting for the underdog. Hey, that's why everyone loves the guy! But, truthfully, the sterotypes in this book just get old so quick. European white = always evil. Indians = always good. Gypies = always good, got the bad rap. Oh please, let's have an author that isn't afraid to mix it up a bit and take a risk once in a while!All in all, this book is frustrating, though it will find a base of supporters. If you were raised on the Disney version of Zorro from which the inspiration for this work evolved (I can't speak to that, as it was before my time), and you can tolerate bad writing then you will probably get something out of this. If your standards are higher, you will be disappointed."},{"Title":"Zorro - A Novel","review":"Zorro is a bland, average, by the numbers chronicle of the hero's childhood and early adulthood. It reads like the novelization of a movie. The problem is that Isabel Allende wrote the novel in Spanish, and I read it in English, and everyone should know that translations are imitations at best. Word choice is very important to a writer. Imagine someone replaced every word of your favorite novel with a synonym--it would be a completely different work. When Allende writes \\"zorro,\\" she means \\"zorro,\\" not \\"fox,\\" which is the English translation. While I'm sure that her Spanish prose is lyrical and eloquent, the English narrative is tedious. Anyone who wants to read \\"Zorro\\" should learn Spanish first."},{"Title":"Zorro - A Novel","review":"Badly written, poor language, predictible plot, full of clich&eacute;s (this is not allways a bad thing, but in this case it is!), utterly boring. Dont buy it is my advice."},{"Title":"Zorro - A Novel","review":"I was looking for a clever retelling of this fictional American homegrown hero, something with an interesting feminine twist. What I got was indeed a retelling, but not as clever or interesting as I had hoped.This is a \\"tale of origin\\" explaining how Zorro became the masked avenger. He is born Diego de la Vega, son of a Spanish hidalgo and a fierce Shoshone she-warrior. Apparently, the author took great pains to research this book. Kudos. Despite all the research, there seemed to be something a little off. It wasn't so much the facts that were suspect(although I'd like to check if the Shoshone values of \\"Okahue\\" were created to serve the plot), but the way the facts integrated--or failed to integrate--with the story. At one point Diego is bitten by a rattlesnake. \\"Diego remembered some of the facts he had learned about rattlesnakes...\\" The facts that follow may as well be numbered, taken from some text or scientific article. The fencing scenes are even worse. You might as well read from a manual. I listened to the audiobook, so here is my best paraphrase: \\"He held his arm 180 degrees in front, foil pointed forward, left arm raised 90 degrees over his head for balance.\\" Yes, that makes for quite the thrilling fight scene. The gripes go on. Every other word is a cliche (the translator's fault?), there is hardly any dialogue, the prose is bland, the characters flat and impossible to sympathize with, as they have as much pep as are papier mache.This is my first Allende book, and I hear she is renowned for her well-drawn female characters and ability to write emotional drama. I can't speak for her other books, but here I found Julianna a distressed damsel, and Isabelle just annoying. Nuria, the girls' chaperone, is religious, superstitious and narrowminded, which makes her the most interesting of all. As for the men...Bernardo the mute Shoshone is sympathetic, mainly because of some emotional manipulation on the writer's part by making him an orphan who refuses to talk due to his suffering. She tries to make Zorro a sort of \\"scarlet pimpernel\\" type who behaves flamboyantly while defending the downtrodden from behind his mask. As with all her descriptions, she never gets more specific than saying he \\"dressed well\\" and \\"behaved flamboyantly\\". No \\"show\\", all \\"tell\\". She also tends to spell things out in case the reader wasn't observant enough to figure out something themselves.I'd like to end on a positive note. Scientific discussion of rattlesnake bites aside, I did enjoy Diego's and Bernardo's Spirit Quests with the Shoshone tribe. I thought the two boys' respective experiences finding their totem animals did more to establish character than any other anecdote in this book."},{"Title":"Zorro - A Novel","review":"Putting aside any issues I might have on a more critical level, the fact is that, like anything Allende writes, this book is a good read. If you want to be sucked into a story, she never fails.Unlike some, I found it refreshing to have such a great amount of detail on Zorro's childhood. For details on his exploits, there are plenty of other books and films available. What intrigued me was how he became who he was. I found the best part of this book to be the first section dealing with his parents and his birth. The enigma that is his mother and the place she has bridging the world of the Spanish and the indigenous, at least for a time, are what allow him to navigate his way through life later on.If you like Allende's narrative style, you'll like this book."},{"Title":"Zorro - A Novel","review":"Born of mixed blood, Diego de la Vega grew up with his father's wealth while learning about his Indian heritage. Along with his milk brother, Bernardo, Diego mischievously discovered the world of southern California in the eighteenth century. Together they moved to Spain so that Diego could have a proper education. They continued to make trouble during the long and difficult journey. Diego joined a secret society, La Justicia, where he could share his passion to help the poor. Diego first became Zorro (named after a fox) when he decided to rescue his precious fencing instructor. After other raids, Diego returned to a very changed southern California. Zorro quickly found missions in California, but Diego always had help. He continued to transform into Zorro for years.Zorro by Isabel Allende allows us to understand Diego de la Vega's background which made him into the man that we all have heard about. An enjoyable read, Zorro, gives us a glimpse into the terrifying world that Diego lived in and how he chose to do good in a period full of dark times."},{"Title":"Zorro - A Novel","review":"I have long been a fan of Isabelle Allende's work and would especially commend House of Spirits and Eva Luna. I find her ability to intermingle the mystical and the real into a novel enjoyable. She has certainly outdone herself with Zorro. I knew nothing about Zorro except childhood memories of the TV show so approached this book without pre-conceived notions of this Robin Hood of California (or Barcelona or New Orleans).Ms. Allende's approach, her narrator and the narrator's ability to retell the story from before birth were fascinating. Each little adventure and the greater adventures read like the best of Dumas. The building of his personality was like the best of well, Allende. The side characters were wonderful and I cannot wait to discuss them with friends after they read the book.Overall, this book confronts issues of justice, rich and poor, human development and does so in an entertaining way. I heartily recommend it."},{"Title":"Zorro - A Novel","review":"Before I get to the book itself, let me preface by saying that I was raised on the Disney \\"Zorro.\\" I used to faithfully watch the reruns after school as a small girl. My husband and I videotaped every episode off the Disney Channel, both in Black and White and Color. One of the highlights of my life was an employee tour of the Walt Disney Studio when I got to walk up to a bushy outgrowth on the perimeter of the studio property, which turned out to be the area where Zorro was filmed \\"emerging\\" from the cave on Toronado. As far as I'm concerned, Guy Williams is the only Zorro - all the rest are pretenders.So, it was with some trepidation that I picked up Isabel Allende's take on the Zorro story. However, once I started reading it, I couldn't put it down - not even to sleep. Allende took many of the familiar pop culture elements of the 1950's version of Zorro, surrounded them with historical fact - both social and political, stirred in folklore and gave the reader a fully realized, living, breathing version of Diego de la Vega - from cradle to young adulthood, a Zorro who had to be created over a long period of time, rather than springing from one moment of inspiration.By weaving Bernardo and even Garcia into Diego's childhood, she grounds her version in familiar territory. Her creation of Diego's mother as warrior/shamen is inspired. Alejandro's foundation in convention is fully explored, as well as his decisions concerning Regina.I love the fact that Allende chose to give Diego an awkward stage of adolescence. It's easy to assume that someone who is a handsome, desireable adult was always so, but here we are subject to Diego's growing pains, frustrations, idealizations and dreams. It is wonderful to see him progress from boyish prankster to the man who risks his neck to protect the humble and those he loves.I loved the fact that Allende chose to portray life as it was, not as a romatic technicolor vision of balconies and luxurious sailing ships. She makes travel stand out as the dangerous, visceral business that it really was. The interlude with pirates was wholey unexpected for this reader, but highly entertaining. I can imagine a younger naive fan-girl reader picturing Johnny Depp as Jean Lafitte in some of Allende's scenes.Without restating so much of the detail that other reviewers have already gone into, I'd like to recommed this as a highly entertaining summer book that leaves readers of a certain age wanting more after the very last page has been turned."},{"Title":"Zorro - A Novel","review":"I read this book while traveling. It makes great airplane/beach reading!Allende's take on the Zorro legend is captivating, entertaining, and swash-buckling. In this book, we get the back-story that develops the characters of eightteenth-centry Californian Deigo de la Vega, his best friend Bernardo, and the surrounding details of the Zorro universe.The book gets off to a slow, plodding start. We go back in time two generations before the birth of Zorro, and spend pain-staking detail in his childhood & adolescence. Half-way through the book, I was still wondering when Zorro was really going to hit his stride. Once I figured out that this was a how-he-became Zorro story and not the-adventures-of, I was able to relax and enjoy the book a lot more.Like most of the Zorro cadre, this book is all about characters: ordinary people you might not like if you were to meet in real life, who nobly rise above their humble circumstances to fight for justice. All good superheroes make you feel like you could do that, too!Compared to Allende's other works, this book has the pacing, personality, and stylized voice that makes Allende such a good read. It also has the politics--toned down just a bit--and ever-the-slightest hint of magical realism.As I was reading, I couldn't help but sense that Allende genuinely enjoyed writing this story and got into it even more than she had planned. In interviews, Allende has said that she immersed herself in the characters by taking fencing lessons and wearing a mask! Maybe that's why she named one of the main character after herself?The day I finished reading this book, I was elated to see the \\"Legend of Zorro\\" trailer for the movie coming out this fall, with Antonio Banderas reprising his title role. Read this book before the new movie is released!"},{"Title":"Zorro - A Novel","review":"Isabel Allende's romantic prose has never been better and is the ideal means of telling a riveting tale of the origins of Zorro, the enigmatic fictitious Robin Hood of Spanish and Mexican Alta California, in her new novel \\"Zorro\\". She tells a splendid swashbuckling tale which tells of Zorro's origins, as Diego de la Vega, the handsome son of a Spanish military officer turned Californian landowner and a Shosone American Indian warrior defeated by her husband in battle. And this is truly a tale of epic proportions, as we see young Diego acquire his sword fighting skills and manhood in French-occupied Barcelona, Spain during the Napoleonic wars. There he will fall in love and become friends with the daughters of Tomas de Romeu, a Francophile merchant, whose wealth and life are soon both lost when the exiled Bourbon monarch, Ferdinand VII, returns to power after the French withdraw from Spain. Eventually he will become the finest swordsman of his time, studying under Maestro Manuel Escalante; it is through his beloved swordfighting teacher that young Diego will join La Justica, the secret society devoted to help victims of religious and political persecution, as well as those too impoverished to help themselves from thieves and corrupt government officials. Allende tells of swashbuckling sword fights aboard merchant ships and French military forts waged by the young Diego, before moving on to a final fateful confrontation at his parents' Californian home. I am not surprised that this fine novel has become an instant bestseller (For the record, I thank Harper Collins for sending me an advance reader's edition copy for review.); one of the most highly sought after books for this summer."},{"Title":"Zorro - A Novel","review":"The only regret I had during the reading of Isabel Allende's latest offering, ZORRO: A NOVEL, was the knowledge it ended at page 400.The kind people at HarperCollins sent an Advance Reader's Edition for my review. How lucky for me, as Allende is an expert at her craft.Allende tells us the story of Zorro's early life in California, his travels to the old country, his first love and how he came to live the life behind the mask, cape and sword. One of the sub-plots revolves around Zorro's mother and grandmother and has enough substance for its own novel.Allende, like Gabriel Garcia Marquez, casts a spell on her readers with wonderful, long, glorious paragraphs. They drift by as if magically suspended above the page. This book also has a rich historical base from which Allende builds her characters and effects their lives.The only complaint I have with Margaret Sayers Penden's translation from Allende's native Spanish is her generous use of the word \\"that.\\" If \\"that\\" can be removed from a sentence and the sentence's intent remain the same, it should go. Every unnecessary \\"that\\" is like a boulder in the middle of a beautiful garden path.It's rewarding to see such quality work on THE NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLERS LIST. Kudos to Allende for sharing her gifts. Kudos to her readers for their recognition of such splendid story-telling.Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Zorro - A Novel","review":"I've never read or even heard of any of Isabel Allende's other books so I wasn't too excited to read this book- which I received as a gift. I usually like fast-paced, \\"race against time\\" mysteries and cheesy but funny romance novels so this did not seem like my kind of book... BUT I really liked it!! She got me interested in a subject I've never cared about before- Diego de la Vega aka Zorro and her writing style is superb. She also livens up the old story with a more \\"up-to-date\\" ending."},{"Title":"Zorro - A Novel","review":"When I was I kid I used to sit in front of the TV every afternoon after school to watch my favorite series. I spent innumerable hours seeing Zorro defend liberty and justice against awful villains like Moncada, and being amused by the clumsy Sergeant Garcia. If you experienced something similar, you will be amazed by Allende's novel, since she creates a convincing past for our beloved hero, and in the process answers several of the questions that we have asked ourselves for years.A close friend of Zorro who remains anonymous for most of the book tells the story. This person is trying to set the record straight regarding the true story of the man who became a legend. In this effort, the narrator starts with events prior to the birth of Diego de la Vega, recounting how Alejandro met Diego's mother in a war between the Indians and the Spanish. From Diego's childhood we start seeing how this individual was shaped by the relationship with his grandmother's tribe and the search for okahue: love, justice, respect, dignity and courage.Some of the questions that we will get answers for include how the relationship with Bernardo started, how the secret passage between Diego's house and the Zorro's hideout came into existence, why Moncada hated Zorro and why Garcia liked him, even though it was his duty to go after him. Also, the author presents us with information regarding Diego's studies in Barcelona, which allows us to gain further insight into what drives our hero.One of my favorite aspects of this novel is how the relationship between Diego and Bernardo is described, not only allowing us to understand their brotherhood, but also as a tool to depict in simple terms the prejudice surrounding them. Even though both of them consider the other one his brother, since Bernardo has Indian parents, everyone except for Diego treated him differently, and this undoubtedly helped Zorro to understand some of life's harsh truths.In the last few years there had been movies, series and books telling us about the unknown childhood and youth of our favorite heroes. An example would be the TV series \\"Smallville\\", which deals with the time in which Superman was a teenager. It was about time that someone revealed to us the real story of the younger years of one of the most beloved heroes of all times. And Allende is up to the task, delivering a novel that is impossible to put down and that brings Zorro even to a higher echelon of a legend, if this is even possible!"},{"Title":"Zorro - A Novel","review":"In this improbable and quixotic novel Isabel Allende imagines the backstory behind the legend of Zorro. In her tale Zorro is actually Diego de la Vega, the mestizo child of a Spanish aristocrat and his Shoshon&eacute; wife, who is raised in southern California in the early years of the 19th century. He is a child of two worlds: the world of the Spanish overlords of California and the world of the oppressed native peoples of the region. His best friend Bernardo is a native American and he spends much of his youth with his grandmother White Owl and her clan. But eventually he goes to Spain to continue his education and there becomes entangled in the complicated Spanish politics of the Napoleonic period. Along the way he and Bernardo have many adventures that build Diego's belief in justice and his commitment to assisting those in need. The character of Zorro builds, finally emerging in full-blown form when Diego returns to California to find his father unjustly imprisoned by an evil Spanish interloper who has carried a grudge against Diego as a result of events that happened in Spain.The book has plenty of action. In addition to Shoshon&eacute;s there are gypsies, pirates (Jean and Pierre Lafitte, no less), duels, secret passages, secret rooms, a circus, even an ultra-secret society. It's skillfully written, as I have always found to be the case with Isabel Allende, but I can only give it 4 stars because somehow it fell flat for me. Blair Brown gives a capable reading, but the narrative plods and is ultimately unconvincing."},{"Title":"Zorro - A Novel","review":"My wife and I were heading off on a four day drive east to Canada and bought this for entertainment. The narrator was solid and made it exciting and interesting. The story was from the beginning and passed through thirteen, yes thirteen CD's. Took us out and most of the way back to get through it. It was interesting and kept you hanging in there but it is long. The disappointment for me is that the first twelve CD's are Zorro's background and upbringing so if you're looking for action in the beginning or throughout it isnt happening. Then it kind of just ends. Then for us, believe it or not, we got to CD 13 and the last 5 tracks were blank and wouldnt play, no ending. To Border's credit, I stopped by a store while travleing with no receipt and they did exchange it for us, then we were disappointed in the ending ... but it did pass the time."},{"Title":"Zorro - A Novel","review":"Zorro is a long narrative detailing the early life of the hero. the length works against the action scenes, but succeeds in filling out Diago's character and presenting the reader with a plausible explanation of how he metamorphized from Diego into the mythic hero, Zorro. Also offers good background of Spanish history during the early 1800s."},{"Title":"Zorro - A Novel","review":"In the case of \\"Zorro,\\" by Isabel Allende, fluff and fantasy in the hands of a great writer equals a rollicking good read. Diego is the child of a Spanish gentleman and an Indian woman who captures his heart, and although the marriage is a failure the child goes on to become Zorro, not a bad outcome at all! Diego sits astride two worlds, that of the Catholic, Spanish settlers in California, and the world of his Indian mother and \\"blood brother\\" Bernardo, the son of his Indian nurse. Diego enjoys the education of a Spanish gentleman, the spirituality of his mother's people, and a keen desire to right the wrongs he sees around him. His exploits as a young man, the disguise he adopts, and the origin of the name \\"Zorro\\" are very entertaining!Extensive end notes reveal that Allende undertook this project as a purely commercial venture, at the request of the owners of the character \\"Zorro,\\" much to the horror of her friends. But how daring of a serious novelist--to do something that's just fun! I whipped through the almost 400 pages on a flight home from Spain--how appropriate!--and I couldn't put it down. A great airplane book or summer read."},{"Title":"Zorro - A Novel","review":"I found this book a fantastic summer read. It's different than some of Allende's other work (which I also like) because it's not lacking in action. For example, I remember reading My Invented Country by the same author and loving it at the time, but there was little action for me to remember it by. In Zorro, some people may not like that the content is fairly stereotypical. If you have any idea of how things go in the classic epics, you'll have a feel for this book immediately. This doesn't make the book exactly predictable -- there are some surprises, and exciting action scenes sprinkled throughout. You've got the classic formula here: some oppressive Spaniards, swashbuckling pirates, dainty beauties, a tribe of Indians, a dashing rival, and an incredible hero. However, this is not a cookie-cutter copy of all the other stories out there. One thing that makes this novel unique is the unmistakable personalities of the characters. You are endeared to Diego and his milk-brother Indian Bernardo because of what you can see of their unique personalities, along with their idiosyncrasies. Diego, although the hero of the novel, is less than perfect and suffers his share of problems with his love interest and rivals. Bernardo is a strong and gentle, selective mute with a peaceful spirit to balance Diego's fiery temper. Another thing that makes the novel interesting is the way it is narrated -- in first person by a character not revealed to us until the end. Lastly and most importantly, it was written by Isabel Allende, a talented writer who doesn't sell short no matter what kind of story she's telling. Her style shines through on every page, ensuring that \\"Zorro\\" will sweep you off your feet."},{"Title":"Zorro - A Novel","review":"Zorro, the famed hero who helped save the oppressed Indians from the Tyranny in Alta California in the mid-1880s, had to have some beginning. This book is pleasantly interesting building up to the story told by Johnston McCulley in The Mask of Zorro. Allende spins a wonderful story of the history of how Zorro came to take his legendary station. She managed to make this book both interesting and enjoyable even though she was merely writting the history of a pre-existing story.The book is broken up into time periods and the locations of Diego's life. The first part tells about when his parents met, his birth, his early childhood, traveling to Barcelona, his return back to Alta California, and his first rescue as Zorro in California. The entire book culminates in the first appearance of Zorro in California and his first rescue mission.The characters are endearing from the mute Bernardo to the confident women Isabel. Along with the original characters like Sergeant Garcia, Bernardo, and Diego de la Vega himself, the reader met new characters like Pelayo and Amalia, who are gypsies Diego befriends. Filled with action and adventure, I could hardly put the book down."},{"Title":"Zorro - A Novel","review":"What a wonderful story told by a brilliant author. This Zorro origin tale reminds me of one of my favorite movies from last year, \\"Batman Begins.\\" Like this novel, that movie provided a fresh new look at a familiar hero. That movie developed the character of Bruce Wayne/Batman through dark cinematic images and flashbacks in the same way that Allende develops Diego de la Vega/Zorro through her beautiful prose. It is no wonder that the creator of Batman was influenced by Johnston McCulley's Zorro. My one disappointment was that this book had to end. This sorrow not only came from the fascinating and imaginative tale ending, but also from the lack of true Zorro adventures (as the legendary hero fighting injustice in old California). I had hoped to read more swashbuckling once Allende established Diego as Zorro. Perhaps Allende will save these tales for further novels. One can only hope."},{"Title":"Zorro - A Novel","review":"As a fan of the original, I was prepared to be disappointed, but Ms. Allende made this story live and breathe in a wonderful new light.

I can just give 5 cheers for the Author in proving me with one of the most well written, exciting, visuals reads (& rides) that I've ever had!"},{"Title":"Zorro - A Novel","review":"Isabel Allende makes the legend of Zorro her own in this rambling, though fast-paced, account of Diego de la Vega, the mestizo son of a Spanish father and Shoshone mother.

The novel traces the brothers' childhood in California and their eventual coming-of-age in Barcelona, where Diego begins to formulate the idea of Zorro, or fox, his Indian guardian spirit, while Bernado acts as his actual protector. The years apart from his father's hacienda in California prepare Diego for his eventual role as swashbuckling protector of the defenseless and oppressed in his Spanish-controlled homeland.Readers will recognize Allende's distinctive storytelling style from the opening lines. As always, she expertly melds history with legend, embracing hyperbole and a sweeping view of her characters' world. With recent novels, she has relied less and less on the magic realism that made her famous when House of Spirits was published, and here, the magic seems an afterthought, something obligatory but which doesn't add much to novel itself. In Zorro, the real \\"magic\\" is in the storytelling -the epic tale of a hero in the making. (Allende wisely ends the novel just as Zorro comes into his own.)

While the Hollywood version back then was akin --- in creativity, at least --- to the old adventures of The Lone Ranger, Isabel Allende's version is enormously fuller and infinitely more interesting, bursting with a vivid and colorful personality.These are the early years, just the first couple decades of Diego de la Vega's life, but they explain how a boy of mixed blood became a man driven to right terrible wrongs, save damsels in distress, free prisoners unjustly held, and all manner of heroic deeds.The story begins in the early 1800s in Alta California, a colony then held by Spain. Diego grows up alongside Bernardo, a servant's son, but treats him as a brother, not caring that their stations in life are vastly different. Diego's grandmother, White Owl, teaches them about okahue, the five basic virtues. Almost without realizing it, nearly everything the boys do thereafter pushes them further toward honor, justice, respect, dignity and courage. During an ancient ritual test they undergo to prove themselves, Diego's alter ego is revealed to him, setting him on the path to becoming the full-fledged Zorro.Diego and Bernardo board a ship bound for Barcelona, expanding their adventures and making friends who may prove valuable later. They spend several years in Spain, furthering Diego's studies and exposing him to Juliana de Romeu, the enchanting beauty who steals his heart and ruins him for any other woman. But Juliana has many suitors, one exceedingly tenacious --- unfortunately, also unscrupulous. Well-connected Rafael Moncada, it seems, will stop at nothing to win her hand. As ZORRO's narrator points out, it wouldn't be much of a story without a formidable villain. And Moncada is a truly formidable villain. While Diego wistfully watches Juliana, her younger sister Isabel zealously watches Diego. He finds it hard to move so much as a muscle without Isabel's keen scrutiny. And, quietly, in the background always, is Bernardo, Diego's silent brother, without whom he would be incomplete.Spain during this time is undergoing some painful political upheavals. Zorro works a little magic, but he is up against daunting odds. The de Romeu family finds themselves misaligned with the new government, and Diego finds himself misaligned with Moncada. It becomes necessary for Diego to smuggle the sisters out of Europe, back to America where it is hoped they will be safe. This, of course, leads to more high seas adventure, fraught with storms, bad omens, pirates, grumbling sailors and a host of other maladies. Back at home, Diego finds many more challenges for Zorro, for not all is as he left it. And some of his troubles follow him from Spain.ZORRO is a terrific, new-fashioned swashbuckling tale full of fun, history and romance.--- Reviewed by Kate Ayers"},{"Title":"Zorro - A Novel","review":"I got the feeling while reading this book that Allende was intimidated by the character of Zorro and she kept skirting around him, spending her time instead building the characters and world that shaped Diego de la Vega and inspired Zorro. At other times I felt like she was too wrapped up in paying homage to Douglas Fairbanks and it seemed like she tried to merge the Black Pirate (1926) and the Mark of Zorro (1920) into one timeline/one character. The first 200 hundred pages take too long to get into the action. By the time Zorro had emerged I was ready for the book to be over."},{"Title":"Zorro - A Novel","review":"Did you ever come to the end of a book and wish it would just go on and on because it's so wonderful you don't want it to end? A book like that is worth its weight in gold, and I found one: it's ZORRO by Isabel Allende. You may be familiar with Allende's enjoyable writing in the popular book club book, \\"Daughter of Fortune,\\" but I like this one even more. The text is beautifully translated from Spanish and it's so easy to read that the pages seem to turn themselves.Because of the familiar \\"Zorro\\" persona, from both the late-1950s TV image of Disney's handsome Guy Williams and the more recent movie image of the yummy Antonio Banderas, I thought the book would be more romantic -- you know, handsome hunk in a mask kissing a lot of beautiful, swooning ladies. Well, it isn't that, and I didn't miss it at all. But it is a real swashbuckler, with lots of action, and it's amazing fun.This is the prequel to the story of the dashing swordsman who fought for justice in early California. Although that legend was long established before Allende came along, her work adds the perfectly fitted pieces to the classic puzzle that is the Zorro legend -- his boyhood, his education and his motivation. I think it will become an adventure classic for adults and kids alike.The story starts with the meeting of Diego de la Vega's parents and his birth in 1795. It ends with his first acts as the mysterious caped avenger. In between, we travel with him from California to Europe and we meet American Indians, Gypsies, sailors, pirates and aristocrats. We see how Young Diego and his lifelong friend, Bernardo, learn the principles of justice from horrifying acts of prejudice they witness as children and government corruption they are subject to as adults. We learn why Bernardo doesn't speak, how Diego took the name Zorro, and what the governmental factors were that drove him to his destiny. We see how he picks up his skills -- fencing, horse riding, acrobatics, illusion -- and adds to his Zorro disguise one element at a time -- a mask here, a horse there -- until he's fully prepared to fight for the downtrodden. I don't normally like fight scenes, but these drew me in right away and I followed them intently.I found myself getting lost in the story, losing track of time. This book is absolutely captivating! An excellent, excellent read for any age."},{"Title":"Zorro - A Novel","review":"There comes a sickening moment about half-way through this book, when the reader realizes that Zorro is not going to be in it at all. Well, this isn't exactly true - we get glimpses of Zorro here and there, and a brief adventure at the end. However, this is the \\"origin story\\" - to use comic-book terms. But, even origin stories usually spend half the time explaining how the hero got to be the hero, and the other half showing his first adventure. In this book, Zorro's first adventure is relegated to the last few pages. Like The Phantom Menace, this is the story of what happened BEFORE the story.And yet this is an adventure novel. While Zorro doesn't see much action, Diego de la Vega certainly does. We see all Diego's many childhood adventures in California, and then in Spain. (To be perfectly fair, Diego first dons the Zorro garb in Spain for several adventures.)Part of the problem with the book is how exhaustive it is in detail. Isabel Allende took the task of writing an origin story VERY seriously. The book begins long before Diego is even born. We witness the union of his parents - a Spaniard and a half-Spanish, half-Native American woman. This is important because it gives Zorro a Native America heritage; a genius bit of invention is letting Diego go on a Vision Quest (guess what his spirit animal is!). Allende's research is also very educational for the average reader, painting a picture of the world in the early 1800's.Despite its faults, I enjoyed this book. It may be an over-the-top, old-fashioned bodice-ripper, but I found it fun and entertaining. Like the superheroes he foreshadowed, there will always be something fascinating about Zorro: he is a fun character with a great love of life. Allende paints him as a perennial adolescent, who is having too much fun to grow up. Now, if only she would write the part of the story we want to read."},{"Title":"Zorro - A Novel","review":"For me, Isabel Allende's ZORRO was like a trip back in time. I remember many Zorros. As a child, I watched the then \\"old movie,\\" which starred Tyrone Power. On TV (I don't know what years) there was a Zorro series which was made by Disney with Guy Williams in the title role. In the 1980's a film called The Gay Blade starring George Hamilton was made. It revitalized Hamilton's career and was a funny and interesting spoof of the Zorro character. More recently, Antonio Bandaras starred in The Mask of Zorro. My reason for pointing out these early films, is just this, I thought that I knew everything about Zorro, and now we're presented with another one. I wasn't sure that I wanted or needed to know anything more about the masked swordsman; however, I succumbed and read the newest ZORRO, and I did enjoy this new version of the Zorro saga.Allende's ZORRO is rich with the background of early California and gives us a lot of information about how and why Diego de la Vega became Zorro. We all knew that he was of Spanish heritage, but Allende gives Diego an Indian mother and a grandmother, who teaches him to cherish his Indian blood. Her influence also makes him want to protect and avenge the oppressed. Bernardo, who is Diego's best friend, is a solid supporting character. The two had been friends since birth. They seem to share a mystical mental link and initially, Bernardo is the only one who knows of Diego\`s dual persona. This story is packed with adventure. Alejandro de la Vega, Diego's father sends his son to Spain when Diego is sixteen. On the voyage, Diego hones his athletic skills, befriends sailors and even encounters pirates. In Spain, he's taught by a master swordsman, becomes a member of La Justicia and reaches maturity. He also meets two women who influence his life, the beautiful Juliana and her brainy sister, Isabel.ZORRO is an enjoyable and entertaining book."},{"Title":"Zorro - A Novel","review":"I wouldn't have picked up this book if Isabel Allende hadn't been the author because I didn't feel any particular interest in the life of Zorro. Allende is one of my must reads and I always eagerly await her next work. To my delight I found the book was great fun to read and watch as my perception of a TV hero was thrown out the window and he was turned into a fallible flesh and blood man. The characters burst with free will to make their own decisions and were rarely constrained by expected role playing behavior.This book was wonderful to escape into and I enjoyed the swashbuckling fun."},{"Title":"Zorro - A Novel","review":"I can't really write anything original here -- it has all been well said by other reviewers. I have loved all of Isabelle Allende's books, and this is another true charmer. I listened to the unabridged audio version of this book during my commute. Blair Brown does a phenomenal job on the story. I loved the fact that it picks up before he was born and tells how he became \\"the fox.\\" It was incredibly entertaining, well written, fun, with a hero you could truly root for...I was even rooting for Jean Lafitte (sp?) to win the beautiful Julianna.

A bad one, sure, but one that's dull as well?Allende's Zorro is a harmless, ineffectual, hormone-hobbled fop. The story has a few bold moments, but I soon began to wish the hero would grow up. I wonder if Allende had any respect left for her character when she finished writing. If you want to know Zorro's origins, read Mark of Zorro, McCulley's original serialization. It, like its hero, is bolder, more daring, and less pathetic than Allende's Zorro, who is somehow made less interesting than a mute character. McCulley recalled the basic principle: heroes should be admirable.

Allende creates a Don Diego de la Vega/Zorro very diffrent from the one in The Mark of Zorro by Johnston McCulley, and in the newer books by Jerome Preisler, David Bergantino and John Whitman but her's is unique and awesome. I think the plot develops well and is very fitting for Zorro. The underground resistence group that Diego joins, La Jusistia to me is very unique and cool. I definatly recomend this book. Pick it up today!"},{"Title":"Zorro - A Novel","review":"ZORRO by Isabel AllendeAugust 13, 2005Rating 4/5 starsIsabelle Allende's ZORRO is her version of the story that was originally introduced in 1919. Zorro's beginnings is the focus of Allende's novel, which is also going to be the basis of the third in the ZORRO trilogy of movies starring Antonio Banderas. Allende stays true to the original story, tracing Zorro's roots from his birth in Alta California (as Diego De La Vega, the son of the Alcalde of Pueblo de Los Angeles and an Indian woman) in the late 1700's. He lives his early years on the hacienda with his parents, Toypurnia (Regina) and Alejandro de la Vega, and his \\"milk brother\\" and best friend Bernardo, the bastard child of an Indian woman.The two friends will travel as teenagers across the Atlantic (by way of Panama) to reach Spain, and that is where Zorro becomes a reality. In Spain, Diego and Bernardo move into the home of family friend Tomas de Romeu, where Diego falls in love with the eldest daughter, Julianna. It's an unrequited love that Diego suffers, and earns an enemy in Rafael Moncado, who vows to win Julianna's hand and make her his wife. Julianna's younger sister Isabel also becomes an integral part of Zorro's life, as the novel will reveal. And with the girls' companion, Nuria, the \\"family\\" is complete.There is not enough room here to detail all the characters that populate ZORRO the novel, but it takes on epic proportions throughout. The adventures of Bernardo and Diego include living with the gypsies, dealing with pirates (and Jean Lafitte!) and learning the ways of the California Indians.Those who love historical fiction that centers on early California history will appreciate this wonderful novel. Allende throws in humor, adventure, love and romance, and of course evil villains, as Diego becomes Zorro and learns how to protect the innocent in the name of justice."},{"Title":"Zorro - A Novel","review":"Even though I loved 'Houe of the Spirits', I probably never would've picked this up had it not been for the glowing recommendation from a friend. I really didn't think it was something that would interest me at all, my only real exposure to Zorro being George Hamilton in that cheesy 80s film, 'The Gay Blade'. That said, this is fantastic. Focusing on the origins of the man who became Zorro presents a fascinating and page turning adventure yarn. Never a dull moment, this is the perfect book to escape for a few hours, unfolding like an edge of your seat Saturday movie serial."},{"Title":"Zorro - A Novel","review":"Most of us above a certain age (and since the 2005 movie came out, I suppose the younger folks, too) know the basic story of Zorro. He rights wrongs and protects the weak. He's incredibly skilled with a sword and a bullwhip. Like the Lone Ranger or Batman, no one knows who he really is. This biography of a fictional character is Zorro's origin story, so to speak.Told in the third person by a narrator who remains unnamed until the end, the story tells of Zorro's- Don Diego de la Vega- birth, childhood and teens. Blending her usual magical realism with Californian and Spanish history, Allende creates an explanation for why Zorro cares so much about the poor and downtrodden. The story has sword fighting, duels, hidden tunnels and access ways, telepathy, cruel rich people, and even pirates. It should be the most exciting story in the world. Sadly, it's not.Isabel Allende is one of my very favorite writers. I should have loved this book. I didn't. I found that, despite all the sword play and daring last minute rescues, it was very slow reading, and I never really came to care for Diego and his friends and family. They just weren't very deep. I don't know if this was an attempt to echo a pulp style, where characters don't normally have any depth, or what happened. Usually Allende's characters are so strong they take my breath away.I'm very glad this was not the first book of Allende's that I read; if it had been, I might never have picked up any of her other books, and I would have missed some truly marvelous stories. It's not horrible, but it just isn't interesting."},{"Title":"Zorro - A Novel","review":"Fairly typical Allende: dysfunctional families, quirky details, elements of the supernatural. However, I felt that the book lost steam midway through and it was a bit of a struggle to slog through to the end."},{"Title":"Zorro - A Novel","review":"While I've always enjoyed reading Isabel Allende, I especially liked Zorro, which delves into the life of the original caped crusader.The author entertainingly covers Zorro's parentage and motivation. We see his long training both in the New World and in Spain. Most of the familar scenes we already know from other sources are included.But this is much more than the embellishing of a particular flashy figure's legend.It is also a description of the development of the West (Alta California when it belonged to Mexico), and the necessity of putting up strong resistance to those universal greedheads who appear anywhere things are rapidly changing and there is opportunity for great wealth, earned fairly or not.A heroic tale served up with romance, feminism and social justice.Yum!"},{"Title":"Zorro - A Novel","review":"Zorro is an epic of a novel. Beginning in the years before Diego De La Vegas birth, it chronicles his aristocratic father falling in love with a half Indian-half Spanish warrior woman, who later gives birth to the timeless hero know as Zorro. While it is a beautiful read it does get a little tiresome. Paragraphs can go on for pages, and the timeline of Diego De La Vegas life is very slow. Halfway through the book, he is only about nineteen years old and there has been little to no action. This being said, it is the only flaw i can mention as everything else is so astounding. Allende's descriptions really make you feel as though you are standing right beside our hero and his loyal friend Bernado. It is a read that definitely deserves your full attention, and you will not be disappointed."},{"Title":"Zorro - A Novel","review":"I enjoyed the movies that Antonio Banderas starred in but that was all I knew about Zorro. I've had this book since it first came out in 2005 and was waiting for an inspiration to pick it up and read it. Fortunately, one of the girls in my book club wanted to read it after reading an earlier book of Allende's, so it was motivation enough to pick it up and start reading it.After a slow start, this book captured my imagination and fancy until the last page was turned. This is about Diego, his upbringing in California as a son who was born to a Spanish noble and an Indian mother, who was a Shoshane warrior herself. Straddling both worlds, where he could move easily in between the two different cultures, Diego was also sent to live with a family friend in Spain. Diego and his milk brother, Bernado made friends with the ship's captain and cook, as well as learned how to sail a ship. Diego spent five years in Spain and learned a tremendous amount of fencing skills, acrobat skills when he became friends with the gypsies, and more. Returning to America with Isabel and Julianna, his benefactor's daughters on the run from one of Julianna's demented suitors, Diego was ready to take on dual identity as Zorro.In the beginning of this book, it is quite wordy and it took me awhile to plod through the pages. However, it is chock full of historical tidbits (which is one of my favorite ways to read history) and the second half of the book picked up its pace quite a bit ... racing almost to the end. It is rich imagery and lyrical in spots. It is an in-depth look of one of the world's famous legendary heroes. Allende provides a great insight to his childhood and showed her reasonings for why he is the way he is and how he became the beloved hero, always fighting for truth and justice.It is a fun novel to read once I managed to get past the first quarter of the book. This is a definite must-read for book clubs as it provides fodder for great conversation pieces especially over hot tacos and burritos.9/21/08"},{"Title":"Zorro - A Novel","review":"Allende's \\"Zorro\\" contains Creoles and is itself a Creole: A seemingly odd, even daring mixture of the pulp genre with a literary flair. The result works far better than one might expect. Zorro, with his mild mannered playboy affection and crime fighting costumed identity inspired imitators such as The Shadow, who in term directly inspired Bob Kane and Bill Finger to create Batman, leading to innumerable others. Zorro has thus shaped popular culture for most of a century, as few other creations.In Allende's treatment, Zorro is both more literary and more mainstream. Oddly, despite her South American origin, Allende has made Zorro more American (meaning North American). Zorro now contains a mixture of Spanish and Native American blood, learning from the best of both traditions. His adventures take him to a highly colorful New Orleans, for example, and show far more of American history than the original novel (which was vague on all things historical).The author balances the need for swordplay, the desire to illuminate American history, the literary imperative for tracing origins, and the popular novelist's need for soap opera. Yet it all works."},{"Title":"Zorro - A Novel","review":"There I was roaming the bookstore with a gift certificate in my hands. I did not have to spend it on something sensible or be practical and buy paperbacks. Zorro with its red, black and white dust jacket almost assaulted my eyes. Zorro, by Isabel Allende. Why, I read everything by her. I have loved her stories of young women, romance in the classical sense, family and spirits. Allende, in my opinion, is one of the best modern storytellers alive.Who is that mysterious masked man? Not the Lone Ranger, although the Lone Ranger might have been based upon this character. Allende tells her own story of Diego de la Vega, son of an aristocratic Spaniard and a Shoshone warrior woman. I have no idea what is fact and what is fiction and, care not a wit. There is warmth, love, true friendship, cruelty, heroes and heroines, villains and adventure from California to Barcelona and back again.Diego a.k.a. Zorro loves passionately, becomes a fencing master, rescues those in distress, duels at dawn, confronts pirates often shadowed by his enemy, Rafael Moncada, and more often in the company of Bernardo, his childhood friend.All of the action (which takes place between 1790 and 1815) is a joyous romp. Allende writes as if she is telling you and me and maybe a few others her story. An example is:\\"We have come to the fifth and last part of this book. We shall soon be saying good-bye, dear readers, since the story ends when the hero returns to where he began, transformed by his adventures and by obstacles overcome. This is the norm in epic narratives from the Odyssey to fairy tales, and I shall not be the one to attempt innovation.\\"In the midst of the story, one also gets a true picture of Spanish colonial California and Old Barcelona under corrupt Napoleonic rule.

But beneath the humorous tales leading up to dramatic swordplay and escapes, there were serious themes of civic responsibility, the requirement to follow one's conscience rather than one's self interest, and something much finer than vigilante action. It was easy, however, to see who Zorro was . . . and the dual nature of being a fluttery dandy in public and a fierce righter of wrong behind a mask added to the story's appeal. But how did Zorro get to be that way? I could never figure that out.In this novel, Isabel Allende takes the fictional hero and makes him even larger than the \\"fictional life\\" by providing heroic antecedents for his adult activities. I was impressed by how seriously she took every aspect of the adult fictional character . . . and how well she wove in themes such as feminism, racial justice, and the coming-of-age desire to make something of oneself. Although it's an origin story that I would never have imagined on my own, the story fits my sense of the adult Zorro.I don't have very high expectations for fictional origin novels. This one vastly exceeded what I could have hoped to find. I thought that it was more interesting than the original stories. Very nice.I had the distinct pleasure of listening to the unabridged CD version by Blair Brown, which I highly recommend.

Well written, I truly enjoyed her tales of ZORRO's formative years, family, and many adventures. My only criticism is one of style.

Her mother, Diego's grandmother, is a shaman. And Bernardo is Diego's milk brother. As a child Bernardo saw his mother raped and killed and has been mute ever since.The boys are sent to Spain when Diego is sixteen to be educated and on the voyage over he learns slight of hand from a crew member and while there he is taught how to use the sword, by Manuel Escalante a member of a secret society that protects the poor and innocent that Diego joins. And because this is the Spain of Joseph Bonaparte, Diego often gets to put his skills to the test.Back in America he is captured by the Jean Lafitte and Diego learns much from the pirate.

Others in the group loved the book."},{"Title":"Zorro - A Novel","review":"Zorro was an epic and thrilling tale, starting in California. The main character in the story was Diego de la Vega, the son of a Spanish captain and an Indian woman. His mother became ill after childbirth, so a servant who gave birth at the same time cared for him and breastfed him and her son, Bernardo. Over the course of their childhood, Diego and Bernardo became closer than best friends. They were brothers.Being wealthy and intelligent, Captain Alejandro de la Vega taught Diego many things. But, unknown to Alejandro, sometimes Diego and Bernardo were taken to Diego's mother's tribe and were taught about their culture.When Diego and Bernardo were ten years old, Captain de la Vega went on a trip to bring pleasantries to his hacienda. While he was away, a band of pirates broke into the hacienda, killed Bernardo's mother, and stole anything valuable. Diego's mother was wounded, and Diego hid her. Eventually, Diego ventured out to Padre Mendoza to save her. His mother survived the attack, but, because of his mother's death, Bernardo did not speak for many years. Bernardo went to live with the Indian tribe to recover and found his true love, a girl named Light-in-the-Night. Bernardo was maturing.Diego's grandmother, White Owl, brought him and Bernardo to the tribe because she wanted them to find their destinies. They had to walk for four days, and then for four days dance around a sacred fire pit. The final part of the journey was that each boy would venture on his way for four days alone. Bernardo found a small black foal, which he called Tornado, and taught it to survive. He knew he was destined to be like a horse: strong and full of endurance. Diego's journey was much harder. He could not find much to eat. On the third day, he was bitten by a rattlesnake. Diego lay on the ground, but was always watched by the protective eye of a fox, a zorro. Bernardo found Diego and brought him to White Owl, saving his life. Diego realized that he would be like a fox: brave and cunning.A friend of Diego's father offered Diego to come to Barcelona, across the Atlantic, and they crossed aboard the Madre de Dios from Panama to Barcelona, Spain. The crew was friendly and cheerful. The cook, Galileo Tempesta, being a former magician, taught Diego many amazing tricks.Barcelona was huge. Diego and Bernardo were brought to their host, Tom&aacute;s de Romeu. He was a wealthy man with two daughters, Isabel and Juliana. Juliana was the local beauty, and Diego knew she was the most beautiful in the world. Soon, a wealthy man, Rafael Moncada, started to court Juliana. Juliana did not love him, but he was relentless. Diego also loved Juliana, but she did not notice. Soon after arriving, Diego went to meet with Maestro Manuel Escalante, a very famous fencing master. Diego began lessons with him, and became an excellent swordsman. Also, Rafael Moncada came to despise Diego.Bernardo befriended the local tribe of Gypsies when he saved a Gypsie named Amalia from an angry crowd. Diego soon became friends with them as well.Maestro Escalante saw a need for justice inside Diego, so he brought Diego to La Justicia, a secret society devoted to justice. He was made a member, and his chosen code name: Zorro. Zorro's first adventure was to free detainees from prison.The band of Gypsies was accused of smuggling weapons. Bernardo found out early, giving him a chance to alert the Gypsies. While the Gypsies fled Barcelona, Diego and Bernardo stalled the soldiers. Shortly after the Gypsies left, Bernardo received a letter saying that Light-in-the-Night had given birth and wanted Bernardo to return to California. He left in January, but left Diego a letter telling him to be wary that Zorro did not take over his life.It was 1814, and Napoleon had just lost all his power. Tom&aacute;s de Romeu and his daughters left when violence broke out, along with the girls' chaperone, Nuria. They believed they would be safe away from Barcelona.La Justicia was in danger. When a member was found in the home of Maestro Escalante, the fencing master was taken to a barracks. Diego decided that he would free Escalante. Zorro fought his way out, but the rescue worked. Escalante left Barcelona as a free man. But that is not all. Rafael Moncada found Tom&aacute;s de Romeu's shelter, had him arrested, and took him to the impregnable La Ciudadela. Diego knew that he could not be rescued, but he and the girls were allowed to see him one last time. At that time, Tom&aacute;s sold everything he owned, and charged Diego to bring his daughters to California. Diego and the girls packed and were soon far away from Barcelona.Diego, Juliana, Isabel, and Nuria began their trek across the widest part of Spain acting as pilgrims. They had walked halfway across Spain when they encountered the Gypsies. Until they reached the west coast of Spain, they traveled with the Gypsies. At the port on the coast, Diego met another old friend: Galileo Tempesta. He welcomed Diego, and the captain, Santiago de Le&oacute;n, allowed them to cross the Atlantic on the Madre de Dios.The de Romeu sisters and Nuria had a good time aboard until, off the Cuban coast, they were attacked by pirates. Jean Lafitte, a businessman and pirate involved in illegal activities, took Diego and the women prisoner.What will happen to our heroes? Will they remain prisoners of Jean Lafitte, or will Zorro save them all?I loved reading this book, because the characters were developed extremely well. Bernardo went from being \\"a runny-nosed boy (p.89)\\" to being a man. Diego also developed a lot during the book. Zorro helped to change Diego's personality forever. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes a good adventure. It's a great book to read, and its definitely worth buying for your bookshelf."},{"Title":"Zorro - A Novel","review":"Isabel Allende is one of the leading lights in literature these days and it's easy to see why. She takes the old pulp story of Zorro and casts it in a new light as a memoir of growing up as Zorro's friend and all of the experiences that might make a person do such a thing as create a secret identity. At the same time she keeps the light-hearted and adventuresome tone that people remember about Zorro, rather than making her novel a draggy \\"Dark Knight\\" psychological study. She also blends in extensive history, real-life people and events, and larger social themes such as the role of women in old Spain vs. the colonies and the genocide against the Indians.My only issue with this book was choice to write the novel as a fictional memoir. Because the narrator (who is very engaging) already knows what happened, the book is mostly narrative summary rather than traditional scenes. Also, there is really no drive or rising action in the narrative.This was my first book by Isabel Allende. I was a little apprehensive because I often don't like literary fiction, but I was surprised at how accessible her writing was.

It is very readable and weaves the story of Zorro and his nemesis in a very subtle way... pretty much like the creators of Smallville managed to do with the superman legend.It does have some flaws, the biggest of which is that the alter ego of Zorro, Diego de la Vega, camouflages the hero behind a semblance of weakness which was very credible for all of us reading the comic or watching the TV show. Even his father was aghast at the dandy demeanor of Diego. This camouflage is nowhere to be found in the book.

The problem was that the story was just poorly constructed.It was barely about 'Zorro\\", and could just as well have been written about an anonymous new character from the author's imagination. Instead, she apparently went for the publicity angle, taking on an 'established' (public domain?) character, but making him nearly unrecognizable.The story rambles without actually going anywhere.The 'biographical' format, narrated by someone whose identity we're apparently not meant to discover until the final chapter(big surprise!), is as tedious and tiresome as the story itself.I'm about two thirds of the way through it, but I've found it so mind-numbingly boring, I just can't force myself to finish.After reading this story, I can safely say that my interest in both the author and the title character remains unchanged."},{"Title":"Zorro - A Novel","review":"Diego was born in california to a Spanish military father.At the age of 16, he is sent to Barcelona for schooling.When he returned to California, he reclaimed his home, and fought for the injustices in his society that had arisen while he was gone.This book shows a great example of the injustices towards native americans by the spanish and europeansI thought that the overall portreal of characters really gives the reader a good picture of what they looked like, felt, and saw while reading.I recommend this book to everyone who loves zorro, or just wants a good read."},{"Title":"Zorro - A Novel","review":"Looking for the dash and adventure of Johnston McCulley's pulp hero Zorro? Then don't look here!Allende's attempt to produce an origin for Zorro has less excitment than one of those .99 romance novels with Fabio on the cover. Yes, it is written better than that type of work, slightly, but as Allende struggles so much to be politically correct with multiculturalism and feminism this book is simply dull. Even her attempts to weave real historical action into the story fall flat. The novel is nothing but page after page of nothing happening. There is no fun in reading it, which is supposed to the point of picking up something with Zorro in it. Indeed, finishing Allende's Zorro was a chore.If you want to read of the adventures of Zorro, find reprints of McCulley's pulp novels, or find Alex Toth's or Don MacGregor's collected comic works on \\"the Fox\\".

The story itself is somewhat weak on plot, with everything resolved as soon as the main characters get to the Emerald City.

Voltaire twists the knife well. I was glad to see that though he excels, and delights, in mockery, the story functions ultimately as what may be an honest question, like that of Job or of Solomon. (In fact, ironically, the book Candide most reminds me of is Ecclesiastes.)In one regard, at least, Candide is less true to life than the Biblical point of view, however. Thousands die here, but no one is begotten. The insanity of life is celebrated to the full, but its beauty and wonder are not squarely faced. The one-sidedness of Voltaire's approach lessens it as a work of philosophy, in my opinion. I couldn't help but reflect that many in the 20th Century went into the hell-holes of communist prisons, where every horror Candide and his friends experienced occurred, and more (the atheists of the 20th Century were also, in their own ways, ingenious), yet emerged with a strong belief in God. (Even some, like Solzhenitsyn, who went in as atheists.) Why is that? Philosophy, it seems to me, needs to face all sides of a question. This Voltaire hardly pretends to do: the book is a question, not an answer. But as satire on premature answers, it sizzles.If all Voltaire's books contain cannabalism, libel, bestiality, and philosophical arguments based on slapstick humor, I can hardly blame the authorities for burning them. Being something of a Puritan myself, I docked Voltaire a star. Let that be a lesson.The introduction by Andre Maurois is excellent.author, Jesus and the Religions of Man"},{"Title":"Candide","review":"Though, in my humble opinion, Voltaire is not one of history's greatest philosophers, &quot;Candide&quot; is indeed one of history's greatest works of philosophy. It is also one of the greatest satires ever written. I believe that even Leibnitz would have found something eminently enjoyable in this work."},{"Title":"Candide","review":"Candide is far from being ennervated by time. In fact, it may be more relevant now than at any time since Voltaire wrote it in the mid-1700s.What happens to Candide, Pangloss and all the other main characters in the novel is cruelly absurd. Real life itself, as we can all testify from personal experience, is often just as capricious, nonsensical and painful as the landscape through which Candide moves.And make no mistake -- this is a novel of movement: movement about the globe, movement up and down the social ladder, movement toward utopia and away, movement toward wisdom hard-won through experience. Voltaire has taken a common-place 16th Century literary form, the picaresque novel, and breathed new life into it. His aim is far higher than the genre's typical morality. In traditional picaresque novels, the hero -- the &quot;picaro&quot; (the genre is Spanish in origin)-- learns through a series of misadventures his place in the grand scheme of things, usually on the underbelly of the society in which he lives.Candide and Company range far and wide through a myriad of societies, including an Andean utopia, finding no permanent place. Only when they settle on the Propontus in Turkey and settle down as a family, not of blood ties, but of mutual suffering and experience, do they create a space for themselves.The novel's oft-quoted ending, which has Candide espousing the virtues of tending to one's own garden, is far more than a call to Protestant simplicity and self-denial. The garden Candide and his friends cultivate is a poor recreation of the original garden, the Garden of Eden. But it is theirs, won through misadventure, pain and suffering. Relentlessly pessimistic throughout the novel about the natural state of mankind, Voltaire hints at an optimism in the end, the possibility that the downtrodden can redeem themselves.This is a fun romp for high school readers and college undergrads will enjoy the overt sexual references scattered throughout. For their teachers, Candide offers the opportunity to show their students that we can all persevere and tend to our own gardens, if we can but recognize the claim of humanity we have upon each other. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Candide","review":"For what reason would the greastest tale of Franois-Marie Arouet (Voltaire) be considered one of the best books ever written? For answering such a question, I would have to waste the pages of a little essay, but if you want a short response, there it goes, whomever is not drowned on the best-seller trash of our comtemporary times will get the point: If thee think Candide's philosophical, historical and sociological analyses are as small as the book, thee haven't understood the story, or better saying, never really read it; If you just laugh at the sufferings of the characters, remember laughing is one of the best ways for showing much of the human misery, and so,realize about what you smiled at, if it was not at yourself. I won't write much more, READ the Candide and, as Italo Calvino said, have this &quot;moving picture of the velocity&quot; on your hands, a book destined for immortality, as his writer and maker, who once said: &quot;to write is to act&quot;. OUI, Such is the power of a philosopher that cultivated his own garden, and ours."},{"Title":"Candide","review":"I must be the only college student that wasnt forced to read this for a class. Anyway,this was an interesting book that really made me think. I didnt find it so much as funny as sad at depicting the horrors of the world but it does so in such a light, outragous way.Some of the best parts are at the end, like when they go visit the rich man who doesnt enjoy anything.The plot is over the top and outragous but this is still one of the most realistic books Ive read. I found it kind of bleak and depressing but I also found it intriguing.Voltaire exaggerates everything in Candide, all of the misfortunes everyone has to go through are too horrible to be even realistic. At least I hope no ones had quite as bad time of it as candide. Even if you dont agree with Voltire and even if you share views with Dr. Pangloss you should still read this book.One final thing, dont mourn overmuch for any of the characters when they die, theyll turn up again later."},{"Title":"Candide","review":"When I started this very short book, I expected it to be a drone-fest from the 1700s. However I was pleasantly surprised to find the story gripping, the satire comical and devious, and my time well spent. I even read sections of the book to younger siblings of ages 10 and 6, and they paid attention with great detail. I would highly recommend this book as a classic for a reason."},{"Title":"Candide","review":"Voltaire's Candide is Perhaps the best satire ever written. It was the silly blind optimism and indifferent response to human suffering and injustice of his era that Voltaire mocked. Through the antics of his tutor Dr Pangloss ' a metaphysico-theologo-cosmolo-nigologist' no less, Voltaire attacked much received wisdom and was not afraid to confront the dark aspects of human nature honestly.Nonetheless, He believed in democratic enlightenment, the power of science and reason to make a better world.His message is still prescient to this day."},{"Title":"Candide","review":"If you're a history guru, or you love hearing people subtly poke fun at authority, you'll love Candide! Voltaire did a wonderful job of musing about the patterns of life and undermining political figures of his time. A word of caution: those with little historical background on this time period may find it silly and trivial. (Just how Voltaire wanted the authority of his time to see it, ha ha). However, I loved it!"},{"Title":"Candide","review":"I picked up this book because I was curious about the source matter for a piece I was playing with a symphony (the overture to Berstein's &quot;Candide&quot;). I seem to be the only person I know personally that wasn't forced/encouraged to read this book in a French/classical Lit. class.I'm not disappointed.I think that those who don't see the satire in this text perhaps don't pay too much attention to their surroundings. Voltaire is poking fun at things much larger than the Leibnizian philosophy that serves as the focal point for attack in this this novella; the central message (contained within the last few lines of the story) is that there are more pressing, immediate, and pragmatic concerns to life than philosophies, dogmas, and the like. Voltaire was the pragmatic's philosopher, the anti-philosopher in many senses. His rejection of blind followings, philosophical &quot;proof,&quot; and &quot;schools&quot; of thought is clear within this sharp-witted text.It's a great read for anyone who's been stomped on for thinking &quot;outside of the box.&quot; I would recommend that those readers with a more thorough background (and interest) in religious and philosophical literature and history look up Voltaire's magnum opus, the *Philosophical Dictionary.* Don't be fooled by its title; it's anything but dry, stale definitions.A great read with some light Mozart and good tea.=)"},{"Title":"Candide","review":"... I would read a lot more classic literature than I do now. So what if this book's sole purpose was to present Voltaire's snide and sarcastic remarks about some archaic German philosophy which no longer exists? So what if the advice to cultivate one's own garden has no more to do with my Real Life right now than Leibniz or Christian Wolffe? The language is a towering pinnacle of aethetic delight (ironic, I know, since I read the book in an english translation.) It was a great pleasure to read. I got to impress my English teacher *and* be thoroughly entertained at the same time -- what a deal! Now, unfortunately, I'm afraid I shall have to plow through all those boring criticisms detailing &quot;the intellectual climate of the period,&quot; which take up two thirds of the edition of Candide I'm reading. Oh well. It was certainly worth it."},{"Title":"Candide","review":"I loved this book the first time I read it in college. But after re-reading it, I've concluded that while Voltaire has a lot going on in this story, there is a simple formula directing the action: Candide meets some people. They do him wrong somehow. On the verge of death Candide escapes. Rinse, repeat.I still love reading the early chapters, they are comical masterpieces. I see Cunegonde in an entirely different light now than when I was younger. Candide and Pangloss are still naive morons, of course. And I have new found appreciation for Martin.Overall, Candide is great fun, but can get repetitious. Best read in one sitting."},{"Title":"Candide","review":"It says live life at Benny Hill freak out speed.--- The Bloodhound GangNot quite, but on to the review.Candide may be both difficult and easy for people to read; it's a very quick novel and can be finished within two hours, but the scope of said novel is huge. The protaganist, Candide, is a young German nobleman who experiences many things in a very short period of time; finding love, losing love, finding love, losing lose, finding ugly love, etc. Meanwhile, he experiences earthquakes, storms, whippings, the death of friends and even comes across the fabled city of El Dorado when he happenstances upon the Americas. Candide shouldn't be read for it's character development - it should be read for it's message. One thing I must add is the virulent anti-semitism which is found in this book. Apparently, Voltaire was a strong anti-semite. This discovery greatly lowered my opinion of him.Still, Candide is a must read for anyone interested in classical literature of important medieval thought."},{"Title":"Candide","review":"Flat out one of the funniest books I've ever read. I thought that Jonathan Swift was satirically vicious in Gulliver's Travels and \\"A Modest Proposal,\\" but Voltaire makes Dean Swift seem a mere Yahoo. One of the most astonishing features of this short, picaresque novel is the speed of the narrative. Works a few centuries old are usually not notable for being quick reads, but I found myself devouring sentences, paragraphs, and chapters at an alarming rate. Alarming because I'd reached the end with nothing more to read.The tale of Candide, the naive hero, who is separated from his love, the deliciously and vulgarly named Cunegonde, is a vehicle for Voltaire to skewer humanity in every way, shape, and form. No aspect of human endeavor is spared his rapier wit--religion, religious figures, the military, government, rulers, nationalities, philosophers and philosophy, sexuality, class dinstinctions, lawyers, the inhospitable natural world, drunkenness and gluttony, etc., and the humor is produced by the accumulation of detail that is used to describe the misfortunes of the various characters. To compound the irony, the tale begins with the pronouncement of Candide's inept tutor Doctor Pangloss that this is \\"the best of all possible worlds.\\"In the course of their adventures, the characters are kicked, slapped, raped, disemboweled, hanged, burnt at the stake, drowned, stabbed, bayoneted, impaled, blinded, amputated, and my favorite--eaten. The old lady with one buttock, a companion to Cunegonde, at one point says of herself: \\"Imagine the situation of a Pope's daughter aged fifteen, who in three months had undergone poverty and slavery, had been raped nearly every day, had seen her mother cut into four pieces, had undergone hunger and war, and now dying of the plague in Algiers.\\"Well, she survived, was bought and sold several times, and wound up with some Janizaries in a fort under siege by the Russians. \\"The twenty Janizaries had sworn never to surrender us. The extremities of hunger to which they were reduced forced them to eat our two eunuchs for fear of breaking their oath. Some days later they resovled to eat the women.\\" A compassionate Imam intervened, however. \\"'Cut,' said he, 'only one buttock from each of these ladies and you will still have an excellent meal; if you have to return, there will still be as much left in a few days; Heaven will be pleased at so charitable an action and you will be saved.'\\"All of this detail takes place in the space of half a page and is typical of the rest of the text--savage meat for the free-thinking mind."},{"Title":"Candide","review":"...in the convulsions of disquiet or the lethargy of boredom.\\"The subject quote from \\"Candide\\" is another version of the idea expressed in the Chinese aphorism concerning the curse of living in \\"interesting times,\\" that is, times that are \\"exciting\\" to read about if one did not actually live through them. Voltaire, a pseudonym, was one of the intellectual giants of the enlightenment. He was a prolific writer; this book is his most read legacy. A major impetus for writing this book was to refute Leibnitz's philosophy of optimism, best exemplified by Voltaire's character, Dr. Pangloss, whose continued philosophical touchstone is: \\"This is the best of all possible worlds.\\" For anyone who has lived through even a portion of the 20th Century, one would not think such a philosophy needed refuting. But apparently it still does, as witnessed by Barbara Ehrenreich'sBright-Sided: How Positive Thinking Is Undermining America. I first read \\"Candide\\" some forty years ago, and decided to re-read after portions of my own life experience have also helped refute Leibnitz.Candide, at a very youthful age, is kicked out of his own \\"Garden of Eden,\\" which is a German castle in Westphalia, after kissing his first love, and almost only love, Cunegund. Dr. Pangloss was a private tutor at the castle. Candide then commences a wild and extremely improbable romp across much of the known world. He is dragooned into the Bulgarian (Prussian) Army, is beaten, escapes, and meets Dr. Pangloss along the way, who is now a beggar, with syphilis. They join a generous Anabaptist, and take a ship to Lisbon, which had just been destroyed in an earthquake (the background event is historically correct; Lisbon was destroyed by an earthquake in 1755). Candide is only one of three survivors from the shipwreck. Dr. Pangloss is hanged by the forces of the Inquisition. Speaking of which, he again meets his first love, Cunegund, who has become a \\"kept woman,\\" on alternate days of the week (naturally!) by a Jew, and the Grand Inquisitor. Candide kills them both, and flees in her company, and that of an old woman, first to Cadiz, and then on to Buenos Aires. The old woman's story is also bizarre and improbable. She is the illegitimate daughter of Pope Urban X, who, inter alia, had half her buttock's removed by Turkish defenders of Azov, during their wars with Russia, so that they would not starve. Candide visits much of South America, including a kingdom where diamonds and gold are just so many pebbles. He acquires a few, which finances his latter journeys to Venice and Istanbul.Sure, this is satire, but for many a reader, the question would remain: Of what? Clearly it is not the best of all possible worlds, and a partial catalog of the evils of the mid-1700's does not seem necessary to confirm this. Way, way back there in high school, when I first read this, I had been taught that wild and improbable coincidences, such as appeared inThe Mayor of Casterbridge (Enriched Classics (Pocket))weere not good literature. Yet, in \\"Candide,\\" Pangloss did not actually die in the hanging, and Cunegard's brother was not actually killed by the sword that ran him through. Even making allowance for the objectives of satire, it does wear a bit thin.Voltaire was a scathing critic of the rigid dogmatism of the Catholic Church, and I say bravo to that. One of the biggest \\"takeaways\\" on the re-read is a footnote in my Washington Square copy that said that \\"Pope Urban X\\" was a fictitious name, since at the time the Catholic Church had so much power than even a critic like Voltaire did not dare use the name of a real Pope, even a deceased one. The evils of the world are acknowledged; Voltaire's advice to help us get through: cultivate your own private garden. That advice still resonates through the centuries. Well, I have to get ready for the spring planting. 4-stars."},{"Title":"Candide","review":"Candide by VoltaireThis is a great classic. \\"Candide\\" treats important philosophical questions in unusual way. The book is brilliant and often laught-out-loud hilarious."},{"Title":"Candide","review":"In Candide, Voltaire chronicles the travels and travails of a group of perenial optimists despite the many harsh and cruel blows life deals these people. By experiencing murder, beating, torture, censorship, banishment, theft, and slavery this group of loosely tied adventurers inquire about the most intricate details of life's philosophies in the most lighthearted and witty quips centering around God's general plan for the betterment of society as a whole and the individual sacrifices and seemingly absurd happenstances needed to occur for this greater progress to occur.This seems to culminate in discussions around drunken card games held at baron's and other highly-esteemed officials pallaces where there thousands of dust-collecting books seems to be the ultimate symbolic farce of the pointlessness of societal mores and trivial critical establishments. Afterwards, after many unlikely events and quick turnarounds from despair to wealthy gleeming back to gloomy hopelessness, Candide and his journeyman Martin come across other mentors and enemies from his past, as well as his long sought after lover Cunegonde, to find them in the most deplorable conditions and with many regrets, but yet with unflayling blind optimism.The book greatly picks up from their journey into the utopian like village of El Dorado onwards and then gains the respect that has been hyped upon it. However, I still think this is overrated and maybe the translation has lost some of the supposed wit and fancy of the original Frenchman's work and his rhyme and prose style.In the end, we are all left to create our own Garden of Eden from whatever limited/superfluous environments affordable and available to us and make the best of the people, places, culture, and tools to us. You can loose your mind and you will be among the many who have lost their minds, certainly in the majority and only by crossing that boundary of supposed weakness can you transcend the peculiar weaknesses of the mind and body.A toast to Voltaire for his lively and everlasting work!"},{"Title":"Candide","review":"This is a &quot;laugh-out-loud&quot; funny book.

There are different versions and interpretations of the French satire, and I think that some is lost perhaps in our interpretation of the satire (as to what we perceive to be satire modern day, as opposed to the time period), and the French to English translation itself. Nonetheless, this is a great book and I especially enjoyed the smooth prose throughout the book.Candide travels all over Europe, Turkey, and SOuth America and finds himself having epiphanies on every adventure. This book makes me think of the things that we value in society and how are cultural norms and complacency can rob us of the will to take risks and live. One of my favorite quotes, towards the end of the book puts the novels' themes into clear perspective for me.The old woman says, \\"I should like to know which is worse, to be raped a hundred times by negro pirates, to have a buttock cut off, to run the gauntlet among the Bulgarians, to be whipped and flogged in an uto-da-fe, to be dissected, to row in a galley, in short, to endure all the miseries through which we have passed, or to remain doing nothing.\\" They inevitably conclude that \\" man was born to live in the convulsions of distress or in the lethargy of boredome.\\"This is a timeless book and a MUST READ."},{"Title":"Candide","review":"The book is for class starting soon, so not used it yet but it was in good shape and on time."},{"Title":"Candide","review":"I love the book, i would recommend it to my friends and family.

The reviewer said that the book is no longer applicable to the world because Voltaire's fight had been won: that is to say religious intolerance and ignorance have been banished. I never agreed with that reviewer's assesment. In light of September 11, my disagreement is further entrenched in my body. Religious ignorance is still running amuck in the hills and desert dunes, and right in our own backyard. Has Voltaire's war been won? No, I don't think so. We're in the middle of it right now. Candide helped take the religious fanaticism out of Europe, perhaps some new translations in arabic and whatever languages are spoken in Afghanistan should be dropped from the back of planes along with the bombs.

It tells the story about an illegitimate son of Dr. Pangloss. This book is a satire and as good a depiction of the follies and vices of men that you'll find. We follow Candide through many outrageous adventures which put into question all that mankind holds dear (such as science, philosophy, religion, government and romance). It attacks the pretentiousness of the upper classes. It attacks man's culpability, stupidity and crudeness. It's funny, warm and incredibly poignant. It is no wonder that the printer that was to publish Voltaire's book had to go underground to do so, and that he lost his business and his personal fortune because of this book. This is a masterful, if blistering satire on the follies and vices of men. Voltaire does not save anybody, no matter what walk of life they are in. In fact, the upper classes are painted in a very unflattering light. Candide is a young and impressionable if somewhat bumptious hero, who falls into and out of more trouble in his life. He is a nave soul who believes all that he is told and thinks that everyone knows more about things than he does himself. Voltaire spares no punches as he outlines his idea of man. To him humankind shows grossness, cupidity, and not a little outright stupidity. But even so the book is not as pessimistic as it could be. There is a freshness here in the simplemindedness of Candide, and in the occasional goodness that he runs across. His stay at Eldorado is part of the book that illustrates goodness, and the ending leaves on an optimistic note when Voltaire and his motley band of followers realize that good will come if man will stay at home and look after his acreages. Wonderful book!"},{"Title":"Candide","review":"Candide is among the classics of world- literature.Voltaire wrote a hundred volumes or more but this is the only piece which is still read today. There is reason for this. The theme is an eternal one, innocent optimistic idealistic youth confronting the realities of the world, and being slowly disabused of his idealism. Voltaire takes on Leibniz whose views are represented by Candide's teacher Pangloss( Everything is for the best in the best of all possible worlds). Voltaire writes with great satirical skill of the numerous misadventures of Candide who after them all comes to the conclusion that ' it is best to cultivate one's own garden' . One reason I never fully enjoyed the book is my sense of a certain predictable slaptstick element in which the cruelty preceding is certainly about to be followed by the cruelty to come. And this too has to do with a feeling a sense that Voltaire himself seemed to be enjoying the cruelty more than anything else. Voltaire it is true has an honored place in the human struggle for freedom of individual expression but he was on the personal level a quite terrible person. And that feeling that for him the cruelties of life are a bit of a delight did not escape me when reading the work.This to my mind means that the work cannot even come close to those peaks of world literature in which we have deep connection with and sympathy for the major heroes. Candide is a straw- figure and this little moral allegory still speaks a truth and a question."},{"Title":"Candide","review":"Still today, over two hundred years after it was written, Candide still shines as one of literature's best satires.The book is full of pessimism does not prevent him from using humor throughout the book. Some of the humor used in the book is blatant; the governor of Buenos Ayres declares his love for Cun&eacute;gonde, says he will marry her, then never does. In case readers did not understand the hypocrisy, Voltaire gave the governor a name to remember: Don Fernando d'Ibaraa y Figuerora y Mascarenes y Lampourdos y Souza. Another interesting name is that of Baron Thunder-ten-tronckh. The illeteration and mental imagery is what stood out for me; the name brings pictures of a corpulent man thundering down a hall. It does not sound aristocratic (if indeed, names can be aristocratic) and seems more of a misnomer than a label for a noble from Wittenburg. By examining the Baron's behavior (working everyone towards his goals and then profiting from their labor while he does nothing) the name is no longer a misnomer.Candide reminded me of Miguel de Cervantes' Don Quixote in that a man following the regulations of chivalry is driven to do the correct thing even though disastrous consequences may come of it. Candine discovers this when he rescues Cun&eacute;gonde from a Turkish noble and finds she is ugly and disagreeable. In addition, Don Quixote and Candide both find themselves in improbable situations over and over again. Both books are satire and they poke fun at the same government, social, and ecclesiastical principles. Despite the similarity, I did enjoy reading Candide more so than I did Don Quixote."},{"Title":"Candide","review":"I disliked the book very strongly. If it was in new style english and brought out the meanings in plain words it would have been so much better.It took me reading somethings 4 or 5 times to understand its real meaning, and sometimes after that it still didn't make sense to me. I did find it weird how the story from way back at that time is really close to a lot of stories on the Jerry Springer show.To end my review you would like it if you were into old english literature, but thats just not for me."},{"Title":"Candide","review":"Granted my having read Candide in it'a original French in a highschool French Lit. class may have something to do with my dislike of this novel. However, we read other books in that class that I loved (Une Si Longe Lettre for one). I can only conlude that it is the book not the class that was so horrible. There are many things detestable about this novel so I will limit my critisicsm to only several aspects: the pot has no coherence, the character developement is not only unbelievable but also banal, the writing style ,although blessedly, terse is childish and unimaginative to say the least. And finally, a qotation I once read said something to this effect: the best novel are those that are novels not only of the hour but of all time. Candide has no relevance to my life or this era what so ever. One more word to those who wish to deride me as an illiterate teenage who can only process the sound bites of T.V., think again. I am an avid reader of all kind of literature including classic literature.

French books are, of course, often french, but this one is frencher than most. Ah, Pierrot! Reading this fine french book makes me the sad clown of life. Could Voltaire be any frencher, you ask?

So come, bring along your Jerry Lewis video tapes and we will read this very french book together. It is frencher than a Quebecer at a Steisand concert. Frencher than Little Richard at an amfAR banquet. Frencher than Richard Simmons at a french pride parade. Read Candide and you too can be a very french sad clown. Sacre Bleu!!!"},{"Title":"Candide","review":"you call this literature?!? I mean come on now, this is a little bit ridiculous. Who can really understand this? Not only understand it but see where it might have anything to do with us and today's society!"},{"Title":"Candide","review":"Being a fan of such authors as Charles Bukowski and Hunter S. Thompson, I admittedly found myself disheartened upon learning that Voltaire's \\"Candide\\" was on my summer reading list. I, as well as many, many other young readers, often find myself trudging through dreary and boring works of \\"literature\\", all of which are hailed by critics and scholars and \\"experts\\" (thus the reasoning for us to read them). It is because of such books that most kids these days hate to read and don't give books that could actually interest them a chance. But in reading \\"Candide\\", I found in Voltaire a thing almost identical to what I found in Orwell and his classic allegory, \\"Animal Farm\\" - it's not necessarily a staggering work of unimaginable genius, but what it is a work of great insight, fantastic adventure, wonderous charm, and upon finishing it, one will hardly feel their time was wasted.Candide is both the title of this book and the name of its main character. In the beginning of his life, Candide is born to the sister of the great Baron of Thunder-ten-tronckh (you'll often see foreign and confusing names such as this). In no time, he and the daughter of the Baroness, Cunegonde, fall deeply in love, and the Baron discovers this secret and immediately kicks Candide out of the castle, which is seated in the province of Westpahlia in Germany. During the breadth of his travels, Candide is always in want of his love Cunegonde.From thence forth, Candide is thrust into an adventure surrounded in the blood and bones of the many and the love and friendship of the few. From Portugal to Paris to the fabled city of El Dorado, Candide follows a magnificent road. Plans of passage to find Cunegonde are often devised during his journey, although he is equally as often sidetracked and then swindled out of the unparalleled riches he has amassed by the greedy and unkind citizens of the countries he enters.Along for the journey are a handful of Candide's wise friends, most of which he meets for the very first time, including a valet (somewhat similar to a servant) named Cucumbo, a miserable philsopher named Martin, and an old woman who is the daughter of the Pope and is now a poor and lonely soul. Another one of these friends is a man Candide had once admired - the Baron of Thunder-ten-tronckh's former philospher, Pangloss. From Pangloss, Candide takes the expression \\"all is for the best.\\" By the end of the book, it could be said that this outlook on life and Candide's generally \\"rose-tinted\\" view of life are altered.In the end, what we have, as readers, is a magnificent \\"coming-of-age\\" tale, in which the innocent, doe-eyed Candide witnesses, firsthand, the horrors not only of war but of life itself, and if not for the love in his heart, he would surely have chosen to end his misery sooner.And to all those who are reading this book because their school requires it: Do not be afraid of the perfect English and 18th century setting, because what you're about to read is a wonderful roadtrip of a tale about a starry-eyed romantic out to conquer whatever lies before him so that he may one day see again the lover with which he is so infatuated.When you think about the book \\"Candide\\", don't think Shakespeare, think Hunter S. Thompson. Don't think \\"Romeo and Juliet\\", think \\"Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas\\". Then you will begin to understand the unwholesome fun of which you are soon to discover."},{"Title":"Candide","review":"Candide is a very brief, yet wholly amusing satiric thrust at the Christian philosophy of perpetual optimism. Obviously Voltaire couldn't write anything without making a pointed statement of some sort, and in its entirety Candide is no different from his other works. It's a story, of course, but only secondarily; the writer left not a single word devoid of relevance to his point. In fact he tells his tale with very little attention to detail, only concerned with encompassing his main character's lengthy odyssey as quickly as possible. With such an approach, his sole aim was to simply get the message across. In Candide, Voltaire strives to refute the belief that we live in the best of all possible worlds. By documenting his young protagonist's horrendous sufferings and hardships, the philosopher more than implies that misfortune is certainly not part of any divine plan for us. And whether you agree with that or not, I'd still say this book manifests a great deal of provocative insight, not to mention a whole lot of dark, dark humor. I wouldn't call Candide a consistent knock-out -- most of its pages aren't quite laugh-out-loud funny -- but the whole of the story very well tickles the reader with its caustic narrative. So if you're just itching for a short read (most folks could complete this one in a single sitting, I'm sure), look no further. While it may be of very petite proportions, Candide is unarguably a literary classic, as entertaining and surprising and clever as one would hope."},{"Title":"Candide","review":"In Candide, Voltaire opens the door to self-discovery and the search for a true God by closing the door on what we perceive to be reality. With an unmatched wit he sets up an increasingly impossible series of events that force us to see with unlidded eye the ludicrousness of our attempts to reject that which is present and real, for that which is outside of us and fantastical. If his intention was to show the pain that is evident in all of our lives, he has succeeded. If it was to show to what considerable distance we as a people will go to avoid pain, he has again succeeded. The character I most identify with in Candide is the central character in the story, Candide. We can see the effects that his experiences with other people and their philosophies have had on his life. Candide, from the French candida, means \\"white.\\" This may suggest that he begins life as \\"a blank page,\\" a yet undefined form.At one time, we are all born a \\"blank page\\"; our existence is marked with no blemish, no experience that has defined who we are. Our minds are in essence candida. Yet, looking back into my past and opening up the pages of my existence, I can ever more clearly that I am not a self-made man. Personal experiences, past and present contacts with individuals, institutions and society have combined their respective influences and written that combination which is me, on my blank page. It is no longer white, but stained with the indelible ink of experience.As Candide's story progresses, we can see clearly how his pages are being written, step by step. Few of those pages in Candide's life are filled with what we might consider to be positive events. He begins as a young impressionable boy listening to the philosophy of those around him. Unfortunately, he has the estimable Dr. Pangloss, whose name literally means \\"all tongue,\\" as the tutor and former of his mind. He says that all things happen for a reason; therefore, it must be the best reason. In essence, Pangloss teaches Candide that the reason for his and others' suffering is for the greater societal good.How many of those persons who have influenced the person that I am today have been \\"all tongue\\"? Throughout my life, I have heard from every shade tree philosopher, \\"There is a reason for everything.\\" I would be inclined to agree with them if, by that statement, they mean that every cause has an effect. That is however, not the case. Like Pangloss, they are ascribing the \\"cause\\" to an entity, a God, or force outside of themselves as individuals and society. This excuses us from many things. One of those things that it excuses us from is responsibility. If things cannot be other than they are then my part, my action, was preordained and consequently I am not responsible for the effects of those actions. Voltaire saw that these people who spoke so often of a God, who was alive and called each of us to \\"personal responsibility,\\" were at the same time ascribing the \\"cause and effect\\" of their actions to Him. Candide was the vehicle that Voltaire used to show the mutual exclusivity of the belief in Free Will and Absolute Necessity.I can really identify with the questions that Candide asks in the midst of his suffering. After a series of painful experiences that Dr. \\"Paingloss\\" Pangloss covers over with his \\"Indispensable\\" defense, Candide is inclined to ask: \\"If this is the best of all possible worlds, then what can the rest be like?\\" I hear him saying that, if this is the best of all possible worlds, then why would anyone want more? When people tell me that there is a reason for everything, with the purpose of glossing over my pain, and that we will all find out in the \\"by and by,\\" I wonder what prevents them from finding \\"sufficient reason\\" to expedite their own end and thereby to circumvent the pleasure, pain and reality that they are in actuality trying to escape.Voltaire shows us that we all undoubtedly will suffer. Through his farcical style we see the reality of Candide's suffering. We are also made to see that the pain that he is suffering is suffered at the hands of man and nature. We see that Candide is being led through life by the will of others and that a large part of his suffering is brought on by because he is reacting to life rather than acting upon it. Candide does not see himself or others as an initiator of his pain. He still holds to Pangloss' philosophy that everything is for the best.In reality I have never believed that everything was for the best, yet like Candide I have spent a majority of my life in reaction rather than action. As I suspect is true with Pangloss, I have built up a series of impenetrable defenses. At one time in my life they protected me from that which I could not comprehend, and hence had some value. They were a reaction to experiences that I could not explain away. Yet as time passed, the defenses that had served me so well began to become increasing invalid with each experience that broadened my horizons.While Candide was still a resident of the greatest Hall, owned by the greatest Baron, who was married to the greatest Baroness, who had the most seductive daughter, as well as a son who was naturally worthy of his father, who were all taught by the greatest teacher in the town and \\"consequently the greatest in all the world,\\" his defenses served him well, for there were no experiences that could invalidate the theory that Pangloss was teaching. When these things were taken from Candide, Pangloss' theory did not protect him from real physical or emotional pain. But protection was never its intention. I have never needed protection from anything that did not exist. What people are attempting to do is eliminate suffering from existence. If Candide could only repeat Pangloss enough, then his emotional pain would disappear. He could invalidate pain as a feeling.A lot of people in my life have tried to teach me the same thing. It is not enough that they don't have to feel. Their lives can never be safe as long as the world is inhabited by people who do. Our contact with these people threatens their faux peace. When we cry out, they close the doors. When we are angry, they smile. When someone dies, we mourn in their midst as they say that God is going to make something good come out of this. What a hopeless world we are in when life cannot be other than it is. It would lead me to the greatest of desperations if I could not affect my life, for better or worse, by a thoughtful action.We all want the answers to the questions that suffering naturally brings. Why did this happen to me? Why will it not stop? How can I make it go away? I too have asked all of these questions and attempted to find the answers. I think that Voltaire knew that pain was unavoidable. I think he knew that we had not the power to control the world. He showed clearly that our choices are the determiner of our actions, that Free Will and natural disaster are the determiners of cause and effect. Not only will we try to alter reality so that it does not conflict with our opinions, but we punish, condemn, excommunicate and kill those who do not see our \\"reality\\" as being real.Why then do we ask why pain exists? Why do we ask to stop it? We are constantly throwing punches at those who we believe are of a lower social standard, of differing religious beliefs, dress differently than we do, or are of different color, yet still ascribe these actions as being the way things are meant to be. Do we not see that those punches are a source of pain for those at which they are aimed? Voltaire had \\"sufficient reason\\" to question the ludicrousness of this still commonly held belief. Candide's experience, although farcical, is consistent with the pain that we all feel and that we all try to escape. Voltaire asks us to look at the world with a realistic view. If we hold onto beliefs that we ascribe to whatever God we believe in, even though those beliefs are inconsistent with reality and in most cases contrary to the beliefs of our respective creator, we are voiding any real power that He has, and actually increase that pain which we are trying to eliminate."},{"Title":"Candide","review":"As a closet pessimist, I have often come across - and scoffed at - the notion that we live in the \\"best of all possible worlds.\\" The must be so, of course, because the great God almighty is omniscent, omnipotent, omnibenevolent - in short, perfect, and cannot make a mistake. Therefore, all the seemingly needless suffering, trials, and tribulations that are inherent in our world - i.e., airplanes crashing into buildings - are actually for the better, for the greater good, because everything, EVERYTHING - no matter how seemingly cruel and inhumane - is part of the Big Guy's Great Cosmic Plan. Every action has a purpose, and that purpose is (perpetually) benign.All of which is fine, except...Have you looked at the world lately? I have, and, it seems to me that there are, to put it delicately, Several Flaws In This Plan. I watched two airplanes crash into two major American buildings, needlessly killing thousands, and I find it somewhat hard to believe, to put it lightly, that this is the \\"best of all possible worlds.\\" I'm sure most you do as well... or else you probably wouldn't be reading this, now would you?And yet, in the 18th Century time period when this book was written, just such a philosophy was popular (perhaps \\"rampant\\" is a more accurate term) among the heavy, high-brow philosophers of the day. Candide (subtitled \\"Optimism\\") is Voltaire's refutation of the notion. The writing is heavily sarcastic and burlesque - not to mention dark - as any good satire must be. It contains much delicate gallows humor. It reminds me of nothing (and I realize this is an obvious case of putting the carriage years before the horse) so much as our dearly beloved 20th century Doomsday Prophet Laurete, Kurt Vonnegut. Certainly, as this was in essence an ephermal political satire of the time in which it was written, Candide is not, perhaps as technically valid to our present \\"modern-day\\" society as the work of a, say, Vonnegut. As the book is primarily a reaction to the notion in question (that of all-pervading and naive optimism), and not an explanation of it picking its faults specifically (which is to say, it does not explain the nature of what it is refuting, assuming the reader already knows), much of the sarcasm has been lost through the years. One would need a general knowledge of 18th century philosophy to appreciate all the points that the book tries to make. However, Voltaire's main messages are certainly clear enough, and just as valid today as they ever were - and always will be. Read Candide - it's a dark, funny, irrevently hilarous and enlightening satire on man and his naive, optimistic folly and fallacious outlook. Even if you don't like the book - unlikely, if you have already waded through my review this far - I guarantee that you will respect it, and that it will make you think - and, perhaps, get you to question certain notions that you may have held unquestioningly throughout your life. Essential 18th century literature."},{"Title":"Candide","review":"Candide is another one of those books I wish I'd been forced to read at some point in my education, whether in my comparative literature classes in high school (which as previously mentioned, wasn't very comparative if the teacher didn't care for the author) or in one of my several philosophy classes in university. Either way, it's been on my list of books to read for ages now, and seeing as David had it on a shelf, unread and lonely, I decided to pick it up and give it a go.Candide is a fast read, something that I was three-quarters of the way through after my commute on Monday (thirty-five minutes each way) and finished after another half-hour of light reading this afternoon after returning from the doctor's surgery. The only real way to describe it is to imagine what would happen if Camus travelled back in time and decided to write a book with Swift. Candide is funny, sarcastic, satirical, and incredibly entertaining, which is surprising considering I didn't exactly have the best translation in the world at my disposal. It's the story of a young and nave servant to a nobleman and how his journey in life, most of which is taken up with seeking after his unrequited love, is filled with sadness and joy, and how his outlook determines the course of his action.Like most satirists, Voltaire did not stop to consider friends or enemies: he took shots at everyone from the Catholic clergy to Protestants and even his own philosophers who continue to espouse beliefs even after they no longer believe in them because \\"it is the proper thing to do.\\" Brilliant, witty, and clever, this is probably one of my new favourite satirical works, right up there with \\"A Modest Proposal.\\" It's definitely not something that would be enjoyed in a required university class, but anyone who's studied comparative religion or philosophy, or is at least familiar with the absurdities in all philosophical systems, should enjoy this book."},{"Title":"Candide","review":"According to Woody Allen the world is made up of two types of people: the horrible and the miserable. The horrible consist of the crippled, the maimed, and the chronically disabled; the miserable are everyone else. Candide, who believes in the thinking of his tutor, the philosopher Dr. Pangloss, travels throughout the then known world in search of someone who is truly happy. Dr. Pangloss is of the belief that everything that happens to one--whether for good or for bad--is all for the best in \\"this best of all possible worlds.\\" Martin, a philosopher with whom Candide later becomes acquainted, like Woody Allen after him, subscribes to the belief that everyone is unhappy and is doomed to suffer one misfortune after another.Candide himself experiences one tragedy after another. Candide is swindled out of wealth that he accumulates in Eldorado, he suffers beatings, imprisonment, and endless humiliations. He is kicked in the rear end for kissing Cunegonde, his sweetheart for whom he searches the world over. He is even in a shipwreck and is forced to swim ashore. Candide calls out in despair to the absent Dr. Pangloss, for Candide hears only tales of woe from those he meets in his journey._Candide_ should not be taken too seriously. It is meant as a parable and a satire on religious beliefs and on human behavior. That people are greedy, selfish, dishonest, and enjoy inflicting pain on others should be no surprise to anyone who reads _Candide_. It is not unusual for characters in the book to be killed and later to return to life, or for a protagonist who is physically attractive to become aged and ugly, then later on to regain beauty. _Candide_ is an easy read with short chapters. It is rather entertaining, but can be very depressing at times. Its the message at the end--that love and friendship are what makes life meaningful--that is undeniably positive."},{"Title":"Candide","review":"One of the most popular philosophical ideas in Europe during the eighteenth century was that of \\"all is for the best in the best of all possible worlds\\". It was the catch-phrase for Leibniz's argument that because god had created the world, everything was made to occur for the best because god's creations couldn't be evil. So even events that seem tragic and pointless are actually part of some larger, cosmically good plan that mere humans can't see. Therefore we should all accept our fate, and know that everything happens for the best, because we live in the best of all possible worlds.Voltaire, a man who had twice been imprisoned in the Bastille and then exiled, thought this was a crock of you-know-what. Candide, subtitled Optimism, is his satirical response to this idea. Clearly humour was one of Voltaire's strong assets; Candide is quite funny. Many critics say that the characters aren't well developed, but I think that they're broadly drawn on purpose. I believe that one of the reasons Candide still works in our time is that we can identify the characters with people we know, and so we can follow their relationships and actions. For example, the old woman (who is never named) has seen what life has to offer, and cannot be surprised by anything anymore. I'm sure we all know at least one person like this. And Pangloss is basically a self-help guru, spouting out feel-good nonsense and getting paid a lot of money for his time. Candide is also somewhat short on dialog versus explication, but I didn't mind it.However, the major drawback is that Candide was written in the eighteenth century, when the idea of the best possible world was so popular. Therefore the book is not an explanation and then rebuttal of it. Candide is only Voltaire's shout of disgust with it, and so the original idea is not addressed in any depth. In order to recover a large amount of the sarcasm, one would have to be fairly proficient in eighteenth-century philosophy.Even with this weakness, I still found Candide a funny, enjoyable short read, and that Voltaire's basic ideas came through in the end."},{"Title":"Candide","review":"In response to the person who complained about the English translation of Candide featured in this book, I wish to point out a few things. Firstly, the French of the original version by Voltaire cannot be considered as 'modern,' even though it is perfectly understandable to the modern reader. There are a few archaic touches here and there, sometimes because the language has evolved, sometimes because Voltaire intended it so (e.g. the title of the first chapter, &quot;et comment il fut chass&eacute; d'icelui&quot; &gt; &quot;and how he was driven thence&quot;, or something like that, was archaic even for Voltaire). I find the English translation fairly accurate in that respect. This is the opinion of a native French speaker, though.Secondly, and consequently, the use of 'thou' in the translation is understandable. This is not the 'clerical' thou as can still be read in the English Bible and other 'flavoured' translations, but the older 'thou', which had become in Late Middle English the familiar, even contemptuous form of the deferential pronoun 'ye' (originally exclusively plural). The 'clerical' thou is a relatively modern device used in certain type of writings to convey an archaic language, but it is really an 'invention.' Therefore, the use of 'thou' in Candide, where the French has the familiar form 'tu,' is acceptable ; but it certainly can be misleading to the modern reader.That is not to say this is the perfect translation -- such a thing does not exist. Where Voltaire uses understatement to great comic effect I find the translator usually too emphatic. Also the French version is much more vulgar in places. I suppose this translation is quite old ; there are others, but I did not read them.To those considering purchasing or reading this book: do so, by all means. Candide is a thought-provoking, entertaining and humorous tale for readers of various tastes. It is a classic."},{"Title":"Candide","review":"Candide, is a satire, irony, sarcasm and hyperbole. In this novel he punctuates the naivete of optimism in a cruel, corrupt and bellicose world. In developing this theme Voltaire satirizes the philosophy of Leibniz who contended that earth is the best world possible inasmuch as it was created by a benevolent, omniscient, all-powerful God. Voltaire mercilessly ridicules Leibniz and his philosophy as simple-minded and unrealistic. Voltaire uses wit to mock the practitioners of bigotry, superstition and tyranny. This is a fairly easy read and I would recommend it."},{"Title":"Candide","review":"Check for ISBN: 0143039423.I read Candide years ago; however, while looking through the shelves of the local bookstore I stopped dead in my tracks when I saw this new presentation. Check any of the participating book sites and enlarge the image of the new cover to be treated to a whimsical stick figure rendition of the majority of the story (complements of Chris Ware, some of his graphic novels include : The Acme Novelty Library, Quimby the Mouse and Jimmy Corrigan: The Smartest Kid on Earth). However, read the book, not just the cover, for one of the smartest satires ever written.Candide tells of the outrageous adventures of the nave Candide, who steadfastly believes that \\"all is for the best\\" even when faced with the injustice, suffering, and despair of the world. Following his eviction from his home for a tryst with his stepsister, he sets out to find the \\"best of all possible worlds\\" that his mentor Dr. Pangloss cannot stop extolling. Allthewhile Candide and his friends barely keep from being killed or tortured at every turn. Controversial for its time (the 18th century) and entertaining still today; Candide is a book that is relevant even now in our society, where \\"the mania for insisting that all is well when all is by no means well\\" prevails.I am an avowed classics hater who could never make it through a single volume of anything in any Literature class. Never in a million years would I have picked up this book if not for a recommendation by Kurt Vonnegut in one of his autobiographical works. He highly recommended Candide, and being my favorite author, I could not help but be intrigued. I found it in the bookstore and it was short enough to read in one sitting.The sight of this clever new edition brought a wonderful work of literature back into my mind and I could not help but read it again.

Everyone else, enjoy!"},{"Title":"Candide","review":"Candide is a short satirical work that questions if this world is indeed the best of all possible worlds, as \`Liebniz's disciples' believed. Their uncaring verdict on the loss of lives from the earthquake in Lisbon coupled with their arrogance and lack of tact in the time of suffering was fuel for Voltaire's fire.The book is fairly short and can be read in one sitting; it is laugh out loud funny in some places as the most absurd things happen to the major characters. I read it mostly because I like satire and not to get any particular message out of it. The story is pretty straightforward and I guess it does raise a few questions in the readers mind about what our purpose in this life is, how to find happiness, contentment etc... but it can also be read for the pleasure of \`listening' to one of the wittiest men that has ever lived (or so they tell me).I have not done justice to this book, and you can read longer reviews about it on this site, but I would advice you to read it yourself and then make up your mind. Get the Penguin edition.Again, read this book! It's short, it's funny and it's by Voltaire, what other encouragement do you need?"},{"Title":"Candide","review":"Ouch! That hurts!(reacting to the sorry metaphor of my subject line)I found Voltaire's famous satire surprisingly tepid. Perhaps I've become jaded in my old age, or perhaps I should have read this in the 18th century when it caused such a sensation because of the scandalous way that Voltaire satirized the church, the clergy, and just about everybody else in any position of power or influence. Reading it now, it seems a bit tame. All the horrors and stupidities Voltaire describes seem almost commonplace considering what we have experienced since he made his attack on optimism in 1759. Today we can look back at two world wars, at the Holocaust and Hiroshima, at the war in Vietnam, at terrorism and the latest stupidity in Iraq. Nothing in Candide can compare to these real historical events that have so sorely tested human optimism. We can even look back to the French Revolution and the revolutions that followed in the 19th century, which in a sense Voltaire predicted with his devastating critique of the corrupt and degenerate European society. Or we can recall the Catholic priests and Ted Haggard from yesterday's headlines. Plus ca change, plus c'est la meme chose.It is difficult to appreciate how deliciously scandalous this was in Voltaire's time since today we are free to criticize the church and our governments, whereas in Voltaire's time such criticisms could land you in the Bastille. Voltaire's legendary reputation for rapier wit and shocking turn of phrase can be found in these pages, but much of it seems diluted because his style has so often been imitated. We have read and reread his imitators, and we have even read some who have improved upon him in some ways, people in America like Mark Twain, Ambrose Bierce and H. L. Mencken. We tend to forget where they got their inspiration at least in part. An example from The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (episodic in structure much like Candide, by the way) is in the rascals that Huck and Jim meet on the river, the Duke of \\"Bilgewater\\" and the \\"King of France,\\" who, like the six \\"kings\\" that Candide sups with in Venice, are out and our frauds and represent the impossible, deluded aspirations of the average person.This is the work in which we have Dr. Pangloss and his \\"best of all possible worlds.\\" And this is the work which ends with Candide summing up all the philosophy he has learned in his travels with the words, \\"'Tis well said, but we must cultivate our gardens.\\""},{"Title":"Candide","review":"The style of exposition used in this book is reminiscent of The Misfortunes of Virtue by the Marquis de Sade. Voltaire presents a catalog of calamities meant to debunk the belief that our world is perfect, and that everything happens \\"for the best\\" according to some divine plan. While there is no doubt that Candide is persuasive in its comical misadventures, the style gets old just as it did in The Misfortunes of Virtue. The story becomes a trite joke that loses its potency with each subsequent catastrophe, so that half way through the novel the reader no longer cares what befalls Candide and begins to pray that some benevolent deity will put him out of his (and our) misery. If I were not so thoroughly desensitized to tragedy, and had I not already come to the philosophical conclusions that Voltaire is trying to lead his reader, then I might have found the novel to be more profound. Still the novel is well written, reads quickly if you ignore the endnotes*, and is fairly entertaining.* Every time I was compelled to read an endnote just to find out that Voltaire was referencing some long dead frenchman I wanted to fling the book across the room."},{"Title":"Candide","review":"This book is at once both hilarious and horrifying. To have a book possess both these features and still be well done is a noteworthy feat. Well, I guess that Voltaire has accomplished a noteworthy feat. The tale is about a young man named Candide who was brought up under the tutelage of a chap named Pangloss. Pangloss is a caricature of the philosopher Leibniz, who believed that ours' is &quot;the best of all possible worlds&quot; because it was molded and shaped by an omnipotent creator. The name itself is also a pun: Pan (which is Greek for &quot;all&quot;) gloss (which is French for talk): Pangloss = All-talk. At any rate, Voltaire finds out (and continues to find out) that this Pollyanna view of life can be rather troublesome to the senses. He experiences the horrors of war, separation from his beloved, shipwreck, unfortunate misunderstandings, robbery and a plethora of other misfortunes. He also makes it to the mythical utopia of Eldorado, only to find that it's not all it's cracked up to be, either. This is a first rate classic that deals with the meaning of life, the $60,000 question &quot;Is anyone out there really happy?&quot; as well as many delightful lesser questions.

In less than one hundred pages, Voltaire manages to skewer religion, politics, bigotry, love, hatred, optimism, cosmopolitanism, agrarian idealization, and everything else he could get his eighteenth-century hands on. The book is not perfect (I could have done without that slight anti-Semitic barb at the very end), but is scathingly brilliant and often laught-out-loud hilarious.

Voltaire was a French Enlightment writer. He used wit to make his points. He made fun of the teachings of the Church but he was pushing for religious freedom. He had strong opinions and the book was a tool to presenting his thoughts. The book is considered to be one of the most significant works of Western Canon due to its portrayal of the human condition.The story is intended to satirize the idea of optimism. The approach was developed in the events of a trip. The events of the trip allow him to interchange the tragedy and the comedy within the various situations that occurred. This is a unique approach but it allowed him to develop a look at good and evil as well as the role of God and Government in men's lives. The satirical approach allowed him cover to focus his criticism.A simple story. Young man leaves his home but really he has to leave having been caught kissing the wrong person. Sill optimistic he joins the army. He is flogged. Later almost burned alive. He sets out to see the world but continues to believe, as he was taught early in his life, that he is indeed living in the \\"best of all possible worlds\\". It seems as though nothing goes well. One tragedy after another. Funny but sad. Then after what seems to be an endless ordeal he returns and settles for life in a garden. Even so, still optimistic perhaps, he says that \\"we must cultivate our garden\\".His book and his story challenge the idea that \\"all is for the best\\" in a world where it is often assumed that things \\"work out for the best\\"."},{"Title":"Candide","review":"Everytime Somerset Maugham set out to write a novel etc. he reread Voltaire's Candide. For elucidity, a must."},{"Title":"Candide","review":"Right on, Voltaire. I couldn't believe how readable and relevant this book was more than two hundred years after it was written. Apparently, it's aged very well."},{"Title":"Candide","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed reading Voltaire's Candide. Voltaire's use of satire and irony creates timeless humor that can be appreciated by many readers. Candide, Voltaire's protagonist, is not necessarily a character with whom readers would relate. Like most of the characters in the novel, Candide is a caricature, an exaggeration of optimism, ignorance, and nave views. Voltaire proves through his novel that sometimes the best way to make a lasting effect on one's audience is to show something in its most blatant form. Voltaire's sarcasm and ridicule of a particular party or stereotype can seem a bit harsh at times. However, I think that Voltaire felt the combination of humor and tough criticism was the best way to bring to light his own disgust with hypocrisy within the church and government. The situations and conflicts that Voltaire places his characters in produce surprising illustrations of issues of the 1700's, such as war, poverty, and prostitution. Although this novel was written nearly 250 years ago, striking parallels can be drawn between the issues that Voltaire comments on and the issues that authors of our time choose to focus on in their literature."},{"Title":"Candide","review":"I had to read this book for my world literature class, and was absolutely blown away. Voltaire's satarical tone on philosophical optimism and organized religion in the Enlightenment era leaves you laughing for days. I don't recommend this book to light readers. It can be very in-depth, and somewhat insulting. Definitely one of the best books I have ever read, though."},{"Title":"Candide","review":"&quot;Candide&quot; by Voltaire is probably the best non-fiction work that I've read in a long time. It serves as a satirical introduction the philosophical problem of evil and as an attack on the philosophy of optimism, which is still adhered to today, although perhaps not like in Voltaire's time.Voltaire eviscerates everyone's sacred cows. He satarizes everything. Nothing is not reduced to rubble by his vitriolic writing. In &quot;Candide&quot; Voltaire intelligently satarizes: Christians, Jews, Muslims, war, authority, religious intolerance and bigotry, free will, determinism, the Bible, priests, imams, monks, France, the Papacy, the Inquisition, the Catholic Church, the Protestants, the Jesuits, the Spaniards, the English, Frederick the Great, Gottfried Wilhelm Leibnitz, the so-called morals of religious figures, as well as optimism, and pessimism.There is no work of fiction that has a better grounding in fact than &quot;Candide.&quot; And the final statement of the book, that we must cultivate our garden, is the most universal task put to mankind. It serves as an answer to evil, and as an indictment: Life is a garden, your life is your own garden, YOU must cultivate it in order to reap its benefits. Thus, Voltaire ends his razing of life by endowing it with purpose and meaning.This book is a great adventure in philosophy, satire, religion, and life. It is an easy read, although it can spawn discussions and questions bound to confound almost any theologian. Too bad I can only give it five stars."},{"Title":"Candide","review":"Much as in The Autocrat at the Breakfast Table, in which ideas are thrown around under the premise of a breakfast room table conversation, Voltaire expresses his philosophical insights by having his character (Candide) engage himself in a number of conversations with a wide range of people. The book is intriguing and is filled with excellent topics for conversation."},{"Title":"Candide","review":"Votaire does an excellent job in showing the political and social beliefs of his time. But in order for one to experience the satire involved in the book, one needs to look at the time at which the book was read, and take in some other readings by Voltaire. To clarify one person's statement that Voltaire did not develop the character's or show the reader his (Candide's) travels, it was simply because he had no time. Candide was written under 48 hours by Voltaire and he was slightly angry when he wrote it (the night before he started, he had been jailed by the government and retaliated by writing a satire)."},{"Title":"Candide","review":"Writen hundreds of years ago it's just as true today as when Voltaire wrote it.

Having toiled through many long, hard books troughout the year, this hilarious, SHORT, easy-to-read book was a relief!

Although it is not the best book I've ever read, I definitely recommend it."},{"Title":"Candide","review":"Comedy or tragedy? Which makes for better literature? How about both? In fact, many of the greatest works of literature are both comedies and tragedies. Candide is probably the greatest example of such a work from a French author. Penned under a pseudonym by the great thinker, Voltaire, this work is superficially an adventure novel about the title character traveling the known world to find his love, while accompanied by Pangloss. In reality, the book is a parody of human society, culture, philosophy, and mentality. The result is a short, witty and insightful examination of the human condition. The textual level is appropriate for anyone at the high school level, but is great reading for anyone at any reading level.All in all, one of the best works in young adult literature."},{"Title":"Candide","review":"I have owned this book for quite awhile but put off reading it, fearing that it would be dull and scholarly. I was in for a wonderful surprise. His philosophy makes a lot of sense and he puts it forth in a simple story accessible to almost everyone. Many, many times I laughed out loud. It was fun as well as enlightening. The term \\"sixes and sevens\\" was used; what is the etymology of that expression? The violence is expressed in an absurd way, though we know awful things did and do happen."},{"Title":"Candide","review":"The antiquity of this shines through like stained glass.

Is everything that happens in this world for the best? This is the main philosophical question addressed in this book, and Candide will try to prove you that."},{"Title":"Candide","review":"This book has two things which good book needs: first, it's a work of extremely talanted man, second, it's a book of a person with which you'll never agree. Voltaire was one who talked about bad taste of Shakespeare, but his taste is really extremely bad. When you begin to read this book, you think it to be a work of honest man, but in the middle of it you see that he was just a tricky politician. But it all just adds fun to the reading."},{"Title":"Candide","review":"Candide may have been something in its day, but as a modern reader only marginally versed/interested in 18th century France, I found reading it to be rather dull. (Before I get comments about how I'm stupid, I would like to point out that although I sometimes like to read classics for fun, my career and focus has always been in the sciences)Like other satires I've read, Candide seemed heavy-handed and flat. The philosophy of optimism is silly! Absurd things happen! Cue another character who only stands for symbols and has no real personality!This is why I don't read satire very often.I gave this two stars rather than one because I recognize that one may potentially get a chuckle out of the some of the ridiculous situations, and that someone more well acquainted with the particular philosophies may find Voltaire's criticism more entertaining. And it only took one day to read, which I suppose is a mark in its favor as well."},{"Title":"Candide","review":"Voltaire's short 1759 lampoon of the fashionable feel-good philosophies then making the rounds of Europe continues to bring a smile. It's not a literary masterpiece, but a quick and funny satire. In style, it reads something like Swift's &quot;Gulliver's Travels&quot;, but its humor is more pointed and its satire more trenchant.Candide is an illegitimate boy expelled from his adoptive home for kissing the Baron's daughter. A simple and candid man, he resolutely adheres to his tutor's absurd theory that &quot;all is for the best&quot;. In coming years, Candide and everyone he meets suffer tortures, rapes, slavery, and death. Yet Candide remains ever the silly optimist, chasing the Baron's daughter around the world and giving Voltaire space to vent against the happy feel-good philosophers with their buzzwords, tautological reasoning, and empty aphorisms. The tutor, for example, demonstrates the &quot;necessity&quot; of syphillus, as having brought chocolate to Europe though &quot;it is to be observed that this malady is, like religious controversy, peculiar to our continent&quot;.Candide is a quick satire, silly and contrived, but we can read it with pleasure 250 later, long after the targets of Voltaire's wit have faded away."},{"Title":"Candide","review":"i should start by saying that i like voltaire very much but can't understand how this work has come to overshadow his &quot;alphabet of wit&quot;. if u can get a hold of this little book it will be well worth your time. far more amusing and intelligible than candide. voltaire could be a very funny man and there really wasn't a lot of humour in candide. i thought candide was a bit boring at times. also, he did NOT demolish the argument that this is the best of all possible worlds. with matter there are limitaions and the arguments are complex. this book deals with none of them. but i still adore voltaire."},{"Title":"Candide","review":"My personal opinion of the genre of \`fables' is that unless one is intimately familiar with the author's biography and is sufficiently versed in history, books like \`Don Quixote', \`The Alchemist', or \`Candide' should only be read before bedtime and to an audience of no older than 12 years of age.Like any other fable, \`Candide' raises a few of the basic questions of life: wealth, the issues of free will, religion, optimism in the hardest of times, metaphysics of life and of course - love. Expect that a lot is hidden behind the names of the numerous characters introduced by Voltaire. Some of the examples the author uses do not sit well with me - take the one with the raping Bulgarian warriors and their king (by the time the book was written, Bulgaria was into its 400th year of Ottoman slavery without any kings or queens).At times the book drags, especially with Candide's endless voyages, or recounts of seemingly impossible stories.I would've rather reread \`The Stranger' by Camus than read this one in the first place.- by Simon Cleveland"},{"Title":"Candide","review":"Yes, this is a rereading of a book for school, but like most books, I got more out of it on a second reading. I love this short novel of a young man's journey through the world of sin, evil, and darkness to test preconceived theological and philosophical notions that this world is the \\"best of all possible worlds.\\"Candide is Voltaire's indictment on an active, benevolent God, but he ignores the important fact that without an absolute standard of what is good, how can we call anything evil? Why are all the wars, rapes, thieving, murder, and vengeance Candide experiences considered evil if there is no measuring stick to define it against an absolute good? In the words of C. S. Lewis, how can we call a line crooked without any notion of a straight line? Contrary to Voltaire's findings, the evil and wickedness in Candide's world point to absolutes of goodness, fairness, and honesty. If there is no God in this world, how does the atheist explain the evil? To what standard can he call rape and murder wrong if there is no ultimate goodness?"},{"Title":"Candide","review":"\\"When all is said and done, there is a sterling goodness in unsophisticated Nature; for instead of eating me, these people behaved most politely as soon as they learnt I was not a Jesuit.\\" Voltaire's protagonist Candide is certainly a character who withstood anything the world and mankind could throw at him and remarkably kept his spirit of optimism.Voltaire's satire - my first experience with anything Voltaire - was a quick and fairly easy read, and a rewarding experience to have acquainted myself with this literary work. Aside from the repeated tragedy experienced by Candide and his various travelling companions, one thing that struck me was how a satire written over 250 years ago still plays so well in today's world. It poked fun at a myriad of different societal aspects from Voltaire's time (mid-1700s): religious philosophies, man's penchant for power/riches/violence/domination, politics, and much more. Given that the satire seems just as relevant in 2011 as it was in Voltaire's time is a testament to me that there's creedence to the ol' saying \\"the more things change, the more they stay the same.\\"As for whether the Penguin edition of the story is any good or is an injustice to the original, I can't offer an opinion as I have no idea how the original reads or its literary style."},{"Title":"Candide","review":"This is my first attempt at Classic Literature, and I have to say that this one was very interesting, very well thought out, and dowright good.

Too bad it wasn't required reading when I was in high school."},{"Title":"Candide","review":"Before you read Candide, you must place yourself in XVII Century France; a time with no middle class, where most diseases are deadly, where the smallest dispute would be solved in a duel, and where making fun of the monarchy could get you hanged or at the very least, flogged. Are you there yet? If so, poor you. But to enlighten your mood, grab a copy of Candide and I guarantee it will put a smile on your face.Candide is a young, naive man who lives in the lap of luxury under the mentorship of Pangloss, an optimist philosopher who believes that everything that happens, no matter how bad, is always and without fail for the very best. The premise of Voltaire's story is simple. Optimism is absurd. And the lovely, but yet horrible life of Candide is the tool he uses to prove it.Most people attribute the literary genre of magical realism to Colombian author Gabriel Garcia Marquez and his novel \\"100 Years of Solitude\\", but that would be like saying that Christianity precedes the birth of Christ. Voltaire's \\"Candide or, the Optimist\\" is THE blueprint of magical realism and even satire.We follow Candide in his lifelong battle to be with his one and only love, Cunegonde, through a multitude of adventures full of misfortunes, unsurmountable obstacles, improbable situations, and downright silliness; all of which happens while he struggles to understand how so much misery can indeed be \\"for the very best\\". His travels take him through places like Germany, France, Portugal, and even Paraguay. It may sound crazy, but in the world of Candide, it all fits into place.There are so many politically incorrect and deliciously crafted remarks that at the time, would have been considered downright blasphemous. It's hilarious. Chapter 25 is a perfect example of this. Candide and a companion visit Lord Pococurante, a noble Venetian, at his breathtaking palace. Candide is impressed by the cultural collection of art and literary works he owns, but yet, Lord Pococurante is disgusted by it! When describing a Raphael painting, the senator explains that \\"the colours are too dark, the figures are not sufficiently rounded, nor in good relief, and the draperies in no way resemble stuffs.\\" Then, while they waited for dinner, the musicians played a tune and Candide found it delicious.\\"This noise,\\" said the Senator, \\"may amuse one for half an hour; but if it were to last longer it would grow tiresome to everybody, though they durst not own it. Music, today, is only the art of executing difficult things, and that which is only difficult cannot please long. Perhaps I should be fonder of the opera if they had not found the secret of making of it a monster which shocks me. Let who will go to see bad tragedies set to music, where the scenes are contrived for no other end than to introduce two or three songs ridiculously out of place, to show off an actress's voice. Let who will, or who can, die away with pleasure at the sight of an eunuch quavering the role of Caesar, or of Cato, and strutting awkwardly upon the stage.\\"After dinner they went into the library. Candide, seeing a Homer magnificently bound, commended the virtuoso on his good taste. To which he replied:\\"They used at one time to make me believe that I took a pleasure in reading him. But that continual repetition of battles, so extremely like one another; those gods that are always active without doing anything decisive; that Helen who is the cause of the war, and who yet scarcely appears in the piece; that Troy, so long besieged without being taken; all these together caused me great weariness. I have sometimes asked learned men whether they were not as weary as I of that work. Those who were sincere have owned to me that the poem made them fall asleep; yet it was necessary to have it in their library as a monument of antiquity, or like those rusty medals which are no longer of use in commerce.\\"Is this not brilliant? Forgive me for quoting so much in this review, but it's all so good that it'd be a shame not to share more!When confronted about Cicero's works, the senator said: \\"When I found that he doubted of everything, I concluded that I knew as much as he, and that I had no need of a guide to learn ignorance.\\"Reading this, most of us in modern times who have actually read such works cannot avoid screaming, \\"FINALLY, SOMEONE SAID IT!\\" If today, admitting such opinions around so-called intellectuals can be enough reason to earn ban in cultural society, imagine how devastating it would have been BACK THEN.Pococurante then concluded his argument saying that \\"fools admire everything in an author of reputation. For my part, I read only to please myself. I like only that which serves my purpose.\\"We are seriously considering making this the new motto of The Book Maniac.Some believe that long books can only be the work of great authors, but in reality, if an author is really great, he will be able to convey his message and leave a long-lasting memory of his work without wasting a single word. \\"Candide or, the Optimist\\", an all-time masterpiece, is less than 100 pages and our unanimous opinion was that this is the literary work with the richest and most exquisite use of language we have ever read. Considering we read the English translation, we can only imagine how incredible the French version must be.This was a review of the PDF belonging to the Electronic Classics Series by the Pennsylvania State University.

The only thing left is \`cultivate our garden.'This is a cowardly, selfish non-solution, to use Voltaire's own terms.

At face value, it is an allegorical attack in the belief on progress of its age, but I think it is much more than that. With a plot similar to that of a picaresque novel, it tells the story of Candide, a nave young man taught by Dr. Plangloss (\\"all is for the best in the best of all possible worlds\\") on Leibnizian optimism. Several misfortunes forces him to go on a journey throughout the world (among the lands he travels, very breezily, are his native Germany, Bulgaria, the Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, South America, France, England, Venice and the Ottoman Empire). Through the book, the main purpose of his life is to meet his beloved Cunegonde, a friend of his childhood who seems to have been through as much misfortunes as him. The novel attacks not only the religious intolerance of the day, but European colonialism, and institutions then considered natural by most people, like slavery (when he meets an African slave in the Dutch colony in Surinam, the black man wonders why if the Dutch preachers tell him that all men are brothers, some peoples rule over others). In a Rousseau-like touch, the place most happy to him seems to be a place in South America, where the natives have found a shelter from the European conquistadors, and where gold is considered valueless mud.

It is a very short book, and although I wanted more at the end, it was nice, fresh and held my attention throughout."},{"Title":"Candide","review":"This is a hilarious romp through the 18th century world that Voltaire knew. This book provided him to make fun of the intellectuals of the day (cannibals who only eat Jesuits) the politics of Europe and the social mores of the elite. His characters include the noble Candide who combines his good heart with his reliance of Gilgamesh like helpers in order to succeed. His hero worship for Dr. Pangloss, the Rasputin like philosopher (and later Martin) bailed him out of some situations but perhaps more importantly his lesser, Cacambo saved his life. All of the fantastic adventures that Candide experienced were all designed to reunite him with his true love Cunegonde.Many years later, Upton Sinclair wrote a \\"Candide\\" like, utopian socialist fantasy novel, Metropolis that I was reminded of while reading this novel."},{"Title":"Candide","review":"As a rule I don't recap the plot of books because I don't want to ruin anything for anyone, but for this one I will make a slight exception. Candide is a naive young man who lives in paradise worshiping his one true love, a princess at the castle in which he resides. The cruel world comes in and sends him on a trip of horrors that would make what Job went through seem like a blister. Fast moving, exciting and funny as a great novel can be.This book can be read as a fun tale of misfortune and woe, or it can be read as a deep philosophical tale. Which is why the book is brilliant, it works on many different levels. Actually, it works on every level, which is why I recommend it to everyone who claims that they love to read. The humor is biting and hilarious, which is why it is the greatest satire ever written, even if the object of the satire has long since died.I do want to point out one thing, and it won't ruin the ending, because the ending isn't as important as the journey. Many people see this novel as an unabashed, full on assault on optimism. It isn't. Read the ending again. In the end things work out for the main characters, just not in the way they could have ever imagined in the beginning. I think that this novel deals with the unreal expectations of youth and innocence than it does optimism.

Candide, the young illegitimate nephew of a German baron, is taught by his teacher/philosopher Pangloss that this world is \\"the best of all possible worlds.\\" Candide falls in love with Cunegonde, the baron's young daughter. When their love is discovered, Candide is expelled from his home, and the fun starts. The entire novel is then consumed with tongue-in-cheek melodrama of Candide's worldwide attempt to find and marry Cunegonde, who is, of course, constantly on the move.Early on in the story we realize that the important aspects of Voltaire's novel are not the plot's details but the higher themes: the \\"real-world\\" tragedy which disproves Pangloss' initial optimistic teachings, the hypocrisy of the day's religious theologians, and the inability of money to solve problems. Voltaire's wit shines in his masterpiece, and while this book is not for young children, it does have broad appeal, especially due to its short length."},{"Title":"Candide","review":"I had some hesitation about reading Candide but I found that this book has mirrored my own thoughts on how life is.

Voltaire knew suffering. He had been imprisoned in the Bastille. He meditated on calamities, earthquakes in Lisbon and in Lima. CANDIDE was publshed in 1759. Voltaire emphasizes the resilience of human nature. Finally, there is characterized the uselessness of metaphysical speculation and the value of work.Candid was granted a pardon from the King of the Bulgars because he was a philosopher. He encountered a charitable Anabaptist in Holland. In South America the lovely Cunegonde's, the woman of Candide's dream, brother appeared as a Jesuit. Candide had learned from their tutor Pangloss that he was deceased. The Jesuit Baron became angry with Candide because he wanted to marry his sister and then Candide had to kill him in self-defense. Subsequently Candide's life was spared because he was not a Jesuit. Candide and his servant, Cacambo, traveled to El Dorado. They left to find Cunegonde and ran into a sugar plantation.Candide embarked with an old man, the scholar Martin, for Bordeaux. Candide had the hope of seeing Cunegonde again. Candide went to Paris. He spent an evening gambling, and did not mind his losses, and so was taken as one of the English milords. Candide and Martin, through a series of events, were taken to lower Normandy to save their lives. Their ship went to Portsmouth, England. At length they reached Venice. Candide was reunited with his servant.The party went to Constantinople. First Candide bought Cacambo his freedom.

The group endeavored to work on their small estate."},{"Title":"Candide","review":"Explore into Voltaire's world as you read the piece of literature he wrote to express his opinions and scrutiny of society. Candide is an adventurous novel with a philosophical viewpoint. See society through the eyes of Candide's experiences with all the negative and positive aspects. Candide is a young man who is deeply in love with the baron of Thunder-ten-tronckh's daughter, Cunegonde. Although, the baron and his son will never aprove of their love Candide will always hold her love close to him. Candide is tricked throughout the novel and taken advantage of many times. He lives with the many philosphical points of his teacher, Pangloss. Candide doubts Pangloss' theorys throughout the novel, and decides what his own theory's are by observing people and through his many interactions that he encounters. Candide meets many people that he either rescues from poverty or is being arrested for ridiculous speculations. In the end everything went chaotic for a reason, and Candide finds hisself being the optimist after all."},{"Title":"Candide","review":"I have always been fond of satire. Candide is my second favorite satire of all time.Voltaire with great style and grace attacks the great sacred cow's of his day. Popes, Kings, philosophy's he detests, theater critics, the greedy, and wars are but a few.My favorite line was his description of the inquisition: \\"...for it had been decided at the University of Combra, that the burning of a few people alive, by a slow fire, and with great ceremony, is an infallible secret to hinder the earth from quaking\\"This a brilliant master piece which I strongly recommend to anyone."},{"Title":"Candide","review":"Candide is basically Voltaire's criticism of the idea of optimism. Optimism in the 18th century did not have the same meaning as it does today. Back then, it was the belief that ours is the best of all possible worlds, since it is G-d's world and G-d is perfect. Voltaire takes a naive adherent to this belief and exposes him to the horrors of the world: war, enslavement, theft, rape, heartbreak, etc. Not only does Candide experience these things himself but he hears everyone else bemoaning their situations. Perhaps the crushing blow is when Candide accidentally discovers the paradise of El Dorado, only to willingly leave and face the problems of the real world yet again.I will not reveal how the story ends, but I liked how it turned out. In my opinion, Voltaire does a good job of criticizing optimism, and he isn't afraid to take some more personal cuts at some of his philisophical opponents. The beauty of this story is that Voltaire accomplishes most of it through humor. Undoubtably it would have been funnier to an 18th century reader (I did not understand many of the religious references--and I still don't know what the Jesuits believe in) but I think I got most of the jokes.So, all in all, I give this a 4/5 for a story that still has value today."},{"Title":"Candide","review":"I've read this book three times.

The third time, I'd found it used at the university bookstore, so I finally bought myself a copy (in English, this time). Every time I read it, I find it funnier and more accurate. I've been trying to get my friends to read it, but they look at it warily, obviously thinking &quot;Uh-oh, literature...&quot;"},{"Title":"Candide","review":"One of the most awsome things about Candide is how so much has been crammed into so little. The short, sharp, effortlessly satirical style and wit of the work tends to distract from the scope which the work acheives. Voltaire treats his subject matter in the same way that the young boy treated the Emperor's New Clothes = the ridiculous absurdity of folk pyschology and much that passes under the guise of common sense is ruthlessly exposed for what it is. I loved the anti-clericalism, and whilst the church is such an easy target for the satirist, Voltaire's attack on ill-founded optimism (whether it be philisophical or religious) is a masterful destruction and exposition of the unquestioned acceptance of dubious truths."},{"Title":"Candide","review":"Book is short, funny, insightful, and just stunning.

As a comprehensable, logically structured novel it can be at times confusing.The great thing about \\"Candide\\" is Voltaire treats these characters in a way I feel satire works best. You need characters who are complete cliche, sterotypes of those being mocked. Satire I feel only works when you are without limits. Go overbroad, get crazy, but always remain consistant. Don't get serious on your audience when the first 50 pages did not. It breaks your flow. And Voltaire stays true to that form.In some ways \\"Candide\\" reminds me of the work of Homer. It is a grand epic where one absurb event after another takes place, but sometimes it leaves you scrathing your head wondering, \\"how did we come to this\\"? You can argue Voltaire, in an attempt to pass one by the censors of the day had to make the book seems \\"pointless\\" so the government wouldn't be offened, but, we come to ask ourselves, what side is Voltaire really on?He seemed to be for the enlightment, but Pangloss, who is a symbol for the enlightenment, is presented as such a fool, who repeated says everything happens for the best when nothing is working out. Is Voltaire saying the enlightenment has lost its way? If so, he never really provides a way for it to redeem itself.Many of his attacks on society can still be agrued today, especially his opinion of the government which makes the book a worthwhile read, but the structure of the story and much of the character set-up I found poorly done.In short the novel works well as an example of great social and political satire, but can be improved in story development.** 1\\\\2 out of *****Bottom-line: Voltaire's wit reminds me of Oscar Wilde.

Kurt G&ouml;del, humanity's greatest logician, had it exactly right when he bluntly asked, \\"Who ever became more intelligent by reading Voltaire's writings?\\" People too dense or disinterested to follow Leibniz's deliberations regarding the reciprocal entanglements of possibility, freedom (openness), complexity and contingency--which do not of logical necessity (or even logical implication) have anything whatever to do with Voltaire's pedestrian concept of \\"optimism\\"-- won't have a clue as to what Voltaire is attempting to mock. And they won't be alone. If we suppose that Leibniz was Voltaire's true target, then Voltaire apparently had no clue about that which Voltaire was attempting to mock.All of that may be, if only just slightly, too harsh. Voltaire (Franois-Marie Arouet) doesn't actually claim to even know exactly what Leibniz's philosophical treatment of \`possible worlds' was! While he mocks Leibniz by name, his treatise (if we may call this little catalog of misfortunes a treatise) assails a simple-minded caricature of Leibniz's \`possible worlds,' Voltaire merely batters a clownish straw man. Whatever Voltaire's target or motivation, this is no work of serious philosophy, and yet, so long as you don't irrationally expect anything of epistemological or general philosophical weight, this goofy little romp is modestly entertaining, and more memorable than more complex (and more rigorous) works which, unlike Candide, actually require critical thought. Perhaps one person has attempted Leibniz for every 5,000 that have enjoyed Voltaire's fluffy sarcasms. For every 10,000 that have read Candide, perhaps one has grasped Leibniz's \`possible worlds.' That one knows what a strutting clown Voltaire was. Clowns can be fun, but shouldn't be taken very seriously as teachers of philosophy."},{"Title":"Candide","review":"I did not enjoy this story.

Voltaire's humor, already delivered dryly, is lost to the same culprit, as is his sarcasm. Once stripped of those crucial elements &quot;Candide&quot; reads like the outline of a potentially great tale. But it cannot be considered a story, too much is lacking. 1. The tale is 90% exposition. Rather than showing us dear Candide's many wondrous travels, letting us come along, allowing us to feel the events unfolding, we are summarily told. 2. Though the plot takes many turns, some of them clever, there is no art to the writing. We are simply, and again summarily, hurried from place to place, twist to twist. 3. There is no character development. All we ever know of Candide is that he is naive, that he does not learn from his experience, and that he has some truly horrid luck. There is nothing to make us care about him, or any of the characters. At most we say, \`Oh, that's too bad.' But we say it without feeling or concern. 4. Of the final 10%, nine is dialogue. In this we get our only glimpse of Voltaire's intelligence. But as pleasing as that is to see, it cannot make up for the artless way he placed his words. Each character, regardless of upbringing or social standing, speaks in exactly the same manner as every other character, and I suspect that they all speak in a manner that was exactly as Voltaire may have spoken. The remaining 1% is spent, poorly, on some very minimal scenes. He spends so little time on actual scenes, that it seems he must have considered them a great inconvenience. Voltaire gives us no more than is required, which is wonderful in any descriptive passage, including the setting of any scene, but it's all done just as artlessly as the exposition and dialogue. The ending is good. There is a little moralizing, telling us to look to our own lives, but it's done with subtlety. This is the one place Voltaire's simple style pays off. This book is best suited to those of simple and undeveloped literary minds. Those who know anything about writing or good literature can find many better books, under and outside of the &quot;Classic&quot; umbrella."},{"Title":"Candide","review":"aside from it's ugly ass nauseating cover i liked everything about this book"},{"Title":"Candide","review":"Ever since philosophers began thinking about the meaning of life, a favorite question has been \\"Why do bad things happen to good people?\\". In Voltaire's day, this issue was primarily pursued either from the perspective of faith (everything that happens is God's will and must be for Divine purpose) or of reason (What do these events mean to you, as you interpret them subjectively?). Infuriated by the reaction by some members of the church to a horrible loss of life from an earthquake in Lisbon, Voltaire wrote this hard-biting satire of the human condition to explore these questions.Before reading further, let me share a word of caution. This book is filled with human atrocities of the most gruesome sort. Anything that you can imagine could occur in war, an Inquisition, or during piracy happens in this book. If you find such matters distressing (as many will, and more should), this book will be unpleasant reading. You should find another book to read.The book begins as Candide is raised in the household of a minor noble family in Westphalia, where he is educated by Dr. Pangloss, a student of metaphysical questions. Pangloss believes that this is the best of all possible worlds and deeply ingrains that view into his pupil. Candide is buoyed by that thought as he encounters many setbacks in the course of the book as he travels through many parts of Europe, Turkey, and South America.All is well for Candide until he falls in love with the Baron's daughter and is caught kissing her hand by the Baron. The Baron immediately kicks Candide out of the castle (literally on the backside), and Candide's wanderings begin. Think of this as being like expulsion from the Garden of Eden for Adam. Soon the penniless Candide finds himself in the Bulgarian army, and receiving lots of beatings while he learns to drill.The story grows more far-fetched with each subsequent incident. To the casual reader, this exaggeration can seem unnecessary and annoying. It will remind you of the most extreme parts of Swift in Gulliver's Travels and Rabelais in Gargantua and Pantagruel. But subtly, Voltaire is using the exaggeration to lure the reader into making complacent judgments about complacency itself that Voltaire wants to challenge. The result is a deliciously ironical work that undermines complacency at a more fundamental level than I have seen done elsewhere. Basically, Candide challenges any view you have about complacency that is defined in terms of the world-view of those who are complacent.Significant changes of circumstances (good and ill) occur to all of the members of the Baron's household over the course of the story. Throughout, there is much comparing of who has had the worst luck, with much feeling sorry for oneself.That is the surface story. Voltaire is, however, a master of misdirection. Beneath the surface, Voltaire has another purpose for the book. He also wants to expose the reader to questioning the many bad habits that people have that make matters worse for everyone. The major themes of these undercurrents are (1) competing rather than to cooperating, (2) employing inhumane means to accomplish worldly (and many spiritual) ends, (3) following expected rules of behavior to show one's superiority over others that harm and degrade others, (4) focusing on money and power rather than creating rich human relationships, (5) hypocritical behavior, and (6) pursuing ends that society approves of rather than ends that please oneself.By the end of the story, the focus shifts again to a totally different question: How can humans achieve happiness? Then, you have to reassess what you thought about the book and what was going on in Voltaire's story. Many readers will choose to reread the book to better capture Voltaire's perspective on that final question, having been surprised by it.Candide is one of my favorite books because it treats important philosophical questions in such an unusual way. Such unaccustomed matching of treatment and subject matters leaves an indelible impression that normal philosophical arguments can never match. Voltaire also has an amazing imagination. Few could concoct such a story (even by using illegal substances to stimulate the subconscious mind). I constantly find myself wondering what he will come up with next. The story is so absurd that it penetrates the consciousness at a very fundamental level, almost like doing improvisation. In so doing, Voltaire taps into that feeling of \\"what else can happen?\\" that overcomes us when we are at our most pessimistic. So, gradually you will find yourself identifying with the story -- even though nothing like this could ever happen to you. Like a good horror story, you are also relieved that you can read about others' troubles and can put your own into perspective. This last point is the fundamental humanity of the story. You see what a wonderful thing a kind word, a meal, or a helping hand can be. That will probably inspire you to offer those empathic actions more often.After you have finished Candide, I suggest that you ask yourself where complacency about your life and circumstances is costing you and those you care about the potential for more health, happiness, peace, and prosperity. Then take Voltaire's solution, and look around you for those who enjoy the most of those four wonderful attributes. What do those people think and do differently from you?"},{"Title":"Candide","review":"It is probably fair to say that there is no book that is quite like Voltaire's 'Candide'. This is a venomous satire of the 'Optimistic' philosophy and outlook of enlightenment thinkers such as Leibniz and Alexander Pope. As such, it is served well by the unique combination of repeated brutality and a deft, light touch. If that last comment doesn't make sense, then you'll just have to READ THE BOOK.At a mere 144 pages (in this edition), this is a classic that is a breeze to read. As to the charge that this book is too &quot;violent&quot; or &quot;in bad taste&quot;, I would only ask you to remember that Voltaire was furious that learned members of a &quot;civilized&quot; society (like Leibniz, Pope, and even Rousseau)could claim that the apparent senseless violence and mayhem wrought by disasters, war, disease, man's cruelty, etc. was actually only a part of some 'greater good' - after all, God (being perfect) could not 'logically' created anything but the 'best of all possible' universes.Voltaire's touch is so light and understated that I defy anyone to write anything that contains a third of the violence in 'Candide' and still manages to read as breezily and somehow be genuinely funny.But dark satire must be funny - otherwise it lapses into pedantry.Read it - even if you do not like it, I guarantee you that it will disturb you and make you think.And for that, we can thank Voltaire."},{"Title":"Candide","review":"&quot;All is for the best...in the best of all possible worlds.&quot;Utopia generally conjures up images of beauty, brilliance and harmony. How is it possible to conceive of the violent and brutal happenings in Candide as &quot;the best of all possible worlds?&quot; Our world is clearly not perfect, so isn't it more logical to conclude that all is not for the best? At least not all of the time? Such are the questions raised in Voltaire's timeless masterpiece of satire, Candide.Candide tells the journey of a young man through the world and the realities he must face, deal with and eventually come to be defined by. During his ventures, Candide leaves behind the naive innocence of his childhood and assumes the status of an intelligent and distinguished man.Candide was born and grew up in the castle of the Baron of Thunder-ten-tronckh, in the land of Westphalia in Germany. Soon after his mentor, the philosopher, Dr. Pangloss introduces him to the idea of extreme optimism, Candide's adventures begin as he is banned from the kingdom for kissing the Baron's beautiful daughter, Lady Cunegund.As Candide travels through Germany, Holland, the New World and the remainder of Europe, he encounters trials and evils of every sort--war, hatred, betrayal, starvation, natural catastrophes of all kinds, in short, any and every evil to which man has ever fallen prey.In the course of his travails, however, one thing becomes outstandingly familiar to Candide; the parallels of events that denote the universality of evil.Finally, coming full circle, Candide settles down to cultivate his own garden and make the best of his own possible world.As with most satire, the characters in Candide exist for one unique purpose rather than being fully fleshed out. Dr. Pangloss is the most notable. Pangloss is not present in most of Candide's adventures but he does provide the theme underlying the whole of the book. He serves to sway Candide with his one, unrelenting optimistic outlook on life.The epitome of Pangloss's philosophical outlook, &quot;Everything is for the best,&quot; is assimilated by Candide very early in the story. Being young, sheltered and naive at the time, Candide proceeds to live his life according to this tenet. When faced with a problem he always asks himself what Pangloss would do or say in a similar situation.Candide, however, eventually learns to form his own opinions and concepts and thus the philosophical optimism of Dr. Pangloss is tested and challenged throughout the book.The &quot;Pangloss Effect&quot; is also demonstrated through Candide's experience in El Dorado, Voltaire's fictional utopia. Candide, traveling with Cacambo, his servant, finally discovers El Dorado, the purported &quot;perfect&quot; place. Why would anyone ever want to leave this perfect place, Candide asks himself? His quest had been to prove the theory of optimism of Pangloss and now apparently, he had succeeded. However, all is not what it may seem, even in El Dorado, and Candide is confronted with many ironic and enigmatic questions.As his journeys draw to a close, Candide comes to realize that it is man's almost limitless ability to accept the fate that befalls him and move on to new and better things that allows him to remain sane, happy and productive. In this sense, Candide comes to represent change and development while Pangloss remains the apex of the unchanging and inflexible.While most satire grows stale and dated, Candide remains as fresh as it was when Voltaire wrote it. In the end, as Candide wisely shows us, in the best of all possible worlds, we all tend our gardens as best as we possibly can."},{"Title":"Candide","review":"When Voltaire's Candide was originally published in 1759, it must have really been something. Voltaire's goal, of course, was to satirize the haberdash Liebnizian view holding that everything that happens in this world - the good, the bad, the ugly - is all part of God's omnibenevolent plan, and hence, ultimately, for the good. Thus, by watching young Candide, a boy schooled in this philosophy, endure mindless tragedy upon mindless tragedy while despearetely trying to decipher how each fits into God's all-good plan, we see how ridiculous such a view is.While this everything-is-for-the-best-no-matter-how-bad-it-actually-seems view is not AS active today as it was in Voltaire's 1759, we still see a good bit of it. Witness Pat Robertson and Jerry Falwell telling us that the 9/11 suicide attacks were God's way of punishing us for leftward political activities (as if an all-powerful God couldn't come up with some better way to get a message to us than this). And how many times, in the face of tragedy, do we hear platitudes like \\"It is all ultimately for the best,\\" or, \\"God works in mysterious ways.\\"In a sense, Candide is as biting and prescient now as it must have been in 1759. Of course, Voltaire isn't trying to disprove this Liebnizian idea. Satire can't disprove; that's what philosophic tomes are for. Rather, Voltaire is simply trying to show it's absurdity by allowing us to laugh at it (in the comfort of our own homes, of course). So those looking for an actual debunking of the \\"problem of evil\\" (as it is known in philosophy) should look elsewhere.Another warning: as fiction - purely as fiction - Candide is not a good work at all. It basically consists of the main character going from place to place (searching for his lover) only to encounter one attrocity after another. If one throws out the satire element, then Candide is a rambling, disjointed and drastically inferior Don Quixote. But as satire, the work is innervating and deep."},{"Title":"Candide","review":"Candide is a short and rewarding read. Follow the adventures of Candide, an honest and naive young man who grows up in a baron's household in Germany, on his loss-of-innocence journey. Kicked out of his house after he is caught in a tryst with the baron's daughter, Candide is banished to wander the cruel world. From forced conscription to the Inquisition, Candide sees wonder upon wonder, always holding fast to the teachings of Master Pangloss, his philosophy teacher, that all things (no matter how bad) are right--because they must be so, and picking up new friends on the way.Candide is Voltaire's Swift-like satirical commentary on the society of his day (Europe) and all its dirty laundry--the hypocrisy, greed, cruelty, lecherousness, and demagoguery. Not a single ethnic, political, or religious faction is spared. Voltaire wants Candide, and his reader, to cast off our complacency and irrational optimism, embracing instead demonstrable truths and the responsibility to make things right.In short, Voltaire wants Candide to live up to his name, and maybe it is the most innocent and gullible hero needed to restore the integrity Voltaire saw lacking in the men and women of his day--a new beginning."},{"Title":"Candide","review":"I first read \\"Candide\\" when I was still in HS, around 4 or 5 years ago.

Having some free time while I waited for my next amazon.com book order to arrive, I decided to pick up \\"Candide\\" once again. This time around, my experience was much more enlightening.\\"Candide\\" revolves around the title character, who has had it instilled upon him by Dr. Pangloss, his personal philosopher, that we live in the \\"best of all possible worlds.\\" After seeing Pangloss fooling around with the chambermaid, Candide decided to replicate the acts with the Lady Cunegonde. After being discovered by the Baron, Candide is swiftly kicked (on his rump) out of Westphalia. This sets into motion a long and unbelievable set of events. Candide travels across half the known world in hopes of once again being reunited with Lady Cunegonde. Calamity upon calmity is witnessed by Candide yet he remains steadfast in his belief that everything works out for the best. To fully understand the insanity that marks this book you have to read it for yourself. I would do it an injustice it by saying anything further. I will say that the ending is quite a change of pace from the rest of the book.Although it isn't hard to discern that this story is wholy unrealistic, it is written in such a way that you feel it is somewhat plausible. This might stem from the fact that our society has done a 180 and is composed mainly of cynics and pessimists. Although it was written around 250 years ago, many of the basic issues that Voltaire attacks are still around today. While we don't have the Inquisition murdering people today, religious intolerance is still deep rooted in many humans.There are many reasons I so highly recommend this book. It is a quick read, something you can finish in only a couple hours. It also has several fantastical scenes that will leave you chuckling in disbelief. Finally, it is a good book to see exactly how much our world (at least the Western half) has changed."},{"Title":"Candide","review":"The story of Candide greatly affected the way I perceive occurances on a daily basis. I've always lived with a very optimistic outlook on life, assuming things will always turn out for the best. After reading the tragedies young Candide had to cope with and the way that he handled them, I realized that such a naive approach to life could be very dangerous. The proper amount of optimism is always good because it keeps hopes alive, but being irrationally optimistic in certain circumstances can often result in dire consequences."},{"Title":"Candide","review":"It [optimism] is the obstinacy of maintaining that everything is best when it is worst.\\"With satirical wit and humor, the great French Enlightenment thinker Voltaire espouses his philosophical beliefs in \\"Candide,\\" an 18th century masterpiece. At first, the intent of \\"Candide\\" may be a bit difficult to discern. If you have a mindset that this is a flowery treatise on Enlightenment philosophy, you may be disappointed (or relieved). \\"Candide\\" is neither realistic nor didactic. In fact, one can almost view it as a dark comedy or a biting satire, for most of the circumstances are absurd and far-fetched, to say the least.Although Candide (\\"The Optimist\\") is the protagonist, his teacher Pangloss is the most important character, for Pangloss is a magnificent (or so Candide thinks) philosopher who espouses the eternal optimistic view - no matter what evil befalls humankind, it is part of a perfect master plan. Indeed, this is the \\"best of all worlds\\". Despite being stricken with syphilis, hanged, nearly dissected, enslaved, losing an arm, ear and nose, burned and drowned, he maintains this worldview until his last dying breath. As a foil to Pangloss, Martin is an eternal pessimist. Yet, while this worldview may be more pragramtic in an imperfect world, it nevertheless discounts true good in the world and can also be a hindrance. Indeed, Voltaire criticizes both extreme optimism and extreme pessimism.\\"Candide\\" is Voltaire's forum for exposing the hypocrisy and brutality of the world he lived in. Voltaire bashes Catholicism by repeated references to gay clergy and the illegitimate child of the Pope. Voltaire shows disdain for Protesant zealots by illustrating the contemptible treatment of Candide when he expresses doubt that the Pope is the devil. Voltaire ridicules the aristocracy with the character of Cunengard's brother, a homosexual German baron. Voltaire ridicules the monarchy by virtue of six deposed kings bemoaning their fates in a village inn. Voltaire satirizes do-nothing philosophers through Pangloss and Martin. Voltaire rips Islam through the sultans and princes of Turkey. Anyway, you get the picture. Even the relatively progressive country of England is not immune to Voltaire's criticism.Another myth that Voltaire dispels is the Utopian ideal, embodied in the mythical city of El Dorado in South America. In this city, there is no religion, prisons, or crimes. The roads are paved with gold and diamonds and even the most destitute denizen lives a carefree, fulfilling life. There is no need for money, despite the land's innumerable riches. Yet, this utopia is nearly inaccessible to the outside world, as Candide stumbles upon it by a freak of nature. Although this utopia is perfect, no one will ever reach it again. In this way, Voltaire seems to imply that the pursuit of a utopia on earth is a fruitless endeavor.So what exactly is Voltaire's worldview? Through Zenoida, a desposed Danish noblewoman, Voltaire expresses his philosophies. Although we are all children of Providence, we are not exempt from sorrow, misery, and grievous atrocities, for life is a conglomeration of both pain and pleasure. The best one can do is to better the community one lives in and to follow one's conscience. Idleness and philosophizing without action is a useless endeavor.\\"Wait a minute - who the #@%! is Zenoida and since when was Pangloss burned and drowned. I've read the entire book and there's no reference to either.\\" Ah, yes, most novels only present Part I of \\"Candide,\\" where our merry adventurers our left to live out a fulfulling life on a modest farm in Turkey. But there's more to this story. Do yourself a favor and download Part II of Candide, easily obtainable on the internet through a free literature site, such as the Gutenberg Project. In Part II, Voltaire presents a tidy conclusion for Candide and his companions, while providing more items for contemplation. Honestly, I found Part II (which is shorter than Part I) a more enjoyable read."},{"Title":"Candide","review":"Candide, which is subtitled Optimism, was written in 1759, and is proof that a sharp wit and biting satire was just as much appreciated in Voltaire's time, as it is today.Candide is the life story of a fictional character named Candide. He is a naive, innocent, and optimistic sort of person. If you ever feel that life has treated you unfairly, then you have nothing to complain about if you compare yourself to poor Candide. Just about everything bad imaginable happens to him during the course of his life. Fortunately, at least Voltaire leaves him still alive at the end of the book.Although the book is funny and fast paced (my copy has 115 pages), it can best be appreciated by recognizing the author's intention. Candide is Voltaire's commentary on the church's prevailing philosophy at the time.In Voltaire's time, the church preached that because God is perfect, he would only create the best of all possible worlds. To create a lesser world would imply that God was less than perfect. I don't believe Voltaire's argument was against this philosophy per se, but rather against the way it was used to justify all the evil found in the world.The &quot;best of all possible worlds&quot; proponents used the argument to justify all bad things as a necessary part of the world and so bad things should be accepted as just another part of life. However, Voltaire's philosophy was that &quot;we must cultivate our gardens&quot;, i.e., help the good to grow while pulling out the weeds. Greed, lust, vice, etc., were not necessary in Voltaire's opinion and we should make every attempt to ward off such evils rather than merely accept them.The &quot;best of all possible worlds&quot; philosophy is exemplified in the book by Candide's teacher, Dr. Pangloss (a footnote says that Pangloss means &quot;all-tongue&quot;). Pangloss teaches Candide this philosophy and Candide tries to use it throughout the book to justify the bad things that happen to him. Voltaire uses this approach to ridicule proponents of the &quot;best of all possible worlds&quot; argument for why evil things happen, and takes us on an exciting and funny adventure in the process.Candide is certainly one of the best books you could ever read. After all, there must be some reason the book is still popular today and has even been made into musical plays.

This is by far the worst english translation I've come across.

Penguin Classics are always my favorite choice, not only because they do a good job in selecting translators and supplementary materials, but also b/c the paper smells so good."},{"Title":"Candide","review":"A brilliant member of what historians have deemed the philosophes, Voltaire's views on government and church are comical at worst. Voltaire's Candide is clearly a stab at the church of his time, a church unwilling to accept what are now basic scientific truths such as the earth orbiting the sun (and not the other way around). The church is painted in a less than flatering light, seeing as a few characters in Candide include the daughter of the pope, a monk with a favorite prostitute, and an Inquisitor with an illegitamate lover. Characters such as Doctor Pangloss display brilliantly the ancient thought, painting it (perhaps a bit too exaggerated)in a way nearly blind to the real world. Pangloss's views of all things happening &quot;for the best of all possible worlds&quot; is clearly defied in the story which is in essence a collection of horrific stories painted in a comical array of words. The innate sarcasm in the book pokes a great deal of fun at the thinking of the times, and yet Candide's views are applicable today. Truly an entertaining and intellectually stimulating book, Candide is one of the greatest works of its time."},{"Title":"Candide","review":"Voltaire has a knack for satire. Candide is an excellent example. If you are familiar with the philosophy of Leibniz, you will find this book somewhat philosophical.

I particularly enjoyed the part with the eunich and the old woman."},{"Title":"Candide","review":"As one who prefers light reading, I decided to challenge myself with the highly philosophical Candide, whose slim appearance seemed to promise a quick read. Reader beware: this amazing novel takes you on a journey of thought and rationalizing- you will find yourself reading a page several times for its meaning or becoming lost in long intervals of thought! (Principally, you will ask yourself, &quot;Is there always a good side to everything, or are we trapped in a naturalistic world?&quot;) Candide, therefore, is an excellent book for discussion and debate, for it allows the reader to interpret one author's words and theories in so many ways."},{"Title":"Candide","review":"For the most part I thoroughly enjoyed Candide. I found the chapter titles most humorous. The plot itself is a bit lacking. Basically Candide just travels places and gets robbed or beaten all for his love, Cunegone. His adventures, though, are a hilarious journey through the 18th Century world in which he meets many people with different views of the world and beyond. During almost his entire adventure Candide keeps a good outlook on things which may have been the very thing that kept him going."},{"Title":"Candide","review":"CANDIDE is a biting satire which engages readers of all ages:young readers may appreciate its wondrous adventures, most notably theland of Eldorado, a place of sparkling gold and silver, of games and stones, where society is flawless: equal, crime-free, loving, and safe. Likewise, adult readers will adore the exciting travels, as well as the sexuality and ridiculous situations. However, it is the underlying point that causes the most amusement because of its stab at a certain philosophy: optimism. Voltaire calls it &quot;the mania for insisting that everything is all right when everything is going wrong.&quot; Optimists espouse that all the pain, disaster, and suffering in this world is all part of a big plan which results in the ultimate bliss. Voltaire pokes at that thought in a manner which is both entertaining and entirely witty.---Karen Choy"},{"Title":"Candide","review":"Candide is a book for people who enjoy reading philosophy books. It is also entertaining for other people to. It is a short book and will not take a person any great time to read Candide if he want to. Candide goes many places and meets many people, but everyone seems or is miserable. Near the end he becomes unhappy to, for people either live in dispair or with boredom. All you need is a &quot;garden&quot; to keep your minds off of boredom and dispair. Voltaire might be daed but his books live on though the centuries"},{"Title":"Candide","review":"This book's eponymous protagonist is a naive young man who was taught by his teacher, the philosopher Pangloss, that ours is the best possible world and that everything in it always happens for the best. According to Pangloss, misfortunes only ever visit us because they contribute in some way to the general good and \\"the more private misfortunes there are, the more general good\\" there is. Pangloss also dusts off the old chestnuts that all men were created equal and that all property should belong to everyone. Voltaire wrote this novella mainly to refute these ideas, which he attributed to Gottfried Leibniz.It was hard for me to get excited about this book-length refutation because I don't know anyone who believes that everything in our world always occurs \\"for the best\\". Most of us are aware of people who think that private property is evil and that all men were created equal, but unfortunately, those are not the parts of Pangloss's thought that Voltaire spends most of his time refuting. He simply has Candide go through a long series of fantastically cruel misadventures, all just to prove to him that life isn't a piece of cake after all.At one point in the novella a character named \\"the wise man of taste\\" (oh, the subtlety!) holds forth on literature. Among other things he says that a good writer should always strive for newness without being bizarre. Voltaire clearly failed his own test here - all of \\"Candide\\" is bizarre.While pretty violent, this book is not at all depressing. This is mostly because Voltaire seems completely uninterested in his characters' inner lives. I can't imagine what a movie based on \\"Candide\\" would look like, in large part because a cartoon would be far more appropriate for it. After being hanged, raped and pierced with swords, the characters invariably dust themselves off to cheerfully continue their arguments about Leibniz's ideas. Their emotional responses to being hanged and raped aren't any more realistic or thought-provoking than the physical ones.Voltaire made his naive, honest, idealistic protagonist German. After two and a half centuries that stereotype hasn't really changed. Another one has though: in Voltaire's imagination Germany seems to have been a wild, provincial country situated on the far outskirts of civilization. In the 18th century his native France was still the cool kid of nations - a dynamic trend-setter, envied by everybody with a clue. Northern Italy had held that place during the Renaissance, but by Voltaire's time it was already considered a decadent has-been. Voltaire dramatized that feeling here through the character of the Venetian aristocrat Pococurante, who has seen everything and is tired of everything. The cycle that takes some societies from provincialism to leadership and then, almost invariably, to decline is, of course, fascinating. A century after Voltaire's death it was France's turn to become a symbol of decadence in the world's imagination, and Germany's turn to start setting the trends. Then, in the late 20th century, Germany itself joined the rest of Western Europe in the declinist camp, while America and Russia tried their hands at leading.In his time Voltaire was a notorious liberal, and consequently a very fashionable guy to know. But times change - so much so that some of the stuff in this book would probably get him thrown in jail as a Nazi in modern France. For example: \\"The northern nations have not that heat in their blood, nor that raging lust for women, so common in Africa.\\" Or this, from one female character's description of how she was raped by a pirate: \\"He was an abominable negro, and yet believed that he did me a great deal of honor\\". And this is how the same woman explains the pirates' attraction to her and to her European companions: \\"...our maids of honor, and even our waiting women, had more charms than are to be found in all Africa...\\" In a different chapter he describes women from an Indian tribe in Paraguay being amorous with apes, incorrectly stating that such unions are capable of producing offspring.Through the character of Pococurante Voltaire dismisses all scientists and their work as utterly useless: \\"...if only one of those rakers of rubbish had shown how to make pins; but in all these volumes there is nothing but chimerical systems, and not a single useful thing.\\" It's fun to note here that Voltaire belonged to the last generation of Europeans who could have honestly made that claim. He died in 1778, just as the Industrial Revolution was starting up in England.Another interesting thing in the Pococurante episode is that it contains a short review of what people of Voltaire's age considered great literature. Most of the authors mentioned were unsurprisingly Greek and Roman. Only one English writer is discussed and it is Milton, not Shakespeare. In 1759, when \\"Candide\\" was first published, Shakespeare hadn't become super-important yet.Voltaire spends a lot of time decrying the horrors of war here. Actually, I've never thought of the first three quarters of the 18th century as having been particularly violent. It is only with the French Revolution, many of whose leaders were inspired by Voltaire, that the quaint little wars and cartoonish despotisms of his age gave way to the megawars and megadespotisms of the Jacobin and Napoleonic types.Voltaire, a staunch enemy of organized religion, included an auto-da-fe scene here as an example of how violent his clerical foes could be. Of course, the Revolution and its copycats across Europe ended up killing a lot more people than the Inquisition ever could, with most of the Revolutionaries being as anti-clerical as Voltaire. It's important to state here, however, that unlike many modern European critics of Christianity, Voltaire was a consistent secularist - his attitudes towards Islam and Judaism were often negative as well.As a contrast to the crumminess of the real world, Voltaire included in this book a description of a utopia called Eldorado. Like everything else in \\"Candide\\", this utopia is painted in pretty broad, cartoonish brushstrokes, but I'd like to single out one of its aspects nevertheless.Eldorado is apparently devoid of war, crime and all other forms of human conflict. Let's disregard for a moment the fact that no such society has ever existed. Let's just ask if such a society COULD ever arise, and if it could, what would be the long-term consequences?I believe that man, like all other animals, is a product of evolution. The competition for survival, essential to evolution, takes many forms, most of them involving conflict in some way. Regardless of whether or not they want to admit it, most people enjoy conflict. I know that Voltaire did because I've just finished a book of his that joyfully attacks the church, Leibniz, a bunch of now-obscure Parisian writers who happened to be his professional rivals and lots of other people besides. If a society was somehow forced, against its will, to abandon all forms of conflict, what would become of that society long-term? Voltaire died long before the rise of political correctness, so he must have been aware of the correct answer to that question, yet he described his utopia as being devoid of conflict anyway. It is no excuse at all to say here that he couldn't have been aware of the theory of evolution as such. The 18th century was obsessed with the idea of breeding, both human and animal, so he must have known how that system worked even if he wouldn't have used modern terms to describe it.To me the most likely explanation for the Eldorado episode, as for much else in \\"Candide\\", is simple intellectual sloppiness."},{"Title":"Candide","review":"This book was moderately entertaining from a fictional standpoint. However, maybe I am shallow, but I did not see the philosophical genius which is frequently exalted in this work. I felt the conclusion was a great let down after all of the events that led up to it.

I was surprised in how funny and crazy this novel was. The chaotic events that take place, which continuously contradict Dr. Pangloss's notion that \\"all is for the best in the world,\\" meaning that the world is perfect because God made it, and the evils that take place upon the world are all part of a cosmic plan. But apparently, as we all know more than ever today, is that the world isn't perfect, and that we do have free will to prevent some things from happening. For such a short book, Voltaire portrays society, government, social classes, etc. very well into a very comical and sometimes appalling satire. I was very impressed, i look foreward to reading this again and again in the future. It's very entertaining, full of wit, exciting, and will make you laugh, make you shudder, and at the end, make you think. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Candide","review":"Like any story that is written in an allegorical style, it serves the reader well to investigate the story of the writer as a person before trying to understanding the motivations of the person as a writer. (Clarence Darrow's short, unofficial biography is an excellent reference.) Suffice to say that any philosophy that can be applied and re-applied through history must be treated as relevant. Candide's story, a quest to be reunited with a woman who represents an idea more than a person, of human suffering, of enduring injustice, and of noble intention twisted to serve the basest defects of human character, could evoke similarities in a modern setting as easily as it was applied to the brutish realities of the 1700s. Read this story. Better yet, read several of Voltaire's stories (Zadig or Fate, Princess of Babylon, The White Bull, etc.,). Monsieur Voltaire was a hero to not only many of his French brothers and sisters, but was inspirational to several rebellious British subjects in the \\"New World\\", most notably Ben Franklin and Thomas Jefferson. The Age of Enlightenment owes perhaps more to this man and his spirit of personal freedoms, independent thought, and libertarian dogma, than any other thinker of his time."},{"Title":"Candide","review":"I'm not usually predisposed to the classics, but this is one I'd been meaning to read for quite a while, and it is relatively short.

Candide, albeit a short work, emanates incredible power. When first printed, Candide subsequently was banned by Louis XV for fear of rousing the proletariat. Upon reading Candide, one can, without doubt, ascertain why. Voltaire stresses resilience, realism, and an eschewal of blithe trust and optimism.For a short work, Candide provides more outrageously absurd events than one would deem possible. Voltaire's unremitting penchant for humorous and farcical satire makes this book an absolute necessity to read for anyone who possesses a keen mind and is up to the challenge of profound literature."},{"Title":"Candide","review":"Complete shock with mix of giggle and 3rd eye opened with depth of meaning.

How possible it is to challenge blind optimism and yet not wallow in complete despair and self-pity. Above all, I found it to be a very accessible work of philosophy. Ahem.

I found this book a very tedious and I did not enjoy the wild plot as Candide and his fellow friends travelled all across the world, never to escape sorrows. If you are reading it for surface content and plot I'm afraid you will be sorely disapointed.

It's set in the eighteenth century and deals with all the tragedies of it's time. Voltaire touches base with many historical accounts including the earthquakes of Lima and Lisbon.

Peer Gynt first appears to me as this self-centered youth who cares only for himself and the satisfaction of his impulses and whims at any cost. He is the quick non-thinker, who leaves a life of relative conventionality to roam as a dissolute wanderer. He is indeed all of these things, but all the while his &quot;self&quot; is not &quot;centered&quot;. At the end of his adventures as a libertine, the grey-bearded Peer Gynt is at a cross-roads, and he asks the character of the Button Moulder this question: &quot;What, after all, is this being one's self?&quot; The Button Moulder replies that being one's self means slaying one's Self, and furthermore &quot;observing the Master's intentions in all things.&quot; Peer Gynt contemplates this... restraint and delayed gratification have never been manageable themes with him. In my opinion, this whole idea of the search for the &quot;self&quot; is what Peer Gynt is all about. At the very final crossroads he is redeemed by the undeserved forgiveness and love of Solvieg, the woman he has once abandoned... this scene being a beautiful picture of the grace and love of God that is available to the Peer Gynt in every reader.Ibsen originally wrote Peer Gynt as a poem, and therefore we lose the Norwegian rhyme and metre in any English translation. To compensate if at all possible, I suggest reading the play while listening to the incidental music of Edvard Grieg, specifically composed to accompany the live performance of Peer Gynt.

The play doesn't have much of a plot exactly. It starts of in a Norwegian village where Peer is a buffoonish character. He leaves the village, meets up with Trolls, gets in a shipwreck, wanders around the desert, and runs into the button moulder. All of this just happens, disconnectedly. He spends time in America also, but we aren't shown that.There is a lot of talk about being your self, being authentic, etc. If the play has a theme, I am guessing that's it.It's completely different from Ibsen's realistic works like An Enemy of the People or The Wild Duck. I'm more a fan of those works. Peer Gynt didn't really speak to me.On a side note, in the movie Educating Rita, with Michael Caine, Rita takes a test where one of the questions was 'What are some of the difficulties in staging Peer Gynt?' A: It's long. It's not in prose. It has trolls and other fantastical creatures. It has a huge cast many of whom are only on stage very briefly. The main character goes from being a youth to a very old man. The settings vary from a Norwegian village to Egypt and the Sphinx. This is why it's rarely done on stage."},{"Title":"Peer Gynt,","review":"Based on traditional Nordic legend Ibsen's version would make a better narrative than verse literary effort. Obviously all rhyme is lost in a prose translation, plus the story itself defies the Greek Unities of Time and Place. Scenes are set in Norway, the tropics and the desert--lest audiences be bored with mere snowy locales. Peer's story covers his wild, reckless youth through his cynical middle age, right up to his regretful old age. He interacts with humans, trolls and other-worldly characters as he vainly romps through life. Driven to clear his reputation and earn the respect of his skeptical, critical neighbors, he embarks on a lifelong journey to discover his true identity.Possibly a cautionary tale PEER GYNT touches a human chord: the desire to improve oneself, to repay maternal care and to earn the love of a sweet, faithful maiden. Typical Nordic references include trafficking with trolls and the danger of getting a shard of glass or ice in one's eye, which distorts true vision and humanity. Despite the temptation Peer ultimately rejects trolldom in favor of maintaining his priceless human attributes.This edition, photocopied by robot, proves difficult to read because of:--lack of apostrophes in most contractions--odd punctuation which disrupts the flow of reading--inclusion of literary notes directly into the script, instead of placed as footnotesIn short: a confusing and disappointing version of an honored tale, which inspired composer Edvard Greig's PEER GYNT SUITE."},{"Title":"Peer Gynt,","review":"I like this version a lot - it's full of energy, and very exciting to see in person, which I was lucky enough to do.

While this one is true to the story and the characters, there's a lot of updating and a lot of language that might offend people who don't like the kinds of words you can't say on radio and TV.

One of these is Ibsen's Peer Gynt. Written in the late 19th century, Edvard Grieg wrote two Suites of music for the stageplay version of this Scandinavian classic a decade later. This poem / stageplay is actually a short novel, and tells the story of Peer Gynt, the ultimate ingrate of a son. Growing up raised by a single mother, he is the terror of his village, bullying younger ones and annoying older ones. Eventually he leaves his village and encounters a series of creatures and adventures bound to rattle anyone's cage. One memorable moment is when he finds himself in the Hall of the Mountain King, who happens to be a troll. This is the scene whose song of the same name by Grieg is a classic TV commercial tune. Life soon turns the young Peer into an older Peer. Near the end he reflects on his life with some characters he encounters. At this he realizes the waste his life has been. The moral of the story: don't waste your youth or any other moment of your life causing trouble for yourself or anyone else, for in the end you only isolate yourself and make life miserable for both you and those around you."},{"Title":"Brat Farrar","review":"Brat Farrar has everything a mystery should: a carefully-constructed plot, well-hidden but available clues, and an ending that wraps everything up without resorting to deux ex machina. The build-up to the &quot;creation&quot; of Pat Ashby -- the character the protagonist assumes in order to inherit an English estate -- is so thoughtfully described and developed, it was later referred to by Mary Stewart as the basis for her own character's deception in &quot;The Ivy Tree.&quot;All of these lead to a good mystery; what makes it a great mystery is the plethora of believable characters. The reader is invited to be part of a charming English village and becomes the champion of Brat as he works his way through a complicated identical-twin relationship to solve the hidden-secrets mystery in the end."},{"Title":"Brat Farrar","review":"Purchased this book for a book discussion group. Thought Tey must be a new author because I had not heard of her. Was suprised to discover that she is a vintage author. The book had an interesting story to tell and we had a good discussion. I may try to find some of her other books."},{"Title":"Brat Farrar","review":"Not the best beginning perhaps, but I really loved this mystery novel, once I got into it. In this story, a stranger named Brat Farrar enters the Ashby family, posing as Patrick Ashby, the heir to the family's fortune and grounds. Brat has been coached on everything about Patrick: his mannerisms, appearance, and every detail of his life, up to when he was thirteen, when he disappeared and was thought to have drowned himself. It looks like Brat is going to pull of this scheme, until old secrets come to light.Brat Farrar was really suspenseful, though the writing was a bit off-putting at first. It took some getting used to. But once I did, I was pulled into this excellent story. It's one of those books where you don't really know who to side with, or who is good and who is evil. Obviously, what Brat is doing is wrong, and you don't want the whole family to tricked, but then again, you kind of sympathize with him. He's an orphan, and he's finally found a family that he loves (except for Simon, who was going to inherit Latchetts). And he certainly has plenty of doubts about what he's doing. Simon is a real jerk, and, as it turns out, much, much worse than that. Brat compares him to Timber, a horse that has killed a man with his \\"tricks\\". It's a very accurate comparison, even before Brat knows what he did.For most of the book, it seems like Brat has succeeded, but since I read the back, I knew that something was going to go wrong. And that made it all the more suspenseful. I was on the edge of my seat, waiting for the secret to reveal itself. Though short, Brat Farrar is actually kind of slow reading; even though you can't put it down, this seemingly diminutive book takes a while.I loved the British setting; it felt realistic, and there was a bit of interesting social commentary. The plot isn't hugely original, but makes for an engaging mystery. I think it's kind of ironic that his name is \\"Brat\\", even though he's not a brat at all.One last thing. Brat (and others) in the novel have a huge love for horses. I could kind of identify with that, because I used to (and still do) love horses. That added an interesting element to the book. It felt more real, that Brat had a passion."},{"Title":"Brat Farrar","review":"Good story, original, but kind of abruptly ends. Poor kindle copy. Too many spelling mistakes to give it more stars."},{"Title":"Brat Farrar","review":"What was interesting in this whodunnit was the character developement, not something a lot of whodunit writers are good at. Only Bigfoot Littlefoot and West comes to mind and that is wildly different. I enjoyed this book and am glad I read it."},{"Title":"Brat Farrar","review":"The first thing I noticed about this author is her incredible talent for rendering conversations. In fact her narrative is so dialogue-driven that her protagonist often has spirited and convincing exchanges with his inner self. Although written before 1949, the writing has a timeless quality, a very modern tightness, and I found the style very \\"easy on the ears\\" and thoroughly enjoyable. This book is unusual in that it draws the reader inside the story and invites you to unlock the mystery. The plot's plausibility is heavily dependent on a couple of unique coincidences but, once you accept the premise, everything else follows. In fact, for me the precariousness of the situation adds tension and, although the ending was not a huge surprise, the way all the loose ends are tied up is very satisfying.Josephine Tey has deftly created some very likeable but complex characters: Brat is at once tough and vulnerable, an opportunist with a conscience. Simon is charming and cast as the victim but full of contradictions. Aunt Bee is typical of a generation of war-time women who had to be strong and unselfish for the sake of others. Each of the main characters is believably human, annoying at times, but always engaging. This book is perfectly suited for all ages, there is no gore, bad language, gratuitous sex or unsettling content and the potentially contentious adult subjects are masterfully handled. And, finally, horse enthusiasts will be happy to find that the substantial equestrian content is accurate and realistic and Tey's undisguised love of horses comes entirely devoid of saccharine."},{"Title":"Brat Farrar","review":"There's no mystery here: Brat Farrar knows he's a fraud. But, offered the opportunity to impersonate Patrick Ashby, the missing heir of a small English estate, he jumps at the chance to belong to a place and a family--even a family that suspects he might not be the boy he claims he is. And Brat, treading in perilous waters, finds his work complicated by old questions resurfacing.I discovered Josephine Tey's work a year or two ago and would recommend her books to any serious reader. Throughout this story, she challenges our view of issues such as guilt, justice, suspicion, and what it means to belong somewhere."},{"Title":"Brat Farrar","review":"I've just finished reading this book for the first time, and while I cannot add further praise to what the others here have said and fully agree with them (being clear that I loved the book and would recommend it to anyone looking for a completely absorbing read), I will comment a bit on some of the \\"loose ends\\" that most people seem ok with overlooking. There is one in particular that is only given a final token nod by the author and which is in fact the entire \\"raison d'etre\\" of the story. That this is not resolved, or at least tidied up, is what stays with me at the end and leaves an unfortunate sense of incompleteness when I should be basking in afterglow. Slightly less distracting, but still disappointing, is the beginning introduction of a couple charming characters who help to engage us in the story, but who then disappear and only return for a quick final nod. I have noticed this habit in several of Tey's books which is why I would rank this one and several others only a 4.5 rather than a full 5 stars. Tey is a recent discovery, and one I'm very happy to have made. Simply opening one of her books and starting to read is to become enveloped in worlds and characters that so thoroughly engage, one is surprised to look up and realize that they're not \\"real\\". I look forward to reading all of her books, and am sure I'll come back to them and read again. I just wish she would tidy up the details and seriously END her stories, instead of simply allowing them to fade off into an only just emerging sunset."},{"Title":"Brat Farrar","review":"Every couple of years I reread this one. Sadly, I know it to well now to be surprised by the story twists but still, it's a delight and a joy. Hard to put down once you start. This time, one of the things that is particularly present for me is how Josephine Tey / MacKintosh really just seemed to have loved life, and allowed that love of the countryside, animals and the tapestries that are human relationships to flow through her work."},{"Title":"Brat Farrar","review":"One of greatest tragedies in the world of mysteries is that Josephine Tey wrote so few. I've loved this book ever since I was a girl and found it on the shelf of my parents' library.The book is populated by a number of likeable, believable characters (even the unlikeable characters are believable). The reader is compelled to keep reading by the interesting plot that keeps reveals new aspects of the story without seeming at all contrived."},{"Title":"Brat Farrar","review":"Brat Farrer is an English orphan who, after much travel, has decided to come back to England. He is soon mistaken for Simon Ashby of Latchetts by Alec Loding, a cousin of the Ashbys. Brat is talked into impersonating Patrick Ashby, Simon's older twin who allegedly committed suicide when they were ten. Now about to come of age and inherit Latchetts, the plan is for Brat to claim Patrick's inheritance and provide Alec with a lifetime allowance as reward. What Brat doesn't expect is to care so much for the family and, more than fearing his fraud being uncovered, he is in fear of his life.It has been 30 years since I first read this book and I'd forgotten just how good it is. The story starts off gently at the first sentence. I immediately find myself caught up in the lives of the characters and environment Ms. Tey created. Soon the suspense begins to build and I can't put the book down. Even after the climax of the story, I am still kept in suspense until, at last, Ms. Tey kindly provides me with the resolution. I particularly wish other authors would take note that this completely enjoyable, engrossing and suspenseful story took only 276 pages to tell. If you've never read Brat Farrer or, as with me, it's been a long time, treat yourself and pick it up. Also, for the Dick Francis fans, it not only has horses, but a somewhat similar feel in its style. It was, as my British acquaintances say, brilliant!"},{"Title":"Brat Farrar","review":"Brat Farrar does what a good book is supposed to do. It draws you into a world you'll never be able to experience first hand. I've never been a fan of horses and all that goes with them but with this novel I gained an appreciation and some knowledge of the pleasures of owning a horse farm. It's so difficult to find a novel you \\"don't want to put down\\", I'm so glad I bought and read this one. The mystery here is not \\"who dunnit\\" or why it was done but how the main character Brat works his way out of the snare he walked into."},{"Title":"Brat Farrar","review":"First read at the age of 14 I now read this regularly and get something new out of it each time. It is just like sitting down with an old friend and chatting. The atmosphere, the characterisation are superb. Aunt Bee and all the rest come to life with a few well-chosen words. A note to the unnamed writer from Maryland who reviewed it and complained about the dentist being murdered, being exploded so his dental records could not confirm the identity. It is quite clear from the context and the period in which the book is set that the dentist dies in the London Blitz of the early 1940s. Her 'conspiracy theory' is wrong. Such a clever writer as Tey would not resort to murders by bomb explosions. It is mid-century England after all!A wonderful read. Immerse yourself in a classic of crime and character."},{"Title":"Brat Farrar","review":"Whether you like mystery or not, this is an excellent book. First of all, the characterization is amazing. Each and every character is vivid and realistic, however extreme some of their personalities are. Even though Brat is an impostor, he's extremely likeable and you can't do anything but marvle at what an amazing impostor he is. As well as this, you end up becoming attached even to the characters that you don't like, such as Ruth, Simon, and Sheila Parslow Also, the plot is amazingly well developed. It builds up perfectly, for a while, you can't even tell it's going to be a mystery, then Brat becomes more and more curious and eventually realizes that the person he's pretending to be was murdered and by whom. It keeps on moving so rapid a pace that, by the end, it's nearly impossible to put the book down. The actual quality of the writing is just about as good as it gets. Don't hesitate, read it!"},{"Title":"Brat Farrar","review":"I've read and re-read everything by Josephine Tey - I even bought all her works. You may grow to like Brat, as I have, despite the fact that he sets out to steal the Ashby fortune. You may also have a hard time putting this book down until you see how things turn out.Foul Language - Nope.Sex - Some oblique references that maybe some illicit sex is going on and/or has happened.Violence - A mild tussle."},{"Title":"Brat Farrar","review":"This was this first book I puchased with my own money at age 12 and I have read and reread it for almost 50 years. The story and the writing stand up to both time and a more critical taste. Characters are beautifully drawn and the mystery never palls. The other books by Miss Tey are old favorites as well,paricularly The Murders of Richard III. They are perhaps better appreciated by adults, but for good writing for young readers, I always suggest Brat Farrar. Besides, who can resist the horses!"},{"Title":"Brat Farrar","review":"The story is seen from the viewpoint of its title character, Brat Farrar, a foundling who grew up in an orphanage somewhere in England, he ran away to sea, traveled around and lived in America for awhile. When the book begins, Brat has just returned to England, he is stopped by an aging actor while walking along a street. The actor has been struck by Brat's amazing resemblance to someone he knows, Simon Ashby, who is due on his 21st birthday to inherit the family estate, though Simon was not the original heir - it should have been his twin, Patrick, who apparently committed suicide when they were 13. The actor makes Brat a proposition, he is persuaded to pose as Patrick come back and claim the family fortune.This was my first Josephine Tey mystery, and it kept me up late, I couldn't wait to find out what would happen. Originally published in 1949, this author was well known for writing great mysteries that did not follow formulas. Tey has chosen the British countryside and the world of horse breeding as the setting for this one, an enjoyable read, old-fashioned, British, with a country pastor and a character called Aunt Bee. Some things are perhaps predictable, for example I guessed pretty early on who Brat really was, but there were still plenty of other surprises along the way. This would have been a great Hitchcock film."},{"Title":"Brat Farrar","review":"Brat Farrar agrees, against his better judgment, to assume the identity of a dead English boy and take his place as master of a small estate. He doesn't expect to feel an odd sense of belonging in the dead boy's life, or to feel such deep affection for the dead boy's family -- or to be treated with such contempt by the dead boy's twin brother. It's tough to make the &quot;imposter&quot; plot believeable - and Tey manages to suck you in from the very first page. What happens to Brat, and whether his deception is ultimately uncovered, makes for a taut, tense ride. Tey is not only great at building suspense, she's also a darn fine writer. Her characters are well-developed and psychologically true. She has a great eye for detail and paints an affectionate portrait of post-war English country life. I couldn't put this one down until I finished it."},{"Title":"Brat Farrar","review":"This book was fabulous. It's exactly the kind of book I like - cozy, nothing too graphic, lots of mystery and a fair amount of tension/suspense.From the moment Brat Farrar comes into the narrative I was smitten. I found him fascinating. I don't want to say much about this book because it would be easy to spoil it. Let's just say that Brat Farrar is an 'orphan' who happens to look a lot like a boy who committed suicide eight years ago. Much of the book is devoted to finding out who he really is, or isn't. But it's SOOOO much more than that!If you like a well written, old fashioned mystery, you will love this book! It's definitely my new favorite Josephine Tey."},{"Title":"Brat Farrar","review":"I picked this up on the recommendation of a friend. My taste in detective novels is pretty exclusive - they have to be written well (e.g., everything by Jonathan Latimer) and not boring. \\"Brat Farrar\\" is definitely well written; but unless someone told you in advance, you wouldn't know you were reading a mystery until about midway into the book. Tey crafts her story well and creates a village full of flesh and blood characters; and the fact that a mystery eventually develops is almost beside the point, since by then Tey's already seduced you into enjoying the ride so far."},{"Title":"Brat Farrar","review":"One of the great pleasures of reading classic English mysteries is the indulgence of a gentle nostalgia for a bygone world. In defiance, perhaps, of the changes presaged by the First War and brought about by the Second, they represent an England that is still predominantly rural, held together by custom and civility, and where everybody understands his or her place in the social order. Nowhere is this more true than with BRAT FARRAR, published by Josephine Tey (Elizabeth MacKintosh) in 1949, but harking back to a vision of country life that has extended for centuries before that. The whole book reads like a celebration of England in an eternal summer.The setting is Latchetts, an old horse farm in the South Downs, near the English coast. The farm has been owned by the Ashby family for generations. But the Ashby parents are dead, and Simon, the eldest of the younger generation, is shortly about to come of age. There had been a slightly older twin brother, Patrick, but he disappeared in his early teens, apparently drowned in the sea, whether by accident or suicide; the body was never found and nobody is sure of the true story. Into this walks Simon's virtual double, a young man from America now going under the name of Brat Farrar, but claiming his inheritance as Patrick. He has a plausible story, he has a natural gift with horses, and he has great personal charm; it is not long before he is accepted by virtually everybody.But -- and this is the really daring thing -- the reader is told, long before Brat appears at Latchetts, that the claimant is an impostor, coached by an unscrupulous neighbor who hopes to share in the inheritance. By the third chapter, the author has not only taken away the mystery, but moved the story into a place from which no graceful exit seems possible. By this time, however, the reader has come to take such delight in the life of Latchetts and its people and the Sussex countryside that he reads on regardless. And the author does produce some mystery and quite a bit of danger out of nowhere; this is the most absorbing, fully-realized, and exciting Tey novel of the four that I have read. The book also turns, most unexpectedly, into a romance, but a romance with strange incestuous overtones since it involves the growing feeling between a young woman and a man whom she believes to be her brother. Naturally, the book does not have an easy or obvious ending, but it is a satisfying one. It is amazing that Tey can extract herself from the narrative and erotic morass with the delicacy that she does, but that is a tribute to her remarkable powers as a writer, here seen at their very best.[The reader may wish to see my rather longer review of a collection of Tey novels published as THREE BY TEY, from which the above remarks are taken.]"},{"Title":"Brat Farrar","review":"What makes Brat Farrar an interesting book are its complicated, brilliant plot and fascinating characters.Brat Farrar, an orphan who has drifted around the world his entire life, is given an opportunity to become part of a family. To do this, however, he must deceive them, by pretending to be Patrick, who supposedly commited suicide at the age of 13.Many suspenseful situations ensue, especially between Brat and Simon, Patrick's jealous twin brother. These conflicts, along with Tey's excellent writing, make the book a real page-turner. The depth of the characters also adds to the book.I am usually not a fan of mysteries, but I really enjoyed this book, and heartily recommend it."},{"Title":"Brat Farrar","review":"The best evidence of the fine writing in this novel is a back cover blurb that gives away much of the plot, yet in no way diminishes the pleasure of reading the book.Basically the story follows Brat Farrar, who successfully assumes the identity of long presumed dead Patrick Ashby to inherit a fortune. What sets the book apart is the development of Brat's character. His feeling and motivation is examined sympathetically, and in many ways that is what drives the novel.There are a number of minor shortcomings to the book. In contrast to the wonderful development of Bee and Brat, the character of Simon is drawn fairly shallowly. He seems to be a bit of a stock villain and his motivations are never examined. Also, the ending was a little to pat. It doesn't seem likely that the scenario could be wrapped up as cleanly and quickly as indicated in the book. But apart from those quibbles it was, all in, an excellent book."},{"Title":"Brat Farrar","review":"Quite the best of Tey's books I believe. The conclusion was one only an expert could have written."},{"Title":"Brat Farrar","review":"ditto to the positive book reviews sent in.

Doubt I'll read another one by Tey."},{"Title":"Brat Farrar","review":"Eight years after young Patrick Ashby's disappearance and presumed suicide, a young man presents himself to the Ashby family lawyers as the long-lost heir--just in time to reclaim the family estate from his slightly younger twin brother Simon on their approaching 21st birthday. He knows intimate details of Patrick's childhood and passes all of the tests devised by the lawyers to reveal an imposter. (The family's dental records in London were apparently destroyed during the war.) Could it be? Has the prodigal son returned home? In a word, no.That's not a spoiler, mind you. You'll learn as much on the back-cover blurb, and chapter 3 reveals the imposter in no uncertain terms as Brat Farrar, a foundling who grew up in an orphanage and spent much of his teen years exploring the American West. By the end of chapter 4, it doesn't take a whole lot of pondering to figure out 90% of what's really going on. It's just a matter of following along to see how it all plays out.I know that sounds boring, but it's rather an enjoyable read. You can look at it as being slow-moving, or as having a leisurely pace. If you take the latter attitude, I think you'll have a better appreciation of the manner in which Tey examines Brat's moral struggles and unfolds the layers of mystery surrounding the Ashby family.**Adapted from a Skullduggery review**"},{"Title":"Brat Farrar","review":"This is a great read--romance, mystery, and horses. I could live without the horses, but it is set among horse owners and amateur races in England in the mid-20th Century. The mystery is really a thriller. Brat Farrar has agreed to impersonate a missing heir. So at first reader assume that he is a villain. As the circumstances of the family are exposed, this villain turns into a romantic lead. Then an ancient murder is uncovered and danger stalks our protagonist. There is a deeper message in BRAT FARRAR--who ARE you asked as an existential question. We want Farrar to resolve to be what is difficult. Daphne DuMaurier's REBECCA is also a deeper kind of thriller also asking \\"what is identity?\\" Josephine Tey, the author of BRAT FARRAR, kept her personal life nearly totally unknown, even while living in the first half of the 20th century and writing several very popular mysteries."},{"Title":"Brat Farrar","review":"I love all of the books written by Josephine Tey, and I treasure &amp; reread them all the time. I am just about to purchase my third paperback copy of Brat Farrar - I wore the others out. My only wish is that she had written more of these wonderful stories."},{"Title":"Brat Farrar","review":"This was a 3 part series on PBS in the early '80's Is there a copy of this in existence? I would love one. Masterpiece Theater quality, and lots of British stable yards and horses!"},{"Title":"Brat Farrar","review":"When foundling drifter Brat Farrar is offered the proposition to pose as the aristocratic Ashby family's long-missing heir (whom he strongly resembles), he finds it impossible to resist. What he did not reckon on was the growing attraction to his own \\"sister\\" and the veiled enmity of the younger twin \\"brother,\\" whom he has displaced as the master of the Ashby estate. The author expertly draws the characters so that we always favor the likable Brat, despite his fraudulent part in the scheme. When it becomes obvious that his life is in danger and that there is something decidedly suspicious about the death of the real Patrick Ashby, the suspense builds unrelentingly, keeping the reader's eyes riveted to the book.In addition to the suspense and the excellent characterizations, there is the extremely interesting background of English horse breeding and racing, which the Ashby fortunes are currently built upon.P>Yes, you can see some of the incidents coming ahead of time, but that's the way it is in real life. The author is honest with the reader in letting us know what is developing as the hero himself discovers it. Overall, this is a great read, an excellent novel of suspense."},{"Title":"Brat Farrar","review":"Brat Farrar has been on my &quot;Must Read&quot; list for so long that I was almost hesitant to pick it up for fear it wouldn't live up to expectations. I shouldn't have worried. This is the kind of book you either read in one sitting or can't wait to get back to once you put it down. Tey weaves a wonderful web of characters and suspicion, turning the reader to face new possibilities in the plot like Brat might turn one of his horses. Brat is - without a doubt - an Ashby; all anyone has to do is look at him to know that. But is he the long-dead Patrick, heir to the Latchetts Estate? Arguing (delightfully) against his own better nature, Brat decides to pass himself off as the eldest son of the family only to suffer waves of guilt over his deception. Each member of the family and his or her reaction to Brat is so clearly drawn it's easy to see them jump off the page, especially Simon, Patrick's slightly younger twin who has just seen his inheritance handed to someone who may be an imposter. Tey mixes in clever little side stories which add flavor to the mystery not to mention a few clues before bringing it all to an almost perfect close. A few loose threads at the end are the only down note. What I enjoyed mostly was that unlike some other Tey mysteries which seem dated, this one has stood the test of time."},{"Title":"Brat Farrar","review":"I first met Brat Farrar in the 1980's on the PBS Mystery! television show. I was completely hooked by Josephine Tey's superbly suspensful story set in the beautiful English countryside complete with horses and touchingly real characters, but most of all by the young, handsome British actor, Mark Greenstreet who amazingly played a dual role to perfection. Alas, I never saw it again, and no video exists, so I bought the book, read it several times, then went on to read Josephine Tey's other stories. But Brat Farrar remains my favorite. The book is everything the dramatization was and more--except for Greenstreet. I strongly urge you to read this book, but if Brat Farrar ever comes on PBS again, DON'T MISS IT!!"},{"Title":"Brat Farrar","review":"I was recommended this book by a favorite teacher in high school, and it has remained my favorite mystery novel and one of my all-time favorite books in the decades since. Unfortunately, it's so good that it has little competition, even among Josephine Tey's all-too-few other books. For one thing, Brat is that rare hero that one both loves and identifies with; you can feel what he's feeling, and you can feel what the other characters feel toward him, with an unusual poignancy. There is also the charm of his adopted family (with one exception) and estate, which needs him as much as he needs it. If a few of the characters and situations are a bit too convenient - the attractive &quot;sister,&quot; the villain's lack of conscience, not to mention the revelation of the &quot;why&quot; of Brat's family resemblance! - the compensations are in the richness of the setting and characters, and in the book's wonderful heart."},{"Title":"Brat Farrar","review":"Most die-hard mystery fans are familiar with Ms. Tey's _A Daughter of Time_, in which a hospitalized Scotland Yard detective dispels the &quot;prickles of boredom&quot; by debunking the idea that Richard III killed the Princes in the Tower. Perhaps less well known is this book, _Brat Farrar_, about how a fundamentally decent man is persuaded to exploit his resemblance to a believed-dead heir by assuming that young man's identity. The narration of how he prepares for and pulls off this impersonation is thrilling in and of itself, but the great tension in the book comes when Brat discovers that Patrick Ashby, whose life and inheritance Brat has assumed, did not run away or kill himself, but was in fact murdered by someone very close to him. What Brat does about the moral dilemma--and the threat to his own life--posed by the murderer makes for a suspenseful and satisfying conclusion"},{"Title":"Brat Farrar","review":"This is basically a wonderful period novel with an embedded mystery--with an overview of what might have been a mystery immediately revealed. But, the devil is in the details--providing accelerating suspense & an opportunity for Tey to again excel in her characterizations, dialog, descriptions of English life, etc. I am torn between a 4 & 5 star rating, but the explanation of the details at the end seems a bit thin. On the other hand, similar to \\"Miss Pym Disposes,\\" the main character is faced with moral dilemma & the opportunity to play God--but this time acts differently. Assumptions are the delight of mystery authors! The interplay of the twin brothers is absorbing & the dichotomy between the twin sisters is interesting. Most of the characters are delightful--even the duplicitous Farrar. I wondered how Tey would manage the ending relationship with Eleanor--& she did it. The ending, as usual for a Tey, was explosive & (at least to a degree) unexpected. Again similar to \\"Miss Pym,\\" we are given \\"incontrovertible proof\\" that's proven wrong. As Tey says herein, \\"If you thought about the unthinkable long enough it became quite reasonable.\\""},{"Title":"Brat Farrar","review":"One discerning young man wrote to Amazon from Russia to tell how he had read *BRAT FARRAR* at age 14 and \\"now read this regularly . . .

However, both Josephine Tey and Francis knew how to claim their audience, and a loyal following. The two books claim my top billing for great characterizations, for TENSION, marvelous interplay of characters, and undercurrents that are woven into a wonderfully clever tale, matched by the emotions evoked in readers.The achingly bittersweet story when made into a series for British & American television audiences was blessed with perfect casting: Brat, each member of the Ashby family & the rascally Alec Loding ~ everyone! It is such a joy to watch. We personally celebrate each year with a 'showing' of our (poorly copied) video tape, and it still astounds me that we do this each year, and that the finished product is so perfect.It is impossible to guess WHY \\"Brat Farrar\\" is never even a re-run during those parched times of poor choices played too frequently. PLEASE ! Someone out there help shake up the stodgy and/or resistant top guys who can't recognize a good show when they see one. Apparently it is A/&/E TV Network (American) & BBC that are not cooperating with a long suffering public. Reviewer mcHAIKU asks that we all agitate for a DVD. It would bring honor to the late Josephine Tey, an outstanding writer who deserves that wider audience. READ *BRAT* and read some of Tey's other books: *The Franchise Affair* and *Daughter of Time*. You will delight in a closer acquaintance with an author who will be a cherished friend!"},{"Title":"Brat Farrar","review":"Josephine Tey excels at the twisted plot, the kind of story in which the unreal seems so real that not only are readers puzzled by the meaning of Truth, but even the characters in the story seem a little confused. This was made into an excellent movie, but the book weaves an even tighter and spookier plot. Brat Farrar agrees to assume the ID of a dead boy and step in as master of a British estate. Then he begins to believe his own tale as things that should be foreign to him somehow feel oddly familiar. Fully developed side-characters and tight, tense plot make for a wide-eyed, suspensful read set against the irresistible backdrop of post-war English country life with all the usual quirky and eccentric inhabitants of the genre.Excellent."},{"Title":"Brat Farrar","review":"This book is a true mystery classic, and it is written as only Tey can write them. I had seen a movie made from this story before I read the book. Although the movie was very true to the original manuscript, the book is much, much better. Like all of Tey's stories, this book is not a simple murder mystery. The plot is ingenious. Even though the reader is partly in the secret from early on in the story, the suspense is developed and maintained until the very end. The reader comes to sympathize with Brat early on in the story, and we wonder how he's going to get out of the web of lies and deceit he has made. I enjoyed the country \\"horsey\\" setting, and the family is pure delight. Ms. Tey was a wonderful author!"},{"Title":"Brat Farrar","review":"Orphan Brat Farrar was named partly through a telephone book and partly by mistake. Destiny takes him half way round the world and back again to accept a proposition to take the place and inheritance of a missing boy. The story as so many of the time and genre are, is set in the midst of a middle class English country family. The plot which I will not reveal is clever although not really a shock to the attentive reader, the writing is good and the characters are well developed. The suprise for me was not the twist in the tale, but that the person you really get to like in the book is Brat who is the imposter and criminal. Actually most of the characters are both likeable and comfortable which makes the readers journey through this book extremely pleasant if not gripping. This was my introduction to Josephine Tey, it will certainly not be the last time I read her work."},{"Title":"Brat Farrar","review":"Sent for a copy of Brat Farrar by Josephine Tey. In the middle of this mystery story, the book was missing about 100 pages! I had to find another book to end the suspense.Beware of good deals."},{"Title":"Brat Farrar","review":"I picked this book at the bookstore to while time away, and I'm very glad I didn't buy it. the outline of the plot was appealing but in the end it was mediocre. I didn't like the main character all that much, and mostly he stayed in the shadow, as unknown to us as he was to the family. It's also hard to believe that he wasn't revealed as the impostor. the odds of pulling that off are very low. The story went on at a slugglish pace, and the mystery took a backseat most of the time. Most of the time it was Brat going around the estate and meeting people. The suspense was nonexistent. I think Agatha Christie is much more interesting. Also, the mystery in this book was weak and quite predictable."},{"Title":"Brat Farrar","review":"First I'd like to say I consider the other Tey books I've read to be 5 stars. But Brat Farrar was not as well-written. As the other reviews have stated, the plot is mostly revealed by the first couple of chapters - a family friend plots to have a lookalike (Brat) impersonate a family member to get an inheritance (and the family friend gets paid out of the inheritance by the impersonator.) And as some reviews have stated, the ending of the book leaves loose threads. But what I found disturbing is the cavalier treatment by Tey of a murder that enables the impersonation to happen. The only obstacle to the sucessful impersonation: a dentist and his records (teeth don't lie.) As soon as Brat appears on the scene, we find the dentist (and his records) has been blown to bits, thanks to the family friend! AND THIS IS THE FIRST, LAST, AND ONLY TIME WE EVER HEAR OF THE MURDER OF THE DENTIST. Brat's moral dillema centers on his deception of the family alone, because at no point does Tey let him learn of the murder. How does he reconcile the consequences of his actions, when he doesn't know about them? And there is no mention that the family friend will ever be accountable for the murder of the dentist. It's as though the life of an innocent man doesn't matter, which I found troubling."},{"Title":"Brat Farrar","review":"I don't agree with the many people who raved about this book. The plot synopsis hooked me, but the manner in which the lead character determines that a murder took place, and the manner in which he determines the murderer, is very simplistic, and unimaginative.Further, the &quot;mystery&quot; is really secondary to the plot of how the lead character is going to deceive those around them that he is the long-lost brother.Exceptionally disappointing - with a plot like that, the writer could have truly done much better."},{"Title":"Web Scripting With Vbscript","review":"This is hands down the worst book I have ever seen onVBScript. Let me rephrase that, this is hands down the worst excusefor a computer book in general!First there is a lack of an actual explanation for anything the author does. He seems to ramble on without truly making sense. The &quot;graphics&quot;, if you call equal signs, dashes, and pipes graphics, are inexcusable. If you attempt to &quot;write&quot; a book, at least use screen shots to illistrate your point. Finally, this book bills itself on it's back cover as a handbook for those who want to learn a language but &quot;are stumped by the complexities of learning Java ...... or Perl can now develop web pages ... they've been dreaming about!&quot; Two words for everyone, and I can't type them here. You'll be lucky if you can figure out a single thing if you buy this book.Basically, don't waste your money on this pitiful excuse for a book unless you want to pay for lining your bird's cage. That is about all this book is good for. I recomend the o'riely book on ASP if you want a reference or a starter book. END"},{"Title":"W.C. Fields & me","review":"Carlotta Monti was WC Fields's mistress for a number of years. Her book is not a great book. 'Fortunes and Follies' is more entertaining if sometimes lacking in accuracy. 'Fields by Himself' is fascinating. This book treats only portions of the artist's life and career. Still I recommend Monti's book because it gives a fresh woman's perspective and helps humanise Fields. This should not be the first or only book on Mr Fields one reads. Those who are seriously interested in the great comedian should, however, find time for this memoir."},{"Title":"W.C. Fields & me","review":"I first stumbled across this book at my grandfather's place back when I was nine years old. Of all the role models I could have picked up, this was probably the worst one yet. Monti spins the story of her fourteen years with Fields pretty much as if it were right out of one of his movies. Her depiction of Fields is a mishmash of Souse and Cuthbert J. Twillie, and her recounting of certain scenes (either in his presence or told to her secondhand) is absolutely hysterical. Once I stumbled, once again, across Ronald Fields' &quot;W.C. Fields By Himself&quot; and &quot;The Man on the Flying Trapeeze,&quot; I got the feeling that Miss Monti may have been taking pains to rewrite history to conform both to the public image Fields so desperately kept up *and* her own involvement in it. Read it the way you would watch a Fields movie, but don't expect any in-depth look at his personality or mystique; after reading other biographical works, it's hard to doubt that Fields was doing more than using her for sex and as a sounding board for his gags and routines."},{"Title":"W.C. Fields & me","review":"I would recommend this to any fan of W. C. Fields. While it looks at the great comedian from his mistress's perspective and takes some degree of latitude with that - it is nonetheless a part of his overall persona. Simply take it with the proverbial grain, or tablespoon, of salt! Miss Monti's perspective is obviously slanted and defensive of her life with him. But, taken into account with some of the other, more objective approaches to presenting Fields this adds its portion to the full view of the man. But, do, read other works available if you have not already. A tip of the hat to you!"},{"Title":"W.C. Fields & me","review":"The first time I went to see the movie, I did so to watch Rod Steiger fall flat on his face; having never played a lick of humor before this movie. A couple minutes into it, I lost sight of Fields; it was like watching Fields playing himself, so well did Steiger invoke the great comic.I loved the movie and am totally p*ssed they never put it out on any media I can buy and play at home. The studio says it didn't do well enough at the box office to warrant putting it on recorded media for commercial sales.I just wish there were a way to convince the studio to at least allow Amazon to sell digital images of the movie; that way the studio has no investment in stock, and can make 100% profit from the commission they charge Amazon to publish it digitally. Anyone who agrees with me, write Amazon.Maybe if enough aficionados write them, they'll get in touch with the studio and make arrangements."},{"Title":"W.C. Fields & me","review":"The other Amazon reviewers have all hit this nail on the head. I would add some random thoughts:1. Ronald Fields' \\"Fields by Himself,\\" together with his Emmy-winning documentary, still take the prize in my opinion for comprehensive treatment of the Great Man. The Fields grandchildren, notably also Dr. Harriet, have done remarkable jobs explicating and exhibiting their Grandfather's life, times and artifacts.2. In my judgment, Simon Louvish's \\"Man on the Flying Trapeze\\" is a more compelling biographical read than James Curtis' recent book. Man and myth remain so intertwined, even after all these years, that Fields so far has escaped a really good biography.3. Carlotta Monti sold her story for a few pieces of silver in the early 70's when Fields was a \\"rebel hero\\" of the baby boomer generation. Alas, that apex of post-mortem fame crumbled. Gens X and Y (\\"Millennials\\"), except in my household, have hardly a clue who or what Fields is. If they are lucky enough to get turned on to Fields, I hope their reading does not tarry long on this book--and that they skip Rod Steiger's awful portrayal in the movie. (Imagine if Chuck McCann had gotten that role...or even Ed McMahon!4. Even 25 years after Fields' death, Ms. Monti peddled as truth some of the misdirections and tall tales for which Fields so wanted to be remembered. She was, after all, a wanna-be-actress. She certainly memorized the lines of Fields' last quarter of life--as he wrote them, I fear. For further proof, I note a fascinating 30 minute radio interview of Ms. Monti from the early 70's (available on otradio website, in the Fields mp3), in which her storytelling is so far-fetched, and well-rehearsed, that it is laugh-out-loud.5. For my money, the best way to think of Ms. Monti is as Fields; secretary in \\"Man on the Flying Trapeze\\"--her biggest part. The chemistry between her qand Fields is palpable. her recital of the circumstances leading up to Fields and her landing in a pile outside the wrestling matches is riveting."},{"Title":"Spicy True Stories, Investigators Lies, Slanders And Stocks","review":"This fifty-two page self-published gem is by Sylvia Gibson, author of the immortalLatawnya, the Naughty Horse, Learns to Say \\"No\\" to DrugsClearly, Mrs. Gibson has a thing for absurdly long titles. However, aside from an incredibly poor grasp of the English language, that is all the two titles have in common.Spicy True Stories is a poorly written chronicle of one woman's (and possibly her husband's) intensely paranoid conspiracy theory delusions. It's actually a little sad once you realize just how seriously this is being written. I'm not a psychologist, but it's not a stretch to guess that Gibson is a paranoid schizophrenic who truly believes that everyone she meets - literally everyone - is working for the government with the \`investigators' and \`stocking' her. Oh yes - one thing. Gibson spells \`stalking' as \`stocking' for the entire book. It's used about four hundred times.This book is self-published and is absolutely riddled with typos and grammatical errors, roughly about 10-15 per page, so if you like that sort of thing, this book will be right up your alley. If you're a fan of books with absolutely no semblance of internal logic, you'll love this book. And if you enjoy scenes that are completely devoid of logic and are so mind-boggling stupid that it's difficult to comprehend, you'll probably buy this book and get copies for your friends as well.On the other hand, if you get a few friends together and turn it into a drinking game via dramatic reading, this book can be a lot of fun."},{"Title":"Diving & Snorkeling Belize (Lonely Planet Diving & Snorkeling Belize)","review":"This book has no discernible value to anyone planning a dive trip to Belize. First, it does not tell you which dive sites are good and which are worth skipping. This makes it difficult to plan your trip, assuming you have limited time and money to spend. The book does not even contain a list of top 5 or 10 recommended sites in the country.Second, the book has no information on costs or other logistical aspects of a dive trip. For example, it mentions that Dangriga is the departure point for diving certain reefs, but doesn't tell you that there are no dive shops in Dangriga: to do any diving around there, you have to go thru an out-of-town resort, which is highly inconvenient.Third, the capsule descriptions of 66 specific dive sites -- the heart of the book -- don't tell you anything meaningful and are irrelevant anyway because dive shops, not customers, choose which sites are visited. (Customers can choose which area they want to go to, but the dive shops select the specific sites within that area.)Finally, although the book was updated in June 2002, it ignores the fact that in October 2001, Hurricane Iris devastated the sourthern diving hub of Placencia. The reefs in this area are heavily damaged and therefore not worth visiting. The failure to update the book to account for this major development can only be explained by bad faith on the part of Lonely Planet, which should be ashamed to have put such a lousy product on the market."},{"Title":"Diving & Snorkeling Belize (Lonely Planet Diving & Snorkeling Belize)","review":"This book is not worth buying. It provides very little information on specific dive sites. I did not use the book once to make a dive choice during two weeks in Southern Belize. A good dive book for Belize is really needed - it was difficult to locate good dive operators for some areas...but this book was of no value.It does have some nice pictures and a very basic fish/coral guide in the back."},{"Title":"Diving & Snorkeling Belize (Lonely Planet Diving & Snorkeling Belize)","review":"It is a good overview book, but when we got to Belize realized that a lot of the sites that are listed are not called by the same name at all - so hard to determine what sites we had really dived compared to the book. Also it covers a lot of area in Belize (if you are going to Ambergris Caye then maybe 1/2 or 2/3 of the book is useful)."},{"Title":"Diving & Snorkeling Belize (Lonely Planet Diving & Snorkeling Belize)","review":"This is a fair book, but loads of sites are missing (from this edition at least) and much of the information I expected to find was not in it - particularly the prices and quality of the various diving shops. It is a mere overview of what you find under the sea, with little on how to actually get to that point."},{"Title":"Diving & Snorkeling Belize (Lonely Planet Diving & Snorkeling Belize)","review":"While I agree with the previous 2 reviewers. I did find the book helpful as a brief and very general overview of what was available and what there was to see in those dive areas. It put the areas in geographical perspective for me and was a nice addition to the dive briefing. After the dive, the fish ID part was a nice memory jogger for doing my logbook entries.However, it does not help with planning a dive or a dive trip. You can get more info on that free from websites, magazines and dive tour specialists.Overall better than nothing if you're into filling out your logbook."},{"Title":"Leonie Martin: A Difficult Life","review":"Sometimes you hear of a family where all the children are loved and well cared for, and then one other is a sort of persona non grata. I don't think that was exactly the case here -- everyone seems to have loved Leonie -- but there is a definite feeling that she was considered, and must have felt, inferior to her siblings. Her four sisters all became Carmelite nuns in Lisieux, and one (Therese, of course) has been canonized and declared a doctor of the Church. Poor Leonie found her way in a different order as a nun of the Visitation after 3 tries. It appears, however, that she followed St. Therese's \\"Little Way\\" more exactly than the others, and may indeed finally be the second saint in the family (unless her parents - also being considered - are canonized first). I would like to read more about her, but perhaps there just isn't any other information. Has anyone collected her letters? It would be interesting to see how she grew spiritually by reading all of her correspondence, not just selections. At any rate, this is a nice book and I recommend it to anyone who desires to follow the little way."},{"Title":"Leonie Martin: A Difficult Life","review":"I highly recommend this book to all Catholic mothers. We often hear that Leonie Martin was the 'difficult' child and we tend to scoff in disbelief...after all, this is an extraordinary, saintly family! But the truth is Leonie was difficult by our standards of 'difficult' today! What touches me so deeply with this book is how a mother can stop at nothing for the spiritual and emotional needs of a child she loves. She encompasses all her family members including her sister and brother in this mission of love. And love wins. Zelie Martin is an wonderful example to Catholic mothers today, it is definately a must read, five star book."},{"Title":"Leonie Martin: A Difficult Life","review":"Leonie Martin brought much despair to her mother. Leonie was emotionally disturbed and had a \\"rough\\" temperment. She caused much anguish in the family. After being diagnosed with breast cancer Leonie's mother worried as to what would become of Leonie after her death. Leonie fought valiantly against her stubborn nature and after three tries succeeded in the Visitation convent. Perhaps in the after life we shall find she was the \\"greater\\" saint for having to struggle so hard to conquer herself."},{"Title":"Leonie Martin: A Difficult Life","review":"I enjoyed this book very much. Not very much has been written about Leonie Martin. This book gives a broad overview of her life. It gives insight into the whole Martin family. And you learn how the family reacted to their sister becoming a saint. In reading other books about St Therese of Lisieux, Leonie is barely mentioned. But now I understand her place in the family."},{"Title":"Cochran's German Review Grammar (4th Edition)","review":"Mine is actually the white paperback version, not blue hardback, but excellent condition at a great price.

Ms. Du Maurier succeeds at this and goes way beyond by writing such disparate and fascinating stories. The Apple Tree relates a man's unhappiness with his long suffering wife who has a martyr complex and sees her in an old apple tree he comes to despise; The Little Photographer is a rather depressing but engrossing tale of a spoiled and beautiful woman with a very lavish lifestyle who becomes bored on holiday with the children and the governess, and has a fling she is ashamed of, with a photographer in the town she hired to take photos of her family.To her, it is a casual thing, to be forgotten once she returns home and just an embarrassing footnote to her vacation, to alleviate her ennui. However, to the photographer, it is a life changing event. So much so he threatens her safe and luxurious existence and becomes a very real threat to her way of life.The best of all the stories and one which has haunted me for years, is Monte Verita, a Shangri La, in some remote mountain pass, one which draws young people and they are never seen again. One of these bewitched people is a woman much loved by 2 men, one her husband and the other his best friend. Neither can give her up, and they unite in their quest to get her back.Great collection, wonderful stuff, you will love it."},{"Title":"A C language implementation of the SRO (Murdock) detector / analyzer (Open file report)","review":"Today I again wished I still had access to THEREBY HANGS A TALE. I had read most of it years ago while staying with a friend and have missed its delightful insights into how our language grows and changes. Each word's origin is explained with great humor and insight. This time, however, instead of just feeling blue for not having it, I searched Amazon.com [bless them and their search engine] and by golly, Ollie, I found it. I can't wait to lay eyes and mind again on its wondrous pages. If you don't already love words and their deeper meanings, this may stimulate you into a grand new experience with one of life's simple pleasures."},{"Title":"A C language implementation of the SRO (Murdock) detector / analyzer (Open file report)","review":"This is NOT an etymological reference work (for which I recommend Ayto), but rather a mentally stimulating 300 pages for browsing.Don't expect to find a particular word and don't try to read it all at once. Instead, keep it by the bedside or in the car and read a page or two when you have a spare minute.It's a bit dated, and some entries are obscure or unfamiliar, but Harry Potter fans will delight to find such words as basilisk and mandrake.There are many such non-academic books on the stories of word origins, but this one among many has somehow captured my preference. The balance of etymology and history provides many delightful little ah-hah! moments of new insights and connections.This is best illustrated by example:I just now randomly opened the book to page 58, where we learn that the bird 'canary' is indeed from the Canary Islands, which are so named in Pliny the Elder's account of the journey, in 40 B.C., of Juba, the Mauritanian chief, through the Pillars of Hercules (Gibraltar Strait) to an island overrun with dogs which he named Canaria, Latin for 'Island of Dogs' (canine).In the next 3 pages one learns (in much greater detail):The Latin 'cancelli', for lattice, gave us the word 'cancel' from the appearance of hash marks in the days before erasers (whose usage gave us the noun 'rubber').Roman candidates for public office wore white as a sign of purity (like brides today), so 'candidatus' (clothed in white) gave us candidate, candor, and candid.When Christopher Columbus landed in Cuba, the people explained they were Canibales, a dialectal pronunciation of Caribes, from which we get cannibal and Caribbean.'Canopy' comes from the Greek konops, mosquito, for the purpose of the net it held.One 'canters' on a horse when riding leisurely toward CANTERbury Cathedral for a picnic at the grave of Thomas a Becket, who was murdered in 1170 by his pal, King Henry II.'Canvas' comes from the Latin for hemp, cannabis.'Caper' and 'caprice' describe the antics of goats, the Latin for which is 'capra' (Capricorn). Elsewhere he explains how the leap of a goat, cabriolet in Latin, gave us 'cab', with taxi (like tax) indicating the necessity of paying a toll.That's a summary of just three pages. A different sort of example from page 203 describes the amphibian once called an efeta and still today called an 'eft' in some regions. By tonal similarity, this became eveta. Since v and u were written the same, it became eueta. Just as 'due' sounds like 'dew', it became ewta, then ewte. Finally, the 'n' migrated, so that 'an ewte' became 'a newt'.If you've read this far and enjoyed it, you'll like this book. Otherwise, forget it.It's uncanny how often these factoids subsequently turn up in conversation or on Jeopardy the very same week you read it."},{"Title":"A C language implementation of the SRO (Murdock) detector / analyzer (Open file report)","review":"I have always loved to explore word origins, which is why I love this book. While many of the origins are what you would expect, there are a few gems whose origin is most unusual. The word origins also show what a mongrel the English language is, with words developed using input from every corner of Europe, the Islamic areas of North Africa and Asia and even as far away as British India. It was fascinating to learn how so many of our words had a different form in one language and was altered two or three times before reaching the final form that we know today. I strongly recommend this to anyone interested in word origins or who just wants to learn something while doing some recreational reading."},{"Title":"A C language implementation of the SRO (Murdock) detector / analyzer (Open file report)","review":"Along with dictionaries and encyclopedias, the internet is making short work of classic reference works such as this one by Charles Funk, author of the similarly themedHorsefeathersandA Hog on Ice. In a world of Kindles and Nooks, physical books of all sorts are on the defensive, and even a Luddite like me reaches for a mouse first anymore rather than a dusty old tome when I'm looking for facts, definitions, or information on any other aspect of language, including word origins. As I am still quite interested in those kinds of things, old habits persuaded me to pick up THEREBY HANGS A TALE at a recent library sale, as I remembered enjoying a section of Mr. Funk's other classic work on curious phrase origins, A HOG ON ICE. This book follows much the same format as I remember HOG did - a paragraph or two which explains how a particular word evolved into the meaning we associate with it today. Such as 'academy', derived from Academus, in whose garden spot Plato frequented and taught.What follows is, as Dr. Funk describes it in his forward, a collection of accumulated material from thirty years prior to publishing A TALE, which arrived on shelves back in 1950. Even aside from the interest generated by the word origins is that some of the words Dr. Funk describes have slightly altered in meaning even between 1950 and 2012. It's nothing drastic, but a good example of how language continues to evolve.One of the charms of reference books is the ability to take a leisurely look around once you've got the information you were looking for in the first place. Thus, a quick check on how to spell 'etymology' might also bring to your attention 'entomology', or the origin of the words 'et cetera', etc., etc. If you are open to such charms, or to the holistic method of learning that such random searches can teach, or if you have a particular affinity for reading dictionaries, then THEREBY HANGS A TALE is still quite valuable. But for myself, I quickly found myself becoming disinterested. Before becoming spoiled by the instant access to this sort of information, I would probably have gladly shelved this with my other dictionaries, reverse dictionaries, picture dictionaries, grammar guides, and other assorted reference works on words. Now all those old friends are squirrelled away, on hold, I suppose, in case the Mayan Calendar Apocalypse knocks out the internet next month. It's unfortunate that I've lost the habit for poring through these old volumes, for all the reasons I've already given, and for their intrinsic charm, which is certainly in the eye of the holder, but the truth is I have. It isn't they that have lost value; it's that I'm not as open to it as I once was. Those readers still enamored with all things word-wise, and who have not also totally succumbed to Sky Net, will probably find as much worth here as ever."},{"Title":"A C language implementation of the SRO (Murdock) detector / analyzer (Open file report)","review":"I love the history of words and their origins.

Starting with the assignment of roles of villagers to play in the annual passion play, the novel turns into a real passion play.The village elders, a dismal lot of overfed, oppressive, back- biting types, pick various villagers to play roles in the once- every-seven-years passion play. However, Manolios (chosen to be Christ for his gentle looks) and three friends, chosen as apostles, are humbled by the honor and inspired to begin to struggle with God's will. The crisis is provided by a band of refugees from another village. Run out by the Turks, they seek sanctuary in this village only to be refused both land and food by the village elders who fear their corrupting influence and the loss of revenue. The contradiction between the words of Christ, and the actions of those who claim leadership of the church and the village lead Manolios and his friends to ask dangerous questions. The elders, as elders tend to do, are reluctant to give up any power, and not inclined to accept theological analysis from those who they command. Eventually, the passion is acted out for real, with Manolios accused of treason and the sleepy Turkish overlord acting the part of Pilate to perfection.Liberation Theology is a term we associate with the Roman Catholic Church in Latin America, but I would suggest that this work, dating from 1953, has anticipated the movement in amazing detail. Such standard concepts of Liberation Theology as \\"the preferential option for the poor,\\" \\"base communities,\\" reading the Bible out of experience rather than theology, and so forth, are portrayed here as Manolios and his friends struggle with what God has to say to them."},{"Title":"Christ recrucified: A novel","review":"Brilliant! The only book ever that I couldn't put down after starting. I read it over 14 hours in one sitting and the only thing that eclipsed the sensations the novel instilled in me was the epic thought that I had really, truly and for the first time read a book that physically, emotionally, intellectually drew me in so much that I couldn't put it down. Unputdownable? I can't get the thing out of my head! Like all Kazantzakis' novels the characters are drawn so roundly that you begin to cheer and seethe when they make an entrance. Really fully formed people inhabit this story - and what a story it is. A passion play takes on a mind of its own when the characters in character for the play begin to lose their grip on what is real and what is imaginary. It is explosive, sad, thrilling, genuinely laugh out loud funny, desperate, tragic, joyous. A wonderful book. Clips by a hair, the great Zorba. Now someone should make a movie out of this one....."},{"Title":"Christ recrucified: A novel","review":"A perfect novel and not to be missed.Profound, harrowing, and bursting with the fullness of the human heart-- also boisterous, merry, and bitingly satiric.And Unceasingly Entertaining.The year leading up to Easter week and the performance of the town's Passion Play finds the people of this Ottoman-occupied Greek village becoming transformed by Christ's story, as author Kazantzakis' novel encapsules the very history of the Christian Church.His is a fiercely nature-centric vision of Man's rude and clamorous confrontation with the struggle for right-ness, for rightousness in the face of smothering societal hypocrisy.Funny and sardonic, shocking and brutal, and often deeply beautiful, Christ Recrucified get's my highest recommendation."},{"Title":"Christ recrucified: A novel","review":"Jules Dassin filmed Kazantzakis' \\"Christ Recrucified\\" in 1957 as a French/Italian co-production under the title \\"Celui qui doit mourir\\" with Jean Servais, Bert Fr&ouml;be and Dassin's then-future wife Melina Mercouri in her first movie. It had a brief run on the US 'art house' circuit as \\"He Who Must Die\\",This is one of very few films that have stayed on my mind over the years, as has the book for that matter. \\"On the Waterfront\\", \\"Les enfants du Paradis\\" and \\"From Here to Eternity\\" are others in that select group, but this one hits a lot harder and deeper.AFAIK the movie has not (yet) been released on DVD, but if it ever is I'll be sure to buy a copy. Meanwhile, the book (which has a far less grim ending BTW) will do. Read it and weep."},{"Title":"Christ recrucified: A novel","review":"Following the tradition of his previous efforts, Kazantzakis here once again exemplifies the very tragedy of human nature through his allegory of Christ's crucifixion. This literary drama takes place in a remote Greek village where upon a group of wandering populace, who have lost their homes due to an invasion stumble, and come into conflict with the locals there. The story revolves around the dissonance between the affluent villagers and the down-trodden, starving wanderers. The key figure is Manolios, the son of the village's leader here who as the story unravels he slowly metamorphosises from a local childlike village boy into the figure of martyrdom that essentially symbolises Jesus Christ. Representing each camp are two orthodox priests who are antithetical in their demeanour and attitude. Papa-Fotis who is the priest leading the wanderers is a lean, poignant figure; disillusioned by the hardships of the world his ordained position as a priest takes on a tragic sense. It becomes apparent throughout the story that his tenacity lays more in a faith in Man rather than in an all-powerful Deity who will set things aright. Kazantzakis is quite known for his keenness in personalising intimate emotions and desires in key characters of his works. Here the sin of greed takes the form of an old loan shark who literally starves himself lest he spends money, the sin of pride takes the form of the stout, self-righteous priest of the village while the sin of envy takes the form of a man who is so overrun by enmity for Manolios in the end he will doom an entire village to see him perish. Manolios here is in constant torment, he denounces all worldly pleasures as he feels himself destined to martyrdom, an almost sacred debt he has been bestowed with. Throughout the work, one can feel his frustration, his temptations of his ascetic struggle towards the attainment of divinity. Yet Kazantzakis shines in this book not necessarily because of his exquisite depiction of his human characters but in his epic portrayal of the self-perpetuating drama of Mankind: the wandering people in the end continue to be wanderers; the villagers continue to indulge in sin, while the tragic realisation of the absurdity of human existence reverberates throughout the reader's mind. It's a book which leaves the reader with a rather bitter aftertaste with its pungent poignancy but is greatly rewarding in its climactic prose and spiritual insight."},{"Title":"Christ recrucified: A novel","review":"It's explosive, tragic and sad.

The story begins at a church social where everybody gets together and talks. When they are there they see a short fat man in a lab coat in a green tent outside the church. They went to see him; his name was Thadeus Blinn. He said, \\" I can give you anything you want for fifty cents.\\" They did not believe him, but they didn't know what they were in for. Polly Kemp did believe him for one second and during that second she made a wish that people would smile when they see her and she could always say good things. After that, when she said something mean, she would say, \\"Jug-a-rum\\" and people didn't smile, they laughed. She was in trouble. Just down the road Rowena Jervis was getting ready for Henry Piper to come to town. She wished he would put down roots and move to Coven Tree. He did exactly what she wished for, he turned into a tree. They were both in trouble. Later on, Adam Fiske was hauling water from Spider Crick. When he was finished he made a wish that the farm would be flooded with water. He got his wish, the barn was flooded when he woke up. All three were in trouble, but they all got an idea... Be careful what you wish for!"},{"Title":"The Wish Giver: Three Tales of Coven Tree","review":"The Wish Giver, a story told by a character, Stew Meat, broken up into three tales, a prologue, and an epilogue, is fantastic! Written by Bill Brittain and illustrated by Andrew Glass. The book starts off with the prologue; \\"The Strange Little Man\\", where Stew starts off with the first wild adventure. Stew Meat stumbles across a mildew covered tent that says: THADEUS BLINN, I CAN GIVE YOU WHATEVER YOU ASK FOR... ONLY .50 cents. Curiously, Stew casually walk into the tent, looking at the bench and spotting Polly Kemp; a fresh mouthed little girl with braided pig-tails, next to Polly sat Rowena Jervis; a fifteen, love-struck, young lady, and a good distance apart from her sat Adam Fiske; a young man that pretty much keeps to himself. When Stew sat down, Thaddeus Blinn told them \\"I can give you each one wish, but think about how to say it and what to say, for your wish will be granted exactly as it is said.\\" After paying their fifty cents, Thaddeus gives them each a white rectangular card with a red spot on it. Off went Thaddeus Blinn, with his mildew covered tent and $2.00, never to be seen in Coven Tree again.It would take too long for me to tell all of the tales, what with all of the great language, so I'll tell my favorite one; \\"Jug-a-rum\\". This tale is about Polly Kemp. Sometimes her mouth gets the best of her and gets her into trouble! Luckily, her best friends, Leland and Lenora Wickstaff are there to help her out this time. Polly only has 2 friends, the Wickstaff twins. Her wish, obviously, contained having attention and more friends. Well, Polly gets her wish, but not the way she wanted it to happen. To give you a hint on what happens, she likes frogs and other critters in that category. Also, don't forget that the name of this tale is \\"Jug-a-rum\\". I got so into the book, that I felt like I was there with Polly, Rowena, and Adamduring their adventures.Think that the author's message is that you should whatch what you wish for and how you say. I loved this book and I know that you would, and hopefully will too!"},{"Title":"The Wish Giver: Three Tales of Coven Tree","review":"I remember reading this book in 4th grade. I absolutely LOVED it.

In Jug - A - Rum, it talks about Polly Kemp and her wish. In The Tree Man, it talks about Rowena Jervis and her wish. In Water, Water Everywhere, it talks about Adam Fiske and his wish.

It is a quick, easy read full of fun characters and humorous incidents. My only complaint is that I found it to be extremely predictable; I knew how it was going to end from almost the very beginning. So for me this book really didn't have much mystery or suspense, but I still enjoyed it and didn't want to put it down. I think this would definitely be a big hit with young readers, but older readers who just want something that is humorous, lighthearted and refreshing will enjoy it as well. This is definitely a good one for the kids!"},{"Title":"The Wish Giver: Three Tales of Coven Tree","review":"After my third grade teacher read this book to us, mostly everyone wanted to get it in the school library!

There wishes do come true but not in the way the expected!"},{"Title":"The Wish Giver: Three Tales of Coven Tree","review":"I read this book when I was in Elementary school and its still one of my favorites to this day. It's creative, funny and teaches a very valuable lesson - Be careful what you wish for."},{"Title":"The Wish Giver: Three Tales of Coven Tree","review":"This is a wonderful book by the author of Dr. Dredd's Wagon of Wonders. It's about four people and the effects of wish cards sold to them by a strange man named Thaddeus Blinn. The four recipients of these cards are Polly Kemp, Rowena Jervis, Adam Fiske, and the town shopkeeper, \\"Stew Meat\\". Thaddeus Blinn's cards have the power to grant any wish that is asked of it- exactly as it is phrased- for only fifty cents. This is a great book, and I would recommend it to anyone, along with the other books that tell of Coven Tree. Very exciting!"},{"Title":"The Wish Giver: Three Tales of Coven Tree","review":"This story is about a strange man named Thaddeus Blinn who came to the town of Coven Tree. He had a tent and a sign in front of it read that he could give whatever anyone asks for and it was only 50 cents. Most poeple walked by thinking that there was no such thing as making dreams come true except Rowena, Polly, Adam, and Stew Meat. They recieved a card with a red dot on the middle and were told to make a wish while pressing the red dot. They all walked out with the card in their hands and went home and tried forgetting about it because they thought it was impossible. They all made their wishes after a couple of days, but the bad news was that none of them got their wishes the way they wanted it. All except Stew Meat had made a wish. He was still thinking of what he should wish for...My favorite character in this story was Stew Meat because he was kind... After reading this book, it made me wonder if there could really be a person out there who can grant wishes and other magical things.This was one of my favorites and another story that has magic like in this book is Harry Potter.This book has been recommended to me by a teacher because I liked the book, Harry Potter so much. I think that poeple who are interested in adventors and mysterious magic, will like this book and also learn a lesson from it too."},{"Title":"The Wish Giver: Three Tales of Coven Tree","review":"The Wish Giver was a good it is adventurous. There is four main characters they are Polly, Rowana, Adam. Stew. They all made the wishes and they all went wrong. Polly's wish was to be popular. And it went wrong. Rowana's wish was that Henry would put down roots in Coven Tree. Adam's wish was that it would rain, because the crops were dry. Stew's wish was that all the other wishes would turn back to normal."},{"Title":"The Wish Giver: Three Tales of Coven Tree","review":"I read the book called The Wish Giver. The book started out slow but as I started to read more into the books I thought it was good. When people started to make wishes it made me wonder what I would want to wish for. When I first asked myself that question I thought that I would wish for more wishes, but after I read the book I changed my mind I would wish for there to be no more wishing because all the wishes turned out to be bad. I would recomend this book to any one who likes an adventure or just likes to read or hear a good story that pulls you in to read more as the book goes on. Over all I found the book very interesting."},{"Title":"The Wish Giver: Three Tales of Coven Tree","review":"I like this book because it's surprising. This book is surprising because there are four characters and each character makes a wish. Once the first girl makes a wish, you try to guess the rest of the wishes. Also the book is well written, and the wishes were granted in a funny way. I think fifth and sixth graders should read this book because it's unexpected."},{"Title":"The Wish Giver: Three Tales of Coven Tree","review":"The Wish Giver is about a strange little man called Thaddius Blinn that gives four magic cards to three kids and one adult.

Some parts were really exciting. This book had many problems. They didn't know how to unrealease their wishes. They all wished on something they really wanted. Then it comes out that something bad happens. I always wanted to read more whenever we ran out of time. I think people who like mysteries and fantasy books would enjoy this book."},{"Title":"The Wish Giver: Three Tales of Coven Tree","review":"I thought The Wish Giver was a good book. The author described what was going on with great detail. I could picture every chapter in my head. Since the book was a fantasy it's harder to get the reader to picture it, but Bill Brittain did a good job. For this book I always wanted to read more and see how the next wish was going to turn out. The book told how three people had the chance to make one wish. They made their wish, but it wasn't exactly what they wished for."},{"Title":"The Wish Giver: Three Tales of Coven Tree","review":"I really enjoyed Bill Brittain's book,\\"The Wish Giver\\". I liked this book because it was a mysterious book. It is a mystery because you do not know what the kids are going to wish for. There are four main characters,Polly,Rowena,Adam,and Stew Meat. Polly,Rowena,Adam,and Stew all make wishes, but you have to find out by reading this book. If you are looking for a good book,like mysteries, you will definently like this one."},{"Title":"The Wish Giver: Three Tales of Coven Tree","review":"&quot;...What book should I have him read?&quot;Your would-be lawyer prodigy should read 'The Wish Giver' to learn early on the difference between the letter and the spirit of the law. In this case, the law of magic, and the 'just desserts' granted by its mysterious logic.Fact: After reading this book as an 8 year old girl, I spent hours of my time designing wishes in contractual format that would not allow my wish giver to cheat me one bit.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Wish Giver: Three Tales of Coven Tree","review":"I just finished reading a great book by Bill Brittain called The Wish Giver. The book consists of three sections,Jug-a-Rm, The Tree Man, and Water, Water, Everywhere. In Jug-a-Rum, a girl named Polly made a wish to be noticed. She sure got that wish but not in the best way. She started to croak like a frog. In The Tree Man, another girl named Rowena made a wish that her boyfriend would never leave. Well, she didn't word her wish right and her boyfriend got turned into a tree. Finally, in Water, Water, Everywhere, a kid named Adam made a wish that his farm would get more water because it didn't have much. Well, so much water came because of his wish that he and his family were flooded out. In the end a man named Stew Meat wished all three wishes would go away, and they did. Thecharacters that were in the book were pretty cool. Theonly one I disliked was Rowena and her story. I disliked this section because it wasn't as exciting as the other sections. Overall, I think it was a great book. I would recommend it to anyone who likes magical and mysterious books like, one of my favorites, Harry Potter."},{"Title":"The Wish Giver: Three Tales of Coven Tree","review":"This book is one that everybody should have. It is about three youngsters who visit a magic man named Thaddeus Blinn, who claims that he can give them whatever they want for only fifty cents each. Each one gets a white card with a red spot on it. They are to place their thumbs on the red spot and say what they wish for. Well, one of them wishes that she would be popular and ends up sounding like a frog. Another wishes that her boyfriend would never leave her, but she doesn't say her wish right and her boyfriend puts down tree roots. Another wishes his fathers farm would have enough water, but instead the farm gets flooded. I hope to one day see a movie made out of this."},{"Title":"The Wish Giver: Three Tales of Coven Tree","review":"The book The Wish Giver was very exciting because there were 3-5 main events, and they were all pretty crazy. It was kind-of mysterious because you could never make a reasonable prediction unless you really thought about your clues and what was going on in the story. This story had alot of suspense also. A brief summary is: There was a church social oneday. Alot of Coven Tree's townspeople went. Stew Meat, Polly Kemp, Rowena Jervis, and Adam Fiske went to Thaddeus Blinn's {the Wish Giver's} tent and bought a card with a red dot on it for $0.50 per card. They each got one card. When they wanted to make their wish, they put their thumb on the red dot and said their wish out loud. After reading this wonderful book, you will probably learn this lesson : be careful what you wish for."},{"Title":"The Wish Giver: Three Tales of Coven Tree","review":"The Wish Giver is an outstanding story involving magic, fantasy, and problem solving at its best. Set in the small town of Coven Tree, Stew Meat and three youngsters encounter Thaddeus Blinn, a sinister traveling magic man. Wishes are made, and they all come true, with some intersting results. Children and adults both will enjoy this enchanting tale of mystery and humor.

I liked it bacause I think magic is cool."},{"Title":"The Wish Giver: Three Tales of Coven Tree","review":"I rate the Wish Giver by Bill Brittain a five star book. Some characters in the story were Polly Kemp, a girl that said whatever she wanted; Rowena Jervis, a girl in love with Henry Piper; Adam Fiske, a boy that has no water under his whole barn and house; Henry Piper, a salesman that lies to Rowena about going places and Thaddeus Blinn, a man of magic that will give you whatever you want for only 50 cents. I liked it because it was funny. For example Polly Kemp said Jug-A-Rum every time she said something insulting to some one. Rowena Jervis turned her boyfriend Henry Piper into a tree. Adam Fiske flooded his barn and house with water that shot up from the ground. If you want to know how all those weird things happened than read this book!"},{"Title":"The Wish Giver: Three Tales of Coven Tree","review":"A mysterious little man with curiously snake-like eyes comes to town.

This is a book that anyone will enjoy, especially people who love magic. The book is about three children who make wishes---ones that don't turn out the way they expect!

Two kids come named Adam and Lizzie. Adam wished for all different kinds of animals and Lizzie wished for most of America to be nature land. Adam was a goofy guy and was always making jokes but Lizzie was a smart girl. The wish giver was a four feet tall man with a big bearded. This story was set in Iowa in1959 and in a carnival. It's a fiction book more than anything. What I think Ron did a good job in writing The Wish Giver. He used good voice and similes. He also made you think your in the book.I would suggest this book to people who like weird people with strange problems. I would also suggest this book to people who want to have fun and read a good book. This book taught me how to appreciate what I have because Adam and Lizzie couldn't find the wish giver and they want their old life back. If you want to find out what happens to Lizzie and Adam read The Wish Giver."},{"Title":"The Wish Giver: Three Tales of Coven Tree","review":"I think this book is good because it has a lot of mystery.

It not only explained the purpose of each piece but gave an insiders view on its application as well as a host of other tips. This book is allmost the complete opposite. For the price, I received what amounts to a reprint of some general information from the grip book, plus some reproduced catalog information from the various manufacturers of camera mounts, cranes, trusses, etc. What I expected to find: how to rig a camera to a vehicle, how to rig equipment to structures, scaffolding, etc., how to build rigs or to adapt commercially available equipment. A skinny little book, hardly worth the money."},{"Title":"Uva's Rigging Guide for Studio and Location","review":"I totaly concur with the other review. Not enough real GRIP info. I've been a grip for over 10 years and actually thought I'd get something usefull, but actually this book is just the last few chapters of the Grip Book, drawn out, for 50 bucks. I mean, yea there's an illustration of mounting on a DC3 Plane, but its crappy and nonspecific. I mean there's almost more AC and Electric info than Grip. Underwater Exposure Housings? Ummm not Grip Dept. I'm just getting more into rigging and wanted to see more real world stuff, not even a mention of speedrail/nurail in the Index or Glossary, and barely a page in between brings it up and we know how important it is in rigging and on the spot ingenuity.The most important part of this book is \\"The Big Break\\", how to act on set for noobs, pretty much."},{"Title":"Beginning German","review":"This is an old book but if you like \\"How to Speak and Write It by Joseph Rosenberg\\" you will also appreciate this book. Also, if you like \\"Conversational German in 20 lesson by Cortina Method\\" you will also appreciate this book.One of the best thing about this book is that it starts each lesson with a German reading text and vocabulary. This is similar to \\"Conversational German in 20 lesson by Cortina Method.\\" Also, it has a detail grammar guide of German to English vocabulary section.I do not recommend this book to someone that is looking for modern spelling because this book was printed before the German Spelling Reform in 1996 changing the double ss and the sharp S which looks like our capital letter B.I enjoy this book also as an artist because it also shows the old writing of German type on pages 260 - 261 in the Appendix which explains how to distinguish in reading the old German type which is helpful to calligraphers.PenandInk777"},{"Title":"Twist of Lime: A Lynn Evans Mystery","review":"Valley Gay Press Book Reviewer: Liz BradburyI really wanted to like this book. It had potential - lesbian mystery, warm sandy beaches, romance, intrigue... But it didn't pay off. While the descriptions of the landscape in Belize were fairly lush, the character development and action seemed stunted and flat.There's really no mystery for the reader to figure out, no clues, just the solution revealed at the end. When main character of the series Lynn Evans meets the sultry Ivette, there's little tension and their ultimate affair is so abbreviated it seems as though a prudish editor cut it out and substituted the words \\"They made love.\\" In fact the whole book seems cut down, maybe it was, at only 188 pages.At least the characters don't suffer from low self-esteem and internalized homophobia, like many characters in other lesbian mystery stories of the last ten years. So good for Claudia McKay on that point.McKay has written other novels more recently, (she wrote this in one 1997). I'd bet she could pull off a better effort if she had better editorial help and less restrictions (and if someone would let her use contractions in her dialog, after all, that's the way people talk!). Here's hoping."},{"Title":"Twist of Lime: A Lynn Evans Mystery","review":"I bought this book because it takes place in Belize and is about an archaeological expedition murder mystery. Sounds great...but it only sounds great. The book is terrible. The author has the annoying habit of asking full paragraphs of 'what ifs'? . I figured that since it was a Lesbian title than at least the sex would be good. That is not the case either.

The same goes if you are an adventurous cook looking for something new and you have unlimited time to find the right ingredients.However, if you are looking for a few simple recipes to quickly pull together in your kitchen at home (in the U.S.) this book won't work.I gave it three stars because it is well written for the right audience - but not practical for the U.S. homemaker."},{"Title":"The Four Seasons and Other Violin Concertos in Full Score: Opus 8, Complete (Dover Music Scores)","review":"This is no doubt the best music score Dover Publications (which generally publishes high quality reprints of older editions) has ever put out.

The tone is sardonically professorial, and this frequently leads to recipes that will have you rolling on the floor in merriment. Again, read the recipe on turtle soup. Or the recipe for raisen wine.

Their usual response: &quot;Look it up!&quot; and that only meant one thing, &quot;Look it up in Wise.&quot;This book was the source of often fascinating information, as well as hours of fun - and even laughter - for our family. The laughter came because I could never put it down! It seemed that every time I turned to it for an answer, it would never be so easy as just getting the answer, and that's that. This book is so well cross-referenced, I'd inevitably get stuck in it for what seemed like hours (and often probably was) following all the &quot;which see&quot; and &quot;see also&quot; references.

This is a must read for people who are serious about ministy."},{"Title":"The Boomerang Mandate: Returning the Ministry to the People of God","review":"It is easy to believe that only pastors should do ministry and serve others. That is the easy way out for most Christian. The reality is that God wants pastors to equip us lay people for ministry. In fact God calls us to be His ministers. We have been ministered to, now it is our turn to minister: hence the name of this book, The Boomerang Mandate. What has gone around surely must come around. This little book presents clear and concise suggestions on how pastors can share ministry and its benefits with the lay people in his church. It also gives simple instructions for those doing ministry. It is not a technical book, and is quite easy to read. The author makes it real and practical by relating stories and incidents from his own ministry to introduce and illustrate various areas in which Christians can serve. This little book is well worth having."},{"Title":"Diagnosis in Color: Sexually Transmitted Diseases, 2e (Diagnosis in Colour)","review":"I am Dr.Khan from Saudi Arabia.I read this book when I was doing my training in Genitourinay Medicine from University of London UK.I found this book simple,easy to understand,the pictures are marvelous.It helped me allot in preparing for my exams.I still consult it off and on.I have also read it's old edition but the new one has focused allot on HIV related disorders.

Gilbert lets the reader know that this is just a preview of a much larger collection of maps and photographs about the Holocaust.The book is half good and half average. Gilbert finds some very good photographs of both concentration camps, and average street signs demanding Jews leave the subject town. A telling map by Gilbert shows all the world's countries that rejected Jews because of their own stringent immigration policy, sending many people to their deaths because of red tape (the United States included).The cover of the book shows two young boys, victims of starvation, and Gilbert does not let you forget that children made up more than a million of the casualties of the final solution. A heartbreaking photograph shows four men and a young boy, stripped of their clothes and their dignity, about to be shot by some Nazi soldiers. Everyone forgets the children.Gilbert does try to put too much information into some of his maps, and these overwhelm the more effective photography. The maps feature shocking numbers and information, but Gilbert is trying to do too much with too little.Gilbert is a respected historian, and this little book serves as a good introduction to both his writing, and the history of the Holocaust, but a reader doing research might be better served with a more complete volume.Quote: (underneath a photograph of a tired looking woman, taken during Hanukkah 1942):\\"It was her last Hannuka celebration, for within a year she had been seized by the Gestapo and deported to Sobibor concentration camp, where she was murdered.

It is not a travel guide for modern Iran. Rather, it is a guide for those who want to visit the ancient cities and monuments of the Persian Empire. Sir Roger Stevens, former British ambassador to Iran, exhibited excellent scholarship in his coverage of the history, religion, and the art of the Persian Empire.My fondest memories of using his book were during my travels in Khuzistan. Sir Roger Stevens wrote about Sassanian bridges in Khuzistan built under the inspiration of the Roman Empire. Unlike large monuments or ancient cities, the ancient bridges are unlikely to be listed in maps or in guide books. In Dizful, I had to ask several residents until I found someone who knew where to find Shapur's bridge.Sir Roger Stevens' contribution is important, also, in terms of being an inspiration for anyone who is serious about working in embassies or in multinational enterprises. In my travels and work overseas, I observed that the British embassies appeared to be requiring many foreign service workers to master the language of the assigned country and to remain in the assigned country for many years. Unfortunately, many other countries appear to be hiring workers who simply want to see the world and do not want to learn about the languages, histories, and cultures of the assigned countries."},{"Title":"The Authoritative and Authoritarian in Islamic Discourses","review":"Asalamu Alaikum dear readers, It has been a long time since the Muslim ummah has lived without a state and it seems that it maybe even longer with the types of scholars who contributed to this book. It seems that these so-called scholars are perfectly in line with American Policy to delay the establishment of an islamic state. The discourse is academic and lacks the ability to motivate muslims to re-establish Islam. These orientalists, such as Jackson and Fadl don't give the muslims any incentive to work to re-establish the state. In fact the book is very discouraging. I would expect such an attack against the political infrastructure of islam to come from non-muslims. Who knows, these guys may be CIA...May Allah (SBT) protect us from these uncle toms!"},{"Title":"The Authoritative and Authoritarian in Islamic Discourses","review":"Al salamu alaikum. This is such an important book that it pains me that many Muslims attack it without understanding it. A perfect example: &quot;Abdullah from USA&quot; in the review below feels perfectly comfortable committing slander against the author, saying he is CIA, when it is obvious from Abdullah's comments that either Abdullah did not read the book, or if he did, did not understand it at all. Abdullah calls Fadl and Jackson &quot;orientalists&quot;. If Abdullah knew what &quot;orientalism&quot; means, or knew anything about these scholars, he would have realized how silly his comment truly is! This book calls for intelligence and responsibility in matters of Islamic law, which should be the very basis of a Muslim ummah. It seems that for Abdullah and many other Muslims today, ANY Muslim ummah or political infrastructure will do; forget about the quality of it! This book gives a clear example of what we, as Muslims, should expect of our scholars and the degree of care and effort which should be exerted in issuing fatwas. It is wrong to call someone an Uncle Tom, simply because he criticizes the standards we accept as Muslims today. This book is not anti-ummah. It is pro-intelligence and diligence, true Islamic characteristics. May Allah forgive Abdullah for his arrogance, ignorance and slander, and may Allah help us increase our knowledge and demand more of ourselves in the pursuit of His Truth."},{"Title":"The Authoritative and Authoritarian in Islamic Discourses","review":"I have read this book and truly think it is one of its kind! I had studied Islamic law in Saudi Arabia and went through the traditional channels of acquiring the knowledge. When I read this book for the first time, I came to appreciate the richness and complexity of the Islamic legal system.While the reader before me said that that &quot; EVERYONE agrees that Mr. Palmer is not authoritative&quot;, it seems that previous reader has not been in touch with Islamic seen in the US. Mr. Palmer is invited to speak at many different conferences on almost monthly basis.In another matter, the previous reader missed the whole point of the book. Mr. Plamer was not the topic of discussion, and the author made that very clear in the very first few pages of the book. The author stated that he is not concerned with Mr. Plamer, what the author is concerned with is the style and methodology of Mr. Palmer. The author used Mr. Palmer fatawa as an example of the underlying problem that exists within the Muslim society in the west.The previous reader contradict him self is by stating that the book deals with &quot;the obvious&quot;, so you would assume that the book was too detailed in discussing that. However, the reader in the line after that claims that &quot;book is much to brief given the scope of its topic&quot;! I thought that it topic was &quot;the obvious&quot; thus it was too long, or was it both, too long and too short?As a person who studied Islamic law for a while, I would recommend reading this book to everyone. At the same time, I must admit that it is a heavy reading material and one should go slow through it. Otherwise, one would miss the whole point of the book, as our previous reader did."},{"Title":"The Authoritative and Authoritarian in Islamic Discourses","review":"The book, is an intelligent manner, presents the complexity of Islamic thought and aspects. It adds that Islam is not a religion of traditions, of a certain culture,or view. Although it is a religion with a clear struture,it requires us to observe issues with the intelligent thought and knowledge the religion deserves. This book should defenitely be read by anyone with interest in Islam."},{"Title":"The Authoritative and Authoritarian in Islamic Discourses","review":"This deceptively short work is one of the most important, if not the most important, book on Islam and Islamic law today. Despite its rather modest and unassuming appearance from its cover as a published work, and its deceptively &quot;self-explanatory&quot; title (people assume they know what the book is about without reading it), this book is a powerhouse of intellect, reason and enlightenment. Its implications are broad and conclusions painfully self-evident; so much so that it has drawn significant controversy and resistance from those unwilling to bear the weight of accountability that Abou El Fadl so eloquently demonstrates that Islamic law requires. Far from the contemporary presumption that Islamic law takes a black and white position on most issues, as most activists and self-declared scholars would have people believe, the book captures centuries-old legal traditions, debates and reasoning, and applies their implications to a contemporary situation. The result is clear and startling. Islamic law is simultaneously subtle, dynamic, balanced and humanistic; and it is based in morality, reason and responsibility. In fact, this book is much more than a work on Islamic law; it is a testament to the rich and sophisticated Islamic heritage of which it is a product, and which sadly, is in scarce existence today. Readers will find themselves either immediately hooked or quickly overwhelmed by the exacting logic, penetrating reasoning, and rich legal expertise which the author demonstrates and obviously masters. Would-be scholars and activists would be wise to rethink their own representations of Islamic law, given the new standard of scholarship illustrated and dictated by the examples set forth in this book. Anyone with an intellect will not settle for less. It is true that this book will change your perceptions of Islamic law. This is a must-read for anyone interested in developing their intellect in this field of study. It is one of those books where each time you pick it up, you learn something new, even if you have read it many times before. It is a work to be studied, reflected upon and discussed. Anyone who does not readily see the importance and far-reaching implications of this work simply did not understand it to begin with."},{"Title":"The Authoritative and Authoritarian in Islamic Discourses","review":"It is always amazing that people who are authorities in Islamic law welcomed the book and thought very highly of it. However, there are people who are not qualified in the field of Islamic law, yet they try to attack the book and its author. It is a spectacular and an enlightening book...read it and you will not think of Islam the same way."},{"Title":"The Authoritative and Authoritarian in Islamic Discourses","review":"This book is remarkable in its simplicity, extraordinary in its implications, and revolutionary in the understanding it proposes. It is a must read for anyone studying law in general and specifically, canonical law."},{"Title":"The Authoritative and Authoritarian in Islamic Discourses","review":"Rarely has a book been published which not only entices the reader with a fascinating subject matter, but challenges one's mind so thoroughly and completely. Abou El Fadl's book is clearly the most important contribution to Islamic legal discourses this century. The content will mesmerize anyone sincerely interested in the complexity and sophistication of a forgotten tradition."},{"Title":"The Authoritative and Authoritarian in Islamic Discourses","review":"This book is an excellent critique of how debates and dialogues within the contemporary Muslim community are currently structured. It poignantly points out, through a case study, how endemic Islamic discourses have truly become. They lack real substance, and more importantly lack discipline and sincerity in the search for the Divine Will in today's world. A thought-provoking work."},{"Title":"The Authoritative and Authoritarian in Islamic Discourses","review":"&quot;This is an exhaustive and in-depth study written with the kind of integrity that is necessary for the development of Islamic thinking and the reformation of its political discourse...It should become the subject of serious debate...This is a masterful study and an exceptional book.&quot; Fahmy Huwaydi"},{"Title":"The Authoritative and Authoritarian in Islamic Discourses","review":"The book attempts to redefine, or at the very least blur, what is &quot;authoritative&quot; in Islamic Law. The author attacks a &quot;fatwa&quot; put forth by Idris Palmer. The author must admit that EVERYONE agrees that Mr. Palmer is not authoritative and therefore his opinion, like any non-specialist's opinion, is of little or no worth and should not be a topic of discussion amongst academics. For the author to claim that Palmer's opinion is a fatwa brings into question his own understanding of what can may be considered authoritarian in the first place. Through excessive questioning of the obvious, the book confuses the reader about what is truly authoritative in Islamic Law; namely, the Quran and Prophetic Tradition (Sunna). Finally, the book is much to brief given the scope of its topic. My suggestion is that anyone reading this book should be grounded in basic Islamic disciplines; ironically, anyone firmly grounded in these studies would probably not bother reading this book in the first place."},{"Title":"Fury Beach","review":"John Ross, who had earlier failed to find the Northwest passage and had created a mirage of \`Lancaster sound' in 1818 returned in 1828 to lead an expedition by steam to seek out the Northwest passage and map the arctic. He ended up stranded for almost four years. His men survived on meager rations while learning from the natives. A small party led by his Nephew James Ross also discovered the Magnetic North Pole.This is an amazing account of the ordeal of this harrowing journey into the arctic wasteland. Well written, its greatest downfall is that it includes only one map. This book will be enjoyed by anyone interested in the arctic, seafaring, adventure or survival stories. For further reading \`Barrows Boys' by Fleming, \`Into Thin Air, and \`Sea of Glory' by Philbrick will be of great interest."},{"Title":"Fury Beach","review":"Fury Beach by Ray Edinger combines thorough research with a rousing good story. The lengthy bibliography and index suggest the extensive research that went into producing this book. Well written, it is actually two stories for the price of one: a tale of an Arctic voyage of discovery and scientific research and the heart-warming story of the interaction of two cultures, an Inuit tribe and Englishmen, meeting for the first time and things actually go right. People treat each other with kindness and respect. Friendships result. I particularly liked the short snippets of biographies at the close of the book that explained what happened to the participants after the adventure ended. There are many illustrations, all charming."},{"Title":"Three spirituals from earth to heaven","review":"This is Allan Rohan Crite's second book following \\"Were You There When They Crucified My Lord\\" (Harvard, 1944). Although definately not as well known as he should be due to his own good nature, dedication to his parents, and unwillingness to turn a gross profit off of his own works, Crite is an American artist of no little renown. Crite's work here is a deeply symbolic testament to his faith, and one needn't be religious to appreciate his skill. The figures are all dark in hue, although they all have a variety of different phisical/racial features. For me, this has the effect of bluring the importance of race-color in Crite's Spirituality. The lonely and the weary can be comforted, and humanity is capable of such a grand pageant.This volume includes illustrations for 3 traditional hymns. Each lavish drawing takes up an entire page, with a line from the hymn (in order) beneath it. This is a very moving work executed in ink pen and brush, Crite's illustrations are detailed in rendering a fine vision of glory. The style is reminiscent of stained glass iconography.In \\"Nobody Knows the Trouble I See\\", angels and saints guide a weary Black farmer to heaven, cloak him in glory, and usher him in to meet Jesus.\\"Swing Low Sweet Chariot\\" sees a winged chariot descending on the fields of an elderly Black tenant farmer resting by a stream. Angels lift him into the chariot and bring him through the gates of heaven. The detail on the wings alone is pure magnificence!\\"Heaven\\" is the last and lengthiest of the pageants, containing numerous full-page illustrations of parades of robed angels singing, playing a diverse collection of musical instruments, walking through the firmament of heaven, culminating in the crowning of the occupants of heaven and the entrance of Jesus.Seeing and considering Crite's works are a must for every pen & brush ink artist, in my opinion. At any rate, Crite's style has most definately influenced and impacted me! I suppose you, too will have to see for yourself. :)"},{"Title":"The Prairie Train","review":"The professional reviews did not prepare me for the poignancy and beauty of this story. The story is of a young boy, forced to leave behind his home, loved-ones, comfort, and security for the unknown adventure of the new world. His link to the known and familiar was a small wooden boat carved by his grandfather. Just as he was beginning to embrace the wonder and awe of his beautiful adventure the boat slips from his hands and is lost forever in the prairie grass. Despite the attempts of parents to comfort him in his loss, the longing for home and things as they were envelope his thoughts and he will not be comforted.That night his grandfather comes to him in a dream and counsels him, as only a grandfather can, to leave behind the sadness and look forward to the beauty awaiting at the journey's end. In that brief heart-to-heart talk with his grandfather the boy is lifted and the new day dawns with a fresh resolve to cheerfully move forward.The story will resonate with anyone who has had to face the unknown or has had to journey to a new world leaving a comfortable world behind. Did I forget to mention there are boats and a train sailing over the ocean and prairie to hold the imagination of a young child? For the young child the loss of the toy boat is a signal that the story is about to take off to new adventures. While my little one understands the loss of a treasured toy he doesn't have the experience to let more subtle concerns interfere with a good story and great pictures.As for me, it is satisfying to find a book with an underlying message on par with The Little Engine that Could and \\"I think I can.\\" But this story touches deeper than what the happy little girls and boys on the other side of the mountain can appreciate. Parents and Grandparents will find this a satisfying reading experience with their young explorer. This book gives both the reader and the listener a wonderful feeling, that is, in the words of the inside cover flap, \\"deeply satisfying.\\"The artwork is beautiful. The inside covers have a beautiful stylistic map of the journey from Connemara Ireland to San Francisco."},{"Title":"The Prairie Train","review":"In The Prairie Train, Irish playwright Antoine &Oacute; Flatharta adeptly brings the magic of trains to a story of hope and longing among an immigrant family looking for a better life in the New World. Told through the eyes of a young homesick boy named Conor, the story will appeal not only to children crazy about trains, but also to anyone who's had to move or leave something or someone behind.The gorgeously illustrated topographical map of Conor's journey at the front and back of the book sets the scene. It's the 1890s and an Irish family sets sail from the scenic peninsula of Connemara in County Galway to New York. After the family has made it to Chicago, the narrative begins like a fairy tale,\\"Once upon a time, there was a train that dreamed of being a boat.\\"As the train leaves Chicago, Conor stares at the toy wooden boat his grandfather had carved for him and listens to the unfamiliar sounds of the polyglot crowd. He sticks his head out the window to get a better view of the train and wave to the engine, but in doing so he inadvertently drops his treasured toy boat out the window.Conor's cries to stop the train go largely unheeded as his fellow passengers and ultimately the train itself chime in with a chorus of, \\"Can't stop the train.\\" The steam train's gentle rocking from side to side induces sleep and Conor's dream is the antidote to his homesickness. You'll need to read the rest; revealing the dream would spoil the adventure."},{"Title":"The Prairie Train","review":"This is one of my son's favorite book. He reads it all the time.

He gives the advantages and disadvantages of each: namely, liquidity versus returns. Now, we get into the meat of the subject matter. First, Mr. Masters argues that an investor should own their own primary residence and have 12 months of expenses in the bank before venturing to invest in commercial real estate: conversative, but good enough advice. He gives comparisons between different commercial properties you can invest into, with garden apartment complexes and anchored shopping centers getting his nod as the best investment choices for a real estate novice. He argues that novice investors should form investment clubs to invest in real estate together; however, he gives very little advice as how to hold title and what form of ownership the group should take. I understand that people must consult with tax and legal professionals to see what best matches their situation, but it would have been nice to have Mr. Masters elaborate on this since its a key argument of his book.To find property, Mr. Masters tells the aspiring investor to work with a knowlegable broker and not purchase a property with a cash-on-cash return or a cap-rate under 8-10%. While I agree its very important to buy properties with positive cash-flow, this is one of my biggest issues with this book: while in theory it'd be great to skip every property that offers lower returns, in today's market its virtually impossible in most top markets to find properties with those types of returns. If you follow the advice of the author, it will now be impossible to purcahse most investment opportunities as he does not leave room for exceptions in his rule. He also ignores other calculations and never shows how to construct an APOD, which really dates this book. There is no mention of an IRR or projected cash-flows. He also never says to independently confirm the income and expense figures given by the seller even though 9 times out 10 the cap-rate the seller gives on a property is calculated off of proforma numbers that are not aligned with market realities. I can sum up his financing section in a single sentence: find a good mortgage broker to find you a good rate on a fixed, 15-30 year mortgage. And to manage your property? Use a professional management company and watch them for a year to see how they do it, then you can consider doing it on your own. He gives very little helpful advice on what to look for in a management company, mortgage broker, or real estate broker as well.Tax information is included relegated to an appendix, yet it doesn't even touch on a 1031 tax-deferred exchange and tax implications of real estate investments are hardly touched upon, and when they are, they're no longer applicable as tax laws have changed. I don't remember reading anything about what will effect the basis of your property, how to calculate cash-flow after taxes, or even more than a few quick words about depreciation!For someone who has purchased their own home or has even a little bit of real estate knowledge, this book has little pratical use -- the only difference between this book and better, cheaper books that I've read is the author's limited information on investment clubs. He even gives poor advice on finding information online: he tells the reader to go online and type in a few keywords on a search engine, not realizing that the reader will find plenty of advertisers and unscrupulous companies in the results.For anyone who's interested in investing in real estate, I recommend the first thing they learn is how to evaluate properties so they know what to look for in an investment opportunity. To that extent, I highly recommend Frank Gallinelli's \\"What Every Real Estate Investor Needs to Know About Cash Flow and 36 Other Key Financial Measures\\", a far-superior, more-practical, and less expensive book."},{"Title":"How To Make Money in Commercial Real Estate: for the Small Investor","review":"When I decided I wanted to learn more about commercial real estate investment, I bought a pile of books that claimed to be relevant and started working my way through them. This one was the ONLY one that I feel was really worth the read. It starts out by ascertaining whether the reader is truly ready to buy commercial real estate, taking a very prudent view of personal finances. It lays out everything worthwhile that any of the books on this subject lay out, and does so in a very readable manner. At the same time, it does not talk down to the reader or try to &quot;dumb down&quot; any of the material. I would suggest starting with only this book, and then buying other books (or talking to experts) in a more focussed manner, based upon what you find here.

The book is great for persons without any knowledge of commercial real estate and is a good reference book for persons with experience in commercial real estate.It is worth noting, however, that the much of the author's experience with investment real estate seemed to be during the 1970's decade. During that period of time there was hyper inflation in the real estate market. Often values and prices paid for real estate did not make much sense.Some of the examples in the book refer to properties indicated to be worth several million dollars - and not exactly what you would call a small investment property.However, the financial scenarios in this book are based on reasonably sound financial and economic theory.

I not only enhanced my knowledge of real estate investing, but also got a refresher in economics. Masters discusses many tools and tips on the best way to get started and shares his experiences both good and bad. While he answered many questions that I had, he opened the doors to other questions I never thought of. I thought I was ready, but now I realize I still have some work to do."},{"Title":"How To Make Money in Commercial Real Estate: for the Small Investor","review":"For a former accounting professor, Masters gets the numbers all wrong in this book. Using the logic in this book, Masters gets up to a 43% long-term annual return on real estate investments. In CH5 where Masters describes the source of real estate profits, the author includes paydown of a mortgage loans principal as one of the sources. In fact principle payments increase the amount invested in the property and reduces the return rather than increases it. This is just where the errors begin.Masters targets this book at neophyte small investers. My advice is that neophytes who don't have a sound understanding of finance should stay far away from this book. For anyone else it's buyer beware."},{"Title":"How To Make Money in Commercial Real Estate: for the Small Investor","review":"its a good book but very basic. i was looking for something more detailed and was a disappointed, but if you know nothing about real estate, it'll give u a good understanding."},{"Title":"How To Make Money in Commercial Real Estate: for the Small Investor","review":"On the whole, the book is not so much bad as not as good as it could be. For those new to commercial real estate investment, it contains a lot of useful information. The novice will learn about the different types of commercial real estate plays, the ins and outs of commercial real estate transactions, and how to go about valuing potential commercial real estate investments. The novice will even be told which types of commercial real estate investment are best to pursue, and how best to pursue them. Most important, the novice will be exposed to several key concepts, such as carrying cost and self-liquidating mortgages that if well understood, will keep her out of trouble when making any real estate purchase. However, for those with some background in personal finance and real estate investing (be it residential, commercial or industrial), there are what appear to be obvious errors in the text. Below are just a few, with some of my insights over the years added to provide a little context.The presentation basis is flawed. Any investment must be judged either by its return on equity or its return on invested capital. Masters presents very high investment returns- often in excess of thirty and forty percent, to the reader. These must be discounted because the presentation basis is the down payment, and not the accumulated equity, or better yet, the total invested capital, which includes debt and equity (usually ignoring transaction costs). A more reasonable rate of return using these measures would be far less- about five to ten percent on a long-run average equity basis and about one to three percent on an invested capital basis. It is unreasonable to do any better than this using the techniques outlined in the book. Only then can a fair apples-to-apples comparison with other securities, such as stocks, be made with any confidence.The investment terminology is often mis-used, or worse, mis-leading. He often refers to net income when he actually is referring to operating income, and he often mixes up balance sheet and cash flow statement terminology, which left me very confused in places. A significant improvement to the book would be to develop a complete balance sheet, cash flow statement and income statement for each property under consideration. That way, key performance measures, such as return on initial investment, return on equity and return on invested capital can be readily calculated with ease using the appropriate statement.The general development of the book is good, with the author emphasizing the importance of a good savings and investment plan as well as getting established in a chosen line of work that will allow one to accumulate income with which to (possibly) purchase a home and more importantly, save and invest- ultimately with an eye to participation in commercial real estate investment. However, he neglected to discuss sound and active management of PERSONAL credit and debt. Credit management is critical to real estate investing because without good credit, the investor can not obtain financing on reasonable terms. Other than the independently wealthy, most all small investors in real estate will have to rely on debt to finance their real estate deals. Again, obtaining debt financing at all, let alone on reasonable terms, depends heavily on your personal credit standing. The author implicitly assumes that one has a good credit standing and has access to debt financing on reasonable terms, and this key oversight severely weakens the book. In passing, it should go without saying that the less debt one has, the more one can save and use towards building a capital base with which to launch a real estate investing career.The author neglects to perform a full cost analysis of each property under consideration. He also neglects to make a careful distinction between paper profit, cash flow and liquidity. Most real estate investors fail because they do not consider the total cost of the property; nor do they know the key difference between paper profit, cash flow and liquidity. On paper, the investor may register a profit, or net income, but from day to day they may be cash flow positive or negative, depending upon the circumstances. Liquidity is tied more closely to cash flow than net income, and liquidity is greatly affected by the type of investment (in this case, real estate) and the amount of leverage employed (here we mean the amount of debt financing). Although the author does concede that real estate is a fairly ill-liquid investment, thereby elliptically pointing out a key inherent risk in the activity, he never discusses the relationship between debt-financing, liquidity and profit and how they can contribute to a real estate investment going horribly wrong.A straightforward example demonstrates the latter: A home purchase accrues certain tax breaks and in most markets some capital appreciation- however much (which is by no means guaranteed), that can be deducted from the mortgage. Note that the mortgage is part of the carrying cost of the home (a topic in need of further development in the text). On paper, you may actually rack up a small profit, or rather- a savings (usually as measured against paying rent); however, that is not the same as the month to month outlay, or cash flow, which is always larger than any after-tax benefit (which, of course, diminishes over time). Your liquidity is your ability to raise cash- from all sources, to meet monthly cash flow (not necessarily the ability to sell the asset, in this case, the home, for cash). Failure to secure adequate liquidity to meet the cash flow will mean that a foreclosure is somewhere in your immediate future.With a little extra effort, this text could be a fine addition to one's real estate library, but for now, I would advise potential readers to pick up a library copy."},{"Title":"How To Make Money in Commercial Real Estate: for the Small Investor","review":"This book read a bit like a text book, probably because the author has a teaching background. I almost put the book down after the first couple of chapters, and would have if it was a library book and not a purchased book. I am very glad I did not! There was excellent information in this book which reinforced what I had learned and even built upon it."},{"Title":"How To Make Money in Commercial Real Estate: for the Small Investor","review":"When I was married to my now ex-husband, he owned some commercial real estate, passed down from his mom. He was a musician at heart, and not very business-minded. Mom was too old to be concerned with it anymore, so it fell to me. I had owned several businesses in my life, and had retired at age 38. So I read this book and it helped me a great deal. I was able to recognize when our property managers were stealing from us, and when it was time to sell, I maximized our profits due to the information I found in this book. Thank you! - Aimee Elizabeth, Author of Poverty Sucks! How to Become a Self-Made Millionaire."},{"Title":"How To Make Money in Commercial Real Estate: for the Small Investor","review":"Nicholas Masters is a CPA and has a MBA. That's good for financial analysis of commercial deals, but is it good for the small investor without a degree in finance? Yes, not only is Masters strong on financial analysis, he is also a professor who knows how to teach (and write). I'm not great at math, but I was able to follow all the formulas and numerical examples. It is critical to do a full analysis of a potential commercial real estate deal because of the high dollars involved, the illiquidity, and the need to secure financing in today's market (much more difficult). Masters takes us through each critical area of financial analysis with step by step explanations, examples, and my personal favorite; real life case studies of deals he's done.The real life examples include garden, walk up and high rise apartment complexes, retail strips, anchored retail, office, and redevelopment projects. Through creative and far sighted strategies, he shows us how he's made out-sized ROI again and again. He gives enough detail that you should be able to emulate his investments.Is the book dated? Most of the examples are from the 1970's and 80's. Things have changed since then, especially related to financing, inflation, and cap rates. (By the way, fully understanding capitalization rates is critical to the commercial real estate investor and cap rates are explained more clearly here than anywhere else I have seen, along with numerous examples.) He explains real estate cycles and that you should acquire in weak markets and sell into strong markets. This, with a bias towards holding long term and paying down debt. When you make your own adjustments for your market and interest rates, the out of date elements do not detract much.How to Make Money in Commercial Real Estate for the Small Investor is a book I will keep on my shelf and refer back to often, It was well worth the time to read and study.

The characters were well-drawn, and the plot quite brilliant. A man dies while playing darts, because it appears that a dart daubed with cyanide sticks in the back of his hand. Almost everyone has a motive, and the evidence at hand can point to almost any of them. Reading this novel is like threading a conch-shell. You slip in a piece of string and it snakes through various chambers and entries until it finally comes out at the end. I was a big Christie fan, but now I think I'll be moving on to Marsh."},{"Title":"DEATH AT THE BAR","review":"One of Marsh's most tightly-knit jobs. Victim a famous K.C., poisoned with KNC in the private taproom of a Devon inn while taking part in a demonstration of darts-throwing; plenty of good circumstantial detail leads to supposition of impossible crime. Alleyn, called in both by publican and by local police, does a splendid and fast (24 hours) job of discovering murderer, whose identity is a masterly demonstration in diverting suspicion from the most likely person. Method ingeniously simple, and hence convincing: a very neat job. Virtuoso display of logic at the end, including a delightful false solution propounded by a most amusing Chief Constable."},{"Title":"DEATH AT THE BAR","review":"Perhaps not one of her more richly written efforts, but buoyed by a marvellous mystery plot, set in a wonderful English pub. Darts and beer, a fatal combination."},{"Title":"DEATH AT THE BAR","review":"Three friends form London arrive at a remote inn to spend a couple of weeks on holiday. Norman is an artist and wants to spend his time painting; Simon is an actor and is taking a break and his cousin, Luke is a successful barrister. One of them will meet his death in this idyllic spot. Is it a terrible accident or is it murder? The inquest rules it is accident but the publican of The Plume of Feathers wants to clear the name of his hostelry and pays a visit to Roderick Alleyn at Scotland Yard.The local Chief Constable agrees to Alleyn investigating and it soon becomes clear that this is really murder. This is a well plotted novel with some fascinating twists and turns and a really ingenious murderer. Almost all of the suspects have secrets they are hiding from the police and almost all of them appear to be guilty though they seem to have no opportunity to actually do the deed.I totally failed to work out who did it though of course when you look back the clues are there staring you in the face! An excellent crime novel by a master of the genre."},{"Title":"DEATH AT THE BAR","review":"I am a fan of Ngaio Marsh and I'm trying to read all of her stories, but DEATH AT THE BAR was way below a Marsh standard. There was no mystery, from the moment the characters were introduced the reader knows who will die and who is the killer.The other characters who populate the bar are shallow and repulsive.DEATH AT THE BAR may have been an early manuscript that had been around collecting dust for want of a publisher that should have stayed in the bottom drawer.If you enjoy Ngaio Marsh you should read it, but I can not recommend it.Nash Black, author of TRAVELERS."},{"Title":"DEATH AT THE BAR","review":"This is one of the longest Marsh novels of the 25 I've read so far (of the 32). She has lots of style. This one includes Inspector Fox but not the others in Alleyn's usual crew. The additional characters are well-drawn & intriguing IMHO, including an actor (Marsh has many stage-oriented novels--cf.Curtain Calls: Three Great Mysteries; Enter A Murderer; Night At the Vulcan; Killer Dolphin), an artist (she also has art-oriented ones such asArtists in Crime& Alleyn's wife Troy is a celebrated artist), a Barrister (the victim), & numerous country folk. The setting in a country inn adds charm to the novel as well. But, the best part is the mystery itself. Lots of motives, of course, & a supposedly impossible crime. The finger points to different suspects in cycles--very clever. I did guess part of it, but not the main part. The only drawback to me was the seeming serendipity of the storm & lights going out--and the rapidity of the culprit's movements. Poetic license I presume. My favorite lines in it are: p. 9: \\"His cousin had a trick of saying things that sounded a little like quotations from an interview with himself\\" & p. 293: \\"as conspicuous as a pitchfork in Paradise.\\" It's a delightful book--I'm torn between giving it 4 or 5 stars."},{"Title":"Again","review":"Set in the interesting world of daytime soaps, this book feels real, the characters, the situations, the depth of feeling. Jenny Cotton is the author/producer of My Lady's Chamber who loves her job so much she can't bear to see it as 'work' and strives to recreate a family within her work environment (a common theme explored by KGS)When a new actor arrives on set, the experienced but wary Alec Cameron, he challenges and changes the dynamics and things start to shift.The clever weaving of a regency romance (the setting of the soap opera) and modern day television, the exotic world of TV and the reality of people's complex feelings, makes for a lovely novel. KGS writes beautifully as always, and I don't know why she is so underrated but if you can pick this book up, do, it is well worth it and a definite keeper."},{"Title":"Again","review":"This is a wonderful story, with marvelous characters and a very unique &quot;story within a story&quot;. &quot;My Lady's Chamber&quot;, the Regency soap opera that is at the center of the story, would be a smash if it were real.

The Regency soap opera is a great plot device that is so much more than mere device. Seidel uses the language beautifully and it seems downright tragic she is not better known AND that she's not really writin romances anymore. Her characters are engaging, her plots are tight and well-paced and her writing is incredible. I can't gush enough about this book enough.

I really love how Mr. Henty shows the true reasons behind Cortez's conquest, and not the pack of lies that we usually hear in history. The thing that got my attention was the Henty made it clear that both sides had their good and bad intentions. The Mexicans wanted peace to reign but yet they exercised brutal human sacrifices to their gods. The Spanish wanted to spread the Gospel to the world but they were noted for their brutality in war. There are no reasons to search for good or bad guys, as the hero in this story is torn between the two sides. If you really want to read how history should be written, read this book."},{"Title":"By right of conquest: Or, With Cortez in Mexico","review":"BY RIGHT OF CONQUEST is a great book. It tells the story of a boy who is shipwrecked on a island where the people think he is a god. When Cortez comes to fight the people of the islands the boy is caught in the fray. This story is a great book full of excitment like in the middle of battles or running away in a boat. Even a point where the boy must escape from being sacrificed. This is a wonderful book which I encourage many to read."},{"Title":"By right of conquest: Or, With Cortez in Mexico","review":"Full of historical and cultural information, while keeping mostly clean in light of its content, 'By Right of Conquest' gives a balanced picture of Cortez and the Aztecs. Though it deals with horrifically violent events, they are written non-descriptively. The characters are easy to relate to and the story is interesting. Roger doesn't always do what is right, but his aim is always to do righteously and he looks out for others more than for himself. Highly recommended for those who enjoy historical fiction or want to study this time period or culture."},{"Title":"An almanac of twelve sports","review":"Get the full version or else it makes no sense at all.

The author gives a great synopsis of Taylor's views on such topics as agrarianism, republicanism, democracy, and limited federalgovernment.Taylor's philosophy on separation of powers instead of John Adam's balance of the orders of democracy, aristocracy, and monarchy. Taylor rejects this view and shows how such a system actually &quot; divides people&quot; and &quot; concentrates power&quot;.

There was slight violence through out the book but especially at the beginning. It is a little boring in the beginning in my opinion with sudden violence. This adventure on the west frontier is a nice, fictional story abut two young girls on their daring adventure from their home to the other side of the frontier, meeting many different people along the way. Some of the people you find they will meet will shock you! In my opinion, this book highly lacks the heart touching feel, and to me, i did not become very attached to the Barron characters. This story is more persistence more so than unconditional love. I became somewhat attached to the characters in the middle of the book, and as the story went on, i became more interested in the book, but i shall say that when i started, it was quite boring.You may love this book or dislike it.

They're stay-up-late-suspenseful. Their plots are smart and original. One notable aspect of the two books in this series about girls who are resourceful and independent and meet a range of characters is.. (Spoiler alert! Really! Do you want to keep reading this review?)... the absence of a specific overt romantic love developing between Maude or Sallie and any of the characters they encounter. That's become rare in a young adult novel that focuses on girls, and to me, is an important distinction.

That scene made me break down crying, because I had never heard anyone other than myself talk about these terrific books, and the fact that it is tragic that they are mostly out of print and hard to find. This book is a wonderful story of working hard for a goal, and accomplishing it, or at least getting on the road to achieving a reasonable, yet magical, goal.

Or that you did't fit in? Ever had great plans for another's future...that they didn't share? Dancing Shoes is a well-crafted classic, about three girls we can all relate to.

Of all of the Shoes books -- and believe me, twenty years ago I read every single one I could get my hands on -- this is still the best.The two heroines are so likable and yet so different from each other; Rachel is introspective and quiet, Hilary is vivacious and fun-loving. What this means is that every little girl reading it can identify with one or the other. Streatfeild is at her best when it comes the book's character development. Rachel's reaction to her mother's death, and her changing relationship with her sister, are very well-drawn and utterly convincing.Best of all, this book has Dulcie -- the character you love to hate. And every single person gets her comeuppance in the end; the reader's desire for poetic justice is fufilled in a most suprising but totally convincing way. It's a wonderfully satisfying read, and the kind of book that you can read again and again ... even as an adult."},{"Title":"Dancing shoes","review":"How can it be that a book about a dancing school in 1950s London would make such an impression on a klutzy American 12-year old in the late '70s and early '80s? A compelling story and appealing, cleancut prose have made &quot;Dancing Shoes&quot; a staple -- albeit dog-eared -- book in my library for more than 15 years.&quot;Dancing Shoes&quot; started my long &quot;pas de deux&quot; with Noel Streatfeild's &quot;Shoes&quot; series. Streatfeild describes the day-to-day lives of Rachel and Hilary -- two orphans who find unexpectedly themselves living in a stage-training school with their brusque, stage-mama Aunt Cora -- in such a way that the reader can feel the warmth of the footlights and the pinch of their tap shoes. The plight of untalented Rachel among the dancing troupe of Mrs. Wintle's Little Wonders was very true to life, and her triumph over her spoiled cousin at the end of the book gives hope to all little girls who aren't so light on their feet.

Spoiled Dulcie, comedienne Hilary and sensitive Rachel are entertaining characters. Children will root for Rachel and cheer when Dulcie and Aunt Cora finally get their comeuppance. I picked this book up at a bookstore on a whim and reread it. I do have a few quibbles now that I didn't as a child. Children may be bothered by Uncle Tom's indifference. Uncle Tom is kind, but he is not a good parent. He ignores Dulcie's bad behavior and doesn't stand up for Rachel even though she is miserable. I wondered why he stays with Aunt Cora. Is the money that good? I wanted the adults' back story. It also bothered me that Hilary's adoption by Rachel's parents wasn't treated seriously. The characters talk about how she isn't Rachel's &quot;real sister&quot; and how Tom and Cora didn't have to take her in because she is adopted. Adopted children reading this book might be very bothered by that."},{"Title":"Dancing shoes","review":"Perhaps I have a bit of sentimental bias towards this book. I received it at age 5 to read-- my first-ever \\"chapter\\" book. It took me about six months the first time around, if I recall correctly. I'd just begun dance classes myself, and so the book gave me a sense of a connection to something that I enjoyed doing. Because it was about two young girls that were taken in by their aunt, I also connected it to adoption--something that also was extremely close to home for me, as I am an adopted child.Since that time (in 1980) I've nearly worn my copy out from reading it so many times-- even now, as an adult, I find it to be a fantastic read.

Though my copy is now dog eared and I practically know it off by heart, I read it about once ever four months.It is the involved and moving tale of Rachel and Hilary, both ten years old when the book begins. Hilary was adopted by Rachel's parents when they were both four, and has always felt part of the family. She is a promsing ballet dancer (her real mother being one) but is lazy, and doesn't take the work seriously. Rachel, who is serious in everything she does, watches all of Hilary's lessons and keeps her working hard. Their father, a famous film star, died when they were seven. When the book opens, their mother has just died too, leaving them orphans.They are taken to live with Rachel's aunt and uncle, Cora Wintle and Tom Lennox. Aunt Cora, or Mrs. Wintle as she is commonly referred to, runs a stage school for children called Wintle's Wonders. Throughout the book she is mean, oppressive, selfish and cold hearted torwards first Rachel, and then Hilary. Uncle Tom is an artist, and the opposite of Cora. He nurtures Rachel, who feels misunderstood and out of place in a dancing school, and tries his hardest to make things better. Their spoilt cousin Dulcie is a brilliant dancer, and thoroughly conceited. Pursey is the kindly and fat house keeper who becomes their mother figure.'Dancing Shoes' focuses on Rachel's trials and tribulations, mainly trials though, and how she reacts to the situations and characters around her. Everything about it will pull you in and make you feel like you're really living her life. Although at times it is heart breaking, it is suitable for children and adults of all ages. The ending is very fitting, even though it is somewhat bitter sweet. Please, do yourself a favour and buy this for yourself, your daughter, grand daughter, neice, cousin, sister... whatever.

After Rachel and Hilary's mother dies, they two sisters are sent to live with their strict Aunt Cora, their quite uncle Tom, and their spoiled daughter Dulcie. Hilary, whos real mother had been a dancer on broadway, had a real talent for ballet, but was forced to quite her training, and miss her opportunity to attend the Royal Ballet School, when she went to live with her aunt. Aunt Cora owns a dance school, where many dance troupes are trained, known as Wintle's Little Wonders. Aunt Cora give the two sisters but no choice to attend dance classes, and is determined to make them into Wonders. Hilary quickly catches on to this different from of dance, which is very different from ballet, while Rachel does not. Rachel strongly believes that Hilary should continue with her ballet, but Hilary would rather be doing the tap dancing and acrobatics with the troupe dancers. Dancing Shoes is all about the two girls struggle with dancing, their aunt, and finding what they enjoy most.I strongly recommend this book to anyone who is interested in dance.

She knows Hilary is destined to be a dancer, but, there's still quiet Rachel. The Rachel who never seems to do anything right and is never appreciative. But is that really how she feels?

But when I got deeper in to it, I could not stop. I like Noel Streatfeild's description of the characters like Dulcie.

After Rachel and Hilary's father dies, they are sent to live with their Aunt Cora, who owns a talent school and troupe. While Hilary is a very talented dancer, she wants nothing more than to have fun. Her sister, Rachel wants nothing to do with dancing, but she does want Hilary to go to the Royal Ballet School to study proper ballet, as her family and old dance teacher wished for, even though Hilary doesn't want to. So everyone, including their mean and selfish Aunt Cora, believe that Rachel is jealous of Hilary. Meanwhile, Aunt Cora's talented, and conceited, daughter now has competition with Hilary.The book is full of the same charm as her others. While not as endearing as Ballet Shoes and Theater Shoes, maybe only due to the nastiness of Aunt Cora and how mean she is to Rachel, it is still a wonderful read.

We were not disappointed. Noel Streatfeild is a wonderful author."},{"Title":"Dancing shoes","review":"There are some children's books that were enormously popular at one time, but seem uninspired and one-dimensional compared to much modern children's literature, with its poignant issues and complex characters. Then, there are some older books that possess all the innocence and charm of an earlier era of kid lit, without sacrificing relevance or entertainment value.\\"Dancing Shoes\\" (original title: \\"Wintle's Wonders\\") falls into the latter category. Rachel and Hilary are relatable and engaging characters, despite their flaws (Rachel is sullen and controlling, Hilary lazy). Other characters are created with less subtlety and depth - Cora and Dulcie have no redeeming features whatsoever - but sometimes it's fun to read a nice story in which the heroes and villains are clearly defined, and there is simple pleasure in the end when good comes out with the upper hand.This is a thoroughly predictable novel, but, unlike some tedious tales, is none the worse for turning out exactly the way you expect. Rather, watching the story unfold with quiet gentility is like floating with the current in a gentle stream, taking a ride through your old hometown, or seeing your favorite movie for the tenth time: you know exactly where you're going, you're perfectly comfortable with it, and half the fun is in getting there.This is not a novel about dancing; you don't have to know anything about dance in order to enjoy it, and those dance enthusiasts who pick it up expecting to see their love of dance reinforced and celebrated may find themselves disappointed, in that regard at least; Rachel detests dancing, and Hilary, though talented, has little passion for her art. What this is, is a novel about finding what you love and doing it, letting others be themselves, and releasing an old dream to make way for what the future may hold."},{"Title":"Dancing shoes","review":"Great book from a great series by a great author.

I was less interested in Hilary, as she was a charming, easily likeable girl. Rachel, on the other hand, was sensitive, quiet and misunderstood. I wished that I could be friends with Rachel, because I could completely understand how she felt. I hated it when she was accused of being jealous of Hilary and when she was laughed at. And I was furious when her own Aunt hated that she got the role of Vera in the play. So Dulcie didn't get the role! Can't someone else have the limelight, for a change? For anyone who has ever felt like a misfit, give this book a try. Even if you don't really like Rachel, you'll be able to enjoy the story. Both girls seem real. While Rachel is responsible and hard-working, Hilary is fun loving and lazy. I was actually happy when Hilary slapped Dulcie for laughing at Rachel.And I haven't even talked about the story yet!

Is so tracing the social history of the leftist movements within the domestic political scene. Isserman helps to make greater sense of many of the predominating themes of later domestic radicalism, as with the notorious rise of the Students For A Democratic Society (or SDS) movement, one that transpired largely on large, metropolitan college campuses.Indeed, several of the founders of the SDS organization such as sociologist Todd Gitlin and California politician/social activist Tom Hayden were sons of socialist radicals themselves, raised in middle class households in which spirited intellectual discussions centering round the plight of the ordinary working man and his or her exploitation at the hand of capitalism was \`de rigueur' for dinnertime conversation. We are treated to an inside look at how the wartime pacifism of Gandhi-like non-violent opposition played out over several decades to become the largely non-violent protests of the civil rights and anti-Vietnam war movements of the sixties. Isserman has also authored other interesting tomes about the times, including both \\"Which Side Were You On\\", a study of the American Communist Party, and the provocative \\"America Divided\\", a study of the rise of the American Counterculture of the later sixties.Here Isserman shows how the personalities of several key participants in the avant-garde urban socialist scene such as Michael Harrington (noted author of \\"The Other America\\"), Max Shachtman, and Irving Howe (author of several noted tomes on the rise of an urban and mainly Jewish intellectual class in America such as \\"World Of Our Fathers\\") and how they transformed the collapse of the American Communist Party in the 1950s into a nascent socialist movement that was more consonant with the needs and characteristics of the contemporary American social scene. Isserman is most interesting when tracing how individual beliefs become transformed into social policy, and he does this here with these several personalities quite well. For me, this was a memorable journey back into the intellectual and social heritage and the political genesis of the 1960s protest movements, and a reading experience I thoroughly enjoyed."},{"Title":"The Significance of the One: A Novel","review":"This story touched me, man"},{"Title":"The Significance of the One: A Novel","review":"I first read this wonderful story several years ago and it has stayed in my thoughts.

On the way, the reader is treated to actual accounts of the trip along with memories and histories of the river, the land, and its people. There are beautiful memories, such as finding of a rare colony of yellow ladies slipper orchids in a hidden glen, celebrating with the river people; sad memories, such as the raping of the forests, the loss of her faithful dog, the hard times of the people inhabiting the river bottoms; and funny memories, such as hitching a ride off an island on a tugboat."},{"Title":"Reflections on the Neches: A Naturalist's Odyssey along the Big Thicket's Snow River (Temple Big Thicket Series)","review":"Deftly written by Geraldine Ellis Watson (a plant ecologist and former ranger for the National Park Service), Reflections On The Neches is an absorbing memoir of a past childhood as well as a commentary upon the natural and social history of the Neches (one of the last &quot;wild&quot; rivers in Texas, just now being subjected to dams) region of the Big Thicket country.

Most of what I was reading here I was hearing for the first time. This books complements every other account of the show, because this is the first book to actually tell the story about the show itself, not the movies or stars.Trust me when I say you have no idea how incredibly difficult it is to put this television show together. Unless, of course, you've been there.It's surprisingly well written; it's a easy fast read.It's gossipy, but pleasantly so, and often funnier than all get out.My favorite Oscar book is still \\"Inside Oscar\\" (the first one...as the second is a bit more vitriolic and less, oh, affectionate...) but THAT book and THIS book are the only ones I will read more than once. \\"Inside Oscar\\" gives us an account of the year in film, and then goes through the telecast, followed by events that happened in the weeks to months after the show. Here, you get that crucial few days right before the show, and then all the fascinating details surrounding what you actually saw on TV. They're a perfect fit.Each chapter is a year, covering the process of putting on the Oscar telecast: how are the seat-fillers handled; who makes those decisions for those horrible dance pieces; how much thought is put into set design (a lot, but not all the time...)...the stories behind the rehearsals I found to be the most interesting of all.This period covers the switch from the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion shows/Shrine shows to the Kodak Theater. Having a permanent \\"home\\" now seems like such an obvious idea, but it clearly wasn't.I discovered things about certain stars that surprised me. I will leave you to discover them, but suffice to say, there's a story involving Celine Dion which made me respect her in ways I would have never imagined (although her music still makes me itch).I loved the insight into each host...so many things are known about them, yet this book assumes that. It assumes that the reader already has a healthy knowledge about Hollywood and film, and gives you the stuff you probably don't know.THAT'S why I love this book!"},{"Title":"The Big Show: High Times and Dirty Dealings Backstage at the Academy Awards","review":"Show biz buffs will enjoy the tidbits and quotes here from Oscar show vets like Marc Shaiman, who provided musical accompaniment for Billy Crystal's medleys before becoming a nominee himself.But this book is probably best enjoyed as a companion to the two Inside Oscar books (consulted, we learn here, by at least one Academy Awards producer in the last decade). Niether makes the others obsolete, but you get something from each that you don't get from the other.The experience of reading the Inside Oscar books is like getting good dish from one or two well-informed but bitchy friends as you sit and watch the televised Oscar ceremonies together. Something of an outsiders view, in other words, however compelling (and broader in scope). Because Steve Pond was granted \\"behind the curtain\\" access, The Big Show is more like a report from a relative insider, with a notebook open wide and ears open wider.Being relative, that insider's perspective only goes as far as it goes, however, and one suspects Pond was kept away from, or perhaps sworn to secrecy about, anything really juicy. But there's enough here for Academy Awards viewers to chew on during that boring musical number or endless commercial break."},{"Title":"The Big Show: High Times and Dirty Dealings Backstage at the Academy Awards","review":"Okay, are you interested at all in the Academy Awards? If you are, even a glimmer of interest, then this is absolutely the book for you. Steve Pond has a true gift; the ability to witness the inner workings of a fabulous show, and the ability to write about it in an entertaining, fast-paced way.Steve Pond was granted unprecedented access to the most recent Oscar shows, and reports many findings in The Big Show. He doesn't shy away from sharing his opinions about certain celebrities, and will name names when warranted. Nothing in his book is outright slanderous, most of it is fair reporting of the things that he observed. One thing that surprised me were the amount of Hollywood stars that were smokers.Pond also painstakingly reports about all of the behind the scene work that goes into the sometimes four-plus hour long production. From the producers endless job of overseeing the masses of people and masses of egos, to the director, who somehow needs to make this marathon visually entertaining, the people behind the scenes get their deserved credit. I shall never watch this show without a now deeper understanding of all of the hours, days, weeks, and months of work it takes to put those hours on my television screen.I highly recommend this book as an engaging, entertaining read. Here's hoping that Steve Pond finds himself at this year's Oscars, and we get another behind the scenes look at this amazing process."},{"Title":"The Big Show: High Times and Dirty Dealings Backstage at the Academy Awards","review":"I would've enjoyed this book more if it had been fact checked a little more diligently. It claims 'Billy Elliot' was nominated for a single award, when it actually received three nominations, and says the last time a sweep occured before 'LOTR: Return of the King' was 'Gigi' in 1958, when in fact it was 1987's 'The Last Emperor'.If it can get details like this wrong, it's easy to believe that other, less checkable, stories might be false as well."},{"Title":"The Big Show: High Times and Dirty Dealings Backstage at the Academy Awards","review":"Not sure about the \\"Dirty Dealings\\"...but this is a great behind-the-scenes look at the annual event. Interesting bits of trivia and rules of the seat-fillers. A fun read...."},{"Title":"The Big Show: High Times and Dirty Dealings Backstage at the Academy Awards","review":"I think I breezed through this book faster and with more joy than any book I've read in the past 5 years. Pond gives us a detailed view of the inner workings of the chaotic and stressful act of producing a decade's worth of Oscars telecasts. It's funny, a bit juicy at times, and thoroughly enjoyable.If you are like me and have been a bit miffed with the membership of the Motion Picture Academy lately for its \\"artistic compromises\\" when it comes to the films and actors who get nominated sometimes, at least the AMPAS president goes on record here as saying that the PRIMARY goal is to achieve the highest TV ratings possible for each year's show. The revenue from that show generates pretty much 90% of the Academy's funds for the entire year. He is very unapologetic about it. At least he was being honest and forthright about it. I can appreciate that. And this revelation was published years before the Academy started (in 2010) to make room for a total of ten nominees for Best Picture instead of the standard five. Why? In a nutshell, ratings. The Academy's stance is \\"Art be damned -- we'll allow as many nominations for Best Picture as it takes to get you to watch the telecast. Please watch the telecast!\\"Been dying to know why films that were critical darlings got passed over for nominations, the most egregious example being the documentary \\"Hoop Dreams\\"? Pond explains in this book how and why the voting process doomed that film and what steps were taken to correct it. Pond also explains why some members believe that the voting system is flawed in other ways too, for how else can one explain a single film sweeping every category: \\"Lord of the Rings - The Return of the King\\" won something like 80 Oscars in one year. Do you REALLY believe that a single cinematic production could have, objectively speaking, the year's best film, make-up design, costumes, score, editing, effects, sound, etc etc etc etc, all at the same time??? It's unreasonable to think so. It would be the strangest of coincidences, and yet it has happened several times. The insiders in Pond's book detail the reasons why that happens and why they aren't particularly happy about it or feel it is a fair and accurate way of rewarding effort.You will probably achieve two things after reading \\"The Big Show\\": a respect for the tireless amount of effort, stress, and butt-kissing the show's producers must endure year after year to stage this little dog and pony show, and the realization that politics and a flawed voting system have taken a HELL of a bite out of the integrity of the award itself. Does the award always go to the most deserving? Not by a longshot.But the topic makes for fascinating reading. Well done, Mr. Pond."},{"Title":"The Big Show: High Times and Dirty Dealings Backstage at the Academy Awards","review":"Few TV programs have been more praised and more ridiculed than the Oscars. In recent years the perennial Academy Awards show has been re-thought, re-invented and re-conceptualized countless times in the eternal quest for better ratings. Entertainment writer Steve Pond furnishes a fascinating, inside view of recent Oscar developments in this 2005 Faber & Faber book.As borne out in Pond's book, Oscar's TV history can be divided into pre-Allan Carr and post-Allan Carr. After the jaw-dropping debacle Carr presented to American audiences in 1989, a succession of producers have toiled at making the show fun, lively and quick (i.e. under four hours). Starting with the 66th Academy Awards show (1994) and ending with version 76 (2004), Pond takes the reader behind-the-scenes to see how the show is created and periodically re-invented along with the goofs, gaffes and ego trips that are part-and-parcel of the show.It's been years since I forced myself to watch that lumbering spectacle so Pond's book was a positive revelation. The material on the mechanics of the show was absolutely fascinating as was all the politics. Plus I now know a lot more of the winners!If you love movies and/or television, you'll love THE BIG SHOW. It's entertaining, insightful and a great read. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Big Show: High Times and Dirty Dealings Backstage at the Academy Awards","review":"The concept of this book is great--allowing one reporter to have unlimited access backstage at the Academy Awards. The resulting book is too long and repetitive to be as interesting as it should have been. At 400 pages, it feels padded and needs some good editing.The author chooses to go year-by-year through the recent Oscar ceremonies, and that results in the same dull stories being told over and over about music rehearsals, Billy Crystal rehearsals, celebrity rehearsals...namely, the book is mostly about the couple of days before the ceremony each year when everyone is rehearsing. That doesn't make for the most exciting read. It may have been better to write it with chapter themes. So one chapter could highlight the musical artists over the years, another chapter covering the hosts.Some of the author's comments are biased and don't reflect the mood when the ceremony was held, instead reflecting on the ceremony only in retrospect. There are a few juicy tidbits but the author also includes admittedly off-the-record comments, which raises questions about his journalistic credibility. The book is also very limited as to reporting only what the author witnessed, which means not everything is covered.So the end result is a mediocre up-and-down experience that after a few repetitive chapters no longer is that interesting. For hard-nosed Oscar fans only."},{"Title":"The Big Show: High Times and Dirty Dealings Backstage at the Academy Awards","review":"\\"The Big Show\\" is a great read for movie (I am) and/or Academy Award (I am not) buffs.

Meditation master, holder of the Kagyu and Nyingma transmission lineages of Tibetan Buddhism, Oxford scholar, artist and poet, Trungpa Rinpoche founded the first accredited Buddhist University in the Occident (Naropa University in Boulder, Colorado), and established well in excess of a hundred Vajradhatu Dharma and Shambhala Centers world-wide. Ch&ouml;gyam Trungpa Rinpoche was one of the most dynamic teachers of Buddhism in the 20th Century. He was a pioneer in bringing the Buddhist teachings of Tibet to the West and is credited for introducing many important Buddhist concepts into the English language and psyche in a fresh and unique - yet startlingly clear and understandable - way.During his too brief life, he was also one of the most controversial figures in Tibetan Buddhism and more generally in the Tibetan exile community, largely owing to his lifestyle and life choices since leaving Tibet, which were instrumental in his death at the age of 49.Trungpa was identified at the age of only thirteen months as a major tulku (reincarnation) of an enlightened teacher, a revered figure in Tibet's religious history. As the eleventh in his teaching lineage, he underwent a period of intensive training in mediation, philosophy, Buddhist history and scripture, and the arts, receiving full ordination as a monk in 1958 at the age of eighteen, which he captivatingly recounts in &quot;Born in Tibet.&quot;.The following year in 1959, armed forces of the Communist-led People's Republic of China brutally invaded Tibet, and the young Trungpa spent many harrowing months trekking over the Himalayas, narrowly escaping both the dangers of the terrain as well as capture. Trungpa's account of his experiences as a young monk, his duties as the abbot and spiritual head of a great monastery, and his tender relationships with his teachers offers a rare and intimate glimpse into the life of a Tibetan lama. The memoir concludes with his daring flight from Tibet to India. In an epilogue, he describes his emigration to the West, where he encountered many people eager to learn about the ancient wisdom of Tibetan Buddhism as well as those who made a &quot;museum-piece&quot;-like curiosity out of him.This is a delightful and captivating book, one which once begun can hardly be put down. It is exceptionally well-written, and I strongly encourage any student of Tibet or Buddhism to add it to their library."},{"Title":"Born in Tibet","review":"This superb book tells the remarkable tale of the 11th consciously reincarnated Trungpa Tulku, a Tibetan Buddhist lama, who after living a traditional spiritual life in Eastern Tibet is forced to flee the brutal Chinese invasion of his country in the late 1950s.The story gives a rare first-hand glimpse into the secluded monastic world of pre-communist Tibet as well as some horryfying accounts of the atrocities committed by the Chinese against this totally peaceful nation. Although largely unknown to the West until fairly recently, the Chinese destruction of Tibet and ruthless slaughter its people must surely rank among the greatest of crimes against humanity. One wonders what could possess anyone to parttake in such indiscriminate destruction.But the story has a silver lining of sorts. If it were not for the Chinese invastion the West would never have received a flood of Tibetan refugees, amongst whom we count some of the most accomplished Buddhist teachers ever, including the venerable and late Trungkpa Tulku himself and not least H.H. the late 16th Gyalwa Karmapa."},{"Title":"Born in Tibet","review":"Arguably the earliest breakthrough account of his homeland before and after the Chinese invasion, when this appeared in 1968 it preceded the Rinpoche's fame and the attention his \\"crazy wisdom\\" inspired among followers and detractors. Boldly, Trungpa sought to strip the Vajrayana, the Tibetan Buddhist doctrine, of its factional distinctions and to transmit to the West, among the predicted \\"land of the red-skinned faces\\" in the age of iron, the dharma.That episode, rapidly told, appends the revised edition of this narrative. It concentrates on a rather matter-of-fact, stolid recital of how he was chosen as a \\"tulku,\\" a reincarnated lama, his entrance to the monastery, his education, countless visits to other foundations, more education, and careful wisdom. While this left me less satisfied, for its tone and style keeps you apart from the inherent interest in his spiritual formation and practical experience, it does provide a first-person report on traditional Tibetan inculcation.Lama Pega tells him how Buddhist teaching can never be theory alone, but must be tested by practice, self-examination of precepts, and reflection over the meaning. True faith emerges only after the Middle Way of moderation. \\"Knowledge must be tested in the same way as gold; first refined, then beaten and made smooth till it becomes the right colour and shows it is pure gold.\\" (98)Sadness, but not resignation, pervades this story as it follows Trungpa's coming of age in an increasingly embattled nation. As Marco Pallis explains in his forward, Trungpa conveys the incursion obliquely. It reflects how indirectly, by hearsay, rumor, distant report the natives heard of the coming of the Chinese. While this may cast a detached, fatalistic tone over the story told, it does express the slow infiltration of the occupiers that precedes their military and political conquest.He climbs \\"the holy Mt. Doti Gangkar,\\" where the founding guru Padmasambhava used to meditate twelve centuries before. Trungpa tells of its green and black lakes, and snowy summit. \\"The legend goes that in the Golden Age this snow never melted and shone like a diamond. In the following age it was like an onyx in which light and darkness are mixed. In the third age, however, it was to become like iron; everything would be dark and our time in Tibet would be over. When we reached the top of the mountain we found that the snow fields were melting and that great expanses of dark rock were showing.\\" (120) (One wonders, fifty-five years or so later, what the expanse now looks like after Chinese decimation and global warming.)About five years after the first occupation of the Communists, teenaged Trungpa is warned by Chentze Rinpoche, an elder lama: \\"You must look after and guide yourself, as in the future there will be no further teachers. A new era has begun in which the pure doctrine of the Lord Buddha lies in the hands of individuals; each one is separately responsible, for I do not think that we can carry on in the way we have done up till now. We can no longer rely on groups and communities. The situation is very serious, many of us are old, and perhaps it is young people like you, the new generation, who shall bear the burden.\\" (97)By his twentieth year, he bears many burdens. After hiding, he must flee the Communists as they turn to all-out war against a few determined Tibetan guerrillas. This picks up the pace, and the latter half of the book tells of the escape as he leads three hundred natives from the threat of imprisonment or death-- towards exile in India. He briskly tells of this poignant departure and dangerous flight. It ends with typical understatement; after recounting the fortunes of the survivors: \\"Nothing has been heard of Karma-tendzin, the Queen of Nangchen and her party, nor of Lama Urgyen's group of monks who went to the pilgrimage valley.\\" (249) The following page gives a poem that laments the nature of the Buddhist lesson of life's impermanence: \\"Mortal, yet once we enjoyed the masquerade;/ Now we see clearly all things perishing.\\""},{"Title":"Born in Tibet","review":"Ch&ouml;gyam Trungpa (1939-1987) was a Buddhist meditation master, the eleventh Trungpa t&uuml;lku, as well as a poet and writer of books such asCutting Through Spiritual Materialism (Shambhala Library),Work, Sex, Money: Real Life on the Path of Mindfulness, etc. He established the Shambhala Meditation Centers, and died of complications related to his habitual very heavy consumption of alcohol. He notes in the \\"Acknowledgements\\" section of this 1966 book (revised in 1971), \\"This book was begun spontaneously as an authentic record of the wisdom and culture which existed in Tibet for so many centuries, and of the events of the last decade during which the Communists have destroyed everything its peace loving people held dear.\\"He recalls an early (1955) encounter with the visiting Dalai Lama, \\"We were beginning to lose heart, for the Communists were becoming so powerful; it seemed as if our happy days were coming to an end: however, the presence of His Holiness gave us renewed hope that the spiritual teaching and culture of Tibet would not be entirely swept away. Yet it was sad to see him looking so thin and strained as a result of the heavy burden he had to carry.\\" (Pg. 106) While escaping to India, he told his fellow escapees, \\"Our journey to India must be thought of as a pilgrimage; something that in the past few Tibetans have been able to make. Whether or not India has changed, the spiritual blessings imparted to that country by the presence of the Buddha remain... We should not be thinking only about the enemies threatening us from without. Each moment we should be aware of ourselves and of the forces of destruction that threaten each man from within.\\" (Pg. 208)He observes, \\"Evidently not to take life, not to steal or utter falsehoods, to abstain from unlawful sexual intercourse and from intoxicating liquors should be the rule of life for all Buddhists. However, if people are unable to keep the discipline of all these, there is a simpler form that they may take, which is to make a vow to adhere strictly to one or other chosen precept for a given time, and to make an effort to adhere to the others as far as possible.\\" (Pg. 131)He observed about the Jamg&ouml;n Kongtr&uuml;l, \\"[he] had incredibly precise insight when he dealt with people's minds... he had that kind of patience which permits other people to grow. His inspiring way of teaching allowed his disciples vast amounts of space and encouraged confidence in their own energy... For me the inspiration that he gave is so complete and unique that I have no further desire to hunt for another guru.\\" (Pg. 250)He admits, \\"Coming back to Britain, there was the question of whether to continue the experience of [wearing robes, etc.]. The hesitation was powerfully expressed in a car crash in May 1969 in which I was paralyzed on the left side. This led to my taking off the robe. The purpose of this was to gain for me personally the strength to continue teaching by unmasking, and also to do away with the 'exotic' externals which were too fascinating to students in the West.\\" (Pg. 252)Trungpa was a controversial figure; but this early book serves to illustrate why he quickly became such a popular spiritual teacher."},{"Title":"Born in Tibet","review":"Opened some new insights into world history and Tibet and especially about Chogyam Thungpa, the Buddhist teacher who adapted to America instead of expecting Americans to adapt to him."},{"Title":"Multiplicative number theory (Lectures in advanced mathematics)","review":"I like this book because it gives you a good understanding of where the difficulties in the subject are. It takes a historical approach, following more or less the same steps that the original discoverers of these results took. Today we have very slick proofs for many of these results, and it is sometimes hard to understand why it took so long to discover them in the first place, but this book will give you this understanding; Dirichlet in particular practically had to invent Analytic Number Theory to prove his theorem on primes in an arithmetic progression.The book works up gradually to each result, for example proving Dirichlet's theorem first for a prime modulus (as Dirichlet did himself), then the general modulus. In most cases it proves first the result for all primes (zeta function) and then the generalization for primes in an arithmetic progression (L function), pointing out which parts generalize easily and which cause special difficulties.Some of the more advanced results covered are exponential sums, Vinogradov's theorem that every large odd number is the sum of three primes, and Bombieri's theorem about the average distribution of primes in arithmetic progressions.I haven't seen the previous (1980) edition; this new edition seems to be lightly revised from the previous one.

I believe this book has it. It's not the simplest or the shortest proof, but it gives the deepest understanding of why the prime numbers behve like they do. In addition to this, it shows you the historical perspective in these proofs. All too often today math books give one short and slick proofs that leave you wondering how on earth they came up with it. In this book, however, one can almost feel the thoughts going through Riemann and Dirichlet's heads as they came up with the theorems. This book also has the proof of Dirichlet's theorem and Vinogradov's partial proof of the ternary goldbach conjecture. The vinogradov and following sections are considerably harder, partly because they were not written by Davenport himself.

Michener weaves a captivating story of his youth followed by his WWII years in the U.S. Navy, which of course brought us &quot;Tales of the South Pacific&quot;. He then relates real down to earth experiences as a would-be writer seemingly trapped as editor. Through it all his humbleness is refreshing. His appreciation and respect for the arts and culture is most noteworthy and no doubt will have many readers running to the nearest record store well stocked in opera and classical music. He relates as only he can the various stimuli involved in the undertaking of his later massive works, many accomplished well past the age of 60. If nothing else, upon finishing this remarkable auto-biography, the reader will have an immense respect for the writer and a stirring curiosity to explore his many works and indeed, the several fine pieces of literature that influenced him."},{"Title":"The World is My Home","review":"I have read and loved many books by James Michener and I was happy to run across this book (on audio cassette from the library). It was interesting to learn about his life and to learn from his example. For example, even though he faced deprivations as a child, he made a choice to be a sunny, optimistic person all his life. He made a choice not to harbor grievances or dwell on negative thinking. Also, he was a great student all his life. He loved art, opera, literature and for anyone who has ever read his books, you know he had an insatiable curiosity about nearly everything. The nice thing is that when he learned new things, he shared that knew knowledge with the world and everyone was enriched.Also, he was a high-principled (moral) and generous man and his generosity began long before he became a famous author.He didn't become a writer until he was forty.

What fascinated me as I read this book by one of my favorites was his awareness of where publishing as an industry and writing as a business was heading, as he continued working in what turned out to be his life's final decade. Although he insisted on keeping his manual typewriter, and depended on secretaries to cope with word processing, he foresaw the shift from paper to digital submissions at a time when most authors and most publishers were either not thinking about this at all or refusing to consider that such a sea change might happen.

Mr. Michener is known internationally for far more than solely his writing, including service to his country in both the government and private sector.From his beginnings as an orphan during the Great Depression, his hitch-hiking began at age 10! His positive attitude combined with a superb intelligence found him being mentored by many, leading to a career studded with success. Michener's ambition was permeated by humility and humor. He exhibited no qualms about job security during the Depression. Moving about in high powered jobs only increased his self confidence. (Similar to author Louis L'Amour who also held many jobs worldwide which translated into his own best sellers.)Before World War II, Michener worked in the literary world as an editor; spent a year touring Europe at his own expense; and taught at what is now the University of Northern Colorado (UNC). During World War II, he served as a Naval Officer in an amazingly relaxed manner; he began keeping copious notes, and shortly after the war, his notes became \\"Tales of the South Pacific\\" which earned a 1948 Pulitzer followed by a top Broadway musical of the same name, starring Mary Martin and Enzio Pinza. For the most part he would live in a specific area to absorb the culture as he would publish another work. For example, \\"Centennial\\" was preceded by years living in Denver. Michener bequeathed his papers to the Greeley, CO college he loved so dearly in the \`30s. UNC happily houses \\"The James A.

The words are broken down phonetically, and phrases introduced in the beginning are reinforced in later lessons.

For example, it teaches you words, and then phrases, and helps you to retain them by asking questions that require you to employ them. I listen on my IPod as I commute on the train, and it's a plesaurable, engaging way to pass the time.I have received several curious looks, particularly from Chinese folk, after speaking poor quality Mandarin aloud, but my accent is slowly improving. At first, I was utterly uninteligible. Then, after just 6 units of Pimsler, I actually was able to carry on a brief conversation with a Mandarin speaking telemarketer last night.In Mandarin, I said, \\"Hi.\\" I asked her if she spoke English. I told her that I didn't speak that well. I told her I didn't understand her (even though I did). Perhaps more importantly, I understood most of her responses! I asked her if she knew where College Road was when I started running out of things I knew how to say. She seemed a bit puzzled by that, so I just said, \\"Thank you,\\" and hung up.If you've ever been intimidated by the prospect of learning Mandarin, you don't have to be. It does require you to use your brain, but, as long as you can take some time to listen (e.g., while commuting), you can learn.Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Chinese (Mandarin), Conversational: Learn to Speak and Understand Mandarin Chinese with Pimsleur Language Programs (Simon & Schuster's)","review":"I'm through lesson 5 so far, and I've probably only learned 10-12 exchanges. But my native Chinese students tell me my accent is amazing--and I've had no previous Asian language experience. What these lessons do is make you repeat variations of the same basic question (for instance, \\"Do you speak English?\\"), and they are designed to make you pay close attention to the tones. Tones are key! I'm learning now for a trip to China, but I will probably start experimenting with other Pimsleurs when I return to pick up some Korean and Japanese just for talking to the many Asian people at my job and in New York City, where I live.

When the box came, because of his illness, it stayed unopened. A couple of months passed and we received an email from \\"Stroll\\" which then was designated as spam-mail (nothing in the subject line revealed that it had to do with the Pimsleur Approach). In reviewing his emails today, I noticed a second email from \\"Stroll\\" and opened it out of curiosity. I learned that we now owed $256 for a supposed second installment of the Pimsleur Approach which we did NOT order. THIS SECOND INSTALLMENT AUTOMATICALLY COMES TO YOU IF YOU DO NOT CANCEL IT!!! As far as I can tell, we did not receive the second installment--according to Stroll's tracking records, it was delivered on January 4th, LESS THAN 10 DAYS AFTER WE RECEIVED THE FIRST INCREMENT (not giving us the 30 days to examine the first program as it says on their website). Although I hate to pay for what we did NOT receive, I was told that our account would go into COLLECTIONS if we did not pay it, so, feeling intimidated by this, I paid the account. THIS IS TERRIBLE!"},{"Title":"Chinese (Mandarin), Conversational: Learn to Speak and Understand Mandarin Chinese with Pimsleur Language Programs (Simon & Schuster's)","review":"Obviously the course you chose should depend on what you want as well as how you learn. This Pimsleur course offers conversational Mandarin, not reading or writing. In fact that is what I want right now. It proceeds almost entirely by immersion with very little discussion of grammar or pronunciation. That is not perfect for me, though it might be for you. I will come back to it. This Pimsleur course is entirely audio and so is very well suited to learning as you drive or walk or whatever.This is very convenient but there is another reason for it: Pimsleur has theory that if you look at written Mandarin (or any language) too early then you will have trouble acquiring a native accent, because you will pronounce the written Mandarin with an American accent (supposing you are American...). This may be exactly right, if Mandarin is only your second language. If you have already learned several languages with reasonably correct accents then maybe you will have less tendency to make that mistake.The problem with immersion-only Mandarin for me is that this is an intimidating language for Americans. The musical tone of each vowel changes the meaning of a word and the tones are hard for me to learn.So I am going to cheat on Pimsleur by also using Chinesepod downloads (mp3) and their written supplements. Sometimes I really can't be sure if a syllable on the Pimsleur CD begins with b or d. I can't always tell if a tone is rising or falling (although the narrator often steps in to help with that). So I will look it up. If Mandarin is your first foreign language maybe you should start with straight Pimsleur for just the reasons they give. Mandarin, even more than most European languages, is useless if you do not have a good accent.The other course I tried was Living Language Ultimate Mandarin. That course is not only conversation. It comes with a very nice textbook. And it requires that you spend considerable time working with the book in front of you, and so not driving or otherwise \\"on the go.\\" They said their course was the equivalent of 2 years of college courses and that may be true. It aims at all around mastery of spoken and written Mandarin including the simplified character writing used on the Mainland and exposure to the traditional characters used on Taiwan and in Hong Kong. I do not expect to ever reach that level, and anyway I would probably start with Pimsleur and Chinesepod.Pimsleur courses are reliably very good."},{"Title":"Chinese (Mandarin), Conversational: Learn to Speak and Understand Mandarin Chinese with Pimsleur Language Programs (Simon & Schuster's)","review":"Pimsleur is good for getting your feet wet but it's also lacking in that it only teaches you a few conversation topics. It stresses pronounciation of words and making your tones match the speakers on the disc, but tells you nothing about the four tones of Chinese (found that out the hard way). It also does not go much into sentence construction, only forming a pre-meditated sentence.I give it 4 stars because as a beginner with no prior experience in Mandarin, it let me get a grasp of what I would be studying in more in-depth lessons. So if you know absolutely --nothing-- about Mandarin then I recommend Pimsleur.P.S. Don't get the four disc version. The eight disc-er has the first four and nothing's different."},{"Title":"Chinese (Mandarin), Conversational: Learn to Speak and Understand Mandarin Chinese with Pimsleur Language Programs (Simon & Schuster's)","review":"The problem with the Pimsleur approach is that they teach far too little vocabulary. You go on and on learning just a few words, and worse. You have to tolerate the 'gradual intervail recall system' which means you have to listen to entire half hour to follow their rigid program and if you don't, your memory technique is wasted.This means that if you have, say, ten minutes in which to commute to work, you will listen to the same ten minutes teaching the same ten words over and over.Your other alternative is to keep your finger glued to the fast forward button. There are no'multiple track' opitons.I greatly prefer the Behind the Wheel Chinese/Mandarin course.The amount of vocabulary taught here far exceeds that of Pimsleur. Furthermore,each CD has a sentence building section (8 CDs in all) that teach you basic sentence formation to accompany the vocabulary. There are two native Mandarin speakers on the CDs.Even better, Behind the Wheel Chinese has multiple tracks which makes sailing through a review a piece of cake.I gave Pimsleur four stars just because I'm sure it could work for some people.I have tried other Pimsleur and Behind the Wheel courses and I always reach the same conclusion.No contest in any language.Behind the Wheel Chinese is way ahead in all categories."},{"Title":"Chinese (Mandarin), Conversational: Learn to Speak and Understand Mandarin Chinese with Pimsleur Language Programs (Simon & Schuster's)","review":"I really think this is a good method of learning, particularly Chinese. The people I know who speak English as a second language best are people who learned it by watching TV, not by studying. This second group of people often has the worst accents. Since the hardest part of Mandarin is the pronunciation, I figured the best approach would be to go alphabet-free for the first few years of my study. These CDs just allow you to listen and try to imitate, which I think is the best way.Now the bad thing is that you really will not learn very much. You're not even going to learn the basics with these 7 CDs. What you will learn is several phrases (and most of the individual words in those phrases), but I've listened to these CD's over and over for the past year (to practice the pronunciation multiple times) and what I've learned from these CDs in the past year I feel I could have learned in about an hour or two in any European language (for which the pronunciation is a lot easier).Also, the add above says this is the \\"first half\\" of the comphrehensive set. That's true only if you consider the comhrehensive set to consist in the first set (I out of III). It is indeed the first half of the first set of the comphrehensive set.I would recommend these CDs to anyone just starting out. I didn't expect to learn a ton of Chinese, just to practice pronunciation, but even I was surprised at how little Chinese I ended up learning by the end. There are so many pauses and repeats in the CDs that I think they could easily have taught twice the material in the CDs provided. It might sound like a lot of pauses and repetition would be good, but I can just repeat the cd myself (and I did). I'd rather they put more material on the CD so I could learn more once I finished learning a CD."},{"Title":"Chinese (Mandarin), Conversational: Learn to Speak and Understand Mandarin Chinese with Pimsleur Language Programs (Simon & Schuster's)","review":"I have finished Pimsleur Mandarin I-III and did all the lessons at least 3 times.The Pimsleur series in general, always encourages a sense of enthusiasm mainly for the deceptive (perhaps too strong a word) marketing and partly for the somewhat raving reviews!To put my review in context I am a native English speaker with much more natural ability in physical sciences rather than languages I have always been very mediocre in languages and never had any interest whatsoever in learning a foreign language. It more was just a passing interest that first introduced me to Mandarin Chinese. With a curiosity of the impenetrable nature of the language so distant from English grasped my interest but I really just started at a whim. Very Surprisingly continued with it off and on to the end of the 3rd Series.Pimsleur focuses on the 30 minute a day lessons, Seems easy right? Hence the full course should take 90 days before you have attained a advanced beginner stage. Therein lies the problem. If one realistically expects to get a good grasp of a language with just 30 mins a day, then one is very much mistaken! In my view it takes a lot, lot, longer that this, at least 3 times as long.Some reviewers are obviously a lot better than I at picking up a language and have noted the slow progress. For me progress was a little too fast and I need to constantly repeat the lesson or going over old lessons, especially as you advance on throughout the units.I think a lot of points have been made already about the Pimsleur Mandarin Series however I will add some for clarityPimsleur ContextNo question about it Pimsleur should not be your only source. You should at least have a pocket dictionary (The Collins pocket dictionary is good), a grammar book (Basic Chinese Grammar by Yip Po-Ching, et al), and by series II, a good set of websites. There are loads of excellent free ones that list and detail issues such as measure words, proper discussion of tenses. Even towards the end I hadn't really grasped the proper use of the \`le' and \`de' particle.ProsIts maintains interest!This should not be underestimated! Learning Chinese is difficult but ultimately rewarding. **If you are doing it for personal reward like me, this one key point outweighs all the cons below and justifies the course in the first place** I work long hours and the last thing I want to do is read a traditional text book in Mandarin every evening. I never took to solely slogging my way through a tedious grammar book or constant repetition of words via a flash cards. Pimsleur takes you from the first few basic words to complete (albeit short) sentences by day one. Pimsleur does an excellent job of bite size learning which maintains the enthusiasm!Great stepping stoneNaively I thought the 3 series would put me at an intermediate stage. You can have a basic elementary conversation with a native speaker who speaks slowly but as soon as the conversation takes off, or they alter the sentence, drop in unknown words, you are lost! This can be very disheartening as unfortunately (or more realistically), most people don't speak with the great clarity as the speaker on the audio files. This is not all bad, you are left with a strong sense of feeling that you can progress at a similar pace should you choose to continue on your own studies or via some other taught course. I read somewhere that 90% of spoken Chinese is covered by 1000 most frequently used characters (note characters not words!). Not sure how accurate my facts are!ConsLack of script.This is a major drawback in my view. This is the main reason I retract a point from the rating.The tones and characters can be very subtle. Although the tones should very different at the start as the lessons progress, you forget what exactly the tone the speaker is actually using, so you end up convincing yourself that you have been saying the correct tone all along. Furthermore, \`Tone Shandi' is not mentioned at all, For example: in lesson one, you are told that hello = ni3 hao3, i.e. 2, 3rd tone characters, however, when 2, 3rd tone characters appear in a row like this, native speakers pronounce the first one with a 2nd tone, i.e. ni2 hao3.I am baffled as to why Pimsleur refuse to give transcripts, it can only aid the course. No-one is going to get the script and not use the course! Although you can get attain a transcript fairly easily on the web if one is inclined to do so, you can, with the aid of a dictionary and a few good websites, write you own script and Dictionary. This is tedious but invariably time well spent. I wrote out most of the lessons in Pimsleur with its corresponding pinyin, (with the aid of my Chinese flat mate!) and it was a huge help! Writing out all the words in pinyin will really hammer the tones and pronunciation in. Some tones are very subtle and are a key part of a taught course, where by you are trying to distinguished, for example, between \`si' and \`ci'. Pimsleur makes little attempt at highlighting the differencesContinuityAlthough for the most part, the lessons build from one another, there is a fair portion of words that are never repeated. Contrary to what they recommend I found great benefit from repeating old lessons. Some words in Series one are not repeated after that. Its not a major drawback as they can't very well keep repeating every word regularly but definitely once you finish them all, meander about through lessons.PriceIts expensive but it's a great start to the language, much better than Rosetta stone which is all bells and whistles. You will get a lot more that the 90 days @ 30mins a day out of it.Lack of grammarAs the lessons continue, you need to supplement the course with a decent grammar book. The \`le' particle is actually explained properly, (albeit briefly) in one of the accompanying audio notes but nevertheless the use of measure words, particles and time construct, is only loosely discussed. Furthermore a good grammar book will rectify that and be very encouraging to read /dip into. Basic Chinese Grammar, by Yip Po-Ching, et al is an excellent accompaniment. When you read it, you do a lot of \\"Oh really!\\", \\"yes I see!!!\\", \\"that makes sense!\\" etcVocabularyFor me this is a minor point, Pimsleur covers about 450 (I have the full list) It's shorter than Rosetta Stone and other competing packs but it is minor, Some other reviews mentioned that you only learn 3 colours, red, green and white. It's a very simple task to take out a pocket dictionary and learn the rest should you wish! Its not important at all. They are used in the same context. I think it is much better to know 400 words well rather than 1000 pronounced incorrectly and used in the wrong context. The Tuttle flash cards are great compliment. You can't compare 2 programs on a cost per word basis,As for choice of vocabulary, I would have liked to see a different choice of words. You learn about 15 place names in China, 3 in the USA and that's it. A few country names or continent names would be nice. Also there is a lot of talk about tennis and bowling in Series 2 but no mention of Mahjong or ping pong. The only food/beverage they mention is water, beer, tea, wine, coffee and mung bean cake! I am told by native Chinese that it's a odd one to learn! I would have thought that in 90 lessons you could put in a handful of scenarios that ask the waiter for Chicken, beef, fish noodles etc! Its invaluable in China, how to order in a restaurant. There are several websites that summaries frequency of characters in the Chinese language. That is they list every word and character in order of common usage based of statistical studies. Pimsleur can mention character 2000 and miss out the 30th most common character. i.e. you are taught \\"microphone\\" but not \\"fish\\" Minor points again but shows that the series could be optimised a little better.My guide to CourseMake your own notes!I, like other reviews was initially disappointed by the lack of a script. I, 100% recommend making your own notes, Writing the pinyin really does beat home the pronunciation and tones. Also, some great snippets are noted through the lessons but unless you write them down you are left searching through previous units for something that you knew was important but just can't find it. It takes a while for the brain to grasp that there are a huge amount of characters that sound the same and have different meanings (even those with same tones). Your brain naturally starts doing a one-to-one association with mandarin-English link. Hence writing all words out in a table in MS word and sorting alphabetically by pinyin (i.e. mini dictionary) is very interesting to see, you have a lot of \`z' and \`x' words. You do about 450 words over 90 lessons so about 5 per lesson on average. Its pretty easy to write word in English and corresponding pinyin & characters in MS excel or MS word, Will make a massive differenceRepetition, repetition, repetition!Other materialI have Tuttle flash cards but to be honest I rarely use them. There are a lot of websitesAvoid False marketingI see a lot of adverts for \\"learn 80 characters a day guaranteed\\" or \\"become fluent by tea time\\" by Dr Wang \`\\"4 PhD's\\" Cheung, ... blah blah. Its not going to happen!User ReviewsEverybody has they own style of learning, one method doesn't necessarily preclude another.Read completed reviews on Amazon. There are a lot of reviews where people have be enthuastic about the material and reviewed it after 10 minutes (I am guilty of that to!)Don't just do it onceIts not like school where you try pass an exam and forget it. If you really want to learn, repeat lessons and when you finished start bouncing around through the course. I listen to it on my IPOD and when I was finished all 3 series I went back over it doing first 10 mins of Unit I, lesson 5, Unit II lesson 5, Unit III lesson 5 etc. Remember speaking a language is not sequential, topics can occurs at any stageSupplement the courseThere is a huge amount of websites around, loads of decent free material. I can't put links in this review but search for \\"pinyin table\\", \\"mandarin\\" etc A grammar book to dip in and out of by Series 2 is essential in my view.UpdateI recently registered on a mandarin language course and also got a copy of the Rosetta stone CD series.Pimsleur V Rosetta StoneThere is a review on Amazon by Timothy bender I think on the Rosetta stone series. It's a spot on review in my opinion. Rosetta stone is all bells and whistle and more like a entertaining bit of software rather than a serious means of learning a language. The subtleties in pronouncing the initials and finals in pinyin are completely missed by the voice detection system. You can say a word with word sound and wrong tone and Rosetta stones says you got it perfectly even on the most sensitive detection level. RS teaches characters so that's a positive. Personally I think the \`immersion' system or whatever they call is a gimmick in my view. A native English speaker has been engrained with speaking the language, it cant be undone.Pimsleur beats it hands down (for oral of course, no characters)Pimsleur V Taught courseI recently started a taught Mandarin course at well known language school. There are pros and cons. Cost is an obvious one. Pimsleur starts to look fairly priced compared with a taught course. Taught courses have the benefit of interaction, being able to ask questions, discussion points about mandarin phrases etcDisadvantages are, don't cover as much material on a cost basis, grammar covered more, may not meet schedule.Naturally, it completely depends on ones circumstance, and the nature of the taught course. A lot of taught courses here in the UK are simply taught by native speakers and actually they don't make the best teachers (i.e. could you teach English successfully?)"},{"Title":"Chinese (Mandarin), Conversational: Learn to Speak and Understand Mandarin Chinese with Pimsleur Language Programs (Simon & Schuster's)","review":"I love Pimsleur's method, but NOT FOR STARTING Mandarin. Needs more explanation, not \\"listen and repeat\\".For an English speaker, Mandarin requires more up-front explanation of how the pitched syllables work.I've used Pimsleur's audio CDs for learning basic Japanese and Spanish and *LOVED* it.But when I bought Pimsleur's Mandarin, I was stumped. I couldn't even imitate the very first sentence, no matter how many times I went back and tried again. My mouth just didn't know how to make that sound. And there was no explanation, just \\"listen and repeat\\".After an hour of trying one sentence of this Pimsleur Mandarin, I had to give up. Knowing there must be a better way, I was about to take private lessons.Instead, the brand new \\"Michel Thomas Method\\" to Mandarin has just been released by Dr. Harold Goodman and it made all the difference in the world. A completely different approach that I feel needs to come FIRST, BEFORE you get into the Pimsleur method.In the Michel Thomas method, someone really takes the time to explain the sounds and grammar. No memorization, just explanation then experience. It gets you really understanding the basic building blocks of Mandarin first, so that when you're done with its 10-hour audio CD program, THEN you can come back here to Pimsleur's Mandarin and it'll all make sense."},{"Title":"Chinese (Mandarin), Conversational: Learn to Speak and Understand Mandarin Chinese with Pimsleur Language Programs (Simon & Schuster's)","review":"This is the best audio language program I have used for a very challenging language. Unlike other audio programs that cram in much vocabulary and too little response time, Pimsleur Mandarin limits the vocabulary but teaches the beginner how to organize sentences. They do this through repetition and substitution. It was so subtle that I didn't realize how much grammar I learned. Used in combination with a book that provides Pinyin spelling and tones, it is even more useful for continuing at the intermediate levels. My only complaint is with how Simon and Shuster markets the set. I thought this was the complete Mandarin I course. It is only the first 16 lessons. To complete Mandarin I, you will need to purchase another set with 14 more lessons. The price is $175 or more depending on coupons and discounts. The problem is, this set includes the first 16 lessons that you already own and you have already mastered. This makes it redundant and expensive. I completed Mandarin I by finding a complete set on cassette(not CD as I preferred) at the library. Now, I just bought Pimsleur Mandarin II in CD and hope it is complete.

At a dense half an hour each, the lessons were just not concise enough for me to remain focused on the material. Explanation is kept to such a minimum that the student is required to deduce sentence structure (for instance, we are told that the syllable \\"ma\\" is used to make a phrase negative, but we are not instructed as to where to place it in a sentence -- after the verb? the noun? at the end of the sentence?) Also, the instruction stresses the importance of matching one's pronunciation to that of the native speakers, yet the two speakers, one male and one female, pronounce phrases distinctly differently. In addition, the male speaker, who predominates, pronounces the same phrases differently several times in different sections of the lesson. (And both speakers speak WAY too fast.) The phrases themselves are not particularly useful (I have spent a week so far trying to learn how to say \\"I speak a little Chinese\\" which, in fact, I obviously don't.) The most interesting thing is, the lessons manage to be too long and too fast at the same time. Memorization is difficult without written materials or writing things down to reinforce them.

Teach Yourself Chinese Mandarin is an affordable way to learn Mandarin. The Teach Yourself Package comes with a book and two audio CD. You can put the audio into your MP3 or iPod. However, you can also spend time by learning from Schaum's Chinese Grammar Book. An essential book is learning how to write the Chinese Characters. There are two books that teach you how to read and write in Chinese.The Chinese Language is a difficult language to learn. Until today, there are many old Chinese people who don't know how to read or write in Chinese. The written Chinese is understood anywhere in the Chinese community regardless of dialects like Cantonese. Once you learned how to read and write in Chinese, the speaking part will come naturally. It's like learning musical notes. You can't play Mozart or Vivaldi without reading the notes. Yes, Frank Sinatra sounds good; but Frank Sinatra uses improvisations to change the tunes of the lyrics. You can't do sound improvisations in the Chinese Language because the meaning of a word depends on the sound.

I can have limited conversations with Chinese friends as long as they are related to certain topics (e.g., what languages we speak), know a bit about sentence structure, and can sort of understand pinyin pronunciation. The learning curve goes pretty quick as long as Pimsleur sticks with common words and phrases. If it did this all the time, I would give it 5 stars.Unfortunately, the course veers occasionally to specific terms which can leave your head spinning. For example, lesson 3 focuses on asking directions. To do this, it comes up with stupid street and road names that are meaningless. So, you have to keep trying to repeat it over and over. It completely interferes with what should be covered like how to say \\"I'm lost\\" or \\"go left or right\\". This permeates throughout the lessons and makes what could be a great learning tool an average one.No language course is perfect and this is as good a starting point as any.

However, if you want to learn serious Mandarin, you will be better served with a different progran than this one."},{"Title":"Chinese (Mandarin), Conversational: Learn to Speak and Understand Mandarin Chinese with Pimsleur Language Programs (Simon & Schuster's)","review":"I've used Pimsleur materials before for German. As a foreign language teacher (French, Japanese, English) I value the thoroughness of the method with regard to pronunciation as well as to the methodology which drills/reviews vocab. and phrases while incorporating new structures & vocab. Especially for a language which a learner may find difficult to pronounce, this is in my opinion the best available short of a native speaker. Pimsleur will likely not be useful for someone who seeks a quick review or overview of a language."},{"Title":"Chinese (Mandarin), Conversational: Learn to Speak and Understand Mandarin Chinese with Pimsleur Language Programs (Simon & Schuster's)","review":"Let me first state that I recommend this product to anyone with no prior experience with Mandarin or someone who wants to casually learn a little. Here are the pros and cons.Pros:1) CD format is great2) Lessons are short and easy3) You can learn very quickly IF you dedicate the time4) Lessons learned in the previous section are reinforced in the next.Cons:1) There is no pin yin to go with the CDs. I had a hard time distinguishing between, for example, \\"ni\\" and \\"yi\\". This is probably because I listen in my car instead of at home. Your best bet is to listen through your home stereo system or walkman.2) The words and pharases you learn are not necessarily the ones you want. For example, in Lesson 4 you are taught how to say \\"Where is Long Peace street?\\" Who needs to know this??3) There is no discussion of sentence or phrase structure so that you can form your own. For example, the sentence \\"You speak Mandarin very well\\" is structured \\"You Mandarin speak very well\\". The serious learner needs lessons on sentence structure.Overall this is a good beginner product. If you're a serious learner, you'll need additional resources like a dictionary, phoenitics guide, and phrase book."},{"Title":"Chinese (Mandarin), Conversational: Learn to Speak and Understand Mandarin Chinese with Pimsleur Language Programs (Simon & Schuster's)","review":"Upfront notice: This package offers the same first 15 lessons as in Pimsleur's Mandarin I. (Wish I'd known, because I bought them all over again, in order to continue with just the next 15 lessons!)I like learning languages and have used all kinds of tapes / CDs to practice in the car. Used in that way, this program is tops! (A friend from mainland China was astonished at how, in just a few weeks, I started speaking in fluent sentences, with a near-perfect accent -- and using current, idiomatic expressions.)With Pimsleur, you won't progress through many topics or an extensive vocabulary -- but what you encounter, you'll learn well. (The program repeats concepts over and over, configured in different ways to avoid monotony and to embed them into your head.) And--as far as it goes--the material is all high-value, immediate-use.To really learn Mandarin, you'll also need to take up other resources about the written characters and grammar, and to build vocabulary. And be aware: this program proceeds at a fairly sedate pace. If you want to go zero-to-60 in Mandarin for a trip to Beijing in 2 weeks, you need to find a different approach. For me, this is a way not to waste time in the car--and I go through about one lesson per week until I know the content cold! But Pimsleur has been an incredibly effective kick-off to what clearly will be a lifetime of effort . . . like losing 10 pounds, the first week of a diet."},{"Title":"Chinese (Mandarin), Conversational: Learn to Speak and Understand Mandarin Chinese with Pimsleur Language Programs (Simon & Schuster's)","review":"I believe that different people learn things in different ways. Perhaps the Pimsleur style of learning a language won't suit everyone but it suits me.I've been struggling with Chinese for 20 years. The fact that I still can't hold a fluent conversation with a native Chinese speaker is partly testament to my lack of dedication and in part due to the many unsuitable courses I've undertaken.Please, avoid like the plague, all those 'Chinese in 5 minutes' books or CDs. They are only going to waste 5 minutes of your life.Chinese is difficult. If you're over 30 and plan to learn the 'hanzi' ( characters ) and 'pinyin' , then you are starting out to learn two languages. Good luck.It is ultimately the correct way to learn Chinese but you need to be extremely dedicated ( obsessed ) and/or you will have to live in China for an extended period of time.By far the best compromise I've found, is the Pimsleur style of learning. The biggest and HUGE fault of every other system of learning a language is - lack of repetition.This is the key to people learning. How can a juggler juggle 6 balls without thousands of hours of practice? How can learning Chinese be achieved when the teacher recites something once and you are expected to retain it?Study harder, rewind and listen again. If you are like me, it won't happen. You won't retain the language.The Pimsleur system focuses on the most important aspect of language - it's spoken. It may not be the most thorough, long term route to fluency in Chinese but, as a middle aged person, it's by far the most effective way I've found to be able to get some actual skill with the language.The only fault I have with the system is that it doesn't go far enough.

In my opinion, there is only one occasional flaw (aside from the relatively high price of the full program). That is that the speakers are inconsistent in their pronunciation of the tones. I mean they are sometimes inconsistent in their pronunciation of the SAME phrases at different times!! One could excuse this, even for a tonal language, if there was some type of written aid or perhaps an explanation (e.g. a dialectical difference, etc.). But there is no excuse for this type of erratic pronunciation in an audio-only program. Even still, this is a five-star product for how rapidly it gets you up and running. Some people do not like the Pimsleur audio \\"immersion\\" and quizzing method.

The competition has you memorizing hundreds of words, without using them in sentences.The pimsleur method trains your ear and brain.

And you can ask questions with a high sounding pitch at the end, or sayyes or no with the verb.I also learned how to add the numbers 1 through 99, and you get to perform adding with nativespeakers.Couldn't say how more thrilled I am with it.I would even give it six stars, if I could."},{"Title":"Chinese (Mandarin), Conversational: Learn to Speak and Understand Mandarin Chinese with Pimsleur Language Programs (Simon & Schuster's)","review":"This product is amazing to put on your iPod.

I realized that I would never have a better chance to learn Mandarin and it would help me connect with my new colleagues. I bought these Pimsleur CDs and, having completed the first six lessons, feel like I'm ready to write a review.First let me say that I think any of the commercial language programs probably work if you actually follow the program. In this case the program is to listen to the CDs for half and hour per day, every day. The process is very interactive. You are asked to repeat phrases and answer questions in Chinese. The nice points about the Pimsleur method are that you have your hands free and that it only takes half an hour a day. I think I will be far less likely to blow this program off than I would if it required writing or computer work or took more time per day.I have been doing most of the lessons first thing in the morning while I drink my coffee. You are supposed to repeat each lesson until you get 80% of the responses correct. So far I have averaged three repetitions on each lesson.Progress: After a little over two weeks I find myself understanding a fair number of phrases and words when my colleagues are talking in Chinese. My overall listening comprehension is only about 5%, but that's progress. I have tried out several sentences on them and they seem impressed. The night before last I actually carried on a halting conversation with a waitress in a Shanghinese restaurant and she said my accent was \\"very good\\". I don't know if I believe her, but she said it in Chinese and I actually understood it! Overall I am very satisfied.I will probably buy the rest of the disks after I finish this set.

I had only finished just over half of the lessons when I traveled to China. While in China, I shocked many native Chinese speakers with my command of their language. Admittedly, the extent of my vocabulary was limited, but the things I could say were understood. More than a few native speakers showed their surprise and even delight on their faces. Clearly I was communicating.I had a breakthrough with my first, short conversation with a taxi driver: I was able to tell him I wanted to go to my hotel, and then confirmed he knew where it was. I arrived at my destination without having to break out the hotel address card. This was a big deal for me. Later, a native Chinese speaker from Shanghai commented on my \\"Beijing accent\\".

Louis Chunovic is not the &quot;writer&quot; of this &quot;Northern Exposure&quot; book, but rather has &quot;Compiled and Edited&quot; the proceedings, which are, of course, based on the television series created by Joshua Brand &amp; John Falsey. The idea was to take pretty much everything said by the character of Chris Stevens (played by John Corbett), the voice and soul of the borough of Arrowhead County for everyone who loyally listens to K-BEAR's &quot;Chris-in-the-Morning&quot; radio show. I am not sure if every quote was actually uttered over the air, or simply in the radio station, and not on the streets of Cicely, but you get the idea. The result is that from the literal call of the wild to the complex vagaries of love to the fine art of curing a hangover, this book provides (in its own words) &quot;a veritable aurora borealis of Chris's own recollection, speculations, dreams, and philosophies.&quot;After an introduction that recalls how reading Walt Whitman's &quot;Leaves of Grass&quot; changes his life from a budding hooligan of fifteen into an artist, this book is divided into two sections. Part I consists of Raps, Rants, and Wrenching Times. We are treated to The Chris Stevens Story, culled from his walks down memory lane, and then Chunovic tries to get thematic, with mixed results. Remember, for the most part these observations are divorced from the original context of their respective episodes. Part II is a catch-all section that offers Opinions and Observations, A-Z, which would be from Aging (\\"People impose all these chronological imperatives on themselves\\") to Zen (\\"See Carpentry; Mathematics; Plumbing; Technology\\") for those keeping track. As I said, I appreciate the attempt to present this collection of observations made by Chris Stevens as an articulated philosophical position, but this is more of a cultured and idiosyncratic weltanschauung. The key thing is that Chunovic is not trying to create consistent ontological, epistemological, or axiological positions. These are just scattered seeds of wisdom, embedded in Chris's recollections, speculations, dreams, and philosophies. Besides, the pleasure here is just getting a chance to re-read those big long speeches Chris used to unload on &quot;Northern Exposure.&quot; The meaning, dear reader, lies not in Chris's words but in ourselves. Pick and choose as you desire.My one minor complaint would be that the writers who came up with these great speeches and choice epithets are not credited. Allow me to rectify that with a list of all the writers who wrote on &quot;Northern Exposure&quot;: Sybil Adelman, David Assael, Kate Boutilier, Joshua Brand, Henry Bromell, Jordan Budde, Mitchell Burgess, David Chase, Sean Clark, Denise Dobbs, Sam Egan, John Falsey, Diane Frolov, Robin Green, Barbara Hall, Karen Hall, Ellen Herman, Jessica Klein, Dennis Koenig, Jeff Melvoin, Geoffrey Neigher, Mark B.

Ike and Abby, the detecting duo, are thoroughly creatures of the late 1990s, and their New York City is realistically gritty and menacing. Yet, the books manage to evoke the great mysteries of the 1930s and 40s. Comparisons to Nick and Nora Charles are inevitable and on-target, but don't do justice to these endearing characters.Like a well-executed meal, all the ingredients are finely balanced and delicately seasoned. There is just the right amount of action, of character development, of humor, of &quot;insider&quot; information. The plot is complex but clear, devious but fair. I was carried along on the momentum of the plot and the action -- but by the end, I had come to know Ike and Abby. And, I had (painlessly) learned a little about television news production, homelessness in New York (including the potter's field where indigents are laid to rest), roller-blading, glass-blowing and other subjects I never knew were so interesting.This is mystery writing at its best, an important series by a talented and exciting writer."},{"Title":"Until The End Of Time","review":"Ten victims, one doctor and an innocent man killed over a simple, yet tragic, experiment with glaucoma medicine. At about three o' clock in the morning Abby was on his way to work when a mugger named Tex came up and approached him and tried to tell Abby his story. Abby wouldn't listen so Tex mugged him and took four of his dollars and his I.D. Abby works for NTB news station so that morning on the news was his mugger pictured as the Yellow-Man serial killer. So he and his ex wife, Ike, decided to find him and ask him why so that their newscast would be the first to air the story. When they found him he said that he hadn't done it and that he was painting the victims faces yellow so that they would get noticed and not, just because they were homeless, taken off to Potter's Field and that a doctor was testing glaucoma medicine on them. Then they put everything together and figured out that a doctor named Hektor, who was on their show, had glaucoma and that he was the one testing out medicine on them for his own personal use. Then Hilda, a guest on the show, killed Hektor because her father was one of the victims and she was mad so she gave him a taste of his own medicine, literally, and killed him. She also killed Tex because Tex knew her secret and she didn't want it to get out. In the end, Hilda is framed for murder and he and his ex-wife get back together. I would recommend this book to those who like books that lead you off track and keep you wondering who the killer really is.Until the End of Time by Polly Whitney was a book that always made you wonder who the killer really was. The killings suspect changes many times throughout the book. At first the suspect was Tex because he was in the videotape. Then it switched to Hektor because he was the doctor who was giving them the actual medicine. Lastly, out of nowhere, an unexpected suspect, Hilda was framed as the killer because she killed Hektor and Tex.This book was also shocking in many aspects. It was shocking when you found out that a suspected serial killer had just mugged Abby. Then when the author told you that the homeless would just sit on the ship and didn't have any proper burial when they died and were just thrown in Potter's Filed to rot. The most shocking part of the novel was when Hilda Murray had been behind it all, because she was supposedly the nice one and she had been on the show with Hektor just before he died and it wasn't at all expected.The book had a lot of added details so that you would sway away from the actual murderer. It added the things about Abby getting mugged to add some meanness to Tex's character to make him seem as if he would do it. The fact that Hilda was such a nice character in the book and that Abby even took her out to lunch made her seem like she wouldn't kill anyone. When Hektor was on the show he didn't have much detail to him so he wasn't played up to be a type of person who would test out drugs on the homeless.In conclusion, I can say that this is an excellent book because of its elaborate and in-depth details. It is a book that I would defiantly read again to see if now that I know who the killers were if there were more clues in the book that I didn't pick up because they weren't suspects. If you are the type of person who likes books that lead you of track and make you wonder this is the book for you!- N.

As his second book on this topic, Farhang Rajaee has done a sound scholarly work in editing this volume. This readable and engaging book has multiple objectives: to update debate on unresolved issues of the Iran-Iraq war, to show the biased roles of international forces favoring Iraq, and to provide particulars about the controversial issue of the relationship between the war and Iranian revolution among others. To solidify this claim, the book refers to various dimensions and historical, economic, political, ethnic and religious backgrounds of the conflict between Iran and Iraq. The book's focus is on \\"Iraqi aggression,\\" yet it is a valid source of information, facts, and reliable analyses useful for scholars as well as any individual interested in regional conflicts, international politics, and war. It also presents an analytical perspective on the causes and consequences of the war. The book is organized into three parts and fifteen chapters, including the editor's introductory chapter and the contributions of fifteen knowledgeable scholars. The first part of the book, Policy Dynamics, consists of six chapters that covers the roles of the regional and global forces in the conflict. The second part, Conceptual Dimensions, in five chapters, covers the various issues of the conflict between Iran and Iraq. The third section, Postwar Development, addresses the issues of post-war period. Understanding the historical and global connections of regional and national events and the relationship between the policies and actions of major powers and their interests in the world is obviously different than what is known as the conspiracy theory. The book clearly makes distinction between these two, while indicating its awareness of the prevalence of a conspiratorial mind among the Middle Eastern people in general and Iranian policy-makers in particular. For instance, the egoistic and paranoiac personality of Saddam Hussein is seen as a factor affecting all the war events. This volume succeeds in documenting it as a fact that Iraq started the war. It falls short, however, in proving their claim that \\"the US followed a conscious policy to...destroy the revolution, encouraging Iraq to impose a war on the newly formed revolutionary government\\" (p. 49). This position contradicts that \\"European states were selling arms to both sides in a hidden competition\\" (p. 47). Or, \\"it is possible that Iraq could not have waged the war, or continued it, without military support from the Soviet Union\\" (p. 36). And \\"the war began when the revolution in Iran was in a moderate phase, and evidence demonstrates that the Iraqis had been planning this aggression for months\\" (p. 95). As it is correctly stated elsewhere, \\"in the international arena, states have neither permanent friends nor permanent enemies, only permanent interests\\" (p. 70). It was the interests of these nations used as justification for the alternate supports for both sides in the conflict, or the shift from one policy to another, or the use of an entirely different policy during the second Iraqi aggression (against Kuwait). As part of this policy \\"...in 1986, as the Iran-Iraq war began to turn decisively in Iran's favor, the pace of U.S. intelligence information escalated as part of bid to at least restore Iraq's edge. The United States was not alone. In advance of the Faw counteroffensive, France, Egypt and Jordan provided help in reorganizing and retaining the weary Iraqi military, Reagan administration officials pointed out.\\" (Robin Wright, LA Times, Feb. 16, 1998) Saddam was looking for an excuse to attack Iran to lessen the effect of Iranian revolution on Iraq and to declare the 1975 treaty of Algeria invalid. Based on his assessment of the Iranian military force as being disintegrated and dysfunctional right after the revolution, Saddam saw the time to be ripped for expansion of his territory. But \\"he grossly misperceived and thus miscalculated Iran's weaknesses\\" (p. 109). While countries in the region consistently sided with either Iran or Iraq during the eight years of war, the Soviet Union and the West supported both sides supposedly to maintain the balance of power in the region. Despite the fact that Iraq was the aggressor of the war, Iran created more enemies than friends. This was mainly due to Iran's lack of proper diplomacy and a hostile approach toward other countries. \\"In short, the Islamic Republic's foreign relations have been strongly ideological, personal, and reactive as well as oriented toward its few precious allies in the region\\" (p. 139). I may add that this was actually an extension of the internal policy of the Islamic Republic of Iran (IRI). It was after the war and during the presidency of Rafsanjani that a practical economic and political policy was gradually adopted (p. 145). In the latter chapters, the book provides a comparative analysis of Iraqi aggression in Iran and Kuwait and criticizes the double standards of the international agencies, such as the UN. While preparing for the invasion of Kuwait, Saddam proposed normalization of relations with Iran. His intention was to either form an anti-Western bloc with Iran or to keep Iran neutral in the conflict. Though, officially, Iran declared its neutrality in the conflict, some Iranian leaders (radical Islamists) were navely deceived into entering the war against the West. The Iranian government soon corrected this major error; otherwise it could have brought a disastrous result for Iran. Although, many other mistakes of the war were to be recognized only after the end of the war death of Ayatollah Khomeini, an independent assessment of the war yet to be done. This volume falls short to include several internal factors that prolonged the war and weakened the position of Iran in the conflict such as the involvement of non-professional non-military personnel in the war affairs. It also fails to include the views of the Iranians who opposed the war. Lessons could be learned also through a self-critical perspective about the war and a fair assessment of the erroneous policies made by non-professional, ideologically oriented leaders in the power circle. The following are few more points overlooked by this volume: 1. The hostage taking was an important issue that undermined the legitimacy of Iranian demands as the victim of Iraqi aggression at international arena. 2. Instead of focussing on national interests, the IRI used a sectarian religious cause, virtually excluding many potential capabilities. This policy turned the territorial aggression of Iraqi forces against Iran into a war against Islam, overshadowing the fact that this was actually a war between two Muslim nations. 3. To engross the power, the struggle within the IRI grew to the extent that the elected president, Bani Sadre, was ousted. Also, the ethnic groups who were demanding local autonomy were effectively suppressed. The policy of monopolization of power led to opening of another military front against ethnic and religious minorities in Kurdestan at the border side with Iraq. The IRI's religious sectarian policy weakened patriotic sentiments and hindered a strong identification with Iran as a nation-state against the aggressor. 4. War was used as a means for political consolidation of the regime and as an excuse to suppress its opponents. This goal prevented Iran to reach an honorable peace when time arrived. \\"After recapturing Khoramshare [no parts of Iran were occupied by May 1982], Iran demanded $150 billion worth of indemnity. Saudi Arabia agreed privately to pay $50 billion worth of indemnity to Iran if it accepted the peace agreement\\" (p. 58). Regretfully, however, the IRI failed to use that opportunity in favor of an honorable peace and prevention of further war damages.Kazem Alamdari, Ph D California State University, Los Angeles"},{"Title":"Discovering Computers 2003: Concepts for a Digital World, Complete","review":"I am very happy and pleased with the book for its solid and rich content.

Great service!"},{"Title":"Rudyard Kipling: The Complete Verse","review":"Largely forgotten today, to many, Kipling is an outdated imperialist with racist and sexist views, and should be left to moulder on the shelves of public library back collections. To others, he is a great poet, with a sympathetic ear for dialogue and an uncanny ability to weave the atmosphere for any story or poem.I side with the latter.I've liked Kipling years back. He writes poetry as easily as he does his stories, with wit, snappy soundbites, and both the ability to make you laugh and cry.Famous for his writings of the soldiers, for his fairy tales, he isn't much in demand these days, except maybe recommended for children, which is rather a shame, because he wrote many interesting works, be it in verse or novel.Those who call him racist had probably not read past the first few lines. Even in more blatant works like &quot;Gunga Din&quot; or &quot;Fuzzy Wuzzy&quot;, he writes with a certain respect for the natives. And even in his colonialist days he was more of its critic than its trumpet. Such an attitude is obvious in more obscure works like &quot;We and They&quot;, or &quot;Hadramauti&quot;, where an Arab voices his dislike for the Englishmen.Also there are his historical pieces, like &quot;the Dutch in the medway&quot;, describing the humiliating defeat of the British at sea, and &quot;the Roman centurian's son&quot;, a very poignant piece about an Roman soldier being called back to Rome after decades in Britan. More whimsical and lively pieces (as well as the satire he was known for), like &quot;The way through the woods&quot;, &quot;Pagett, MP&quot;, his pieces for chapter headings, as well as inspiration poems like &quot;If -&quot;.Darker works like &quot;the Storm come&quot; shows that he is no warmonger; his &quot;Recessional&quot; predicts the dissolution of the empire which he nearly outlived, and his lament for his son in &quot;the Children&quot; is both moving and tragic.I suppose there's not much to be said -the poetry is loud enough on its own, and I hope my cruddy penmanship doesn't affect your view on Kipling -or deter your from reading his works."},{"Title":"Rudyard Kipling: The Complete Verse","review":"This is a treasury of verse for Kipling fans and anyone who enjoys poetry.

Many moons ago, after killing 200 buffalo they killed a bird. That senseless murder angered Thunderer who took away the souls of four women. The irate tribe retaliated by killing four of Thunderer's children. In a rage he starts to eradicate the tribe of 2000, but the Creator intercedes by placing the tribe under a curse. Two days a year they will live on the mortal plane; the rest of the year in an ephemeral existence. The only hope to escape the curse resides in the Chosen One who must perform a heroic sacrificial deed by the time he is thirty.In 1835, Burnt Chest knows he is running out of time to save his tribe but instead rescues Angelia Honeywell and her brother who lead a wagon train through the wilderness though they know nothing about the job, endangering their passengers to escape the law. As he helps them and he falls in love with Angelia, Burnt Chest knows he must not lose sight of his quest, but she is so pretty and warm as she reciprocates his deepest feelings.THE ANGEL AND THE WARRIOR is a terrific Indian romantic fantasy that readers will enjoy from the moment when White Claw explains the dilemma to the four preadolescents. Burnt Chest is fabulous as he knows time is running out on his mission, but prefers spending what's left of his clock with Angelia. Though the emphasis is more on the romance, this fast-paced story line is driven by the desperation of Burnt Chest, who understands what is at stake.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"The Angel and the Warrior (Berkley Sensation)","review":"The hero's tribe is under a curse--they live in a shadow land, and each generation one young man is chosen to try to break the curse.

The Powers are stand-ins for the rich, powerful and famous in our society, and mixed with the stories are glimpses of how they affect us and warp our lives. Now, a superhero murder case - similar to those of previous &quot;Powers&quot; story arcs - leads to global catastrophies, and what many of the characters believe will be &quot;the end of the world.&quot; Bendis and Oeming are simultaneously mocking standard superhero groups - the cover is a clear reference to DC's &quot;Super Friends&quot; of the 1970's - and warning us that celebrity worship diminishes us.

He writes mainly about the Great War, Germany, the problems of the peace, various forms of socialism, and Bolshevism. For GK, the Great War was nothing less than a battle between Christendom and barbarianism. He pounds Prussia and Prussianism into the ground with relentlessly logical arguments, and a recounting of facts so obvious and fundamental that they seem to have been overlooked by the pacifists, socialists and other war critics of the time. His perspective on American culture, Wilson, The League of Nations, the Russian Revolution, Poland, France, capitalism, on and on, are truly fascinating and blend together to provide an incredibly vivid picture of the political and social forces at work in Europe in this enormously complicated and tumultuous period.

In this book, Rosenstock-Huessy uses this riddle as a starting point for an inquiry into the essential features of human speech that people in modern times have tended to disfavor or take for granted. Counter to the intuitions of modern personalism, Rosenstock-Huessy says that real speech, speech capable of transforming lives, must have been in its origin, and still today, formal speech whereby strangers can be assembled, oriented, and sent forth in trust to pool their energies to create durable order and remarkable change. Intimate chitchat and everyday common sense, argues Rosenstock-Huessy, can be nothing more than the residue left behind by formal speaking and the \\"uncommon sense\\" of political agreements and multi-generational social projects.&quot;The Origin of Speech&quot; declares that human beings require rituals and tangible signs that they live in an orderly universe over which they possess some control. In the process of exerting power through speech, people invariably create both the past and the future as the locations of society's hopes and fears. Ominously, Rosenstock-Huessy points out that the modern mentality has consistently preferred the informal to the formal, the abstract to the ritualistic, and numerical impartiality to personal address, and hence has forfeited the sources of a \\"grammatically healthy\\" community.&quot;The Origin of Speech&quot; is Rosenstock-Huessy's longest sustained essay currently available in English on the subject of speech. Communication scholars and linguists concur: no other writer has approached the problem of formality in language with the fresh insights to be found in &quot;The Origin of Speech.&quot;&quot;Origin of Speech&quot; can also be ordered from Argo Books (www.argobooks.org), as can all the rest of Rosenstock-Huessy's English language works, including many of the lectures he gave on these topics.

It should also be noted that this is the novel that won the author the Carnegie Medal, a prestigious award for outstanding children's books. It's the third part of the loosely linked Roman Britain trilogy that began withThe Eagle(The Eagle of the Ninth) and continued withThe Silver Branch. Readers are probably well aware that the first novel has been dramatized into a movie, The Eagle, which is currently opening and showing in cinemas all over the world.Other reviewers have dealt with the storyline and Aquila, the tortured main character, so I won't go into an explanation of the plot.The Eagle of the Ninth was one of the main influences in my choosing to write about Rome and its legions. I have read it many times, and although I cannot say why, the same cannot be said of the second two books. I recently read The Silver Branch for the second time specifically to review it, and while I enjoyed it greatly, I didn't think that it quite matched the first book in calibre. I expected that also to be the case with The Lantern Bearers. How wrong could I have been?The Eagle of the Ninth fuelled my boyish imagination with pictures of stealing back an eagle standard from wild Scottish tribes, and to this day, I remember and enjoy and honour it for that. I had few childhood memories of The Lantern Bearers, however. Rereading it over the last few days was akin to reading it for the first time. To my surprise and joy, it gripped me not just with the richness of its prose, but also with the depth and accuracy of its description of human emotions and relationships. I was moved to tears on numerous occasions, and I now regard this finely crafted novel to be every bit as good as The Eagle of the Ninth. If anything, it's aimed at an older audience than the first two parts of the trilogy. In my opinion - and I write this as a man rather than a boy - it is a better book than either of the others. The Lantern Bearers stands four square with any piece of adult historical fiction that I have ever read.

Normally, I don't much appreciate love stories, but the one in this book was different. I was urging him on, pleading with him to love her. I was close to tears several times; yet this is not a very emotional book, by most standards. In fact, Aquila is often the very absence of emotion.

I'm already starting another work of hers."},{"Title":"The lantern bearers","review":"The third volume in Rosemary Sutcliff's Roman Britain Trilogy, THE LANTERN BEARERS is set roughly 300 years after her first, THE EAGLE OF THE NINTH in around 427 AD. 18-year-old Aquila is just starting out on life, and has spent a year as a commander of the Rhenus Horse Auxiliary Cavalry. What happens in the first few pages of this novel changes him for life, from an open-minded pleasant young man to someone who is not well-liked.But Ms. Sutcliff has done such a wonderful job in showing us Aquila's life both before and after, that even though he is not a likable character, one cannot help rooting for him.By and by he acquires a wife and a son, but nothing can take away the awfulness of what happened to him. Eventually, however, he finds a certain kind of peace, and the last image of the book is both consoling and realistic. This book won the Carnegie Medal in 1959. More than just a fictional account of history, this book engages the reader at a deep level, forcing us to feel the agony of the difficult choices Aquila has to make. Five stars."},{"Title":"The lantern bearers","review":"This is really a YA book, but the writing and sentiments are very adult. Although it's the third in a trilogy, it works just as well as a standalone book. Set in the Dark Ages. Aquila is a British born soldier for the Roman Army who deserts when the Romans leave the British shores for good.QUOTE: \\"Why should a deserter take the trouble to light Rutupiae Beacon?\\" Aquila demanded, and his voice sounded rough in his own ears.\\"Maybe in farewell, maybe in defiance. Maybe to hold back the dark for one more night.\\"Heading back to his family home, he barely has any time with his beloved sister and father when the Saxons invade and take everything. He watched his father killed and his sister carried off, before he is captured as a slave. The Lantern Bearers tells his story of his escape from slavery and subsequent search for revenge. He joins up with Ambrosius, the so-called Prince of Britain to fight the Saxons.QUOTE: So Aquila took his father's service upon him. It wasn't as good as love; it wasn't as good as hate; but it was something to put into the emptiness within him; better than nothing at all.I loved this book as a teenager, and loved it even more now. It would be hard not to feel for Aquila and to sympathise for his cause. The quality of Rosemary Sutcliff's writing lifts what could be a good story to being something of pure delight, littered throughout with quotes that I would read and read again, just to enjoy one more time.QUOTE: The wind blustered in from the sea, setting the horses' manes streaming sideways, and the gulls wheeled mewing against the blue-and-grey tumble of the sky; and Aquila, riding a little aside from the rest as usual, caught for a moment from the wind and the gulls and the wet sand and the living, leaping power of the young red mare under him, something of the joy of simply being alive that he had taken for granted in the old days.Aquila is always alone, it becomes part of who he is, even when he eventually takes a wife.QUOTE: But tonight, because Rome had fallen and Felix was dead, because of Valerius's shame, the empty hut seemed horribly lonely, and there was a small aching need in him for somebody to notice, even if they were not glad, that he had come home.There is a beauty and a poignancy to this story and it is one that I would recommend to any teen or adult with an interest in the period. One of the fabulous things about Sutcliff's writing is the simple way she explain complex issues - her skill at writing for a younger audience. One thing's for sure, I'll re-read this again before too long. 5/5"},{"Title":"The lantern bearers","review":"The Lantern Bearers is the fourth in Rosemary Sutcliff's loosely-connected series about a Roman family in ancient Britain. The story begins when the last Roman legions are leaving Britain. Beseiged by wars with Germanic tribes on the European mainland, the empire can no longer afford to spend any of its military capital fighting off Saxon invaders on this remotest of its territories which it had by now largely abandoned, anyway. Young Aquila, a cavalry officer in the Roman army, is spending a rare leave with this father and sister on his family's homestead when he is urgently recalled to duty. Immediately upon his return he learns that preparations are being made for the last boatload -- literally -- of Roman legions to leave the island of Britain forever.Over the ensuing few days Aquila wrestles with his thoughts and feelings and finally, at the last moment, realizes that, though he considers himself a Roman, Britain is his home. His family has lived on the island for generations, he knows his father and sister will never leave, and he decides that he cannot leave either. So he hides in the lighthouse on the coast and watches while his ship sails off without him, then makes his way back to his family's villa.Just three days later his world is forever turned upside down when Saxons raid his home, burning it to the ground, killing his father, carrying off his sister, and leaving him tied to a tree in the woods for the wolves to find. By an ironic turn of events he is rescued and taken to the homeland of the Jutes (present-day Denmark) as a slave. Desolate at the loss of his beloved father and sister and the only life and world he has known, beset by bitter loneliness in a strange land, the desire to find his sister is the only thing that keeps him going.Thus begins The Lantern Bearers, a story that traces Aquila through the ensuing decades of his life as he journeys through hatred, grief, desolation and bitterness in a quest first to find revenge and then to find some measure of peace. At the same time the story traces the story of Britain as it gradually loses the influence of Rome and descends into the Dark Ages.As always, Sutcliff's writing is lovely, detailed and evocative, whether she is describing the British countryside, or a battle scene, or the physical decay of society in the wake of Rome's departure from the island. Unlike her earlier books in this series, The Lantern Bearers really isn't about a young man's quest for honor or bravery, and doesn't involve adventure per se. Instead, it explores, through the life of Aquila, the painful overtaking of an older culture (in this case the Romano-Celts of Britain) by invaders (the Saxons). The bitterness, hatred, crossed loyalties, fragile peace and uneasy acceptance that Sutliff so skillfully depicts resonated with poignant realism; I am sure this is how it was in the many times in Britain's history (and that of other parts of the world as well) when two vastly different peoples battled for the same piece of ground, and their cultures (as inevitably happens) uneasily merged.The book also introduced the character of young Artos; the amount of attention given him, and the fact that he was a Romano-Celtic young man who was a charismatic battle leader, made it obvious that he was the King Arthur of legend. I look forward to reading the next book in this series to see how Sutcliff develops his story."},{"Title":"The lantern bearers","review":"Set in the brief Romano-Celtic twilight between the end of the Roman Empire and the creation of Anglo-Saxon Britain, this is the story of Aquila, a Roman soldier who chooses to stay among his adopted people. However, his world crashes to pieces when he and his sister are enslaved by the Saxons, their father slain and their farm destroyed. Aquila eventually escapes, but his sister, now married with a Saxon son, makes her own choice to stay with the invaders. Aquila is embittered and angry, and the remainder of the story is his redemption, helped by a kindly priest, his celtic wife from an arranged maarriage, and the Romano-British leader, Ambrosius, whose friend he becomes. I first read this book in my early teens, and it has stayed with me ever since. The themes of irreparable loss, vengance and redemption are quite adult, but not at such a level that adult or teen cannot appreciate them. Sutcliffe brilliantly captures the heroic twilight of the Dark Ages, and makes it utterly convincing. She also wrote a longer sequel called &quot;Sword at Sunset&quot; (use the out-of-print service) based on the Arthur legends - Aquila appears as a minor (older) character, Arthur appears as a young warrior Artos in &quot;Lantern Bearers&quot;. Both books are highly recommended for adults, &quot;The Lantern Bearers&quot; for teens and adults."},{"Title":"The lantern bearers","review":"This is a book that I have to force myself to read, despite the fact that I love it dearly. The first time that I ever read it I was reduced to tears several times and even now, almost twenty years later, I still have to steel myself before dipping into it again.This is a book about a lost world, the moments when the Roman Empire in the West flickered and died and the black cloak of the Dark Ages descended, almost swamping the light of civilisation. This is a book about the start of the fall of Roman Britain as it began to fall under the sway of the Saxon barbarians. This is a book about a small group of people who, as in the title, became lanternbearers, trying to keep alight the flame of civilisation as the darkness and chaos of the Dark Ages threatened to swamp Britain.It is not a cheerful book for obvious reasons, and as such is more for older children who are starting to look into darker literature. It is a book that deals in issues such as anger, despair, revenge, fortitude and resolution. It is also a book about loss, about what Britain lost when the English came, and speaking as a Welshman it has more than once reduced me to tears."},{"Title":"The lantern bearers","review":"I brought this book with me a month ago for my first trip to London a month ago and reread it for likely the fourth time in 40 years under an oak tree in Hyde Park. Ranking along with Flowers for Adonis as one of Sutcliff's most bleak but sweeping books, The Lantern Bearers features a a classically great and complex hero who is a tough, thorny, quiet brooder caught between old and new worlds. As both the young romantic risking all to give his world one last blaze of hope and the bitter general fighting to hold back the enemy tide, Aquila is an engrossing study of a man trying to make sense of his duties to his families, friends, and ruler. The choices he is forced to make at the twilight of British-Roman England are heartbreaking but of a piece with the man and his world.Arguably the most complete of Sutcliff's novels as she weaves the bits of recorded history into a tale that pulls together an important era for England, this a hard but rewarding novel. Full of great settings including the Roman lighthouse, Saxon war camp, British mountain stronghold, and various battlefields, the book also includes the dolphin ring that ties together a string of Sutcliff's novels from early Roman Britain to Norman England as she highlights the many peoples who made England."},{"Title":"The lantern bearers","review":"Wonderful story of Aquila, a young Roman cavalryman who chooses to remain in Britain after Rome recalls her armies to defend her crumbling frontiers. His friendship and loyalty to his sister is tested through captivity by the invading Saxons. Aquila joins the legendary leader Ambrosius in his fight to preserve the last dregs of Roman civilization in Britain against the invading Saxon barbarians. He meets the boy who becomes the even more legendary Arthur. This story is a excellent prequel to Sutcliff's best book: Sword At Sunset."},{"Title":"The lantern bearers","review":"Most people know the drill already regarding Rosemary Sutcliff: she wrote beautiful, melancholy children's books on key moments in British dark ages history that are so complex and beautiful that they appeal to adults as well. As many reviewers have noted, \\"The Lantern Bearers\\" is just such a \\"children's\\" book, but will appeal to readers of any age who enjoy rousing tales based on both fact and legend. This book follows the adventures of a Roman soldier who decides to stay in Britain when the legions depart in the early 5th century. He is quickly captured and enslaved by the invading Saxons but manages to escape and join the Romano-British resistance to the Saxon onslaught. This is one of Sutcliff's finest--surpassed only by its adult-oriented sequel, \\"Sword At Sunset\\"--and her prose captures the sadness of seeing the end of an era. But like many of her books, it also has a message of redemption and hope and ends on an uplifting note. The action is gripping, the characters are three dimensional and interesting, and the historical detail is astounding. Highly highly recommended."},{"Title":"The lantern bearers","review":"I cannot hope to match the eloquence of the previous reviews, but I agree with them completely. I first read The Lantern Bearers in my teens; I am now in my thirties and still find myself drawn to this book. I would add that all of Ms. Sutcliff's books written for juveniles make compelling reading for adults. In fact, for intelligence and beauty, they surpass most contemporary fiction."},{"Title":"The lantern bearers","review":"I am an avid adult reader of Arthurian legends. I read this book after hearing it is a prequel to The Sword at Sunset, also by Rosemary Sutcliff, and I loved it. I am captivated by the romance and chivalry of this passionate era in our history - and also by the great battle scenes as described by the better authors of this legend (Bernard Cornwell in particular). This book kept my adult interest and made me more anxious than ever to get to The Sword of Sunset...a continuation of the story line in The Lantern Bearers where a young Artos is introduced to us - and by the end of the book can be recognized as the great King Arthur to come."},{"Title":"The lantern bearers","review":"Although the third book in the trilogy about the family with the dolphin ring, The Lantern Bearers is maybe for more mature readers.(Notice I said more mature, NOT older.) One of the things I love most about this book is that, even though it is sad, the sadness is REAL, not Romeo-and-Juliet type, with a tragic ending. The ending is not exactly hopeful about the future of England, but Aquila has finally found inner peace. However, the middle, in which Aquila is a slave of the Jutes (not Saxons, that's just what the British called all the invaders), and when he- oops! Don't want to give away the story!- is very bitter, and that's why it's perhaps for MORE MATURE readers. This book is one of Rosemary Sutcliff's best."},{"Title":"The lantern bearers","review":"One day, someone clever will make the Eagle of the Ninth series into a great movie. Nothing EVER written captures the collapse of the Roman Empire and the loss of civilization as Sutcliff did when she wrote these books.The penny drops on the last three pages though. I shan't say what, why or who, but as the last of the Romano-Brits ride for Mount Baden it clicks.Memorable, brilliant and vivid-even after I read it 40 years ago.By the way, \\"How the Irish Saved Civilization\\" I STRONGLY suspect was based on this book."},{"Title":"The lantern bearers","review":"I feel strangely unsatisfied with this book. I liked the attention to detail and atmosphere as well as the historical context and references, especially to 'Artos' and his father 'Utha' - very subtly done. There were some moments of incredible bitter-sweetness, such as when Aquila watches the Romans leave without him at Rutupiae Light.The characters were well-drawn, a few lines of description necessary to give a good impression of each. There's nothing to really criticise; it was a very solid piece of work. However, I certainly wouldn't want to re-read it - I wonder why? I think perhaps the main character, Aquila, just didn't click with me. His bleakness and bitterness was understandable but it meant he never really interacted with any other characters as a friend - deliberately done, but it made for quite monotonous reading. We never saw closely into any other characters; there were brief, well-written encounters with people, but nothing very fulfilling. I find that I enjoy a book most if it has good characterisation, and while Aquila was sufficiently bitter for his role, I found him lifeless (perhaps I was meant to? I certainly didn't enjoy reading about him though...) and the other characters not well fleshed-out enough. Years and events flashed by, and before I knew it Aquila was getting old, and I still didn't really know him, or the people around him, even his wife. Events were sketched over and I never felt caught up in the story entirely because of the jumps forward in time. However, there was a lot of beautful imagery in this book, right down to the last sentence; that's what kept me reading."},{"Title":"Drugs and Death : Profiles of Illegal Drug Abuse","review":"A powerful presentation.This extremely graphic presentation is one of the most effective and affecting presentation on the dangers of drug use and abuse that I have ever seen.Its intensly graphic nature serves to highlight the commen age fallacy that drug use can be a fleeting and harmless flirtation.This guide illustrates the underlying compund cyclic nature of drug use that can quickly thrust the user into a network of unforseen problems.Most of us are familiar with burn outs but one would be surprised at how many drug users and pushers started out as mere burnouts until they become trapped beyond what they could bear, usually taking their own lives.Its a shocking wake up call to the misleading information society that suggests drug use is a personal choice that does not interfere with the safety of society.One would be amazed at how erroneous that type of subjective argument is, especially after coming away from this highly detailed presentation."},{"Title":"The Don Flows Home to the Sea","review":"The Don Flows Home to the Sea brings the story of the civil war in Russia to it's conclusion from his other book, And Quiet Flows the Don. He not only tells a great story but does so with a great lyrical style that absolutely makes the book a page turner. I would recommend this book to anyone who appreciates the style of Dostoevsky, Turgenev, Tolstoy, and Gogol."},{"Title":"The Don Flows Home to the Sea","review":"This book is probably the best work to make it out of Russia this century. This is a truly captivating tale of adventure, love, and war. The story twists and turns as the front lines move over the countryside. The author gives an unbiased portrait of the revolution, and all of it's bloody consequences. Definately a must read."},{"Title":"The American Mind in the Mid-Nineteenth Century (The Crowell American History Series)","review":"Irving H. Bartlett's contribution to the American History Series is a sound and brief look at the ideas that dominated the period of time in American history that is overlook by most history classes, the 50 years from the War of 1812 to the American Civil War. From religion to reformers to showmen, Bartlett turns a critical eye to them all. A large section of the book deals with the minds of the Jacksonians and the mind of the South. Emerson, Thoreau, the Grimke sisters, Webster, Calhoun, Howthorne and others have their influence over the way Americans think analyzed. My personal favorite is the chapter on P.T. Barnum and the begining of entertainment in the United States.This is a great book for a college class or any lover of history."},{"Title":"The Kids' Yoga Deck : 50 Poses and Games","review":"I teach yoga to people of all ages, including my son's preschool class of three year-olds. I think this set is truly wonderful. :-)I guess I'm writing in response to the oh, please review. That parent might wish to take a second look from a different perspective. I am an instructor and know the value of good instruction with a qualified teacher, but kids just naturally do yoga! Parents can use common sense to help kids practice safely at home. This deck stimulates creativity. Yoga for kids is FUN!!! So many things in life are serious enough. I am serious about my own practice, but light-hearted, too. I have Babar's Yoga for Elephants (LOVE IT!), but that is a little too \\"old\\" for my son, as yet. This deck he has been using since his third birthday. The illustrations are light-hearted and bright! The names reflect things found in nature and our world. The author named parsvottanasana \\"pyramid\\" and pascimottanasana as \\"river\\" in this deck. She uses imagery i.e., \\"Imagine that your legs are the sandy river bottom and your spine is the water flowing down.\\" Pyramid works! Your legs need to be really strong and stable to hold this pose, like a pyramid. Maybe the cutesy name referred to was \\"upside-down gorilla.\\" (The deck is recommended for ages 4 and up. I wouldn't use some of the names with my adult classes, unless the intention of the class were PLAY!, maybe! but this deck is intended for children. A lot of the names match the English translation of the Sanskrit.) The author knows that kids loooooove imaginative play! She gives suggestions for encouraging kids to use their imagination within the poses to get a real feeling for the poses as they practice.The deck is color-coded with breathing poses, sitting and standing poses, upside-down and forward-bending poses, backward-bending poses, twisting poses, partner poses and resting poses. She gives suggestions for incorporating artwork, language arts, cooperation, non-competitiveness and listening to one's own body into the practice of yoga. Their are some \\"strings\\" of poses suggested as well as ideas for creating your own strings, using cards of different colors. Each card has on the front side an illustration of each pose, like the one shown on the front of the box. On the back she has written instructions to give for getting into and out of the pose, as well as suggestions for how to be in the pose - breathing, feeling sensation different places. Below she has suggestions for moving deeper, for expressing how the pose affected you with words, art, finding things that resemble the pose in nature, etc. This deck is truly a wonderful gift for those wishing to share the spirit and beauty of yoga with children. This touches kids beyond the physical of just how to get into the outer form of a pose.There are some other neat books for kids out there like Fly Like a Butterfly, Playful Family Yoga, Thia Luby's book, The Idiot's Guide to Yoga with Kids, among others. This deck is very accessible (easy to just pick a card, more so than paging through a book, to be honest), safely and effectively sequenced, inspiring for children's (and adult) creativity and just a joy to use! I highly recommend it!!! I hope this review is useful!"},{"Title":"The Kids' Yoga Deck : 50 Poses and Games","review":"These cards are very useful in structuring a class for children. The children enjoy seeing the brightly colored cards which show how it looks when doing the pose. You can make your own \\"string of poses\\" for the children to do, as the deck suggests, by picking a card from each color (rainbow string), or there are other \\"strings\\" suggested (basic string, sleepy string, energy string, friends string, calming down string, warm-up for sports string). I teach yoga to children ages 6-12 at a Youth Center, and I use these cards for every class. We mostly use the Rainbow String, except I often put the partner poses (a yellow card) at the end of a class to close it. That way, the children leave the class feeling a connection with one another. Often, I pick two poses in a particular color group (usually the light green and the red cards) to extend the class to a 30 minute time frame. There are really nice GAMES at the bottom of each card, listed after instructions for doing the pose. They are clearly bulleted, and I have found them to be very useful. The children are interested in these cards, and they like to shuffle them around and read them. They can offer input for class content. These cards spark their interest in yoga. I have many \\"yoga for children\\" books which I use as supplements occasionally, but this yoga deck forms the structure for the children's yoga classes. I would recommend it for home use also. These cards are easy to use, and they make yoga FUN for the kids!"},{"Title":"The Kids' Yoga Deck : 50 Poses and Games","review":"I use the yoga deck in my 4th grade classroom with my 9 and 10 year old students.

The Midden's gloriously chaotic denouement in particular is something of a comic masterpiece. This is some of Tom Sharpe's strongest characterisation in a long time and is simply crying out for a sequel. I genuinely want to know what adventures the indomitable Miss Midden gets up to next. Surely the unfortunate Chief Constable will be plotting some horrible revenge? What about the creepy Major? and can poor Timothy Bright escape Piggy Chops for ever? So come on Tom Sharpe, let's have &quot;Middenhall Revisited&quot;!"},{"Title":"The Midden","review":"An amazing history, just like Sharpe is able to make them.

There are traces of Sharpe in it,but i feel Sharpe has succumbed to what i gratutiously call the \\"Hollywood\\" syndrome. Find something which appeals to the masses, then flog it to death. This book is really nothing more than nastiness without a real purpose to it; money and sales seem to be the motive behind it. The constant emphasis on lesbianism and sexual escapism (and i am not a prude) are simply crude and unamusing. Shame on you Mr Sharpe for descending from brilliance into mediocrity."},{"Title":"The Midden","review":"I've long been a Tom Sharpe fan, but \\"The Midden\\" just doesn't live up to his previous books. Three specific criticisms:(1) it's just not very funny. Sure, there are occasional amusing passages, but nothing that gives rise to the uncontrollable laughter we've come to expect from Sharpe.(2) a lot of the writing is gratitously nasty. Sharpe's writing has always been 'edgy', and that's okay ... but here he includes long irrelevant passages, filled with unnecessarily coarse language. The personal attacks on Margaret Thatcher and John Major strike an unpleasant note, too.(3) much of the book reads like a badly done pastiche of \\"Blott on the Landscape\\" and \\"Riotous Assembly\\"."},{"Title":"The Midden","review":"On the lookout for new novels by Tom Sharpe, I scouredthe bookstore shelves under &quot;S&quot; for years. The howls ofdelight that Riotous Assembly, Indecent Exposure,Blott on the Landscape, Wilt and The Great Pursuit elicitedfrom me and from anyone I lent them to were loud and long.Although I never saw his other novels as the equal of thatquintet, I enjoyed them all, even &quot;Wilt on High.&quot;I waited years for a new novel, only to be saddledwith &quot;Grantchester Grind,&quot; a true dog of a novel.With &quot;The Midden,&quot; Sharpe shows flashes of his form,but the assembly of the story is flawed. The beginningintroduces us to a character who then spends the rest ofthe novel either unconscious or imprisoned and out of mostof the action. We then only have the rest of the novel tobecome acquainted with the new characters centeredaround the Middenhall. This is unfortunate, becausewe are reminded of Lady Maud in &quot;Blott on the Landscape,&quot;and Inspector Flint in &quot;Wilt.&quot; Moreover, we have afailed attempt at an irreverent attitude to today'sheadlines with references to AIDS. It takes a verydeft hand and a good grasp of these types of issues tomock them and Sharpe comes up short. Nevertheless,there are amusing characterizations, a brutal ridicule ofauthority and some amusing passages. This is the closestthe world has been to a Tom Sharpe novel of the old typein many years, and a vast improvement on &quot;Grantchester Grind.&quot;I can only hope Sharpe keeps improving at the samepace so that his next book will be top drawer.I'm still waiting for &quot;Blott&quot; part two"},{"Title":"MEN IN SPORTS","review":"the book arrived just in time for the class to start.

For the umpteenth time in their 20-year relationship, Cleo's lover has run off with another woman. Her friends wonder why she puts up with this; why she lets herself be hurt this way; why she doesn't leave. But Cleo's answers are always the same. I wait because I love her. I hurt because I love her. I let her come back because I love her...A PASSION SHE CAN'T DENY... Anyone in her right mind would know better than to get involved in Cleo's life right now. But Frankie hasn't been in her right mind since the day she walked into Cleo's cafe. The heat between them is undeniable, but Frankie desires more than a warm place in Cleo's bed. She wants to fill her heart.A CHANCE FOR TRUE HAPPINESS... Maybe this time will be different. Maybe this time Cleo can finally free herself from the chains of the past and surrender to a passionate new love. Then again, old ties are the hardest to break.END OF BACK COVER TEXTMany of Bennett's books seem to have too many characters, thus complicating the stories and making them hard to follow. That is not the case with this wonderful book. There are only three main characters to follow in 'Old Ties' -- Frankie: the new girl in town; Cleo: the perpetual forgiver; Romaine: the perpetually forgiven.Romaine and Cleo have been together off and on for almost 20 years. Romaine strays, but always comes crawling back to the devoted and monogamous Cleo -- that is until Cleo decides enough is enough and opens her heart just enough to let Frankie in. Romaine doesn't take kindly to this and so the story goes.Well-written, easy to read and enjoy, this book is a welcome addition to my personal collection"},{"Title":"Old Ties","review":"Old Ties is a light, yet engaging love story.

Don't miss out on reading this book."},{"Title":"Old Ties","review":"&quot;Old Ties&quot; is truly one of the worst novels I have read in recent memory.

I can say that his teachings have expanded my perspective of things literally to new levels.Many other boooks and people say the same things as in the book. The book puts it in the visual perspective the brain understands. The Bible tells nothing but stories. Great motivators always have a great story to tell. When you think of something, it is done in a story even if it is short!I love the book for it's simplicity. It is so simple I can actually absorb more becaus of the ease of the content. I would ask to just try it! The simpleness is the genius behind it. There is nothing comlpicated about the Sun rising in the morning. The Sun feeds that which is deserving and perishes that which is not! It does some of the most complicated things known to man, yet no one really questions that it's still simple in their mind.Vernon's ideas appear to destroy that which is not worthy and grow that which is in as much ease as the Sun rising....."},{"Title":"Psycho-pictography;: The new way to use the miracle power of your mind","review":"I stumbled across Vernon Howard after a lifetime of struggling with life, theorizing and reading silly books or books I did not understand.I have found him to be the most helpful and trustworthy writer of all. He is wise of course, but much more than that. He writes so simply that it is easy to gloss over a whole paragraph to your detriment. But if you back-up and read slowly it dawns on you, well me at least, that this man has tremendous understanding.OK, \\"so what\\" you might say.

Over the years, this is the book I have come back to for clear explanations, and it is indeed my favorite Vernon Howard book. For many years I have kept the mental picture of the Indian brave setting the stack of wood on fire after many misses with his flaming arrows, to remind me to persist in spite of the many challenges along the path. I would be indebted to Mr. Howard if this were the only book he'd ever written because it means so much to me."},{"Title":"Psycho-pictography;: The new way to use the miracle power of your mind","review":"Great 'self help' book.

Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Psycho-pictography;: The new way to use the miracle power of your mind","review":"Vernon Howard tells many short stories which some readers, not all, find motivational. Short storytelling is the same technique used by Jesus Christ as recorded in the four gospels. Short storytelling is not a new way to use the mind unless one has never assembled stories around themes before (such as serving the needs of people well and loving them). For those who are not motivated by bare facts, storyboarding/visioning of a successful outcome can help."},{"Title":"Psycho-pictography;: The new way to use the miracle power of your mind","review":"HI!Psycho-Pictography came into my possession in a very strange way. I was in a need for growth, and it came to me thru a bizarre circumstance and answered ALL my questions and showed me ALL the answers.

A sincere desire for inner change. 2. Contact with workable principles. 3. Self-honesty. 4. Persistence. Common sense, right? It's amazing how uncommon the use of it is. Even those who have heard of this advice and worked with it need REVIEW and PRACTICE, but most of all, a different outlook, a different perspective.

Some of the writing style seems a bit corny or outdated, but the content is amazingly powerful.I don't think much of most self help books, but this one really does teach us to meditate on the way our minds work, and the resulting increased awareness really can bring about lasting change. It does take a lot of work, but obsessive thoughts can be brought under control with this awareness, leading to a lessening of chronic anger and depression, which in turn allows a brighter outlook and a more optimistic future.Vernon really knew his stuff."},{"Title":"Psycho-pictography;: The new way to use the miracle power of your mind","review":"This book makes you think about life a in radically diffrent way. The book offers short but powerful stories that change your perceptions and stimulate personal growth.

I was seeing things in a whole new way; life and everything on the planet looked wonderous; and I allowed myself the privilege of feeling whatever emotion arose - and being okay with them all! \\"This is the way man was meant to feel,\\" I told myself. \\"And I've never felt better in my life!\\"I've since slipped from that \\"high\\" and then wondered what it was I was doing right that created such wonderful emotional states. Only now am I beginning to discover the answer to that question: I read one-third of THIS BOOK in the months prior to my \\"enlightenment.\\" Perhaps it was Vernon Howard's \\"Psycho-Pictography\\" that made the difference! If so, then this book is a little miracle-maker worthy of repeated readings! It must work imperceptibly - almost subliminally - at creating real life-changing results.Time to read \\"Psycho-Pictography\\" again and test my theory. If it can again serve as a catalyst toward wonderful feeling-states, then I'm in for a wonderful 2005... and will never feel depressed or irrationally afraid again!If you're depressed, lonely, panic-striken, confused about your place in the Universe, or haunted by irrational beliefs about yourself and the world, I recommend giving this book a crack at what it is that ails you.

If you are new to the idea of self awakening, or acquiring good mental health, this is a good place to start. Compared to his other books, \\"Mystic Path To Cosmic Consciousness, The Power of Your Supermind, and \\"Esoteric Mind Power\\", this book seems on a beginner level. But that's good if you've never read these other books. I could recommend this, then the other books in that order.The one and only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because the \\"Mental Pictures\\" didn't appeal to me that much. Some people need analogies and metaphores to help them to grasp a concept, I just tend to want to get to the heart of the teaching. The whole book is based on the idea of visualizing these concepts in this way, and others may find this enjoyable.That is only a minor point, I do believe this book will ease you into the philosophy."},{"Title":"Psycho-pictography;: The new way to use the miracle power of your mind","review":"Truth resonates loud and clear from each page of this book!Other reviewers of this book here have said it all, very well.This is the most valuable book I own, for it has saved my life, many times.Thank you Vernon Howard!"},{"Title":"Psycho-pictography;: The new way to use the miracle power of your mind","review":"This book can show you how to keep your mental balance in today's world.

I even remember seeing an article he wrote for the Wall Street Journal that became the nucleus of the first chapter. Ching tells many very interesting stories but the one that truly gripped me was the one about the Kangxi emperor's grief at the death of his stepmother. Here one of the most pwerful men in the world was reduced emotionally to that of a child grieving the loss of his mother. He himself was already an old man who couldn't walk because his feet were swollen but he 1. cut off his queue, something one only did at the death of one's father or maybe paternal grandfather; 2. wore mourning garments when his own courtiers told him that it wasn't necessary; 3. wouldn't sleep in his palace but lived in a mourning hut. At the funeral he kept calling out \\"Mother!\\" in such a way that his own courtiers were embarrassed. It definitely shows that these people were indeed human subject to all the emotions we all feel."},{"Title":"Ancestors: 900 Yrs","review":"THis is a remarkable inquiry into the history of one family, from the rise of one member 900 years ago - a confucian scholar noticed his fine caligraphy in an exhibition and took him on - to martyrdom in Mao's CHina and the career of the writer as a journalist.It takes this kind of story sometimes to bring the lessons of history out, in particular the impact of the confucian tradition on a civilisation. The book is peopled with exremely vivid characters, almost all striving to honor their family in the records that survive. To Westerners, the view into an alien and vanished worled is as fascinating as it is surprising. THere are sons who were honored as having true &quot;filial piety&quot; because every day for years they licked the pus out of their mother's wounded knee; the difficult father who ruined the family with gambling and sloth - a typical selfish &quot;Asian man&quot; - only to spur his son to greater effort; the local official who spent a huge part of the family fortune to build a splendid garden for the emperor to see as he passed their home once.Nonetheless, this history gets a bit lugubrious with detail, particularly personal. SOme of it could only be of interest to members of the immediate family, in my view.REcommended for those who want a quirky perspective on Chinese history."},{"Title":"Library of Contemporary Architects: Alvar Aalto","review":"ISBN: 0500580065 and ASIN: B0006VUDFU ONLY!

He gives an extremely cogent hypothesis to explain how and why we perceive music on an emotional level, and from what I've heard, nothing's been shown to disprove his ideas.Beware that although Bernstein tries to put everything in &quot;layman&quot;'s terms, many of the concepts touched upon will be difficult to understand without a rudimentary knowledge of musical notation.I found this 'book' to be extremely interesting and a unique, welcome perspective on the nature of music. Those of you interested in Bernstein's compositions will get a nice long look at the inner workings of the mind of one of America's greatest composers; and even if his insights as to the answers of the questions he's asking are erroneous, the manner in which he couches said questions is insightful in and of itself, and more than worth the investment."},{"Title":"The Unanswered Question: Six Talks at Harvard (Charles Eliot Norton Lectures)","review":"I respect Bernstein even more as a scholar of music and languages than I do as a conductor. I thought this was an inspired literary work of his, really. For example, his explanation of musical motive in Beethoven's 5th Symphony where we are shown that Beethoven has taken the common coda form, TA TA TA DUM, that many classical works end with, and turned it to a motive from which derives the motion and power of HIS entire symphony. That is Bernstein at his most insightful and brilliant. Wonderful! Illuminating! I would never have thought of things that only a conductor and musicologist can otherwise understand and explain. Thank you Lenny, we love you!"},{"Title":"The Unanswered Question: Six Talks at Harvard (Charles Eliot Norton Lectures)","review":"The Unanswered Question, the transcript of six lectures delivered at Hardvard in 1973, outline a new theory of music. Inspired by work of Noam Chomsky and other linguists, Bernstein attempts to find a system of musical grammar analagous to that of language. This is the weakest part of the book. He makes strained generalizations and is attempting to show something that quite possibly isn't true. Starting with the third lecture, however, his work becomes stronger. He includes an efficient analysis of Beethoven's Pastorale Symphony without any extramusical associations. Then he proceeds (with musical examples) to trace the &quot;twentieth century crisis&quot; in music and how Schoenberg and Stravinsky derived different &quot;solutions.&quot; This is the strongest past of the book, and certianly worth suffereing through the first two weaker lectures. &quot;The Unasnwered Question&quot; is strongest for raising questions rather than answering them."},{"Title":"The Unanswered Question: Six Talks at Harvard (Charles Eliot Norton Lectures)","review":"There is little to say that has not already been said. These lectures are classic because of their multi-disciplinary focus. Simiply put, they are an integration of diverse material that fosters an awareness of the larger picture.

No. I started reading BAD TO THE BONE the night I purchased it, resulting in another night's missed sleep.There is not a single paragraph in this book that is slow, dull, or boring. Not a single paragraph. There aren't many books you can say that about. But, I'm warning you that once you start the book, there is absolutely no way known to mankind to stop reading.Besides the nothing-short-of-gifted sense of humor Katy Munger displays, she can make a character spring to life in one sentence. The reader is carried along with the fast-moving plot, the humor and the characterization.

I put the book down halfway through and put it in the &quot;book exchange&quot; bag without even caring how she solved everything.

At the time, Casey was a bit of comic relief, a badass girl PI with more moxie than brains.In the Casey Jones books that Munger has written under her own moniker, however, Casey is a much more complex character, with each book revealing more of the anger and the passion that drives her.The cover copy compares Katy Munger to Janet Evanovich and Sue Grafton, but I find Casey Jones more interesting, complex, (and yes, sexy) than Stephanie Plum or Kinsey Milhone could ever hope to be. For depth of characterization, I'd compare this book more to Robert Crais than to Evanovich or Grafton, and you don't get a much higher compliment in my book.Oh, and since I live in North Carolina, I love the settings, although I don't think Katy Munger does full justice to South of the Border.

I can do without sleep when a book is this good!The plot, characters......Heck the entire book was just perfect. I wouldn't change a word. Casey Jones kicks some major butt in this one. :) I was so pleased to get a glimpse into Casey's past life, and I really liked the way she handled it. These books are darned good mysteries, but they are just flat-out great fiction. If you are in the mood for humor in a PERFECT book, buy this book now.

I know some of the other reviews of the previous books in the series compared Casey to Stephanie Plum,but I think the characters are very different, and thecases she works are much more involved. I like the development of the relationships amoung Casey and her friends. Although they have quirks, they come across as caring about Casey. She is a very smart PI (albiet not legal) and I am looking forward to the next books but don't want to read them too quickly.I hope the series continues!"},{"Title":"Bad to the Bone (Casey Jones Mysteries #4)","review":"I don't think the person below who hated the book even read it because her/his comments make no sense. I have no idea what they are talking about. This is in no way an obscene book, at least not by the standards of anyone under 60! I read it cover to cover and was not only never offended, i was very entertained! It is very funny, very tightly-paced and plays fair to the reader -- lots of clues and lots of tension to keep you turning the pages. The mystery component of the story is as good as any I've ever read. And Casey has that heart of gold a true hardboiled protagonist needs -- her sense of justice and moral code is very strong. As for the quality of the writing: Ms. Munger's work is definitely way above the quality of almost all other contemporary mystery authors I have read.But, no, you will not like her work if Miss Marple is your only idea of a strong female protag. Fortunately, most people are a little more open-minded."},{"Title":"Bad to the Bone (Casey Jones Mysteries #4)","review":"I have liked all of Munger's Casey Jones books to date a whole lot, but have sometimes felt as if she could not decide whether to be a hardboiled or mainstream writer. Her books have been walking a fine line, but Bad to the Bone seems much harder and darker than the other books and that puts it solidly in my camp. It is a true PI novel in that Casey figures out pretty early who her main suspect is and there are not a bunch of red herrings or suspects like in an Agatha Christie book. But the villian is great, especially if you have ever known someone like this particular villian which I would guess most people have. You really want Casey to bring this person down and that keeps you turning the pages. Munger is very funny as usual but there are also some scenes that made cry and some that were downright scary. The jail scene had me howling. I also liked the way Munger changed Casey in this book and showed us that she is less than perfect. I recommend this book to anyone who has enjoyed her previous books or to readers who like PI novels with an edge."},{"Title":"Bad to the Bone (Casey Jones Mysteries #4)","review":"Its a good book, part of a series, which I like.

I like my mysteries with a little meat on them and Casey Jones is certainly a meaty character--and all woman, to boot. She's independent and sassy and doesn't listen to people who think she should cross her legs and act like a lady. The only thing I enjoyed more than Bad to the Bone is Better Off Dead. This is an excellent series, and I eagerly await the next installment. Go get 'em, Casey!!!"},{"Title":"Bad to the Bone (Casey Jones Mysteries #4)","review":".... Stephanie Plum's book was a slight disappointment this year, so it's WONDERFUL to make a new discovery (for me) and find Casey Jones!Where Stephanie Plum is still bumbling her way through after how many years on the job?, Casey is a smark cookie (or Krispy Kreme donut) who has the chutzpah to face her troubled past as it intersects her latest manhunt.Ex-husbands, current boyfriends who are riding out funks, and downright no-holds-barred evil murderers who kidnap kids make for just part of the varied cast that Munger paints so well. I love her character descriptions and sense of place (though true enough, South of the Border isn't portrayed nearly as wierdly as it should have been).I'm looking forward to this weekend to read the next book in the series!"},{"Title":"Bad to the Bone (Casey Jones Mysteries #4)","review":"This is, I think, Katy Munger's best book. The plot, for a start, is an absolute corker: when she's used by a client, blonde bitca Tawny Bledsoe, to frame an innocent man for murder, Casey Jones swears revenge. The only problem is, things from the past -- her no-good ex-husband, her sometime lover Bill Butler, and her own trailer-trash upbringing -- keep getting in the way. The writing is superb. There's all the fast-moving action, local colour, wit and sass we've come to expect from Munger, but there's also a greater psychological depth to the novel as Casey tries to come to grips with her own past. If you're a fan of female PIs -- hell, if you're a mystery fan at all -- you are going to love this book. Just don't try reading it in bed -- you'll be up all night because it's quite a pageturner."},{"Title":"Teaching English Through Action","review":"I first discovered this book when Ms. Segal did a workshop for ESL teachers in my state. She demonstrated the techniques using Yiddish, which none of us knew. Several months later we returned for a follow-up seminar. With no practice in the meantime, I was still able to remember the little Yiddish she had taught us.I purchased the English and Spanish versions of the books after the seminar. Over the years I have used the techniques to teach English to non-native speakers and Spanish to non-native speakers. I have taught it on the high school and college levels as well as the continuing education level. I have also used her teaching techniques in foreign countries.The techniques she explains and teaches in her book can be used with people of any culture because they are based on the natural way each of us learns a first language.

In these pages, Haven speaks about the difficult, day-to-day work to awaken from the sleep in which we are all immersed. Practical means both beginning to see things as they are and attempting to act from what one sees. Practical also means distinguishing between the efforts that one is capable of making by oneself and the line beyond which one cannot pass without outside assistance. The Fourth Way is a teaching of spiritual development ... brought to the West in the early part of this century by George Gurdjieff and Peter Ouspensky. ...

For example: There are now five, not &quot;three great kingdoms into which all natural objects have been classified.&quot; (P.209). A supernova is not a &quot;nova that that suddenly explodes into dazzling brilliance.&quot; (p. 218). The alpaca is not a &quot;domesticated llama.&quot; (p. 198).

As with many new Manga series it starts out a little slow as we are introduced to the main characters. In this case we meet Kinzou, a medicine man/pharmacist who is traveling the dangerous Adachi fields with a Samurai named Sawa and another companion, Umenosuke. Sawa is spinning tales of these dark lands when they find themselves attacked by a demonic woman who kills Sawa and Umenosuke and forces Kinzou to carry their remains to a mysterious castle. Kinzou meets the lord of the castle who plans to use Sawa's body and Umenosuke's head to restore his son, Shibito, to life.Shibito is nothing but a walking, rotting mummy and his soul must be put into this new, young body so he can fulfill his father's dream of returning the Saezuki clan to power to rule all of Japan. The father casts the spells of the dark arts and at first it seems as if he has failed but slowly the new pieced together body begins to stir and eventually sits up. Yet Shibito is not yet fully restored. His body moves but he as yet hasn't regained his memories or his mind in general. Kinzou is charged with being Shibito's teacher and guide in the world as he ventures to find his destiny. But not everyone wants Shibito restored to life...Popping up to seemingly aid Kinzou and opposed the Saezuki clan is the mysterious Ranken, a toy maker who makes lifelike and life-size automated constructs. One of his constructs battles Shibito but loses and Ranken disappears through a mysterious portal in the castle. Soon Kinzou finds himself falling through another portal into a strange village where an outlaw Samurai fugitive is on the run from vengeful villagers and ends up taking the daughter of one of the villagers hostage. Kinzou tries to broker a peace and even helps the injured fugitive but now must deal with the villagers who want the man dead.Sword of Shibito action, horror with Kinzou providing some comic relief as he continues to find himself in one bad situation after another through no fault of his own. The first issues sets up a number of questions such as just who is Ranken and why does he oppose Shibito? What will happen when Shibito regains his memories? What part will this village play in the story? There are enough good elements going on here that I want to find out what happens next. The final part where Kinzou falls through the portal into the village does seem to distract from the central plot but we will see where the story goes from here. The Ranken character is very intriguing and I want to see what part he will play in the succeeding chapters as well as the development of Shibito. The art is very strong throughout also at times the battle scenes can be somewhat difficult to follow. A good start to the series.Reviewed by Tim Janson"},{"Title":"The Sword of Shibito, Vol. 1","review":"Length:: 1:03 Mins"},{"Title":"The Sword of Shibito, Vol. 1","review":"It's almost impossible to judge this manga series from just the first volume alone. The artwork by Missile Kakurai is decent, even though I found some of the action scenes hard to follow and confusing. There isn't a whole lot of story in these 200 pages. In fact, the complete first volume feels like merely an introduction to a much larger tale. The stage is set, characters are introduced and then, after an act of resurrection, it's already over.

Simenon was a master of small-scale drama, and this book is no exception. All he gives us is a house, a daughter, mother, father, son and a maid. Of course, it wouldn't be Simenon if both the son and father weren't sleeping with the maid, and everyone else in the house knew it. This, of course, makes for the creepiness. This book is a good 10 on the CreepOmeter. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"November","review":"November was first published as Novembre in 1969 and translated by Jean Stewart. The Le Cloanec family live an isolated life in a gloomy house outside Paris. The daughter of the family, Laure, tells their tale in November, a gloomy story set in a gloomy winter month. Her mother feels neglected, and has taken to drink; her father and younger brother compete for the favors of their Spanish maid Manuela, and slowly leave their isolated regime, each cut off from the other, to quarrel over her. Laure herself despairs over her family, and has involved herself deeply in her work as a medical researcher. She has become the mistress of her chief, though he is married and can offer her no future, feeling the need to sacrifice herself for his good.This intolerable regime goes on, and no family member can help another. Then the maid Manuela, the one bright, cheerful person in the household, disappears. Laure fears her unstable mother has murdered her. The mystery is never solved, but the maid's disappearance does encourage Laure to reassess her mother, and to feel some pity for her. Professor Shimak, her lover, suffers a grievous blow when his wife dies in a car accident, and slowly the balance of Laure's relationship with the Professor changes, into something less self-sacrificing on her part and more fulfilling. This wintry book seems to be saying that in every deadlocked relationship there can be a ray of hope, and that sometimes it takes a crisis for us to see it. This is not Simenon at his best. The evocation of the house and the characters who live there is as authentic as ever, but the insight into these peoples' motivations seems somehow obscured."},{"Title":"Of Arms and Men: A History of War, Weapons, and Aggression","review":"This is one of the best written books I have read.

Unfortunately he doesn't tell us much about Curtis the man or the experiences Curtis had while assembling his body of work on North American Indians. Gidley writes with a lack of respect and lack of appreciation for what Curtis accomplished. There is no information about Curtis's photography or appreciation for Curtis's incredible body of work or the financial and physical challenges Curtis undertook. Gidley is an English Professor from Leeds, England who attempts to portray himself as an expert in anthropology, ethnology, art, photography and the history of North American Indians and their culture. Unfortunately this book fails to impress and instead reads like a boring academic dissertation or master's thesis. If you are looking for a good biography of Curtis or a story about his work this is not the book to read."},{"Title":"Edward S. Curtis and the North American Indian, Incorporated (Cambridge Studies in American Literature and Culture)","review":"For those who have long admired Curtis' classic photos of Native Americans, but who have wondered to know more about Curtis himself, Gidley provides good background. He laboriously traces Curtis' life and habits. The prediliction for outdoors living is a constant theme of the book. Combined with his skills at photography. We see early experiences in studio photography. But Curtis seemed (luckily to history) to find that somewhat confining.His subsequent travels throughout the American West brought his interests and talents into sharp focus. Letting him document what was believed to be a dying way of life. Which was perhaps largely true. Most of the natives in his photographs were no longer the plains nomads of American folklore.This book does not reproduce many of Curtis' photos. Largely because you can find those elsewhere. Gidley concentrates on the details of his life."},{"Title":"Edward S. Curtis and the North American Indian, Incorporated (Cambridge Studies in American Literature and Culture)","review":"This is an excellent series of discussions of the many different aspects of E.S. Curtis and his photographic and ethnographic project on the North American Indian. I would highly recommend it to anyone who is interested in both background history of Curtis and his project, as well as an interesting interpretive perspective on Curtis and his work."},{"Title":"Cooking in San German, Puerto Rico: Puerto Rican Regional Cuisine","review":"This little cookbook is a work of art. As you read the recipes, all taken from San Germ&aacute;n local residents, you begin to get the varied flavors and influences of Puerto Rican foods in general, and local foods western part of the Island in detail. The illustrations are beautifully done, and Mrs. Vivoni's verses are the perfect accompaniment for this work of love. The recipes work, too! They were all tested and quantified. If you don't read Spanish, buy the English version.

It is divided into sections of PA and each section has some hikes for wildlife, scenery and good views from ridges. I'd have liked some 50 mile hikes, though. If you've been hiking in your section for a few years, then I would look elsewhere for information (you've probably been on most of the trails mentioned)."},{"Title":"Hike Pennsylvania (Hike America Series)","review":"This book has been very useful and helpful!! Ive hike some of these trails and the book tells all"},{"Title":"Hike Pennsylvania (Hike America Series)","review":"I've used this book since 2001 & up until this past week loved it. The descriptions, distances, & landmarks were always accurate. Both my wife & I felt this was the best guide we owned. Consequently we took it as gospel. Now I'm wondering, since it's not been updated since 2001, if some of its out of date.My wife & I hiked Trail 33 - Conemaugh Gorge last Thursday. We picked it because of the views described in the write up. But once on the trail we soon found there are no views. All of the overlooks are overgrown. It's like hiking in a green tunnel. We hiked Trail 37 - Mt. Davis Natural Area last Monday. The trail was boring and we couldn't find the last turnoff & ended up hiking back to the car on a road. So things have changed in 8 years. If the guide is updated I'll buy it as soon as it comes out. In the mean time, I'll continue to use it, but with caution.Our qualifications: We've been hiking for over 40 years & consider ourselves very experienced. We can easily hike 12 miles a day, climb 3000 ft in elevation, and do this at or above 11,000 ft elevation."},{"Title":"Hike Pennsylvania (Hike America Series)","review":"This is by far the best book for Pennsylvania. It has topographical maps of every trail from Northern Pennsylvania, Western Pennsylvania, and Southern Pennsylvania.

If you like the outdoors and want scenic views of Pennsylvania then this is the book for you! 170 of the best trails in PA from beginner to advanced. I'm a PA born hiker and I approve this book!"},{"Title":"Hike Pennsylvania (Hike America Series)","review":"Without a doubt, this is the worst trail guide that I have ever used. I have done two of the hikes and I am afraid to try it again. I have found distances to be wrong, landmarks to be wrong and even trail names to be wrong. On the first hike, I was lost for nearly two hours before I was able to locate a cut-off trail at a point other than the supposedly well marked intersection. On the second, my companion and I spent an hour looking for an intersection that was poorly described. Both hikes have also included rather unattractive segments trough parking lots and along logging trails. Last summer I hiked in Poland and found more utility in trail guides written in Polish (which I don't speak) than in this book. There are several very good Pennsylvania trail guides out there; this just isn't one of them!"},{"Title":"See Jane Write: A Girl's Guide to Writing Chick Lit","review":"I ordered this book for my 13 year old daughter.

I was WRONG! The book is written in a playful format, and does not give any real advice on the act of writing itself. All the information that is given to you could have easily been deciphered from reading any of the multitude of chick lit books written out there. Plus there is a lot of information in there that is wrong or useless! For example, NEVER EVER EVER type your manuscript the way they advise you to in this book! If you seriously want to write chick lit, read as much as you can in the genre you like and read books about writing.

If I thought writing chick lit was going to be easy, why did I pick up this book. In the end I mostly skimmed. Same old writing info as other books. There was input from many other authors, but since I read do not read much chick lit hearing from these authors did not exciting to me.

With 180 pages and lots of graphics, there isn't a lot of text. A lot of topics are covered but: a) none that aren't covered in other guides and b) none that aren't covered better in other guides.

The colored ink and pages make it a little over-the-top with feminine decoration, but it doesn't detract from the content.

Normally I love How Not To tips but these are annoyingly self indulgent at times, particularly a whole page devoted to a spoof bad query letter.

It records some of the experiences she had along the way, not only being a ministering angel to the sick sisters, but several profound spiritual experiences she had.This book is a must for anyone into the original documents.

It's that he happens also to be a nearly life-long surfer, and this book is a perfect example of bringing passion to one's practice of geography (and consensual relations; the title is an exquisite double-entendre). There are some wild turns.It's a beautiful book, and one also consumately energetic. The color plates show someone who has lived in Hawai'i through the modern evolutions of surfing. That he did it as a famed scholar is all the more amazing. This is a better book that Kary Mullis's autobiographical tome (*Dancing Naked in the Mind Field*) -- and were I asked, as a betting man, to wager on who's the better surfer, I'd settle on the esteemed Prof. Grigg in the proverbial New York minute. A majorly fine read."},{"Title":"Canada and the Ukrainian Question, 1939-1945: A Study in Statecraft (Mcgill-Queen's Studies in Ethnic History. Series Two)","review":"Although the language is occasionally prolix, this is an important study of the relationship between a major Canadian ethnocultural community, the Ukrainians, and the government, particularly focused on the years just before and during the Second World War. Arguably this was a formative period in the shaping of the modern Ukrainian Canadian community, which today has less to do with the pioneer experience in western Canada and is more a reflection of the nature of interactions between the government and the organized community during periods of internation (and domestic)crisis. Dr Kordan has performed a singular service to the study of Canadian ethnic and immigration history by underscoring not only how one-sided such a relationship is, by its very nature, but how such interactions do have profound and lasting consequences. In this case Ottawa essentially shaped the future of Ukrainian Canadian society by creating the Ukrainian Canadian Committee, endowing it with a structure that ensured compliance but little flexibility, leaving this particular community more or less strait jacketed from the 1940s to the present. Today Canada's Ukrainians still have a Ukrainian Canadian Committee (renamed as a Congress in the late 1980s) but it is hardly representative of most Canadians of Ukrainian heritage, is quite inept in handling relations with Ottawa, the media and other ethnic minorities, and has become an essentially non-playing actor on the national stage, quite a comedown from the 1930s and 1940s, when what happened in Ukrianian Canadian society (as Dr Kordan demonstrates) was followed closely by a whole range of professors, bureaucrats and policemen. Now no one cares, &quot;thanks&quot; to what was done to this community a half century ago. Perhaps that suggests a model for how to deal with more recently arrived immigrant based ethnic communities too?"},{"Title":"The Ethical Psychic Vampire","review":"As an author on psychic vampirism myself, I know the challenges of tackling this complex and contraversial subject matter - especially when writing from a point of view sympathetic to the vampire. Raven Kaldera attacks the topic head-on, daring to delve into territory that many others have shied away from.Kaldera, an author who has established himself as someone who does not flinch away from touchy subjects and cultural taboos, brings his usual clear, sensible, and sometimes blunt style to the table, offering practical wisdom for those individuals who are struggling to come to terms with their psychic vampirism. In a community that is often rife with politics, Kaldera takes no sides, instead presenting the material simply as he has observed and experienced it for himself. He supplements his own research and insights into the vampiric condition with interviews with other psychic vampires -- several of them fairly well-known. An added bonus is that these are vampires who themselves are known to have radically different approaches to the topic, and so the reader gets a full-spectrum view on values, practices, and personal experiences.What I liked best about this work is the fact that Kaldera does not brush under the rug topics like sexuality, blood-drinking, and even parenting. The spiritual and magickal aspects of being a psychic vampire are adequately served, but the practical day-to-day concerns are also given their due.In all, this is a balanced and coherent text, one I will be recommending to my own readers as a must-have for their shelves.(...)"},{"Title":"The Ethical Psychic Vampire","review":"So, perhaps you've noticed a few odd things going on in your life. You get high from being in a crowd of excited people. Sex leaves you feeling energized and your partner feeling sleepy. You seem to need more contact and attention than other people do - a lot more.You may be what is commonly referred to as a psychic vampire - someone who takes in energy from people around them. But you don't have to resign yourself to being evil, or to wondering if you're the only one out there. You're not.This book is a lifesaver. It will help you answer questions like, \\"How do I get what I need ethically? What purpose do vampires serve in the human ecosystem? How can I use this talent to benefit others?\\"Strongly recommended for energy vampires, those who are close to them, and energy workers of all sorts."},{"Title":"The Ethical Psychic Vampire","review":"Previous reviewers who have complained that there is no bibliography or citations should note that the author states repeatedly throughout the book that everything (except the quotes from other people) he writes about is drawn from his own personal experience as a psychic vampire and a shaman. This is not an academic treatise or a theoretical guide; this is a book by someone who has found out through trial and error how to control his own vampiric tendencies, and who gives good, thoughtful advice about how to deal with such tendencies in oneself or one's child, in an ethical and non-abusive way. There is no bibliography of references because the author's primary source was himself and those whom he interviewed.That being said...I am not a psychic vampire myself, but I do deal with energy work quite a bit, and I think anybody who does as well should probably read this book. Even if you yourself are not a vampire, whether you're a magician, witch, shaman or whatever, you're probably going to run into one of these folks at some point, if you haven't already. Most of them probably aren't even aware of what they're doing. Rather than shunning them and screeching about how evil they are, why not show them this book and try to help them understand themselves better? It can't hurt to be accepting and understanding if you're in a position to help someone."},{"Title":"The Ethical Psychic Vampire","review":"I came to Raven Kaldera's book because I have often had to deal with psychic vampires on an adversarial basis in the course of my work. Having had to protect myself, friends and patients against attack, I tended to view vampires rather unsympathetically, and assumed that they had little positive contribution to make to either the pagan/occult community or to society in general.Then I realised that one of my close friends had vampire tendencies. This book was recommended as a way of gaining insight into her condition and I have found it immensely helpful. Raven has tackled the difficult task of not only explaining life from the vampire's point of view, but of developing, basically from scratch, an ethical and moral framework within which the vampire can live and act, with practical advice to the vampire, and their friends and family, on how to operate within that framework while safeguarding their health and wellbeing.This is the first book to tackle this kind of material, so, naturally, it leans heavily on the personal experience of Raven and others, but this emphasis on actual experience is also one of the book's great strengths. Sharing the down to earth details of living as a vampire demystifies the subject and shows just how psychic vampires can fit into the spiritual ecosystem and benefit others. I, personally, found that it removed a good deal of my previous revulsion. I would still confront vampires who act in a predatory and unethical manner, but I now have a much better understanding of what's going on and the processes involved, and I know not to try and automatically slap down anyone I catch showing signs of vampire behaviour if they're not harming anyone by it.All in all, this is one of those books that really did change the way I see the world, and cast much needed illumination on some dark corners."},{"Title":"The Ethical Psychic Vampire","review":"This is the best book available on psychic vampirism from a Vampire's perspective. Kaldera draws on the experiences of other vampires, as well as his own to explain and explore what vampirism is and what some of its causes may be. He makes a distinction between primary and secondary vampirism, explains basic physical and spiritual and health issues, and offers some excellent exercises that can be used by vampiries and donors. What makes this book shine is the detailed explanation of how energy works for vampirism and how such energy work can be used to help other people who aren't vampires.On the other hand, I would've really liked to have seen a bibliography and internal citations in this book. The argument that Shamanism and Vampirism are similar isn't something I'm convinced of just from reading this book. Additionally the notion that secondary vampirism is caused by dysfunctional families is something I'd take with a grain of salt, given how dysfunctional the majority of families seem to be. Drawing on research in both of these cases would strength Kaldera's argument immensely.I highly recommend this book as a primer for understanding what vampirism is and getting a sense of how energy work in vampirism is done."},{"Title":"The Ethical Psychic Vampire","review":"I bought this book a while ago, and even though it's small, it's still one of the very best introductory books on real vampirism. It's emphasis is on psychic vampirism, but it mentions sanguine vampirism as well. The chapters are clear, concise, and well organized. Even for people who don't like to read much, if you have a serious interest in this topic, you can refer back to this book easily as a reference. I especially liked the chapter on raising a vampire child, because this is a subject that doesn't get much discussion in other books or forums, yet is a practical consideration for some parents who either are vampires themselves or have learned that their adolescent or teenage child is one."},{"Title":"The Ethical Psychic Vampire","review":"I was quite pleasantly rewarded with a really, really good explanation of both psychic and sanguine vampires that filled in a lot of the holes in my education, so to speak. Kaldera is an excellent writer, with a very good writing style that doesn't dumb down the text. It was a rather quick read, somewhere around 144 pages, but not a bad one.The first part of the book is dedicated to introducing the concept of vampirism, and why it is that some people simply need to feed. He also marks the differences between \\"primary\\" and \\"secondary\\" vampires, which answers the question of \\"Is a vampire born, or made?\\" with \\"Yes, and here's why\\".He also dedicates a lot of this book to practical issues, such as physical safety and health for feeding, and problems that can arise in a vampire-donor relationship. And, true to the title, the ethics of vampirism are discussed throughout the book, such as why it's better to have a willing donor.This book is rather streamlined--there's really no extra information beyond the basics, and not pages upon pages of vampire legends and lore (Vlad the Impaler, anyone?) so I'd definitely recommend it as a basic guide to today's vampires. He does throw some magical rituals in there for specific purposes, but they're more of an accent to the main body of the text and are purely optional.My biggest complaint is that the book lacks both internal citations and a bibliography. I don't doubt that most of the material is original. However, particularly in regards to the chapter on vampires and shamanism, I'd like to know where he got his information--a lot of it sounds like material from Nigel Jackson's \\"The Compleat Vampyre\\", which is a book dedicated to vampirism, lycanthropy, and shamanism. That's not to say that this isn't necessarily Kaldera's work; I'm just curious as to whether he has read Jackson's text. The nice thing about bibliographies is that you can use them for further reading, and to see what inspired the author.Overall, though, I really enjoyed this book and it's become an important resource for my own writing. Definitely recommended for anyone who wants a good, basic understanding of modern vampirism."},{"Title":"The Ethical Psychic Vampire","review":"Raven's book has been an amazing source of inspiration to me, and as someone who had many questions, this book helped me find the answers :)I will definitely recommend it to those who need answers to those burning questions.cheers!"},{"Title":"MATH OF MONEY","review":"Some results in finance are non-intuitive.

OK, that was cheaper than buying this book.If you want some examples from a number of areas of finance which demonstrate this observation, then this book is for you.If you want to be able to solve any real problems, you'll have to take the next step and actually look inside a textbook for a first course in finance.

The buzz was that it was uncertain whether or not Ian Fleming had authored the thing. It had a decidedly un-Fleming feel but intriquing none the less.Told from the perspective of a confused young woman, fleeing a bad relationship and caught up in a mob scheme to defraud the insurance carrier of a rural, U.S. motel, Bond shows up accidently and saves the day.Like I said it didn't follow the familiar pattern at all but is still one of my favorite Bond books.

Julia: Missing a Piece of Your Mind Can Be Puzzling","review":"\\"I\\" is for Inspired, not impulsive. It's amazing how often people will stick their preconceived notions and labels onto other people. This is a story of a woman who refused to accept other people's labeling and forge her own path to recovery. The book runs the gaumt of emotions. At one moment, you want to reach out and hug Julia as she describes her frustrations and struggles; the next minute you are right alongside of her wanting to strangle a ill-informed, narrowminded doctor. Julia shows that with a strong inner strength, a loving support system and some spiritual guidance,you can reach places where others told you it was impossible to go. This woman also had some pretty whacky friends and family, so you can't help but find yourself laughing at situations that you'd think were beyond the realm of humor. She sounds like someone I'd like to sit down and have dinner with."},{"Title":"P.S.

This book proves that postitive thinking can overcome anything... even when the doctors say no. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"P.S. Julia: Missing a Piece of Your Mind Can Be Puzzling","review":"This was the most inspirational book I have ever read for a few reasons. First and foremost, you always hear about people who triumph in the face of adversity against others, but what about when it is your own body? If you had to win the fight against yourself, how would you fair? Secondly, it reminds you how to prioritize your life, what would you regret not doing today if there was no tomorrow? Lastly, you would think the subject matter of the book would be something that would get you down , but Julia teaches you that with a positive attitude anything is possible. She is someone that you would walk miles out of your way to see and be around, she has this amazing energy about her and it comes through on the pages of her story.

Without a doubt this book is the most inspiring, funny, compelling and insightful book I have ever read. And believe me, I read a lot! I have a new hero now, her name is Julia, and I have a second hero now, his name is Jim. What a wonderful story, what a wonderful woman, what a wonderful family, I cannot say enough about this book, it is a must read for any person who has had a tragedy in their life or for any person who needs to realize that it is the little things in life that we may take for granted, such as cooking dinner, roller blading with your son or taking an outing at the museum. This book is not what you may think, it is not depressing, it is so uplifting, you will be amazed. Julia is obviously an outstanding individual who has made the lemons out of lemonade, and whether you have been through an Incident or know someone who has or if you are an able bodied person, you can relate to her courage and you can only hope that if, God forbid, you are ever in this circumstance, you can carry her aura with you and hope to be only half the person that she is...Thank you Julia for writing this book, Oprah, ya gotta read it!"},{"Title":"P.S.

As I catch a moment here or there to read it, I quickly find myself filled with emotion and thinking about the many ways and the many people who could benefit from reading Julia Fox Garrison's amazing story. It's inspiring, instructive, humorous and moving all at the same time. But it's also an eye-opening and pragmatic description of what women in particular are faced with following a stroke--things that most of us would never consider. The author has captured the nuances and the emotional complexity of her ongoing encounters as a patient with the steady parade of healthcare professionals all so well and in a way with which many readers can relate. I am amazed at how she was able to remember everything in such specific detail. I have not yet made it to the ending, but I am so engrossed that I can't wait to see how it all turns out. With humor and sensitivity I'm sure. This book stands as a testimony to the resilience of the human spirit and the power of humor over adversity, and serves as an instructive tale to those in healthcare policy and practice who work with all patients, whatever their age, sex, condition, or needs."},{"Title":"P.S.

Apparently he is a leading scholarly authority on religion, and he has written many books on New Testament Studies, Indian cultural history, Hinduism, the Christian missionary impact on India, Scandinavian religious life, and general theological issues.The present book, as its subtitle informs us, is a historical survey of &quot;Western Images of the Bhagavad Gita.&quot; As such, it ought to be of interest to anyone who would like to learn about the various influences the Gita has had on the West since it was first translated by Charles Wilkins in 1785.As befits a scholarly publication, 'The Universal Gita' includes a preface, an introduction, footnotes, glossary, bibliography and index. The body of the book falls into two Parts: Part One: 1785-1885, and Part Two: 1885-1985.To give you some idea of the contents, the chapter titles are as follows: Part One: 1 - The First Translation; 2 - Romantics and Transcendentalists; 3 - Missionaries and Mystics; 4 - Theories of Origin; Part Two: 5 - Renaissance, Radicalism and Theosophy; 6 - Gandhi's Gita; 7 - Rudolf Otto, J. W. Hauer, and T. S. Eliot; 8 - The Gita and the Counter-Culture; 9 - Ethical Monotheism and Social Caste.On the surface of it, what we have here is a thorough and scholarly survey, and I won't deny that the book contains a great deal of useful information about the interesting period covered. What we will not find in this book, however, is a sensitive and sympathetic understanding of the nature of the Gita for Professor Sharpe, sad to say, has precious little sympathy for anyone who actually takes the Gita seriously.His intense bias against the Gita, and against those who try to read it in the way it was intended to be read as telling us something very important about life and reality, comes out very clearly in his style. Although he is, in a sense, an excellent writer, one can hardly admire a style which, as does his, makes such heavy use of propagandistic devices such as slanted language, loaded words, false analogies, flippancy, etc.The book is also filled with puzzling statements. We are told, for example, that although the misguided youth of the sixties had some interest in the Gita, no-one today bothers to read it. Really? I wonder why an Amazon search under 'Bhagavad Gita' produces a list of almost two hundred editions and studies of the Gita? Have publishers cured themselves of the nasty habit of not publishing books that aren't being bought and read?The proper use of the Gita is perfectly clear to Professor Sharpe. It exists to serve as a quarry for scholarly researchers who are interested in investigating &quot;the tough historical and textual questions&quot; (page 137) in the hope, presumably, of stumbling across some academic nugget which has been overlooked by others and which, with luck, they may be able to work up into a publishable article, or even another scholarly book. This, for Professor Sharpe, is the only gold to be found in the Gita. Ordinary folks, unless of course they are Hindus, should not be bothering their heads with it.Readers who would like to find an unbiased study of the Gita might care to look at the philosophic treatment in Professor Eliot Deutsch's edition (1968). Another fine study is George Feuerstein's 'Introduction to the Bhagavad Gita - Its Philosophy and Cultural Setting' (1983). Feuerstein is also a published scholar, but one who seems to have a deeper insight into the true nature of both the Gita and at least some of the contemporary academic approaches to it."},{"Title":"The Universal Gita: Western Images of the Bhagavad-gita - Bicentenary Survey","review":"This is an excellent, excellent book, although not one calculated to appeal to enthusiasts of the neo-Hindu revival (in whichever form) - because of course it is a history of the modern reception of one of the books most important to that movement, and so in part a history of that movement. Still, for anyone uncommitted to the Gita as either a prefiguration of computer science/quantum mechanics/other imported notions of supreme scientific legitimacy (\\"ancient Vedic scientists had long known the secrets of flying saucers, etc.,\\" to be a little harsh) or as a scriptural revelation of absolute truth whose historicity is beyond investigation, this book could hardly be improved upon for what it tries to do.How did Westerners respond to the Gita, and why? (Why, for instance, not the Vedas - at least not until Max M&uuml;ller - a question Sharpe takes up with characteristic brilliance.) What did Thoreau and Emerson find it - and even, perhaps, pass back to Indian history through \\"Self-Reliance,\\" \\"Civil Disobedience,\\" and nonviolence? How was the Gita valorized by Indian nationalists in search of a mythos? What language did Sri Aurobindo and Gandhi read it in? (Edwin Arnold's Victorian English translation, as it happens.) Is the Gita a text of pacifism or militant resistance? Could it help a \\"West\\" denuded of spirit rejuvenate itself through poetry? And what of today's Gita - a product of colonialism and anti-colonialism, philological scholarship and the American counterculture, Theosophy and the Indian independence movement?On each of these questions history has grains of salt to offer - and if you don't like their taste, don't read this book - but it is to be hoped that the truly faithful are of open and generous enough spirit to reconcile the mess of history with the clarity of revelation. In any case, scholars and amateurs alike should find this book an excellent and in many cases astounding jaunt through the impossible, unlikely, and fascinating mess that is the history of ideas."},{"Title":"Dissent in Dangerous Times","review":"Mofo on the cover?

Written in 1998, it contains such chestnuts as, \\"We believe that every one of the personal computers in your store should have a CD-ROM drive.\\" and \\"Providing information over the internet is a much better business proposition than selling products over the internet. Even if you could get your home page address to a huge number of potential customers, we do not believe that you should try to sell things to them.\\" Considering I bought ther book online, I must respectfully disagree with the authors.

But, it was really written for large retail companies, not small businesses.The book has chapters on merchandizing, buying, hiring sales people, managing sales force, etc. You will learn a great deal of information about analyzing your customers buying patterns, using formulas to calculate stock-to-sales ration, sales per square foot, gross margin return on inventory etc. You will also learn how to negotiate with suppliers, recruiting top notch sales reps and account managers, retail technology (ie. assett management systems), the in-store experience and analyzing competition.If i owned a chain of retail stores, then this is a book i would want to read! If i owned a large department store, then this would also be the book i would want.But, this book contains mostly useless information for small busienss owners. Its way too detailed for my purposes.

However, the authors explain these concepts in much the same way Ben Stein talks about dry eyes. Colorful retail experiences could be used to make fun examples and make the book more readable and less like a lecture from a finance professor. My only other gripe was that examples from the non-clothing world would have been great, such as selling technology items that lose value as they age on the shelf.

It does not try to cajole or charm you into the business of retailing. The writers do not wear pink glasses or try to &quot;sell&quot; retailing to you. Both writers know too much about retailing today to try these tactics. The book forces the reader through even the most unappealing parts of retailing - inventory control, cash flow and so on. It suggests that the would-be retailer should understand that in order to be a professional retailer, he or she cannot be also a lawyer, store designer, advertising copy writer, retail trainer or technology specialist. &quot;If you cannot afford to use outside professionals, you should proceed with extreme caution,&quot; the authors say. I like the book because it is realistic. It does not talk at the reader and it assumes that the reader knows a great deal about business already.

Michael McGarrity continues to develop his primarary character, the man's man, Kevin Kerney. This is a GREAT READ from the exciting first chapter through the final page.Buy and read this book and you will, if you are not already a fan, be reading the other four of his books.I highly recommend this book, without any reservation. I can't wait for the next one to emerge from this author with the background, experience and knowledge of his subject matter. He tells things as they really are in law enforcement and on the street.I've seen it all, as a lawyer and criminal procecuter, and from my personal view, McGarrity has directness and tells things truthfully and factually as they happen in the &quot;real world&quot; of criminal investigation.Michael, thank you for another great read. Keep up the good work; my wife and I can't wait until your next book is published and we continue to follow the development of your characters. We and our friends that we have passed our books on to have all enjoyed your work.How about incorporating the Good Friday murders on the walk to Chayamo into a future plot?"},{"Title":"The Judas Judge","review":"Michael McGarrity is a strong writer with a marvelous protagonist in Kevin Kerney.Set in New Mexico, the reader can experience the landscapes that Mr. McGarrity paints with a wonderful verbal brush.Kevin Kerney has grown, evolved and developed greatly as a central character as the series has progressed. That is not to say that any in the series is weak. Quite the contrary...it is a powerful series.It is realistic as the procedural part is most logical. It shows the grunt work necessary, the part luck plays and never to believe in coincidences in solving crimes.The plot is always in motion and this action is the focus of the book. The personal life of the primary characters weaves thru the narrative, but never gets in the way of the flow of the whodunit.Mr. McGarrity is high on my &quot;A&quot; list and I recommend this series highly. Start with &quot;Tularosa&quot; and I think you will be hooked.This is one writer I would really like to meet at a reading and signing."},{"Title":"The Judas Judge","review":"I too am an avid McGarrity fan. As I begin to read this latest installment in the series, I felt the familiar rush of interesting plot building that I have come to appreciate in previous Kevin Kerney novels. Yet this novel doesn't invoke the same excitement and surprises that have been the hallmark of McGarrity's writing. Also, what makes Kerney an interesting character is the fact that he is an everyday man, working hard to materialize his dreams. Something a lot of us can relate to. With Kerney's sudden inheritance and marriage, the entire plot begin to read like a grocery store romance dream novel. The sudden and surprising money does nothing to enhance the character and the marriage line is weak, unrealistic and totally unnecessary. Now with the discovery of a son and a baby on the way with his new wife, I hope that McGarrity will soon retire this series and let Kerney and family live &quot;happily ever after&quot; or free Kerney from his current path and bring back the vibrant hero we fans have come to enjoy."},{"Title":"The Judas Judge","review":"The pressure for a fast arrest is phenomenal, but New Mexico State Deputy Police Chief Kevin Kerney understands why. Six murders including a judge in a remote section of the southeast desert is fodder for the media and politicians. In turn, they stir the citizens into a frenzy of fear especially since the killings look like the work of a random lunatic.The brass believes that a maniac aimlessly committed the murders, but Kevin takes a different paradigm. He wonders if the judge was the target and the other five victims a cover. As he digs deeper into the case, an unknown assailant makes attempts to add Kevin to the count.The fifth Kerney mystery is an excellent entry in an already strong regional series. The why done it is powerfully laid out albeit at a more leisurely pace than usual because Kevin's personal life is more involved. He is now married to a military officer, has a woman from his past help him on the case, and is about to become rich from selling some land. This allows readers a more in depth look at the hero which shows how good Michael McGarrity has become in balancing characterization with plot.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"The Judas Judge","review":"McGarrity is one of my favorite authors, but this story is not one of my favorite stories. It is too full of baffling lies and stone-walling by the people being interviewed. That word 'interviewed' is key here. Most of the book is a series of inconclusive interviews of people who seem only marginally connected to the story, and who consistently tell the cops to get stuffed. The web connecting these interviews, the real meat of the story, is Kearney's life. Even that seems fractured and inconclusive. I enjoyed the little bits of Kearney's life that were included, but they were like an appetiser when I wanted a meal. I wish that the story had been written differently. It was a good story line, but too thinly constructed to hold my interest. Kearney's discovery of the existence of a son and the perfidy of the mother of that son should have been explored in more depth, but that, like the other story elements, left me asking &quot;Is that it? Isn't there more?&quot; Not the best in the series, but at least a link in the chain."},{"Title":"The Judas Judge","review":"Michael McGarrity and detective Kevin Kerney return with a vengeance in this superlative addition to this well done series. Kerney is called in when six murders along a single stretch of highway include a well respected judge. Kerney doesn't think it's just a random sweep killer, but the judge was the intended, and the other murders done to confuse authorities. Along with this, Kerney is now a married man, with his wife Sara off doing her thing, and their long distance marriage causing some strain. Add to this, Kerney had to kill a fellow cop who threatened his life and someone out there doesn't like killer cops, no matter what they did. And on a personal note, Kerney finds out he has a son by a previous relationship years ago..this son is also a cop for the Indian Reservation.As always, McGarrity knows how to write his stuff, once again involving other law enforcers in solving the case. While the murderer's identity is not totally surprising, proving it is worth the effort.Excellent writing."},{"Title":"The Judas Judge","review":"I suggest you order all books in the series and get comfortablewith the first book. You are in for a reading treat. Great characters, realistic plots, never boring. I enjoy the interaction between Kevin & his wife, Sara. Both very strong willed people who love each other.

The mountains are in the distance, the ending no surprise, but the changing vistas keep the trip interesting. Relationships and children are the focus of the tale and Kerney continues to grow.

It is a worthy read if you don't have anything else to read, but I felt it was not up to the story line quality and believability as are the others. &quot;Interview all the gun dealers in the state...&quot; sounds kinda suspect to me as did the racists, hostile attitude of the guess what - the unknown son from an high school days (and nights) affair. Interviews a guy to see what cars passed him when he broke down beside the road several years earlier...I think the success of first 3 might have given him excess confidence. I will read his next, but not until it comes out in paper or I can get it at the used book store."},{"Title":"The Judas Judge","review":"This is a Kevin Kerney murder mystery. The book starts off with the investigation of a killing spree, which Kerney immediately assumes is actually a cover-up for a premeditated murder. As Kerney sorts the clues and interviews the subject, he uncovers the disturbing history of a family gone mad.I picked up this book with the intention of reading a light who-dunnit. I was taken aback however, as the theme of the book began to become clear. The book is about perversion, on many levels, involving both individuals and families, from personal life to professional life. While following the lurid details of a family's dirty laundry can maintain interest, it wasn't exactly what I was in the mood for. McGarrity's style is also a bit uneven at times, with jarring switches of points of view from Kerney to other characters, telling not only what they are doing, but what they are thinking and feeling inside their heads. Kerney himself is not always believable as a character, with his instant recognition of the premeditated murder based solely on one victim of the killing spree receiving two shots in the chest instead of one and his exclusive investigation of only this one victim and his family. If you're looking for a light book to keep you awake and pass the time, this one may do, but it's not for everyone's tastes."},{"Title":"The Judas Judge","review":"I stumbled onto McGarrity over the holidays with Hermit's Peak. Loved it and proceeded to read the others in the Kerney series. They were really fast paced and enveloped me in the beautiful geography of New Mexico. Judas Judge was a mystery that drew me in and then failed to include that spark. It was too dark and did not take me on that sightseeing tour of New Mexico."},{"Title":"The Judas Judge","review":"I remember the event very well. It's one of those life experiences you don't tend to forget. I was living on the western slope of Colorado in a small mountain town. It was a winter weekend, the weather was cold and blustery, and I had just finished reading the latest Tony Hillerman novel, for the second time. After a cup of coffee and some quiet contemplation it dawned on me; I was without a good mystery book set in the southwest. What to do? After checking with my HMO and finding they would not pay for admission to the local book detox center and facing a long week-end without a literary fix, I did what any self-respecting reader would do, I went to my favorite on-line bookseller for advice and counseling. Thus, it was with great delight that I was introduced to the mystery novels of Michael McGarrity. I have since read all of his works including Hermit's Peak, Serpent Gate, Mexican Hat, and the highly acclaimed Tularosa. You can imagine my excitment upon receiving his latest offering, The Judas Judge. While McGarrity may not yet be on the par with Hillerman, he is surely getting there. Few write as convincingly and accurately using the southwest as as setting as does McGarrity. The Judas Judge brings back our old friend and protagonist Kevin Kerney, Deputy State Police Chief for the New Mexico State Police, and a host of characters. The setting is New Mexico and the beautiful country of the American Southwest. It's all here for the committed mystery fan and those sho just like a good read. Keerney is called on to investigate a multiple murder spree, which culminates in the death of a former judge. Along the way he encounters a complex web of deceit. lies, and some characters right out of, well, Hillerman country. Oh, did I mention the death of a rogue cop, police corruption, and Kerney becoming an instantaneous father and grandfather? The plot is fast paced, the characters are believable, and his description of everyday, routine police work, warts and all, is on target. McGarrity weaves his understanding of Native American culture(in this instance the Mescalero Apache's) with his superb knowledge of the landscape and people of the American Southwest that results in a scene that adds flesh to the bones of the New Mexico landscape. Finally, the question in any good mystery book, Who done it? Well, it may be the judge's daughter and/or son; it could be his former mistress, or maybe the present one. On the other hand it may be someone connected with the rogue cop or the person that killed the judge's wife with a letter bomb six years earlier. However, one must not rule out the hit-and-run driver that killed the judge's son on a lonely stretch of New Mexico highway. It's funny how money, sexual indiscretions, revenge, family secrets, deceit, and other possible motives can lead to a wide assortment of suspects. Ah, that's why we have Kevin Kerney. McGarrity writes with clarity and knowledge of the landscape, both physically and culturally. He is a former law enforcement officer and has worked both sides of the street, both as a Deputy Sheriff and as an Investigator for the New Mexico Public Defender's Office. He knows the territory and it shows. Who Done It? You be the Judge."},{"Title":"The Judas Judge","review":"I've enjoyed the prior books in the series, but this one lacks the charm of his prior novels. The &quot;action&quot; is less believable, the pace moves slower, and the characters are less likable. As usual, McGarrity's female characters are very shallow. Because so many of this book's lead characters are female, that fault is especially problematic in The Judas Judge.The Kevin Kearney series is showing signs of decline. I don't plan to continue reading any more of them."},{"Title":"The Judas Judge","review":"Reading along the back trail, I find McGarrity's novels entertaining and worth the effort, but I have become convinced that his newer efforts are great improvements. Yes I would tell myself to read The Judas Judge, but.....Perhaps the framework of familial dirty laundry on the part of the title character also takes some of the spice out of this novel. I don't really want to complain too much, but I also find the bad guys pathetic rather than evil. A reader can only take so many psycho-wimps, wreaking havoc because of their thwarted childhood development. Guess I liked Othello because I just like watch Iago types. Sometimes(especially in novels) out and out evil has a role."},{"Title":"The Judas Judge","review":"and &quot;The Judas Judge&quot; is a fast and entertaining read, although not as strong as the prior 4 books in the Kerney series.Here, the minor faults do not lie with Kerney himself, whose life takes some interesting twists and turns while he continues to pursue his cases with the single-mindedness and coping strategies for the tedium and the detail that are necessary to most murder investigations. New Mexico itself also plays a strong role in the novel, and McGarrity's view and visuals of the southwest continue to provide a successful backdrop.No, here the story breaks down with the eventual discovery of the reasons for the terrible crime, and how they center upon a depraved judge, of whom little evil is known until his death. Generally, those as unsympathetic as Judge Vernon Langsford are known to their surroundings as evil, long before their death. In the book, it takes Kerney quite some time to unearth his secrets, even though it is obvious from the beginning that there are a lot of things that are &quot;not quite right&quot; about his lifestyle.Still, the book moves at a rapid pace and has an interesting new insight into Kerney, when an unknown family is revealed to him. His reactions and conduct make him continue to be a favorite hero in suspense and mystery novels.Worth the read!"},{"Title":"The Judas Judge","review":"Kevin Kerney is such a believable character and you follow him through the process of discovery in each of his adventurers."},{"Title":"The Judas Judge","review":"ExcellentThis review requires that I write ten more words. Word, word, word, word, word, word, word, word, word, word."},{"Title":"The Judas Judge","review":"I love this guy! I compare him with J.A.Jance - she writes about Southern Arizona where I live, and he writes about New Mexico in the same style...you recognize the areas they speak of, and can picture them perfectly!

(and J.A.Jance's!)"},{"Title":"The Judas Judge","review":"A bit slow, and not the best plot, but if you like Kevin Kerney novels, this one is a good read."},{"Title":"The Judas Judge","review":"I am a fairly new and die-hard fan of this series! I expect to love every book in the series and so far I have! This one was especially twisted and intelligent! All McGarrity's plots make sense and the motives for the crimes are right on!"},{"Title":"The Judas Judge","review":"As usual this book was engaging. I enjoy this author a lot. Am keen on books that take place in the southwest."},{"Title":"The Judas Judge","review":"I had never heard of this author until I picked this up at a used book store. This was a well written book with good character development that definitely kept me interested until the end. I've read some of the other reviews that sday this is not up to the author's previous works. Because of this I will definitely be going back and reading the other books in this series and start reading them in order."},{"Title":"The Judas Judge","review":"Another good & thought provoking murder mystery! My 2nd book from McGarrity & looking forward to Mexican Hat! Going to try & read the rest of the series in order."},{"Title":"The Judas Judge","review":"Kerney's personal story progresses in JudasJudge, but the surrounding story and investigation not as gripping as I have come to expect in this series."},{"Title":"The Judas Judge","review":"The Author incorporates more detailed investigation techniques than other novels of this kind with twists and turns weaving Santa Fe history and local color into the personal story of Kevin Kerney. It makes you feel you are right behind him every step of the way. McGarrity fleshes out his character to the degree you feel Kevin is an aquaintence of your own. When his bum knee, aches so does yours."},{"Title":"The Judas Judge","review":"Having read through most everything written by John Sandford, I'm trying to find some other authors of the genre to enjoy. This book is ok, but not that hard to predict if you just follow the evidence the author lays out. Not much in terms of twists and turns. Much like Michael Connolly, I feel like McGarrity is trying to impress me with his knowledge of police procedure which kind of gets in the way. The one aspect I really miss from Sandford's work that other's just don't seem to do...he was a master at flashing over and telling parts of the story from the villain's perspective without giving away who it is. Judas Judge lacks depth in the characters and the plot. It isn't bad, but it won't blow you away."},{"Title":"The Judas Judge","review":"Michael McGarrity lives and works where the novel takes place. I followed the story's locals with Microsoft's \\"Streets & Trips\\" and can attest that even the smallest village is a real place. McGarrity's story may be fictional and his characters well constructed and believable. But, his geography and local history is non-fictional. Such details lend credence and strength to a plot that commands one's attention. It's a good read and I've just received delivery of two more McGarrity novels; \\"Tularosa\\" and \\"Mexican Hat\\". I anticipate being well entertained."},{"Title":"The Judas Judge","review":"This is the best of the KK books. I won't say too much about the plot since you can read that above. Suffice to say that KK investigates a serial killer and gets more than he bargained for.Spoilers ahead.My comments:1) Reading the KK books in chronological order is a MUST. Otherwise you'll get confused with his relationships with various people, his status as a policeman and the sideplots.2) This is the best of the KK books because we don't get to see from the killer's point of view so there is some suspense. Bravo, McGarrity should continue with it. Mystery writing 101: Don't reveal too much!3) The end ends quickly as with all McGarrity books, but it doesn't feel rushed, and everything wraps up nicely, unlike some of his other books.4) I don't particularly like the subplots, or sideplots as I call them as some of them have absolutely nothing to do with the story.5) The romantic parts are all amateurly written and cliched. Case in point is at one part where Sara says she made dinner and dessert, and after dinner where KK asks where the dessert is Sara gives him that look and starts undressing. That's terrible writing and totally unrealistic. I have to ask if McGarrity really thinks this happens in real life. For a couple who's been apart, who has dinner first? Business comes first, especially if they have an empty motel room. And after dinner, nothing trumps a post prandial nap, and then maybe business. (OK, maybe you're not a pig like me who eats so much, but didn't your mother ever warn you not to exercise after a meal?)6) There are some other minor logical lapses, but that's OK, McGarrity isn't one of those really technical writers and I won't allow those from preventing me to enjoy the book. eg. McGarrity never explains how Linda is able to construct a letter bomb. It's not something you can easily make. And letter bombs are not big enough to kill. He should have said parcel bomb.The pros (or why I keep reading McGarrity's books)1) His books are always easy to read and well written. A good book is always one which keeps me up past my bedtime and his books do, most of them.2) Despite what some other people say, I think he does a good job of injecting life into his characters. Unlike some poor writers, he doesn't simply describe his characters, he puts them into situations where they interact, and from their reactions or speech, you get a feel for what the characters are like. For example, this is from Everyone Dies, page 50, where Thorpe questions the delivery man. This is just a simple 2.5 page section where a witness is questioned, but it is so well written that the witness's personality comes across and you feel the same as Thorpe does. It could have been a boring 30 lines where you just read what information Thorpe gets, but you don't, you also feel it. I think it's just a talent, some writers have it some don't.The cons:1) I suppose the big cons are Sara. There are quite a few minor recurring characters in KK's life and most of them are OK because they are connected with the plot somehow. But Sara really isn't. I'm not really interested in her job in the military and the problems she has there. Her sideplots just take away from the story for me.McGarrity has his quirks, and like an old friend, I don't mind his quirks."},{"Title":"The Judas Judge","review":"master storyteller michael mcgarrity pulled off again with this crazy and sad story about a terrible family tragedy. i love to see that kerney finally married the lovely sara and also became a grandfather out of the blue. this kevin kerney series has become better and better. i've so far finished 5 of it and still not getting tired of, that's a rare treat. keep it coming, sir, love it."},{"Title":"The Judas Judge","review":"Chief Kerney--an honorable, determined, empathetic New Mexican rancher-trooper--is here up against one of the craziest passels of suspects imaginable, in a return to his natal area of the debut novel, Tularosa. The spree crimes are initially rural and simple, but the detection of the connections is not. Rather than lots of action, ex-cop author McGarrity focuses here on dogged police interviews, a skill rarely presented &quot;on-stage&quot; in thrillers. We see a new hard-nosed Kerney who persistently intimidates female witnesses--key to solving the crimes but somewhat unexplained. Conversely, Kerney's unusually well-developed personal history continues to grow, with surprising new family strains for this sensitive guy. The author spins compelling storiees with great pacing and always an enveloping sense of empty desert places and transient people. Kerney seems real, he has a life apart from his cases; I hope he doesn't retire!"},{"Title":"The Judas Judge","review":"If it's a mystery, I'm prepared to enjoy my time reading it.My dad enjoyed another book by this same author and encouraged me to start reading Michael McGarrity's books. He said that if I tried one, I'd be sure to read more. He was right.Kevin Kerney is feeling the pressure to solve this killing spree and arrest a murderer. Written in a very realistic manner, Mr. McGarrity writes about the politics governing a search for a killer. The New Mexico he describes is very much like the state I live in.My only thought is that sometimes his books get depressing. I found this one depressing at times as well- abusive fathers, affairs and frustrating long distance relationships all add to the occasional darkness of this story. However, it is all written with a very true to life feel and handled with tact.I have read other books written by Michael McGarrity and plan on reading more of his books."},{"Title":"The Judas Judge","review":"This book is a fine example of McGarrity's style. He is direct, descriptive, and the pace of the action accelerates to a great ending. In this book, he adds some richness to the emotional life of his main character, Kevin Kerney, with family ties he discovers, and more inner emotional life. The main story has many characters, like a Dickens novel, that give you a slice of life on the seedy side in New Mexico. There are multiple suspects, lots of false clues, and lies by the suspects that must be unravelled by Kerney. He does a fine job of wrapping it up to a stunning conclusion. It is also fun to follow the action on a map of New Mexico that shows the mountains and topography."},{"Title":"The Judas Judge","review":"As a fan of southwestern mysteries, I can honestly say they don't get better than this. Kevin Kerney's character continues to develop with the addition of a wife and the emergence of a character out of his past who has kept a secret from him for many years. He has to deal with his shooting of a police officer, his impending retirement and finding the identity of a spree killer. Throughout the complicated twists of plot we always get a great sense of place. I especially enjoyed this one because it took us back to the Tularosa Basin and Alamogorde where I grew up. The landmarks and cities were all familiar and it was like going &quot;home&quot;. I have been a fan of the series since his first book, Tularosa, and I am already anxiously awaiting the next one. In fact, I may reread the entire series before a planned trip to that area next fall!"},{"Title":"The Power Of Clinical And Financial Metrics: Achieving Success In Your Hospital (American College of Helathcare Executives Management Series)","review":"You could read numerous books on Lean, Six Sigma, the Toyota Production System and Balanced Scorecards and still not learn as much about driving accountability and leading change in a healthcare setting as you will by reading this one book and sharing it with your project sponsors.The Author is a seasoned healthcare executive, a teacher and a consulting executive and thus is very effective in transferring the right level of detail and knowledge to the reader in a concise and credible format. Throughout the book the Author stays focused on presenting key metrics around the objective, as stated by the title, of \\"Achieving Success in Your Hospital\\".In my role as a consultant who is retained by healthcare organizations to optimize digital technology using lean six sigma techniques, I often give this book to executives and project sponsors to review prior to project kickoff. The book has proven to be very effective in grounding clients in the value of aligning project objectives around defined outcomes to create a culture of accountability to drive safety, efficiency and effectiveness. These objectives are synonymous with what the Author defines in the first chapter of the book as the \\"Basic Tenets of the Information Driven Hospital\\". It should be noted the author teaches a course on this topic for the American College of Healthcare Executives which I have recommended to clients as well. All feedback on this course, much of which is covered in the book, has been very positive.The Author presents numerous case studies with meaningful data in scorecard format to underscore the value of the techniques defined in the text and winds up with a chapter and case studies on \\"Pay for Performance\\" which is emerging as a serious challenge for many healthcare executives.In summary, this is a valuable, timely, executive level text which has served as a catalyst for change for many of my clients and their project teams."},{"Title":"The Power Of Clinical And Financial Metrics: Achieving Success In Your Hospital (American College of Helathcare Executives Management Series)","review":"A good read if you are interested in healthcare infomatics. I bought this book because I needed a good concise primer on metrics for a masters course that I was taking.

Quite an interesting read, very enjoyable. The story is almost so implausible you have to believe it. What a completely believable family situation, and great writing to boot. I'd never heard of Liz Jensen before, but... I'd say she is one to watch. I'll be looking forward to another novel."},{"Title":"Egg Dancing","review":"This book was really entertaining. It addresses a major issue, i.e., is it really ethical to try to create a &quot;perfect baby&quot;? but does it in a way that is quirky and funny, not preachy.

The writing style and cohesiveness of the plot left a lot to be desired."},{"Title":"The long way home","review":"This is the story of a German boy's odyssey--three years and halfway around the world--in search of freedom and a family. In May of 1953 young Christoph has just turned 13. His father was killed in action during the war, his mother died while refugeeing from the advance of the enemy, and he is severely psychologically scarred by having survived the firebombing of Dresden as a toddler--the mere mention of fire gives him convulsions. Since 1945 he has been raised by his mother's old schoolteacher in her isolated cottage on the side of a mountain in Thuringia. This region is part of the Russian Zone, but Chris has been raised as a Christian and a lover of freedom--which causes him to get peripherally involved in a planned student uprising. To protect him, his \\"Aunt\\" decides to send him to America, where he can join Larry, the GI who helped save his life when he was five and promised that one day Chris would live with him as his son. Slipping over the border at peril of his life, he makes his way first to New York City, then to Chicago where he is reunited with Larry and learns of the family difficulties that are delaying his entry into the man's international family (French war bride, Sicilian adopted daughter, Korean adopted son, and infant natural son), and at last to Larry's aunt's pony ranch in a beautiful canyon near Santa Barbara, CA, where Larry and his family plan to move. The beauty and isolation of the place suit him perfectly, but Larry's wife Denise is still discontented and returns to France with her baby for a visit. Not until she has been able to compare her native land honestly with her adopted one can she realize how truly happy she is there. Meanwhile, Chris must conquer his abiding terror of fire when a brush blaze threatens the ranch and its livestock. Chris is a clear-eyed, hard-working young man whose life has forced him to an early maturity, yet his reactions to America--the good and the bad of it--are both fascinating and telling. Benary-Isbert also ties the book to her Lechow Family trilogy by introducing Matthias and Andrea Lechow, who are aboard the ship that takes Chris to America. And her descriptions of the ranch especially border on the lyrical. This is another splendid YA that adults can love too (I just reread my copy)."},{"Title":"CHILDREN OF THE WIND (Seven Citadels Part 2)","review":"I just couldn't wait to get a hold of book two!

Understanding these roles is an important part of interpreting scripture. Biblical scholars Victor Matthews and Don Benjamin attempt to so in their book THE SOCIAL WORLD OF ANCIENT ISRAEL. The book begins with an overview of an Israelite village. The book is then divided into eighteen chapters, each which discusses a different person in the society of the ancient Israelites. The book includes the obvious people such as parents. Monarch, prophet, and religious leaders, but also includes interesting tidbits about slaves, storytellers, widows, and virgins. The book covers a specific period of time, from the Patriarchs until the Babylonian Exile. It is comprehensive enough for scholarly work, but is accessible enough for people involved in preaching or advanced scripture study."},{"Title":"The Social World of Ancient Israel: 1250-587 BCE","review":"While I could write a review on the book, I really only have a question.

I still have my original copy, but am thinking of updating my library if this is an actual revision.My review? This book (1993 version, of course) was required reading for a basic Old Testamnent course I had several years ago at seminary.

These pages are remarkably well-done, but like much of this novel, it's hard to find much on Ravelstein in these pages. Mr. Bellow somewhere in effect admits that his medical problems may be a bit of a departure from the main story line. Fair enough. Unfortunately, the story is a rambling set of recollections; it is difficult to discard anything, and just about everything is fair game in this novel that manages, despite its inclusiveness, to give short shirft to its central character, Ravelstein. When we do meet him, we find precious little exceptional. His materialism is right out of the GQ &quot;central casting&quot; department. We're assured he studied the classics, but when is beyond me, given his propensity to shop. If you want to know about Professor Bloom, you would do much better going directly to the source, particularly his translation of Plato's Republic. You won't learn much about Bloom's apparent weakness for tailored, crisply laundered (wrapped, not on hangers, Bellow assures us) shirts, but you'll get much closer than Ravelstein can bring you to understanding his exceptional mind."},{"Title":"Encyclopedia of Monsters","review":"This book is a wonderfully engaging survey of legendary monsters and modern cryptozoolgy specimens, written in a factual but entertaining style.

Cada uno de ellos es perfecto en su rol y completamente definido, no hay que hacer ning&uacute;n esfuerzo por imaginarlos, casi que bailan ante nuestros ojos.Son muy pocos autores quienes tienen la capacidad para formar una trama donde el trasfondo hist&oacute;rico, el misterio, la pol&iacute;tica las descripciones arquitect&oacute;nicas, el romance, la poes&iacute;a, el humor y hasta la acci&oacute;n se mezclan impecablemente de manera tal que esta obra podr&iacute;a ser catalogada en cualquiera de estos temas sin problema.

Es f&aacute;cil llegar a conocerlos, se hacen de carne y hueso, y en consecuencia el lector desarrolla una empat&iacute;a con ellos, incluso con los malos de la historia. Esta novela, adem&aacute;s, tiene la ventaja de poseer un personaje central que se hace inmediatamente de querer.

Again, another masterpiece. From his seedy characters of the &quot;Seville underworld&quot; each with their own truckful of baggage, and their interestingly tight relationships; to the Seville elite, also each with a skeleton in their closet; to the complicated hierarchy and in-fighting of the catholic church. Only Perez-Reverte is able to bring these three totally different types of people together in one novel and make it believable and a pleasure to read. The reader is glued to the book after reading the opening chapter in which a hacker has broken into the Pope's personal computer, which sets in motion the investigation of small insignificant church in Seville and the identity of the hacker.

After reading the other review on Amazon I am anxious to read it."},{"Title":"Hemingway: A Biography","review":"Carlos Baker is generally known as the founding father of Hemingway biographical studies. His 1969 biography, &quot;Ernest Hemingway: A Life Story&quot; is the so-called &quot;authorized&quot; Hemingway bio and it was the first book of its kind to explore the author's life. All subsequent biographers owe a great deal to Baker and the seven years he spent producing &quot;Ernest Hemingway: A Life Story.&quot;Calling Baker's bio the definitive bio of Ernest Hemingway is difficult though for several reasons. First of all, being published in 1969, the book is now outdated to a great degree. Second of all, a slew of other biographies have been published since 1969 and some are very formidable. Baker's book, in my humble opinion, is probably the most tediously researched biography of Hemingway. His &quot;Notes&quot; section is just over 100 pages.If I had to recommend one standard Hemingway biography, I would likely choose &quot;Hemingway: A Biography&quot; by Jeffrey Meyers. I have read many Hemingway biographies and in comparing them, the work of Meyers does stand out. He offers details not present in other bios and provides fine commentary on EH's literature. Meyers gets as close to definitive as I think one can come in a single book."},{"Title":"Hemingway: A Biography","review":"Jeffrey Meyers' eponymous biography of Ernest Hemingway is, as some have made it, a saltier companion to Carlos Baker's masterful 1969 definitive authorized biography. Meyers is not overly adoring of his subject and gives us a different view of Hemingway. Still, although Meyers is grittier than Baker and manages to dig deeper into Hemingway's complex and contradictory personality, he is not gritty enough nor does he dig deep enough to displace Baker as the biographer nonpareil.And neither does he capture the reader's imagination. HEMINGWAY: A BIOGRAPHY presents Ernest Hemingway in surprisingly muted tones, especially considering the almost cartoonish excesses to which Hemingway could drive himself. This is a very competent and workmanlike biography. However, its pacing and voice are didactic and dry and its portrait of the artist lacks color. Like twenty other books about the man, HEMINGWAY: A BIOGRAPHY belongs on the shelf as part of a well-rounded collection, but can replace none of them."},{"Title":"Hemingway: A Biography","review":"The Mexican beer, Dos Equis, has reportedly experienced over 20% growth since launching their hilarious marketing campaign featuring a mature, bearded man who \\"is often questioned by police just because they find him interesting\\" and who's \\"blood smells like cologne.\\"The inspiration for this contemporary advertising marvel is clearly Ernest Hemingway (who incidentally later in his life endorsed Ballatine Beer in the US). And Jeffrey Meyers' marvelous biography of the writer generally confirms that heroic, manly caricature; a hulking, hirsute stud who perspired pure testosterone while running with the bulls, boxing with local toughs, reeling in half-ton marlins in the Gulf stream, hunting lions and elephants in Africa, fighting the fascists in Spain and France/Germany, and bedding an endless string of beautiful women, who were dangerously mature when he was a young man and dangerously young when he was in his twilight years. (Here is a Hemingway quote, which may be my very favorite: \\"I [fornicated with] every woman I wanted to [fornicate with] and many I didn't, and would like think I [fornicated them] well.\\") He is, for sure, a model of envy and emulation for any red blooded but morally ambiguous young man.There was so much about this book that I loved. Here are three simple endorsements.First, Meyers' presents a complete and unadorned portrait of the master. In no way is Hemingway idolatrized, nor is he necessarily vilified. He was larger-than-life, largely because that is the life image he created for himself. He could be fun and self-effacing, the boisterous but interesting man toward whom the floor seemed to tilt during a cocktail party. But more often than not, especially with family, he could be a boorish, drunken liar, far from the congenial womanizer portrayed in the idealized Dos Equis commercials.Second, Meyers does an admirable job of explaining how Hemingway's personal life influenced his fiction. Every character model from his novels and short stories is completely and convincingly explained. Indeed, I would say that this biography is required reading for a deeper, richer appreciation of all of Hemingway's writing.Finally, Meyer writes with a certain clarity and simplicity that evokes the subject's influence on American literature. This biography is a real joy to read and easy to digest, just like so many of Hemingway's greatest works. It is recommended without hesitation to anyone."},{"Title":"Hemingway: A Biography","review":"Now being well into my fifties, being in good health, and financially sound I have had the opportunity to study my favorite author.

I did not exactly get what I wanted from Myer's book. I learned A LOT about him instead. This book is rich in detail and critical analysis of both Hemingway's life and his work.It is NOT some adoring cartoonish portrait. It is Hemingway stripped raw, and you will feel like you knew him. Whether you like what you see is another thing. He had a fascinating and complex life, but he was full of character flaws and his life was full of sadness and broken relationships. Myers does a very good job of portraying both the greatness and the sadness of his life in equal measure.My only criticism is Myer's style. He plunges right into each paragraph and section without a warmup to let you know what the topic will be, and I think the book could have been better organized. It groups events based on certain time periods or influences rather than going straight through in chronological fashion. That leads to confusion at points. Sometimes he refers to a person by their first name when they haven't been mentioned for 25 pages and you have to think about who the heck he is talking about. And he talks about other authors of the time period as if we know their writings already. I would also have loved more pictures so we can see the people being discussed, but in the age of the internet you can find them on your own.Despite the length, and despite the fact it is was way more than I wanted, I could not stop reading it. I do not think the average reader will be disappointed to get as much detail as you get. You need it to get the real picture of a very complex person. I dogeared about 20-30 of the pages I will want to reread many times, or be able to refer to later.

Sato could have solved the problem advertised by Mirowski, but merely worked all around it without seeing it. Discusses the question whether it is legitimate to assume 'price as gradient of utility' from the standpoint of Frobenius' theorem (hitting a nut with a sledgehammer), but fails to apply similar horsepower to the Hamilton-Jacobi equation (discussed in the last pages). Therefore misses the main point: in optimization problems (Hamiltonian dynamics), price as a function of demand or supply ('price equals gradient of utility'), and utility itself, do not exist unless the Hamiltonian dynamical system is Liouville integrable (see my paper &quot;The Futility of Utility&quot;)."},{"Title":"Revisionist Viewpoints: Essays in a Dissident Historical Tradition","review":"This book is a collection of essays from Dr. Martin, the bulk of which were published in the 1960s in a small libertarian paper, Rampart Journal. The writing style may be a bit dense for some people, and Martin's cutting sarcasm regarding conventional history will certainly offend others, but this book is still worth a read. Several of the essays, such as his summary of the &quot;Peace Now&quot; movement of 1943 deal with little known topics that simply have not been explored by mainstream historians. His two best essays: one on the Cold War, and the other a summary of the work of Harry E. Barnes, however, are worth the price of the book. Martin's discussion of sociologist, historian and journalist Barnes provides a good summary of the latter's career, and his interest in using history to promote international peace. The essay on the Cold War, however, has strongly influenced my interpretation of history and foreign policy. Martin argues that the Cold War was, in the final analysis, an Orwellian conflict, used primarily for controlling domestic populations, and was never an actual conflict between nations, the rulers of which, Martin argues, had more in common with each other than their differing ideologies suggest. The war he suggests, was primarily fought as an element of domestic policy. In this he anticipated some of the later new left critics of the Cold War. Now that the Cold War is over, I can't help but wonder if the &quot;War on drugs&quot; and our new &quot;War on Terrorism&quot; might not fit under the same rubric. In any event, reading Martin is a challenge and delight, and is highly recommended for those with open minds. People easily offended should avoid his books."},{"Title":"Revisionist Viewpoints: Essays in a Dissident Historical Tradition","review":"James J. Martin's REVISIONIST VIEWPOINTS is \\"must reading\\" for those who have been deluged with canned historical accounts and conventional studies by those who should know better. The \\"Court Historians\\" have been either too timid or too politically connencted to write an honest assessments of events since World War I and especially World War II. This book should make an honest reader think.The essay titled \\"On the 'Defense' Origins of the New Imperialism\\" gives a clear account of the U.S. policy since the end of World War II. Political adventures in extending U.S. control have been defined as \\"National Defense.\\" If there are no actual enemies, U.S. policy makers invent them to justify huge defense budgets government contracts to the politically connected plutocratic rich.The essay on conscription or the military draft has been connected to this defense spending. In spite of the Thirteenth Amendment, which forbade slavery and involuntary servitude, conscription has been used as part of this scam. Martin also uses the public record including military reports to verify that military conscription has not produced type of military hero that is presented in media entertainment.James J. Martin's assessment of Fascism is the best this writer has ever read. All the fake attributes to Fascism as a politically disapproval word is undermined in this. Martin deals with the economic policies of the \\"wicked fascists\\" and concludes that these policiies were similiar to those of the New Deal. In fact, there is an essay dealing with John Maynard Keynes' GENERAL THEORY which was translated into German. Keynes is clear that his economic theories were more easily applied to a totalitarian system rather than to a system of laissez-faire capitalism. Martin also cites historians and political writers who have tried to come to grips with Fascism without the \\"Fascims is bad\\" analysis. For example, Martin cites John T. Flynn's AS WE GO MARCHING and Ernst Nolte's THE THREE FACES OF FASCISM.The interested reader should read the essays titled THE BOMBING AND NEGOTIATED PEACE-1944 and \\"THE RETURN TO THE 'WAR CRIMES'-'WAR CRIMINALS' ISSUE in tandom. Martin memorializes the members of the Peace Now who tried in vain to get a negotiated peace in 1944. Their efforts obviously failed, but had their suggestions been followed by U.S. policy makers, the emergence of Big Communism and the Cold War would have been mitigated or eliminated. Martin mentions that war criminals are those on the losing side in a war. The charges levelled against the Germans and Japanses military and civilian leaders could have been levelled against the \\"Allies.\\" By the way Hannah Arendt makes the same case in her book EICHMANN IN JERUSALEM. What may surprise readers is that Martin cites the very liberal Supreme Court Justice William O. Douglas who was clear that the trials were unlawful and arose under ex post facto law which the U.S. Constitution clearly forbids.Martin's essay titled \\"American Mass Media and Stalinism\\" should be read with \\"The Defense Origins of the New Imperialism mentioned above. Martin demonstrates that many of the Cold Warriors were sychophants who lauded \\"Good Ole Uncle Joe\\" (Joseph Stalin)during the 1940s only to look likes fools when their \\"gallant ally\\" actually kept the spoils of war which has been the nature of the winners of wars for 6,000 years. Martin uses the public record to demonstrate that the patriotic loud mouthed Cold Warriors actually supported Stalin's Big Communism. These revelations should make anyone question the rationality and supposed staunch anti-Communism that emerged since World War II.Two of the later essays in this book are instructive. Martin's essay titled \\"REVISIONISM AND THE COLD WAR,1946-1966\\" shows that a correction of previous historical errors and propaganda have been difficult to overcome. This is a good essay in that any thinking individual could easily see how phony the Cold War was. Yet, those who incited Cold War hysteria refused to acknowledge anything about World War II which created the Cold War and planetary enemies.The last essay in this book is titled \\"HISTORY AND SOCIAL INTELLIGENCE\\" which is instructive on how popular \\"history\\" has undermined honest history and in turn honest political and historical response. Martin scoffs at the notion that history and education has become part of the entertainment business.REVISIONIST VIEWPOINTS is well written. Martin is in elite company in the readabiltiy of his work. He does not cite arcane and obscure sources in his work, and his citations are from the public record if one wants to confirm the veracity of his conclusions. This book should be followed by Martin's book titled THE SAGA OF HOG ISLAND AND OTHER ESSAYS IN INCONVIENT HISTORY. Martin was never challenged with the work in these books. The answer to this fact is that his work is unanswerable."},{"Title":"Revisionist Viewpoints: Essays in a Dissident Historical Tradition","review":"The dean of living revisionist historians is at his brilliant, provocative best in these essays on \\"war crimes,\\" Allied terror bombing, Fascism, the draft, the American mass media's wartime love affair with Stalin, America's postwar \\"defense\\" imperialism, and more! Indispensable for the revisionist scholar, excellent for the thoughtful young student."},{"Title":"Revisionist Viewpoints: Essays in a Dissident Historical Tradition","review":"In an article published just after James J Martin's death in 2004, his interviewer Jeff Riggenbach made the following comment. \\"He didn't regard himself as a \\"revisionist,\\" ...so much as an \\"additionist\\" - the fellow who comes along after the historical accounts have been written and adds what's been (inadvertently or deliberately) left out.\\"Martin's \\"additionist\\" approach is clearly and brilliantly on display in this fine collection of well crafted essays. Where else would you learn that a 1946 Roper poll asking \\"Do you think we [the USA] did or did not deliberately provoke Japan into making war against us?\\" had 14 percent of replies nationally, and 22% on the west coast, respond in the affirmative. Where else would you learn of John Foster Dulles's earlier more realist and anti-'collective security' viewpoints, views almost diametrically opposite those he implemented when Secretary of State? Where else would you learn of the mawkish (in the original sense of the term, meaning \\"maggot\\" like) behaviour of allied 'journalists' at the scene of Tojo's attempted suicide? Even to those who have spent decades studying war and peace in the modern world there will surely be something new to find in Martin's essays.The other reviewers listed here have done a good job in providing a snapshot overview of the contents of his essays. There is little I can add to what they have said other than a few passing impressions.Despite mainly being penned in the 1960s, all the essays are still quite topical. Indeed his analysis of the relationship between Defense and \\"the New Imperialism\\" could have been written yesterday, especially as America's post-Cold War foreign policy has reached a new crisis. The conscription essay is fascinating, and Martin imagines conscription was here to stay. Yet it was only a year or two after this book was published that the \\"All Volunteer Army\\" was ushered in. Of course conscription could return, the ruination of the National Guard in the middle east might force the issue. Despite the misprediction here, my guess is that Martin would not have been that surprised that it was Nixon, a conservative, rather than his liberal rivals who utlimately ended it. His discussion of the still unresolved debate over the definition of fascism provides a great overview full of excellent quotes for any student. With fascism, real or imaginary, back in the news Martin's essay is probably more relevant today. I can only imagine what he would of thought of the bastardised modern neologism \\"islamofascism\\" ...and those who use it. Further mud to muddy waters perhaps. His item on \\"War Crimes\\" is another essay of renewed importance today. The bad precedent of the Nuremburg trials have become the model for the trial of Slobodan Milosevi' and to a lesser extent Saddam Hussein. Martin's analysis of victors' justice applied to losers for the purpose of reinforcing new regime political control in the vanquished territory would seem to apply perfectly to the Yugoslav case. Martin believed the war crime trials had their real roots in Stalin's show trials of the 1930s. There would seem to be nothing in Nuremberg's offspring to contradict him. His essays on Harry Elmer Barnes and historical revisionism provide an insightful hypothesis to help explain the comparative triumph of revisionist thinking post-WW1 versus their failure to dent the orthodoxy, at least in the public mind, post-WW2. Martin notes that after WW1 virtually all the incumbent governments were kicked out thus removing so many self interested roadblocks to revisionist advance. Not so after WW2 where incumbent administrations mostly continued and where the now rival victors on both sides of the Iron Curtain had a shared interest in an orthodoxy that lumped the blame for WW2 entirely on the defeated.I'd like to add that Martin's writing style is excellent, fluid, informative, unpretentious and often sprinkled with sly humour. Even his footnotes are excellent, and sometimes a delight to read. His long footnote in the final appendix essay \\"History and Social Intelligence\\" dealing with the life and times of Arthur Schlesinger is a pocket satire worthy of Mencken.There is perhaps only one substantive criticism that I'd make of \\"Revisionist Viewpoints\\". It lacks an index so digging back into it to ferret out your favourite Martin addition or footnote is not as easy as it could be."},{"Title":"Revisionist Viewpoints: Essays in a Dissident Historical Tradition","review":"Anyone who is tired of the same old establishment take on history should read this book.Included are accounts of conscription,war crimes trials,defense spending,propaganda,terror bombing,the cold war and other topics,all of which challenge official narratives and conventionally oriented accounts."},{"Title":"Revisionist Viewpoints: Essays in a Dissident Historical Tradition","review":"_Revisionist Viewpoints: Essays in a Dissident Historical Tradition_ by individualist anarchist James J. Martin, published by the libertarian press Ralph Myles, consists of a collection of essays which focus on a revisionist perspective of history, particularly emphasizing the entry of the United States into the Second World War and the subsequent loss of civil liberties which resulted from that. Martin is very much against unnecessary war, showing the absurdity of modern war, and the manner in which it results in a concomitant growth of a bureaucratic state. Indeed, in today's world, the state has become virtually all powerful, routinely persecuting those who dissent from the political status quo. In addition, the United States has sought to achieve imperial ambitions routinely declaring war on countries which do not directly concern its fundamental interests. Furthermore, the state now routinely encroaches upon the civil liberties of individuals, confiscating their property through excessive taxation, and cracking down on dissenters. These essays are particularly important in the light of the times in which we live.This book takes a look at many of the issues surrounding the growth of the state following the Second World War, including examinations of imperialism and the misleading use of the term \\"defense\\", an examination of conscription showing the unconstitutional nature of this policy, an examination of the question of fascism showing how the term \\"fascist\\" has been applied indiscriminately and that unless understood in terms of economics (the state going socialist in an attempt to defeat communism once and for all, c.f. Ernst Nolte) has no real meaning, the use of bombing by the Allies and the negotiated peace, \\"war crimes\\" and \\"war criminals\\" arguing that the Nazi war criminals were tried under an ex post facto situation in which they were accused of breaking laws that did not exist at the time they allegedly broke them, the American mass media and Stalinism showing how the liberals of the time who so strongly advocated for war against \\"fascism\\" actively supported Stalinism until later this position became inconvenient for them, and a discussion of the Cold War arguing that the Cold War existed mostly in the heads of those fighting it in that the elite in the United States and among the Soviets did not significantly differ from each other in any substantial way. The book also includes appendices featuring discussions of Keynesian economics (a preface to the little-known German edition of Keynes' _General Theory_, meditations on the early writings of John Foster Dulles who before he became a diplomat wrote against the war, and a discussion of history and social intelligence featuring the work of revisionist historian blacklisted by the Roosevelt government Harry Elmer Barnes. Particularly interesting are Martin's discussions of the origins of warfare. In line with others such as Lawrence Dennis, Martin argues that war involves an attempt to unload excess production when other means have failed. Indeed, Dennis believed that war existed as a sort of \\"make work\\" project much like the building of the pyramids among the ancient Egyptians. In addition, Martin discusses the supposed hoax \\"The Report from Iron Mountain\\" showing how what this document says about war is very much in line with the writings of others such as Dennis. Martin also has much to say about the wars fought to allegedly \\"rid the world of fascism\\". Martin shows the ephemeral nature of the term \\"fascist\\", so often used by Marxists against their opponents. Indeed, for the Marxist fascism represents an attempt of the capitalist state to squelch the social revolution. Interestingly, Martin suggests that the war against fascism may be perceived as an attempt to destroy capitalism once and for all, the state heading in the direction of socialism during war. Martin also shows how many of the same liberals who became Cold warriors actively supported Stalin during the Second World War. Martin is particularly hard on Churchill who although claiming to be a \\"conservative\\" made some extremely adulatory remarks towards Stalin during the war. Later of course, Churchill was to make his iron curtain speech and thus began the Cold War period. Martin argues that both the United States elite and the Soviet elite while engaging in the Cold War sought to actively crush their own citizens, by having the state actively encroach upon their civil rights. These are particularly interesting remarks in light of the situations which occurred at the time of war. In today's world we face a similar situation all over again, with a so-called \\"War on Terror\\" in effect and successively infringing upon the civil rights of United States citizens. Martin's essays are essential reading for understanding the nature of the warfare state and the times in which we live. It is unfortunate that few will come across them."},{"Title":"The Joy of C, 3E","review":"Most books on programming that I have read use 'snippets' of code to demonstrate concepts. This is fine for someone with a grasp of underlying concepts, but useless to novices and students attempting to learn C for the first time. The main problem is lack of context... most of these 'snippets' merely demonstrate _syntax_ Joy of C uses samples that are part of an actual program so that the student may benefit from seeing how 'it all fits together'. The samples are not abstract, they are actually useful. Most of the exercises are extensions of previous programs, demonstrating the iterative process of programming where we take smaller programs that work and slowly add functionality. The authors have a website that provide solutions to many of the exercises, providing guidance when needed. Most of the code compiles and runs. The book covers alot of information, so some of the explanations aren't as detailed or simple as they could be. I believe that some basic grasp of programming concepts would make the book easier to digest, and would recommend it as a second book for students who have never done any programming at all. I highly recommend it to anyone with some programming experience as a means of learning C."},{"Title":"The Joy of C, 3E","review":"I just bought the book a month ago, but already had 3 other titles previously. The thing that impressed me the most is the authors' style of teaching. So many examples, carefully starting from the basics down to a more complicated version of it, adding little snippets that makes one fully understands why a certain statement do what it does when compiled and run. My only regret is that I should have bought this book while I was in college or before I bought the 3 titles before it. This is a type of book in C that made me think a lot about the logic behind each example's functionality even when I'm not reading it and always makes me compare it with the other titles. Now I'm really excited to finish the book and try all the examples and exercises that goes with it, because honestly, I'm not yet an advanced C programmer, so any help from any book is very well appreciated.Thank you Mr. Miller &amp; Mr. Quilici for this wonderfully laid-out book."},{"Title":"The Joy of C, 3E","review":"I picked up this book as someone with no programming experience to speak of. After working through it for a month, I thoroughly understood all of the major concepts in C. The presentation is thorough and interesting. While this wouldn't be my first choice as a C reference to have around, it is a good read (a feat for a technical book of this nature) which offers tons of examples of actual implementation of concepts. I would recommend it to anyone with an analytical mind, looking to break into the world of programming in C."},{"Title":"The Joy of C, 3E","review":"Greak work on C but it needs fine tuning still.

It appears the authors have completely stopped work on the book."},{"Title":"The Joy of C, 3E","review":"In passed three years, I have read the book at least five times thoroughly. The most exciting part of the book is the full of completed examples. The completed example means that the example is completed and you could compile it and see the result of execution from your code development tools right away. I.e., you don't have to figure out how a particular C statement or structure can be used in real world. If you prefer &quot;learn by example,&quot; it will be definitively one of your best choices."},{"Title":"The Joy of C, 3E","review":"This book was used for one semester by my University. It is not concise, it contains many examples and explanations of common C syntactical problems.

It starts in a messy and dirty way to lead you view all the C codes and most basic structures. But, it will explain in great details in following chapters... Neat and Clean... Great Examples too..."},{"Title":"The Joy of C, 3E","review":"I bought this book just for the title, because I assume that you can always learn something from someone who loves what he's doing and is bold enough to state it in the title of a book. I was not disappointed. C and programming in general are introduced though lots of simple, gradual examples reaching the right compromise between being too naive and overwhelm the reader with too much detail. The interest and pleasure that the author takes in programming shines through every page and makes the learning effort less tiring. I won't give 5 stars just because the typesetting of the book is rather mediocre, especially by today's standards.In conclusion, if your want to learn C by yourself, or are in a college course that doesn't force you to buy the nth edition of the trendiest book on C (which will cover exactly the same grounds as this one..) do yourself a favor, save some money and give this little joy of a book a try!Be warned that the example code comes in a floppy disk not a CD, so your machine might not be able to read it."},{"Title":"The Joy of C, 3E","review":"I love this book.

So, by default, Kent Kennan's book is the best reference book a composer can buy for a basic overview of counterpoint. If you already have a year or two of music theory (you know about modulations, sonata forms, and basic part-writing) you can,literally, just start working from this book with Bach as a companion text and start teaching yourself how to write fugues.Kennan's book is helpful because while mostly covering Baroque counterpoint he covers the topic in a way that lets a student expand on the contrapuntal principles into other styles. If you're going to get just one book on counterpoint make this the book."},{"Title":"Counterpoint (4th Edition)","review":"Having taught counterpoint for about twenty years, I can honestly say this is still the best textbook available on the subject. Along the way I tried a number of \\"newer\\" texts, but my classes always met with more success using Kennan. The workbook that accompanies this book is a must for anyone who wants to master the art of eighteenth-century counterpoint. To be honest, you also need a teacher to evaluate your progress."},{"Title":"Counterpoint (4th Edition)","review":"This was my main textbook for my first tonal counterpoint course, and is probably the one I still refer to most - clearly explains contrapuntal rules in composition, starting from basic polyphony to four-voice fugal writing. The emphasis is on tonal counterpoint, rather than specie counterpoint, and most of the examples cite Bach works, though Kennan provides a variety of them, for the student to have as reference. I remember his tonal and structural outlines of a fugue's organization and explanation of tonal and exact answers to be especially helpful.Also recommended: the Counterpoint exercise book by Kennan, which I found particularly useful, the two counterpoint books by Gauldin, and for historical significance, Fux's Study of Counterpoint."},{"Title":"Counterpoint (4th Edition)","review":"The first musical example for Chapter 3 should be an excerpt from Bach's Two-Part Invention, No.11.

I can't emphasize enough how beautiful and moving Chopin's prose is. Reading it was pure pleasure, and when self-realization and introspective thought comes along with that, you know the book is a winner."},{"Title":"The Damnation of Theron Ware","review":"IMHO, this novel can and should be included with the other American novels that we cram down the throats of high-schoolers: Moby Dick, Scarlet Letter, Huckleberry Finn, etc. This is the almost painfully realistic story of a preacher who discovers that there is another world outside his previously sheltered existence. For many of us, this sort of discovery is a happy and broadening experience. But in Ware's case, his new discoveries cause him to reject all the good things about his old life, and to build fantasy castles in the air of his imagination. In his increasingly desperate attempt to escape into a fantasy life, he leaves behind many of his values and ethical standards - not least his responsibilities to those he loves.This book will hit a nerve for many readers - it did for me. It is easy for the reader to identify with Ware and realize only too late, as Ware did, that he is embarking on an illusory and self-destructive quest. Frederick constructed both the plot and the character of Ware perfectly, and this novel is worth everyone's time to read. You will keep thinking about it long after you have closed the book for the last time."},{"Title":"The Damnation of Theron Ware","review":"&quot;The Damnation of Theron Ware&quot; starts out as a quietly damning portrait of small-town piety, but slowly gains momentum until, at the end, it hits you like a sledgehammer. The title character, a naive, self-satisfied young Methodist minister, is a cautionary figure for us all; introduced tentatively to a world of sophistication, he loses faith in all the old verities of his life, with nothing but a few poses and attitudes to replace them. Even at the end, trying to make a new start, his self-delusion is breathtaking. Harold Frederic had the misfortune to die at 42, just as he was starting to hit his stride as a novelist. Had he lived to write even another 10 years, he might be a household name today."},{"Title":"The Damnation of Theron Ware","review":"Over 20 years working as a bookseller, this is the novel I would most often recommend to customers who were seeking a truly entertaining out-of-the-ordinary novel. I've read it three times now, and am looking forward to a fourth in the next year or so. The main characters are fresh and utterly believable and they are surrounded by a fine cast of eccentrics. Frederic is a exceptionally visual writer. This book would make a fabulous movie."},{"Title":"The Damnation of Theron Ware","review":"This book flows and entertains 'til the end. Frederic combines naturalism, realism, and romanticism all in one book and truly touches the heart. The tragedy of this common man opens our eyes to how easy it is to lose our innocence and fall from our pride. I definately recommend this book to anyone who ever ponders about life and the meaning of it."},{"Title":"The Damnation of Theron Ware","review":"I won't bother repeating the plot line or lift any of the criticism found in the introduction, instead I will offer my thoughts on this amazing book.1. It is an excellent picture of what religion may have really been like in the 1880s in upstate New York. I especially enjoyed the revelation that the barnstormer preachers didn't really believe in the religion, but rather did preached fire and brimstone because that was what they were good at and needed a gig. I am sure that is how it has been for centuries in any religion, I never considered that before.2. What is most amazing to me is that Theron Ware was convinced he was making good decisions as he transformed himself, that he was improving himself by associating with intelligent interesting people, rather than the boring, uneducated people of his own religion. Yet, though he thought he was improving, in the eyes of those he wanted most to like him, he was devolving into a terrible person. This makes me wonder, I suppose, when we make decisions in life to pursue some course of action, or to be some sort of way, it doesn't necessarily make us a better person, although at the time we may think it might.3. I didn't think the book was that clear on why the Catholics thought little of him. Granted they didn't like him talking bad about his own folks, still, that does not make a person unlikeable. To me this was confusing and perhaps poorly presented, but perhaps that is how life is.4. It seems that Theron would have remained most likable and respectable if he would have kept to his own people and not dabbled with these \\"out of the box\\" type thoughts. But how can a man who sees the emptiness and backwardness of his co-religionists remain? That is what I don't understand.5. Theron thought he was very clever, when actually he was somewhat uneducated, and looked down upon by those who were. Reminds me of myself. Whenever you start thinking you know something, remember Theron Ware.6. Celia reminds me of some hard core left wing artist types I went to college with. It is hard for me to believe that people like that existed in the US in the 1880s. I have had to revise my understanding of history somewhat.Overall, this is a thought-provoking book about life in general and how best to conduct it, but it doesn't offer any answers, but some difficult questions that I tried to present above.Theron made some mistakes, but before we condemn him, I think it would be best to put yourself in his shoes and ask yourself, what would you have done differently? Probably nothing, and you would have ended up in the same place he did.I have a version with an introduction by Everett Carter. If you have that introduction, don't bother reading it before and certainly not after. It is worthless unless you are a serious literature student."},{"Title":"The Damnation of Theron Ware","review":"This was a very popular novel of 1896, and is considered by many to be a literary classic. Theron Ware enters the scene as a small town Methodist Minister. He and his wife seem to be humble folk and settle into a small house near his church. Soon he meets a Catholic priest, an atheist physician, and a beautiful Irish lass. They make quite an impression on him. They are sophisticated, well educated, and quite worldly. Alas, they are such a strong influence on him that he starts playing the worldly role, and begins to look down on his job and his religion. He also finds himself strongly attracted to the lovely Celia Madden. I should mention that in those days the Irish were assigned to the caste of untouchables.Theron acts as if he is now a man of the world, although he knows nothing of the literature, music, and philosophy discussed by others. He becomes a boring, mean minded buffoon. The book continues with his steady degradation, a preacher who has become a victim of that secular humanism that our current day fundamentalists complain so much about.The novel provides an interesting view of religion and culture of the late 1800s. It was somewhat difficult for me to understand how such a seemingly pious man could turn into such a churlish fellow. Perhaps his upbringing was quite religiously strict, and he developed a strong reaction formation to it all."},{"Title":"The Damnation of Theron Ware","review":"Okay, granted. In some ways, this is pretty thin soup. A short novel, after all, and not by any stretch of the imagination a major novel, certainly not in the sense that Middlemarch or Ulysses are major. But I'd put this on a list of personal favorites. And there are certain second rate novels which for all their second-rateness should not be lost. Frederic lived not too long, accomplished not very much, saw not everything there was to be seen - but in this little fable of a Methodist preacher who never quite got the point, Frederic himself pretty much gets it right. Not a mean achievement for a lifetime, and so one not to be forgotten."},{"Title":"The Damnation of Theron Ware","review":"I would love to recommend this novel. Frederic writes about realistic characters and issues pertinent to America during the 1890's with a touch of irony and subtlety. Frederic is somewhat comparable to William Dean Howells and Stephen Crane in that he was writing at the same time about similar issues. He incorporated techniques of both realism and naturalism, which blended into a unique style distinctly his own. Unfortunately, Frederic is currently a forgotten author. This is the only book of his that is now in print. Please read this novel and pass the word so that Frederic and his work does not remain forgotten."},{"Title":"The Damnation of Theron Ware","review":"Although I was a lit major, this book was never on any of my reading lists in college. I chanced upon it when it appeared on my son's required reading for a course..and wow, am I glad I did! It should be a classic, have no idea why it isn't, if only for the detail and insight about church politics and the workings of congregations in the 1800s.This gem of a novel focuses on Theron Ware, a Methodist minister who has had a less than stellar career, which leads to his current posting in a small, backcountry town. He vows to make a new start and, for a time, things seem to go well. But alas, Theron is less certain than he appears, making him easy prey to those with questionable values and setting him on a parth towards destruction. For the first time in his life, Theron questions his calling, his values and even his marriage.I couldn't wait to see how this one would end..and I won't give the ending away here. I'll just say that if you pick up this one, you won't be disaapointed."},{"Title":"The Damnation of Theron Ware","review":"I found this book on my father's bookshelf and brought it home to read. I'm not sure why I picked it--nothing about the title or description excited me too much, so it sat on my own bookshelf forgotten for several months. Finally, hurriedly getting ready for a vacation I needed a book to read and found Theron Ware. I loved it so much that I went right out and bought my own copy. I recommended it to my 21 year old son and he loved it too. One caution though, do NOT read the introduction first--it gives the entire plot away. Save it for after when you can savor the analysis."},{"Title":"The Damnation of Theron Ware","review":"Illumination (1896) has been an underground classic among serious writers and readers since its publication. Although it sold well in its day, it was largely lost to mainstream attention for most of the 20th century. Only in the 1980s did it first start appearing in school settings with the first critical edition by Nebraska Press (and Penguin Press editions around the same time). It has been called an \\"American classic\\" by more than one critic and writer.First, an explanation of the odd title. Frederic intended the title to be simply \\"Illumination\\", which it was indeed published as in England, but due to some mis-communication at his (soon to be bankrupt) American publishers - a working draft had the internal working name of \\"damnation\\" - it was mistakingly published as \\"The Damnation of Theron Ware\\". Later publishers in the 1930s then combined the two into the full title \\"The Damnation of Theron Ware, Or, Illumination\\".This is an important novel and can be critically approached from a number of perspectives. Probably most important and timeless (c.f. Richard Dawkins \\"The God Delusion\\" (2006)) is Theron Ware's \\"Illumination\\" about truth in religion. Is the value of religion based on the belief in a real God, or just a belief in a god that may not even exist - the existence of which doesn't matter - the value in religion comes from _pretending_ to believe. It is unclear in the end if Sister Soulsby, Forbes and others truly believe, or just pretend to believe, and if it even matters.The narrative technique of writing from Theron's perspective, hearing in the first person about his own \\"Illumination\\" and personal growth (a positive healthy thing it seems to him) - which is then re-played at the end of the novel from other peoples perspective, is very powerful and well crafted. It really makes the reader examine times in their own lives when they thought they were on the right and true path. It has a certain Rashomon theme of subjectivity and what is the truth of events from multiple perspectives."},{"Title":"The Damnation of Theron Ware","review":"I'm a lousy writer, so a positive review is difficult for me to write-- it is always easier to write a negative review, but I'll do my best because I feel like this work is ridiculously neglected. Besides being a fascinating document of social and intellectual trends in mid to late 19th century America, it is a wonderful study of an individual who does not comprehend the limits of his own intellect. Ultimately, it is about self delusion. The theme is relevant today."},{"Title":"The Damnation of Theron Ware","review":"Pastor Theron Ware of a hard-shell Methodist congregation in up-state New York in the late nineteenth century faces hostility among his people and seeks advice and comfort from sophisticated neighbors, including a seductive red-head with money and talent. The slippery path he enters on is not so much one of sin as of self-delusion, a penchant he never really escapes. His poor, put-upon wife and a pair of slightly shabby &quot;debt-raisers&quot; (=fund-raisers) provide him a refuge amid his general ruin. The Methodist Church described in this novel apparently existed in spots in the late nineteenth century but would be unrecognzied today. For one example, the novel explains that not only was Theron Ware a Republican but so were his fellow clergy and even all the seminary professors in the denomination. Ultimately it is a story of terminal naivete."},{"Title":"The Damnation of Theron Ware","review":"When I ordered this book for a school project, I wasn't really expecting that much. We had to choose a work of fiction written during and about our time period, which happened to be the time period this book is set in, and we had difficulty finding many options, so we went for this one.I was surprised to find that this book is quite entertaining. **There may be softcore spoilers in the rest of this paragraph**. It tells the story of Theron Ware, an initially down-to-earth pastor living a simple life who ends up moving to a town where some more diverse viewpoints are held. He begins to learn about the lives of the looked-down-upon Irish and become more versed in the ways of science. Frederic does a great job of creating a very vivid setting for his story, and all the characters come to life as Ware tries to reconcile his traditional, protestant, way of life with the twin forces of secularism and Catholicism pressing down on his worldview.Read it for the history, but also for the enjoyment. 4 stars only because it's not on my list of top 20."},{"Title":"The Damnation of Theron Ware","review":"Rather drawn out.

As soon as I opened the cover the two front pages tore away from their binding, and within a day of reading it the cover fell off, with more pages threatening to go. Moreover, the type is bad and faded in parts. Better to find a used Penguin or Modern Library edition.

It is an inspiring treasure of information on healing foods and herbs, and their benefits for treating and preventing diseases.The material is presented clearly, with lightness and humor, which Steve Meyerwitz is known for! A major part of the book presents drinks, which may be teas, smoothies, citrus juices or other kinds of vegetable or fruit juices, for specific conditions. There are chapters on power drinks for the physical body, for the mind, and for longevity. The longest chapter, called &quot;Power drinks - Medicine Chest&quot;, details nutritional therapies and recipes for 115 different health disorders.A tremendous resource on high power foods and herbs, is the chapter titled, &quot;Nature's Finest Healing Foods and Herbs&quot;. It is this chapter which inspired me to start growing and eating broccoli sprouts, which contain fantastic amounts of valuable phytochemicals (plant derived substances). One type of phytochemicals is glucosinolates; Enzymes in the body convert these chemicals to isothiocyanates. One isothiocyanate, sulforaphane, is the strongest natural inducer of our body's own protective enzymes against carcinogens. These substances have been shown to reduce the incidence, rate of development, and the size of tumors. Broccoli sprouts contain 20 to 50 times more sulforaphane than the average adult broccoli plant! In three days you can raise a crop of broccoli sprouts containing as much sulforaphane as an acre of broccoli would yield in a year!

They call for more ingredients than you'd find in any grocery store, and in order to make these juicy refreshments, you have to have a wide variety of juices on hand. Not to mention a dozen appliances for blending, chopping, squeezing and processing the ingredients they way the book describes.I was hoping for something that said \\"juice 2 apples, a stalk of celery and a bannana.\\" But this book says something like, \\"blend 1.5 oz. apple juice, 3/4 oz. of celery juice, and 3/4 oz of banana juice.\\" It doesn't suggest how much of each fruit you need on hand to make the desired amount. It doesn't even focus on Juicing, which is why I bought it.Looks cute on the bookshelf, and that's where it will stay.

Meyerowitz clearly describes the benefits of juicing, the various types of blenders and juicers, and the health attributes of various foods. He then goes into detail on various health conditions and specific juices that can help heal them. This detail includes causes, diet suggestions, and foods that help.I got a few other books by other authors, but this one is hands down the best. The anti-biotic V8 juice, anti-stress smoothie, and lung relaxer juice are my favorites so far. When I'm done juicing vegetables, I throw the pulp into soup or a rice and bean or quinoa mix.I just purchased a single gear, masticating auger-type juicer called the Omega 8006. It's super easy to use and clean. With it and my Vitamix there isn't anything I can't make quickly and easily.Best thing about juicing: I can get the nutrients from organic, incredibly healthy vegetables into my system in one glass. I normally couldn't sit down and eat five tomatoes, three pieces of celery, raw garlic, raw kale, and raw parsley.

The recipes require not only a juicer, but a blender as well, and more time than I think most people are willing to give.The author also recommends using only organic produce and distilling or purifying your own water. Where does this guy live, and on what budget? Produce is expensive enough, let alone organic vegetables -- 99 cents for a regular cucumber or $3.00 for an organic one.

Secondly, I'm glad I bought this second hand because its about 1/4 inch thick.Thirdly, this is not a good book. Like the previous reviewer stated, Blake seems to be trying to answer why Harry Potter is so popular, but he never really does. He provides a whole bunch of statistics like The Labour Party came into power in the same year Harry was published. So what? This isn't enough. (Not to mention that Fudge has often been called a parody of Tony Blair). He cites a lot of coincidences and contemporaneous events, but doesn't do much with them. Many of his arguments are very thin. He uses the example of Harry relaxing by playing Qudditch in a scene from Book Four to argue that in the books \\"Retail therapy and sport substitute for emotional contact.\\" Clearly this guy has no clue what he's talking about. One wonders if it is not Blake who has the problem with emotional contact--obviously, he could not emotionally connect with the books.Which brings up the main reason why this book is so bad--Blake never took the time to read the books thoroughly and analyze them thoroughly. I got the impression he had casually read through them maybe one time. He never analyzes them beyond a casual recital of the plot. The books are used as mere examples of his thin social and political theories, with a cold, Professor Binns-like indifference.His attitude is insensitive, condescending, cynical, and patronizing, to the point that one wonders why in the world he wrote this book at all? I can only think it was to try and cash in on the phenomenon. Why, for example, is the lettering on the spine exactly like the \\"magical\\" lettering of the American versions?I would advise you NOT to waste your money. Its only 116 SMALL pages with LARGE print.I would recommend The Ivory Tower and Harry Potter instead. That is full of interesting ideas and its well worth the price."},{"Title":"The Irresistible Rise of Harry Potter","review":"i've read this book twice, and, while much of the social and cultural facts, discussions and conclusions are interesting--even fascinating--i cannot say that the author has determined why harry potter has become so internationally popular, and so popular across social levels.nevertheless, i did find it worth reading twice. on the other hand, i think it also proves that it is not possible to analyze the reasons for a cultural phenomenon."},{"Title":"The Irresistible Rise of Harry Potter","review":"I have just begun this book, and my rating is preliminary based on what I've seen so far. Although I look forward to reading it, on the very first page is a bit of misinformation. Blake states that \\"the books . . . have been translated into forty-seven languages; only the Bible has been translated into more.\\" Actually, the second most translated book--in English, at any rate, and probably in any other language--is John Bunyan's Pilgrim's Progress. Isabel Hofmeyr (The Portable Bunyan) reports 80 translations into African languages alone. It has been translated into all the European languages, so that there is there is a translation not only in Dutch but also in Flemish, not only in Russian but also in Lithuanian, Estonian, Serbian, Czech, and Bulgarian. There's just been a new Bulgarian translation, in fact. The Harry Potter books are being translated into key languages, but there is a translation of Pilgrim's Progress in both Armeno-Turkish and Greco-Turkish, as well Armenian and Syriac. Pilgrim's Progress would appear to have been translated into all the major 14 languages of India as well, and so forth. It is also the second most published book after the Bible. Ac cording to bibliographer F.M. Harrison, it had gone into 1,300 editions and reprints, not counting pirated editions, abridgements, abbreviations, adaptations, dramatizations, imitations of or selections from the text, and Harrison was reporting in 1941. Even now, there are as many hits for the full text of Pilgrim's Progress for sale on Amazon as there are for, say, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone. The eleven first editions of Pilgrim's Progress--those published during Bunyan's lifetime--are unspeakably valuable. Lucy Maude Montgomery, author of Anne of Green Gables, even wrote a book featuring the value of an early edition of Pilgrim's Progress."},{"Title":"The Irresistible Rise of Harry Potter","review":"This author along with all the other HP critics overthink the Harry Potter phenomenom. What is going on inthe county has a minimal effect on what fiction people read, especially for grade schoolers.People liek the idea that there is a world nobody knows about. It's not going to be complex literature because its aimed toward younger readers. JK Rowling has a good plot and a gift for writing."},{"Title":"The Irresistible Rise of Harry Potter","review":"Andrew Blake argues here that the Harry Potter phenomenon is a response to the decline of British power and of the publishing industry. Blake sees Harry as a symbol of \\"retrolution,\\" a nostalgic view of the past transplanted into the present.As to the reasons for Harry's popularity, I don't find Blake's thesis wildly convincing. As I see it, the Potter books are well written and exciting. I find it a relief myself to read about Harry's magical problems rather than the all-too-real ones I face every day. Other than that, the main force I see operating in Harry's success is the one no one can sensibly explain: the power of fad.On the other hand, Blake is correct that Britain's power has declined. I suppose it's possible that Harry Potter may relate to this in some way. Unfortunately, Blake doesn't take this analysis very far. I think retrolution may well be an unavoidable part of the future in all the developed countries. Although Blake doesn't mention this, Britain's past dominance in the world depended largely on the Industrial Revolution. The Industrial Revolution in turn came about because fossil fuels were harnessed to do work. Britain's decline began when her coal supplies began to run out. The North Sea oil was a shot in the arm for Britain, but it appears that also is coming to an end. Hubbert's oil peak is likely to cause widespread disruption in developed countries in the next few years. Britain certainly will not be spared these problems. One result will be a general shift back to a slower, more local style of life--in other words, retrolution. For more on this, see Kunstler's book \\"The Long Emergency.\\"The Long Emergency: Surviving the End of Oil, Climate Change, and Other Converging Catastrophes of the Twenty-First Century"},{"Title":"The Irresistible Rise of Harry Potter","review":"Isn't the Harry Potter a book series for children? Isn't it a fantasy series? It's just harmless fun, so leave it alone. Once again a puritanical conservative decides what's best for others and is upset because some people enjoy something he doesn't. Let it go already."},{"Title":"The Irresistible Rise of Harry Potter","review":"This is an excellent and subtle, but unfortunately too brief (hence four stars), overview of the Harry Potter craze. The main question Blake seeks to answer is: why now? Why and how did the Harry Potter series become so popular and why now? He situates the books in historical context--easier said than done. There was much going on in English culture and education that contributed to the books' success. Beginning in the mid-90s, Blake looks less at the books' possible past textual sources and spends more time exploring the books' contemporary cultural sources. I'm currently teaching a university course with _Azkaban_ as a text and may assign readings from Blake's book as secondary reading, both as overview of what came before and as an example of how to read carefully and respect a text and its attendant complications."},{"Title":"The Irresistible Rise of Harry Potter","review":"I would rate this as a tie for the most interesting book on this phenomenon of those I have read so far. This book looks at the cultural and political timing that seems to have made Harry the irresistible darling of the literacy efforts in the UK and since in many respects those things are duplicated in the US, voila, Harry is irresistible there also."},{"Title":"Encyclopedia of the Korean War: A Political, Social, And Military History (3 Volumes)","review":"Encyclopedia Of The Korean War: A Political, Social, And Military History is deftly edited by Spencer C.

As might be expected given the length of the book, there is a wide range of topics covered.As to format, there is a very useful listing of all the topic entries at the front of the book, along with a plethora of plain but clear maps. I might mention though, that the map on p. xxviii, intended to be a map of the Inchon landings, is actually a reprint of the initial North Korean invasion map. Also, under the entry for \\"Orders of Battle\\", one is directed to Appendix I, which seems to be missing. However, in an undertaking as extensive as this, these anomolies are minor.In sum, this book is a very important and useful addition to Korean War historiography. I'm certainly glad it exists and that I bought it!"},{"Title":"Encyclopedia of the Korean War: A Political, Social, And Military History (3 Volumes)","review":"A great book for students of the Korean War. Thorough coverage. Excellent seller."},{"Title":"Encyclopedia of the Korean War: A Political, Social, And Military History (3 Volumes)","review":"The problem with a work of this type is that the editor must depend on the accuracy of the submissions sent to him. The introduction by John Eisenhower has both errors of fact and errors of omission. First, he states that the 24th Division, the first to arrive was almost wiped out. Secondly he says that they were followed by the First Cavalry Division and then the 25th Infantry. He lists the 2d Infantry next, followed by the First Marine Division. He omits entirely the 7th Infantry Division, which participated in the Inchon landing concurrently with the First Marine Division. Actually the third regiment of the First Marines did not arrive at Inchon until after the 7th Infantry had completed their landing. The 24th was not almost destroyed, it remained as a fighting force until relieved on the line by the First Cavalry Division on 21 July. The 25th Infantry was the second to arrive in Korea, with its first elements landing immediately after the last elements of the 24th Division landed at Pusan.There are two entries by Daniel Bierne, both actually about the battle at Unsan. He indicates in both entries that the First Cavalry was ordered north to block the Chinese force that had overrun ROKA forces. He also states that the 1st LU 2d Battalions of the 8th Cavalry had hardly taken up defensive positions on the evening of November 1 when theyy were overrun by two divisions of the Chinese 39th Army. The facts, as recorded in First Cavalry Division and Eighty Cavalry Regimental War Diaries and Unit Histories are that the 8th Cavalry Regiment was ordered on October 28th to proceed at 8 AM on October 29th to relieve the First ROK Division at Unsan and proceed north and west to the Yalu. They arrived on the early afternoon of October 30th after biviouacing overnight at Yongsang. Patrols sent out that day were unable to make any contact with the enemy. Relief of the 1s ROK Division was scheduled for noon on October 31st. That morning the ROK's lost 2000 yards and the Commander of the ROK unit refused to be relieved, so relief was rescheduled for the next day. Mr. Bierne also states that the 8th Cavalry was almost destroyed. Official records of the 8th Cavalry indicate that total casualties for the month of November, most of which occurred on the 1st and 2d of November were 9 killed, 235 wounded and 584 missing. Since total strength of the Regiment was about 3,000, loss of 829 hardly equates to destruction. Battery A of the 99th Field Artillery made it out intact and Battery C lost only one of its six 105mm howitzers in the battle. The missing figure was adjusted downward by 19 as that many members of the 8th Cavalry captured at Unsan were inexplicably released by the Chinese and returned to our lines on November 22. This included the First Sergeant of \\"I\\" Company of the 8ths Third Battalion, Master Sergeant Samuel Cleckner.Mr. Tucker, in his two entries about the Battle of Osan/Task Force Smith relies almost entirely on the accounts of Roy Appleman, which are very inaccurate based on Unit Histories and War Diaries of the 24th Infantry Division and the 21st Infantry Regiment, which tell an entirely different story.ALL IN ALL, MY ORIGINAL RATING WAS EXTREMELY ERRONEOUS, AS MR. TUCKER HAD TO HAVE SPENT CONSIDERABLE TIME AND EFFORT PUTTING THIS BOOK TOGETHER. HE COULD NOT POSSIBLY HAVE HAD TIME TO ENSURE THE ACCURACY OF ALL SUBMITTALS AND REFERENCES.

I reccomend this book to anybody who is interested in religion, sociology, or cultural history."},{"Title":"The Way of the Heathen: A Handbook of Greater Theodism","review":"Mr. Garman Lord caused quite a stir in heathen circles when he founded Theodish belief. Before his time most heathens were studying Norse asatru for the most part only. Having met and spoken with the author on the idea and practice of of both sacral kingship and English heathenism I wanted to know even more. I was very happy when this book was published. Theodish belief is not for everyone it is true. However, if you are like me, and your ancestors were English then you might want to know a bit more on this subject. Some people do not agree with all of Mr. Lord's ideas of kingship in the modern world, or the way he sets up his tribal society. That aside, his writings and ideas express new ideas outside of standard asatru. I say it is worth the read and you may walk away with a broader understanding of Germanic traditions."},{"Title":"The Way of the Heathen: A Handbook of Greater Theodism","review":"This book is one of those that does more harm then well...Extremely shoddy research and some stuff completley made up.There is no historical evidence of sacral kingship in britain.this book is truely about a man who wanted to start his own heathen cult.if one followed much of \\"Garman Lords\\" methodology one could probably say that the Ancient tribes of Northern Europe believed just about anything.He makes a strong case of 2 + 2 = whatever fits into your ideas."},{"Title":"The Way of the Heathen: A Handbook of Greater Theodism","review":"High Theodism is in many ways an extreme version of Heathenry/Asatru with an emphasis on the Anglo-Saxon side of things. In this book Garman Lord discusses what he terms \\"Greater Theodism\\" - in essence Theodism for those who are not quite up to the degree of committment that High Theodism requires.The most striking difference between Theodism and most other forms of Asatru/Heathenry is the belief in \\"Sacral Kingship\\", i.e. that men are directly connected to the Gods through the appointment of a sacral king who also fulfills the role of High Priest. One can see that Theodism is a different sort of religion than the more common individualistic/family-based forms of Heathenry which often have social structures which are loosely based on the old Icelandic commonwealth.The book describes Heathen notions of \\"good\\" and \\"evil\\" in a fairly standard way. Nothing new here.Other terms which are common in Heathenry are explained, e.g. frith, orlog, wyrd, wigh!t. There are detailed descriptions of the blot and the symbel.It also spends a fair bit of time detailing the workings of the Theodish Leode (essentially a Kindred in more typical Asatru terminology)There is an interesting discussion of why so many people in our society are chronically alienated, \\"sleepwalking\\" through life, lost, and powerless, and how Theodish society counters that by providing power and significance.A glossary of potentially unfamiliar terms is provided. Garman Lord also includes a well thought out reading list.The book is fascinating. It has given me some things to ponder. I'll definitely re-read it."},{"Title":"The Way of the Heathen: A Handbook of Greater Theodism","review":"Way of the Heathen is an excellently written instruction manual of Theodish Belief. Garman Lord takes great pains to explain step by step how to be an Heathen. Everything you need to know down to the smallest detail is in this book. There are explicit explanations of everything. Plus, he encourages contact if there are any more questions that may arise in your introduction to Germanic Heathenry.It helps take the mystique of the word Heathen and explains exactly what that means.This book is an excellent start to anyone wanting to start his pagan/heathen lifestyle with honour and ethics."},{"Title":"The Way of the Heathen: A Handbook of Greater Theodism","review":"This book is a wonderful read. It challenges popularly held notions of community outside and *inside* heathenism today. I am also impressed with the Theodish reconstruction of the vertical relationships of the Anglo-Saxons, which stand in some degree of contrast with the family relation focus of the Icelanders. Although I do not completely agree with all of his assertions, I highly recommend Garman Lord's ideas for thought and consideration.

He explores in-depth not only topics specific to The&oacute;dish Belief such as sacral kingship and the role of the Luck of the Folk, but also more general topics such as the role of Heathenry in today's modern society. Garman Lord's style is direct and to the point, and the many words likely to be unfamiliar to the reader are defined in an extensive glossary. Definitely worthy to stand beside Thorsson's &quot;A Book of Troth&quot;, Chisholm's &quot;Tru Hearth&quot;, and Gundarsson's &quot;Teutonic Religion&quot;.

In Heathenry, one's religion is a part of one's being, not just that hour a week sitting in a pew, reacting to the ritual prayers and readings.For those seeking an answer to what is missing in their spirituality, &quot;The Way of the Heathen&quot; isn't necessarity The Answer, but it is an excellent start to finding one."},{"Title":"The Way of the Heathen: A Handbook of Greater Theodism","review":"\\"I hereby swear that, while I live, I shall never raise voice, hand or weapon against the Sacral Kingship of the Theodish Belief, excepting it be in self-defense, nor ever aid or abet any other who does so.

Along with a discussion of the Gods, a detailed glossary, and a suggested bibliography - This book is certainly well worth reading."},{"Title":"The Way of the Heathen: A Handbook of Greater Theodism","review":"I expected to find lengthy discussion of Anglo-saxon/Germanic lore, but that's not what this book is at all. It would have been more properly titled \\"Way of the Leode\\", a Leode being a heathen group (a Kindred in Asatru), since that's mainly ehat it's about. I'm not Theodish and the Asatru group I practice with is generally more left-leaning than I'm sure the author would approve of, but I still found lots of good information about running a group and why to be heathen.If you're used to other works on Asatru, you'll have to relearn most terms because they've been given Anglo-Saxon versions here. The glossary at the back came in very handy, although being in the back close to the back cover it was hard to flip through to find the words just because of the structure of the book. A minor complaint.\\"Way of the Heathen\\" consists mainly of two things, first is a discussion on how to run a Leode, and second is a critique on American culture explaining why Theodism is a good thing. There is virtually no discussion of Germanic history or mythology, in other words the lore, if you want heathen lore you should look elsewhere.As someone who has been trying to help run a group for the past year, I found this book very useful. He describes several disruptive influences in a group that I could definitely relate to but hadn't been able to pin down like he has, even some tendencies in myself that became clearer once I saw it on paper. He also gives some advice on how to deal with those issues for a stable group dynamic. Our group typically works very democratically, which is something he generally argues against, but I have seen the problems he talks about first-hand and even if I'm not taking his advice completely it helped me see where the problems are and gave me some ideas to find solutions.The other major portion of the text is a criticism of modern American culture, which I actually found to be mostly enlightening. There were some portions especially toward the end where I felt he was stretching, but on the whole I felt his assessment was pretty close to how I feel about it. Quite a bit of the book was dedicated to this though, probably a little too much. It seems that the purpose of the book is to give the basic structure of a group and then justify at length why you should start one, while deferring to other books to learn about the lore.There is one small section at the back describing each of the gods, but it was only a brief outline and poorly presented. The names are inconsistently given in Norse and Anglo-Saxon, which is confusing. For instance, it names Frea, which if you're used to Norse names sounds like the goddess Freyja, however in this case it's actually the god FreyR, and Freo is Freyja. That would be no problem if all of the names were Anglo-Saxon, but then it lists NjordR which is Norse, and Mimir also--which it notes in the description is Meomer in Anglo-Saxon! It should be reversed and instead giving the Anglo-Saxon name while noting the Norse name, given what Theodism is. I don't know why they list some Norse names and some Anglo-Saxon, I suspect they took a text originally written about the Norse gods and just converted some of the titles to Anglo-Saxon, but it will likely confuse newcomers. This section is the weakest in the book, and I would personally recommend skimming it quickly or even skipping it unless you already know who the gods are, in which case you wouldn't need it anyway.Some other reviewers have claimed that there is no historical evidence of sacral kingship, which is central to Theodish philosophy. However, every noble line traced their family tree back to one of the gods, that much is obvious to anyone who takes a few minutes to look it up. Whether it was exactly as Theodism treats it is impossible to know, but even a cursory scan of the lore and the relationships between thanes and their lords makes it clear that at least it's not completely bogus.On the whole I found the book valuable to me, since I already have a strong foundation in the lore and am in a situation where advice on group management is useful. That's not what I was expecting to get, however. I expected, given the title, to find a description of Greater Theodism, what it is and how it's different from other brands of heathenism like Asatru. What I found is that Theodism is basically the same with different terms, and if the section on the gods is any indication it also has a disconcertingly relaxed approach to the lore. I suspect the last is only half-true, because in other ways Theodism seems to more strictly adhere to ancient traditions than other groups are willing to, but given only this book to draw my conclusions I wouldn't have gathered that."},{"Title":"The Way of the Heathen: A Handbook of Greater Theodism","review":"If you are looking for a perspective of Heathenry that is outside of the old norse viewpoint and geared more towards the Anglo-Saxon viewpoint then this is what you need to read. It is not just an education of Anglo-Saxon pagan tribalism but delves deep into its philosophies. This book has made me take things into consideration that I have not ever really considered and has helped me open my eyes to things I was previously blind too. I experienced first hand what he meant by \\"going into the woods\\". It was a great read and I reccomend it to all Heathens; Asatru and Theodish alike."},{"Title":"The Way of the Heathen: A Handbook of Greater Theodism","review":"I bought this based on the multiple high review and was utterly disappointed in the text. This book reads like stereo instructions for setting up a conservative religious system of government based on the completely unsupported belief in a historical Sacral kingship (ruling based on having direct descent from the Gods). This text claims to be based on historical information but does not have a single foot note or end note nor does it have a bibliography. Major criticisms I have are the tendency to drift off of topic and to spend a huge portion of the book trash talking about \\"American Leftism\\" , modern paganism's liberal view on homosexuality and other topics that this text clearly should not be focusing on. The simple fact that less then 14 pages out of 228 on actual descriptions of the various Gods and spirits of the heathen pantheon. The rest of the book (that not spent on political ideas and historically unsupported systems nobility) is all about how to run a few rituals that you can easily find on the internet for free (more historically accurate as well). In general the whole book suffers a serious case of christian backlash syndrome and reading all the Sagas Eddas and such is just to hard disease.

Theodism, while Germanic in nature, gets lost in English tradition and speaks a different language when trying to express an ideal rooted in a separate culture. I am sure there are those who will find the Theodish expression something that speaks to them. I, on the other hand, do not. I struggled various Theodish expressions that speak of the same things found in Asatru (Icelandic), but yet come across speaking a different language. I respect Theodism as a part of the Heathen belief system, but find little in it that speaks to the fiber of my being as does the Icelandic expression of Asatru."},{"Title":"What Am I Doing Here","review":"Bruce Chatwin knew he was dying of &quot;a rare Chinese fungus&quot; - posthumously revealed to be AIDS - when he assembled this collection of highly personal stories and articles, most of which had already appeared in print. At first I found the book's seemingly random selection frustrating, but began to enjoy it once I stopped looking for a message. &quot;What Am I Doing Here?&quot; is no swan song. Its 1st-person narratives are snapshots from a creative life interrupted, as if in the middle of a question.More than Chatwin's other books this one is about personalities. He was a grand walker and a literary nomad, so region and landscape play a quintessential role throughout. But the travelogue is backdrop. Each of the book's 35 vignettes reveals an exchange between Chatwin and a personality he connected with. Some of them are famous - Andre Malraux, Werner Herzog, Diana Vreeland - while others, more obscure, get an affectionate introduction:&quot;Howard Hodgkin is an English painter whose brilliantly colored and basically autobiographical pictures, done both with bravura and with anxiety, fall into none of the accepted categories of modern art.&quot;Or: &quot;Madeleine Vionnet is an alert and mischevious old lady of ninety-six with eighty-six years of practical experience in the art of dressmaking.&quot;Or again: &quot;Maria Reiche is a tall, almost skeletal, German mathematician and geographer who has spent about half her seventy-two years in the Peruvian desert surveying the archaeological monument known as the 'Nazca lines'.&quot;In the end, the only common thread in &quot;What Am I Doing Here?&quot; is Chatwin himself, observing, interviewing, questioning. The writing varies from mundane to transcendent, with occasional slugs of the driest humor this side of a martini. While the overall tone of the conversations is warm and respectful, Chatwin could also be savagely contemptuous. Some of the stories are very dark. Others illuminate. Two essays, titled &quot;Andre Malraux&quot; and &quot;Ernst Junger: An Aesthete at War,&quot; integrate complex stretches of 20th-century European history under the umbrella of personality.Throughout, Chatwin has a flair for revealing big ideas through plain dialogue and casual encounters. &quot;What Am I Doing Here?&quot; never explicitly tackles its eponymous question. Instead, by chronicling the relationships that mattered to him, Chatwin shares a piece of the living investigation that was clearly his passion. I recommend this book (as well as the author's &quot;In Patagonia&quot; and &quot;The Songlines&quot;) to everyone interested in the human condition."},{"Title":"What Am I Doing Here","review":"I've always thought to myself that when I'm getting close to death and I look back on my life, there's one thing I'll want. At this point, I don't particularly care about money, or love, or having kids or anything like that. But when I die, I want to look back on what I did throughout life, and think: Holy cow. My life was so INTERESTING!When Bruce Chatwin died in '88, there is no doubt that he fulfilled that same goal. His life was undeniably fascinating, and this book is snippets of it. 35 stories, each concerning different people or places, and all of them are riveting.Chatwin covered an incredible amount of ground throughout his life, and the book gives one a minor snapshot of some of those places. It feels like someone were interviewing him about his life, and just asked the broad question: So, what were your favorite experiences?I lacked the necessary background in art history to fully appreciate a lot of his stories (he being an art connoisseur), but even with little to no knowledge of such things, Chatwin's book was fascinating; he makes you care about what he cares about, whether you did before or not.When I finished the book, I put it down and immediately wanted another one just like it. Undoubtedly Chatwin had more stories to tell, but the general public will have to be satisfied with his own self-selected highlights from a fascinating life.I really can't recommend this book highly enough, especially for people who like to travel, or particularly like art or history."},{"Title":"What Am I Doing Here","review":"This is Bruce Chatwin's dying opus. He edited the pieces in What Am I Doing Here (a quote from one of Rimbaud's letters, writing home from Egypt) whilst weak, fevered and dying from AIDS in 1988. It is the first and best of the collections of Chatwin's shorter writings, composed of articles written when writing for the Sunday Times Magazine in the early 1970s, other newspaper articles, Granta contributions and other miscellaneous pieces.This compendium, arguably more than any of his other travel books and novels, gives a good insight into the complex and fascinating life Chatwin lived, always in pursuit of the bizzare, the exotic, the beautiful and a good story. Chatwin's writings cover themes as dispirate as travel, art, politics, people and literature. Always discussed in a terse, erudite style that became his trademark. The breadth and depth of Chatwin's knowledge is incredible, thus these writings are not the most accessible. Some appreciation of art history, literature and anthropology for example is necessary to comprehend some of the more esoteric pieces in the collection.Readers who give Chatwin the time will be able to unravel a wealth of brilliantly illuminated stories. From personal tales about family members, meetings with fabulously well connected and artistic people - such as George Costakis the Soviet art collector and Madeline Vionnet the French dressmaker, descriptions of his travels to far flung places - Patagonia, Afghanistan, China, searching for yeti in the Himalayas - the list goes on, one never fails to marvel at the rich tapestry that comprised Chatwin's life. Certainly, he lived a life about as far from the mundane as it is possible to get.How did Chatwin manage to constantly encounter such fascinating and varied people and draw out their stories? Part of the reason lies in his connections from his days working as Sotheby's, another explanation lies in his innate charm that seduced men and women all over the world. Also it should be remembered that Chatwin was frequently liberal with the truth in order to tell a story that fitted with his own remarkable perception of the world and its inhabitants. At times he put the fictional process to work in odd instances - his biographical piece on the artist Howard Hodgkin for instance has been declared innacurate by Hodgkin himself, and this as explained in the bibliographical note was published as a 'portrait of the artist' to accompany the catalogue for the Tate Gallery exhibition 'Howard Hodgkin's Indian Leaves'! How did Chatwin get away with it? The truth will probably never fully out, but I would recommend Nicholas Shakespeare's excellent biography 'Bruce Chatwin' for readers interested in finding out more about Chatwin's life.As a final note, I agree with the opinion of Salman Rushdie that the four short pieces at the end of the book 'Tales of the Art World', written in the last year of Chatwin's life are among the best he ever wrote. Four final drops of genius that Chatwin left before departing this world."},{"Title":"What Am I Doing Here","review":"Whether its following the insufferable Kinski through the jungles of Ghana, tracing the Von Daniken lines through the deserts of Peru or climbing after the mythical Yeti in the Nepalese Himalaya, Bruce Chatwin takes you to the strangest places and introduces you to the oddest folks. In 'What Am I Doing Here,' his hodge-podge collection of stories, travelogues, and portraits, Chatwin once again shows his talent for bringing the odd, the exotic and the extreme to light. Where else could one learn about such unknowns as Soviet art collector, George Costakis or South African composer, Kenneth Volans? During his world-wide wanderings, Chatwin met with more than his share of eccentrics and rescued them from oblivion with the magic of his pen. While one often wonders why we should know about these places and characters, it is Chatwin's masterfully wrought prose and storytelling gifts that keep you reading on. While many pieces skirt the periphery of eccentricity and will only appeal to hardcore Chatwinophiles, his best work centers around the more well-known. His biographical sketches of Andr&eacute; Malraux and Ernst J&uuml;nger brim with sharp insights and intriguing facts. When it comes to giving you a taste of place, his river journey down the Volga does more in 20 pages then most travel writers achieve with 200. But his tour de force is his scathing and trenchant analysis of the demise of French Algeria in 'The Very Sad Story of Salah Bougrine.' Sad and savage at the same time, it explains the labyrinthian chaos of France's Vietnam better than any history book I've ever read.Like in all his works, the line between fact and fiction is near impossible to discern, but in the end, it doesn't really matter as Chatwin creates sublime pictures with his words. It's not surprising that this ex-Sotheby's employee and art-fanatic sought to recreate with his pen what others have done with the brush. Often deemed a master storyteller, Chatwin was even more the master of the vignette. Brilliantly colored worlds of exotic people and places all dashed onto the page with a tightly-controlled pen. The best of these leave you with a zesty aftertaste, full of inspiration and quirky knowledge, while the weaker---most of the so-called 'stories' of the collection---often leave you hanging for more, searching for a point.But maybe Chatwin wrote them with just that intention in mind: that there is no point, no underlying theme that might glue these disparate pieces into one congruent whole. Instead, one should revel in the chisled and stark sentences that hide much behind their austere exterior. Chatwin lures you in with his deceptively simple prose, then opens up a world full of rich imagery and insight.If you are looking for an armchair escape to faraway lands, or for encounters with strange figures, then take a chance on Chatwin and dive into a world where you too will soon ask, 'What Am I Doing Here?'"},{"Title":"What Am I Doing Here","review":"When Chatwin died, it seemed that he had barely begun a new chapter in his writing career.
