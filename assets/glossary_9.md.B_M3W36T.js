Commissioned by magazines such as Vanity Fair, Italian Vogue, French Vogue, Rolling Stone and GQ, her photographs instinctively draw out her subjects' qualities, capturing them in a unique, playful, and soulful way. Her subjects are never contrived or forced into situations that are not \\"them\\". Sirota's photographs are real and magical and are never over-stylized to fit into society's obsession with image and appropriated style. Guess Who?, Sirota's exciting debut book, is a tongue-in-cheek homage to the seemingly ubiquitous celebrity phenomenon. Sirota asked various celebrities, athletes and musicians to lend their images to benefit AIDS Project Los Angeles. The trick is that these celebrities are in disguise -- captured in a whimsical and spontaneous manner that renders them unrecognizable at first glance. The reader will be teased, challenged and surprised while looking at the photographs, trying to figure out who's who. For Guess Who? approximately 180 celebrities play along with Sirota and actually let go of their celebrity identity, creating a visual feast that resounds with wit and humor.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=tO46AQAAIAAJ&dq=Peggy+Sirota:+Guess+Who&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Grand Canary","description":"Destiny brings two lonely people together in this moving love story by A J Cronin, one of the master story-tellers of our time.

The steel magnate impressed upon the budding success writer the importance of studying the principles of wealth found in the lives of high achievers of all types. From Hill s study came the classics Think and Grow Rich and The Law of Success, which launched the field of motivational literature.

Here he recounts his surprisingly successful reign: how he cultivates the loyalty of the army and the common people to repair the damage caused by Caligula; his relations with the Jewish King Herod Agrippa; and his invasion of Britain. But the growing paranoia of absolute power and the infidelity of his promiscuous young wife Messalina mean that his good fortune will not last forever. In this second part of Robert Graves?s fictionalized autobiography, Claudius - wry, rueful, always inquisitive - brings to life some of the most scandalous and violent times in history.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=5PtpwEIDbCMC&dq=Claudius+the+God&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Tempered Hearts","description":"Rancher Craig Harris and veterinarian Tamera Collins clash from the moment they meet. Innocence is pitted against arrogance as tempers rise and passions ignite to form a love as pure as the finest gold, fresh from the crucible and as strong as steel. Thrown together amid tragedy and unsated passion, Tamera and Craig share a strong attraction that neither accepts as the first stages of love. Torn between desire and dislike, they must make peace with their pasts and God in order to open up to the love blossoming between them. It is a love that nothing can destroy when they come to understand that only when hearts are tempered, minds are opened and wills are softened can man discern the will of God for his life.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=hYfgDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Shakespeare, our contemporary","description":"Shakespeare, Our Contemporary is a provocative, original study of the major plays of Shakespeare.

Shakespeare, Our Contemporary has been translated into nineteen languages since it appeared in 1961, and readers all over the world have similarly found their responses to Shakespeare broadened and enriched.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ImklBgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Religious Authority in the Spanish Renaissance (The Johns Hopkins University Studies in Historical and Political Science)","description":"This in-depth study of religious tensions in early modern Spain offers a new and enlightening perspective on the era of the Inquisition. Traditionally, the Spanish Renaissance of the 15th and 16th centuries has been framed as an epic battle of opposites. The followers of Erasmus were in constant discord with conservative Catholics while the humanists were diametrically opposed to the scholastics. Historian Lu Ann Homza rejects this simplistic view. In Religious Authority in the Spanish Renaissance, she presents a subtler paradigm, recovering the profound nuances in Spanish intellectual and religious history. Through analyses of Inquisition trials, biblical translations, treatises on witchcraft and tracts on the episcopate and penance, Homza illuminates the intellectual autonomy and energy of Spain's ecclesiastics.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ZIDZDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Dances With Sheep: A K Chronicles Compendium","description":"Humorous comic strips about a variety of subjects.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=ExtQAAAAMAAJ&dq=Dances+With+Sheep:+A+K+Chronicles+Compendium&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Grandpa's Little One","description":"The follow-up to I Already Know I Love You celebrates the first smile, swim, and giggle that occur in a baby's first year of life as shared with and captured by a grandfather.

For most of the population hepatitis refers to a disease caused by viruses, and viral hepatitis is the major concern of this book. However many of the nonviral types also are mentioned. Every year, about 140,000 new cases of hepatitis A occur in the United States, and perhaps over a million around the world. Because some who are infected do not become ill, the statistics are perhaps ten times greater than the number recognized. Fortunately, this strain is not chronic (defined as disease that lasts longer than six months). Hepatitis B infects about 1,250,000 in the U.S. and about 350,000,000 worldwide. Hepatitis C, unique in many ways and virtually always chronic, has produced some 4,000,000 cases in the U.S. About 1.6 percent of the population has been infected at some time, and at least seventy-five percent in this group retain the live virus in their blood. A fourth virus, hepatitis D, is uncommon in the United States. Because viral hepatitis sometimes has serious acute and chronic consequences, reference to it often tends to raise unreasonable fears of death or disability. However, the majority who become infected suffer few complications or long-term effects. The infection rate has decreased dramatically in recent years. In comprehensible terms Understanding Hepatitis furnishes the reader with a better grasp of the disease. Featured in this book are a historical overview, a discussion of symptoms and treatment, and a report on current research. This information not only debunks fearful myths but also provides helpful particulars on how to avoid the risks for contracting hepatitis. James L. Achord, a professor emeritus at the University of Mississippi Medical Center, has published articles in such publications as Conn's Current Therapy, Gastroenterology and Hepatology: Pearls of Wisdom, and Clinical Medicine .","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=bhMo2RZ9LZkC&dq=Understanding+Hepatitis&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"50 True Tales of Terror","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=LOlCnwEACAAJ&dq=50+True+Tales+of+Terror&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Surfaces, Interfaces, and Colloids: Principles and Applications, 2nd Edition","description":"From the reviews of the First Edition: \\"The book has admirably met its stated goal.

P. Blavatsky, Vol. 2 (1879-1880)","description":"Over the last several years, the scholarly interest in New Religious Movements has grown exponentially. The general public, however, tends to hear about New Religious Movements only when there has been a tragedy, such as the burning of the Branch Davidians' compound in Waco or the Heaven'sGate suicide. The press then lavishes attention on these groups, writing melodramatic stories that play up the oddness of their beliefs and behaviors. This volume offers a scholarly, dispassionate look at those groups that have generated the most controversy. The groups covered are: The FamilyUnification Church People's Temple Branch Davidians ISKCON (Hare Krishnas) Osho Rajneesh Soka Gakkai Aum Shunrikyo Falun Gong Aumism Scientology Theosophy Order of the Solar Temple Movement of Spiritual Inner Awareness Heaven's Gate Raelians White Racist Religions Satanism Each essay provides notonly an overview of the history and beliefs of each organization or movement, but also analysis that makes an original contribution to the field.

Then you'll love this account of the Centurion's circumnavigation of the globe, one of the greatest accomplishments in the history of maritime exploration and naval warfare. In 1740, George Anson and his fleet set off to harass Spanish commerce in the Pacific and attack towns on the coasts of Chile and Peru. Four years later, over half the men had died and of the seven ships which left Portsmouth only the Centurion had completed its objective of attacking Spanish possessions around the globe. Although this journey came at the cost of numerous lives and ships, the Centurion had succeeded in capturing the biggest prize of all time, the Acapulco galleon. Captain Philip Saumarez kept a daily record of the voyage around the world in his four log books, which along with a wealth of letters and documents give brilliant insight into life aboard these ships. Leo Heaps has compiled and edited these manuscripts to provide a complete chronicle of the expedition which saw men decimated by scurvy, mutinies among marooned sailors, ships battered by mountainous waves around Cape Horn and eventual glory in the capture of the gold-laden Nuestra Se?ora de la Covadonga. Log of the Centurion is a unique account of a daring maritime expedition across the high seas of the globe in the mid-eighteenth century. \\"It is a tribute to her officers that she not only captured the greatest prize at sea, but that she returned at all.\\" Christopher Lloyd, former Professor of History at the Royal Naval College, Greenwich \\"It is an absorbing tale ... The merit of this book lies in its realistic evocation of the mid-18th century. We have fine descriptions of China and the delicate negotiations conducted with the Manchus for supplies and repairs.

The most feared ship in Britain s West Africa Squadron, His Majesty s brig Black Joke was one of a handful of ships tasked with patrolling the western coast of Africa in an effort to end hundreds of years of global slave trading. Sailing after the spectacular fall of Napoleon in France, yet before the rise of Queen Victoria s England, Black Joke was first a slaving vessel itself, and one with a lightning-fast reputation; only a lucky capture in 1827 allowed it to be repurposed by the Royal Navy to catch its former compatriots. Over the next five years, the ship s diverse crew and dedicated commanders would capture more ships and liberate more enslaved people than any other in the Squadron. Now, author A.E. Rooks chronicles the adventures on this ship and its crew in a brilliant, lively narrative of the history of Britain s suppression efforts. As Britain slowly attempted to snuff out the transatlantic slave trade by way of treaty and negotiation, enforcing these policies fell to the Black Joke and those that sailed with it as they battled slavers, weather disasters, and interpersonal drama among captains and crew that reverberated across oceans. In this history of the daring feats of a single ship, the abolition of the international slave trade is revealed as an inexplicably extended exercise involving tense negotiations between many national powers, both colonizers and formerly colonized, that would stretch on for decades longer than it should have. Harrowing and heartbreaking, The Black Joke is a crucial and deeply compelling work of history, both as a reckoning with slavery and abolition and as a lesson about the power of political will or the lack thereof.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=CNpVEAAAQBAJ&dq=The+Black+Joke&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Creating Wire And Beaded Jewelry","description":"Teaches wirework and beading techniques and features projects suitable for beginning and intermediate jewelrymakers.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=nV1jXwAACAAJ&dq=Creating+Wire+And+Beaded+Jewelry&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Art of Arrow Cutting","description":" An agreeable blend of oriental fantasy and noir-ish sleuthing: a polished, well-organized debut, complemented by Dedman s nice light touch on the tiller  (Kirkus Reviews, starred review).

It is no ordinary key; it unlocks any door and leads those who seek it out of greed directly to Mage. The thought of power like that can drive mortals to extremes but the mortal world quickly becomes the least of Mage's problems. On the run and under constant attack by ninja assassins, Yakuza thugs, and the most fearsome and loathsome otherworldly creations Japanese mythology can muster, Mage's only hope is to conquer the key and its power.

And the nightmare will not end until she uncovers the roots of a monstrous obsession buried somewhere in the most frightening dark shadows of the past.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=_QsfxwEACAAJ&dq=Exit+Wounds+(Joanna+Brady+Mysteries,+Book+11)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Theory and Function of Mangoes","description":"Winner of the Intro Prize","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=te1aAAAAMAAJ&dq=The+Theory+and+Function+of+Mangoes&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"National Lampoon The 199th Birthday Book","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=xaymGAAACAAJ&dq=National+Lampoon+The+199th+Birthday+Book&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Subtleties of the Inimitable Mulla Nasrudin","description":"Here, the subtleties of the inimitable Mulla Nasrudin's anecdotes are parallelled with the workings of the mind and designed to amuse the tea-house audience.

Neihardt's interviews with the Lakota visionary, is one of the most successful popularizations of Native American religious thought. Using the original transcripts of the interviews, Rice points beyond Black Elk Speaks to an increased awareness of difference between Christianity and the Lakota spiritual tradition. To understand these differences Black Elk must be cleanly disentangled from Neihardt. Niehardt was a Christian poet with a typological belief in providential progress, culminating in the enlightenment of all peoples in universal love. Black Elk was more complex, at various times using the language of a Lakota traditionalist, a Catholic catechist, or a synthesis of both. Rice argues that Black Elk retained throughout his life the priorities of his original Lakota identity as healer, visionary, and warrior and held to one constant purpose--the transmission of the Lakota ways to the Lakota people. This indispensable study is the first to discuss thoroughly all the major Black Elk material and the various critical approaches to it. The result is a rich dialogue with Black Elk and Lakota culture that will be of value to literary critics, anthropologists, and other students of Native America culture\\"--Back cover.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=uRGsZx-JrrkC&dq=Black+Elk%27s+Story:+Distinguishing+Its+Lakota+Purpose&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Great Pursuit General John J Pershing's Punitive Expedition Across the Rio Grande to Destroy the Mexican Bandit Panch Villa","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=8RdOPgAACAAJ&dq=The+Great+Pursuit+General+John+J+Pershing%27s+Punitive+Expedition+Across+the+Rio+Grande+to+Destroy+the+Mexican+Bandit+Panch+Villa&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Amelina Carrett: Thibodeau, Louisiana 1870 (American Diaries)","description":"When thirteen-year-old Amelina saves the life of a young Yankee spy found injured near her Louisiana home in 1863, the orphaned girl creates a dangerous situation for herself and her uncle.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=hYFvYhLOXKMC&dq=Amelina+Carrett:+Thibodeau,+Louisiana+1870+(American+Diaries)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Waffles: From Morning to Midnight","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=P2ozAAAACAAJ&dq=Waffles:+From+Morning+to+Midnight&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Affairs of the Heart: A Wedding Record","description":"This Wedding Record book provides a forum for couples to showcase personal photos and reminiscences from the first date through the honeymoon, highlighted by the images of award-winning photographer Terry Winn.

As planetary anxieties about globalization, poverty and climate change grow, where does the international business community stand? Are they a barrier to change or an engine for it? One outcome of Rio was Changing Course, the hugely influential book by Swiss industrialist Stephan Schmidheiny, which argued that business needed to be part of the solution to global environmental degradation. Now, Schmidheiny has joined with fellow prime movers in the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD  the key business organization focusing on policy research and development in this crucial area), Chad Holliday, Chairman and CEO of DuPont; and Philip Watts, Chairman of Shell; to spell out the real business case for addressing sustainable development as a key strategic issue. The results are ground-breaking. For the first time, leading industrialists are arguing that not only is sustainable development good for business, the solving of environmental and social problems is essential for future growth. Drawing on a wealth of case studies and personal interviews from business leaders operating around the world, Walking the Talk clearly demonstrates that the vanguard who have operationalized leading-edge environmental and social initiatives are benefiting in a myriad of ways that benefit the bottom line  and the planet. The book argues that the time for rhetoric is over. The business of business has changed. Even more remarkably, the authors insist that a global partnership  between governments, business and civil society  is essential, if accelerating moves towards globalization are to maximize opportunities for all  especially the world's poor. As Chad Holliday recently stated in an address to the United Nations: \\"Given existing technology and products, for all six billion people on the planet to live like the average American, we would require the equivalent of three planet Earths to provide the material, create the energy and dispose of the waste.\\" Such an option is evidently not available and the book argues that far more eco-efficient and socially equitable modes of development must be pursued in order to allow poorer nations to raise their standards of living. The solution provided by Walking the Talk is to mobilize markets in favour of sustainability, leveraging the power of innovation and global markets for the benefits of everyone  not just the developed world. This means a further liberalization of the market-a move that would be condemned by anti-globalization protestors. Yet, as the authors argue, business cannot succeed in failing societies. When the global market fails poor countries, where most of the world's people live, it will also eventually fail business. Subsidies for rich countries' products and tariffs against poor countries' products do not constitute a \\"free\\" market, or one that best serves people or business. Similarly, governments cannot subsidize fossil fuels or water and expect businesses, or ordinary citizens, to use them efficiently. So, a new, fair and equitable market is needed. A market that can work for all. The authors therefore call on protestors against globalization to stop protesting against the market and instead to campaign instead against the perverse policies that impoverish people and their environment. Walking the Talk explores the opportunities and challenges inherent in eco-efficiency (producing more with less), corporate social responsibility, and a transparent, \\"wired\\" world where reputations can be irreversibly damaged  or enhanced  in real time. It also devotes a chapter to ways in which corporations can and must \\"learn to change\\". It examines the new partnerships needed among companies, governments, and civil society to produce real change, and the ways in which these alliances can work for all concerned. And it argues that consumer choice and consumer information should be encouraged as a positive force for sustainable development. Only what is valued is carefully used and so creating markets for environmental goods and services may be the best way to protect scarce resources. This is especially true in efforts to mitigate the effects of climate change, where business-like approaches, such as the development of carbon trading, offer workable solutions to policy-makers. Whether small, medium or large, all businesses must innovate and change to meet the social and environmental challenges of the coming years. Walking the Talk provides a broad set of proven roadmaps to success as well as real-life inspiration for business to embrace the real challenge  to build a global economy that works for all the world's people.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=pLo6DwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Popularity Plan (Sweet Dreams Series #2)","description":"Frannie's girlfriends create a plan to make her more popular, but she attracts the attention of everyone but the boy she was most interested in, Ronnie.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=G0XxAQAACAAJ&dq=The+Popularity+Plan+(Sweet+Dreams+Series&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Sugar Water: Hawaii's Plantation Ditches","description":"Hawaii's sugar industry enjoyed great success for most of the 20th century, and its influence was felt across a broad spectrum: economics, politics, the environment, and society. This success was made possible, in part, through the liberal use of Hawaii's natural resources. Chief among these was water, which was needed in enormous quantities to grow and process sugarcane. Between 1856 and 1920, sugar planters built miles of ditches, diverting water from almost every watershed in Hawaii. \\"Ditch\\" is a humble term for these great waterways. By 1920, ditches, tunnels, and flumes were diverting over 800 million gallons a day from streams and mountains to the canefields and their mills. Sugar Water chronicles the building of Hawaii's ditches, the men who conceived, engineered, and constructed them, and the sugar plantations and water companies that ran them. It explains how traditional Hawaiian water rights and practices were affected by Western ways and how sugar economics transformed Hawaii from an insular, agrarian, and debt-ridden society into one of the most cosmopolitan and prosperous in the Pacific.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=6lZO0HSgF7UC&dq=Sugar+Water:+Hawaii%27s+Plantation+Ditches&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Netscape Server Survival Guide","description":"This book is necessary for a system administrator implementing and managing Netscape Server.

With each new work, she attacks with a clear-eyed fierceness, a lack of sentimentality, and a deep understanding of the darkest depths of the human soul her eternal themes: the inextricable link between personal and communal history; the inescapable moral ambiguities of daily life; the political and racial tensions that persist in her homeland, South Africa. And in each new work is fresh evidence of her literary genius: in the sharpness of her psychological insights, the stark beauty of her language, the complexity of her characters, and the difficult choices with which they are faced. In No Time Like the Present, Gordimer trains her keen eye on Steve and Jabulile, an interracial couple living in a newly, tentatively, free South Africa. They have a daughter, Sindiswa; they move to the suburbs; Steve becomes a lecturer at a university; Jabulile trains to become a lawyer; there is another child, a boy this time. There is nothing so extraordinary about their lives, and yet, in telling their story and the stories of their friends and families, Gordimer manages to capture the tortured, fragmented essence of a nation struggling to define itself post-apartheid. The subject is contemporary, but Gordimer's treatment is, as ever, timeless. In No Time Like the Present, she shows herself once again a master novelist, at the height of her prodigious powers.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=sf4Lts84Ot8C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Culture Shock!

Through the journey of these essays, you can find simple solutions to everyday misconceptions and challenges. We all have had some flawed concepts presented to us about ourselves and about our impact on others. Here's a sort of Treasure Map out of depression and self-doubt.

The next step or turn is continually revealed, so long as one is ready and willing to take it. The thoughts and ideas expressed in these essays can help anyone out of their self-esteem deficit. Because they are simply stated, they are profound in their universal benefits. Try to look for similarities in your own heart, in your own experiences.

Op humoristische, verrassende en informatieve wijze vertelt Jordan Peterson ons waarom kinderen die aan het skateboarden zijn met rust gelaten moeten worden, welk verschrikkelijk noodlot mensen die te snel oordelen te wachten staat, en waarom je altijd een kat moet aaien als je er een tegenkomt. Peterson legt grote verbanden en distilleert daarbij uit alle kennis van de wereld 12 praktische en fundamentele leefregels. In 12 regels voor het leven maakt Jordan Peterson korte metten met de moderne clich s van wetenschap, geloof en de menselijke natuur, en tegelijkertijd transformeert en verrijkt hij de denkwijze van zijn lezers. Dr. Jordan B. Peterson (1962) is psycholoog, cultuurcriticus en hoogleraar psychologie aan de Universiteit van Toronto.

En natuurlijk laat King zijn licht schijnen over het belangrijkste wapen van elke schrijver: de pen die de auteur altijd in de aanslag moet hebben. Over leven en schrijven is een bron van inspiratie, voor zowel lezers als (aspirant-)schrijvers. Stephen King (1947) heeft meer dan tweehonderd verhalen op zijn naam staan, waaronder vijftig thriller- en fantasy-titels, alle wereldwijde bestsellers, waaronder Under the Dome (Gevangen), 22-11-1963, De Donkere Toren-reeks, Joyland,De Shining en Dr. Sleep.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=UGEtDgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"THE OUTER LANDS","description":"Did you know that horseshoe crabs have been around for 200 million years?

It contains a detailed discussion of modern analytic methods for the solution of fluid mechanics and heat and mass transfer problems, focusing on approximations based on scaling and asymptotic methods, beginning with the derivation of basic equations and boundary conditions and concluding with linear stability theory. Also covered are unidirectional flows, lubrication and thin-film theory, creeping flows, boundary layer theory, and convective heat and mass transport at high and low Reynolds numbers. The emphasis is on basic physics, scaling and nondimensionalization, and approximations that can be used to obtain solutions that are due either to geometric simplifications, or large or small values of dimensionless parameters. The author emphasizes setting up problems and extracting as much information as possible short of obtaining detailed solutions of differential equations. The book also focuses on the solutions of representative problems.

Some employ it as a synonym for democracy, others for the subordination of the legislature to a written constitution and its judicial guardians. It has been seen as obedience to the duly-recognised government, a form of governing through formal and general rule-like laws and the rule of principle. Given this diversity of view, it is perhaps unsurprising that certain scholars have regarded the concept as no more than a self-congratulatory rhetorical device. This collection of eighteen key essays from jurists, political theorists and public law political scientists, aims to explore the role law plays in the political system. The introduction evaluates their arguments. The first eleven essays identify the standard features associated with the rule of law. These are held to derive less from any characteristics of law per se than from a style of legislating and judging that gives equal consideration to all citizens. The next seven essays then explore how different ways of separating and dispersing power contribute to this democratic style of rule by forcing politicians and judges alike to treat people as equals and regard none as above the law.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=_iMxDwAAQBAJ&dq=The+Separation&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Mesopotamia and the Bible: Comparative Explorations","description":"The study of Syro-Mesopotamian civilization has greatly advanced since the 1970s.

In uncertain, rapidly-changing times, adhocracic organizations scan the horizon for winning opportunities. Then, instead of questing after more analysis, they respond with agility by making smart, intuitive decisions. Combining decisive action with emotional conviction, future-facing firms seize the day.

I recommend this book to anyone interested in understanding the nature of reality and their place in it.   Deepak Chopra Unified Reality Theory describes how all reality evolves from an absolute existence. It also demonstrates that this absolute existence must have consciousness as an attribute that s intrinsic to its being. Thus, Unified Reality Theory shows that consciousness, rather than being a product of the evolution of physical reality, is itself the source of what we experience as physical reality, and that physical reality is itself but one aspect of an evolving universal consciousness. Unified Reality Theory shows that, most fundamentally, this absolute consciousness-existence evolves into reality by means of a single process: self-relation. That is, consciousness-existence becomes reality by forming relationships with itself, analogous in a very limited way to what happens to a rubber band that s twisted upon itself, i.e., it remains whole while differentiating into other forms. Thus, Unified Reality Theory demonstrates that reality is a state of existential self-relation. The idea that the universe consists of existence which has formed relationships with itself isn t new; Taoists have understood this idea for at least a couple of thousand years. What s new here is the presentation of this idea in the form of a detailed and defined structural model that correlates with the behavior of physical reality as described by science in general and physics in particular. Ultimately, Unified Reality Theory uses science and logic to make the case that God exists, as a pervasive and absolute consciousness that transcends the realities of space and time, and that we, as well as everything else, are that!","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=dYsyCwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Animal Lore and Disorder","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=42HaAQAACAAJ&dq=Animal+Lore+and+Disorder&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Fundamentals of Physics,Vol 1 (Chapters 1 - 20)","description":"Fundamentals of Physics, 10th Edition, Volume 1 contains Chapters 1 - 20.

There isn t much to it other than the creation of man and woman and the loss of paradise attributed to their disobedience in biting an apple from a forbidden tree. This book gives a detailed portrayal of the familiar story from the perspective of Adam. It tells of the relationship Adam had with God before and after Eve was created and before and after the fall as well. As a consequence to Adam s sin he is doomed to live many lives to witness the effect it has on mankind throughout history to the present day. Adam narrates significant events of history such as the fall of Satan, the first murder, the great flood and the origins of the Jewish, Christian and Muslim nations. Along the way he explains mysteries like creation, evolution, giants, dinosaurs, reincarnation and the spiritual laws that control the universe. As Adam tells his story he produces a scathing diatribe directed at organized religion with the passion only the one and only original man can muster.

The network economy presents itself in the transactions of electronic commerce, finance, business, and communications. The network economy is also a social condition of discontinuity, indefinite limits, and in-between spaces. In Cornucopia Limited, Richard Coyne uses the liminality of design its uneasy position between creativity and commerce to explore the network economy. He argues that design, with its open-ended and transgressive explorations, provides a new way to think about the world of commerce; design's inter-territorial precinct, its in-between condition, offers a way to frame the problems of the Internet economy for profit vs. for free, private vs. public, security vs. open access, defense vs. permeability. Design, says Coyne, has a natural affinity with the edge condition and the position between polar opposites. Edgy design starts with an idea, brings to mind its opposite, and then works with what emerges from the friction between the two. The designer of a Web portal, for example, might take on the problem of security by focusing on the limits of permeability. Design is edgy, and risky, argues Coyne, in the same way that breaches in network security are risky. In Cornucopia Limited he examines the threshold between conditions exemplified by the boundary between design and commerce. Coyne uses five metaphors of design to develop his argument: the household (in economics, historically opposed to the market), with its relationship to the street mediated by various portals; the machine, rampant and glitchy; the game, competitive but simulated; the gift, precursor to commerce; and the threshold. The threshold condition, Coyne says, is the site of edgy design and a portal into the new. The threshold, he argues, provides the most potent metaphor for understanding the liminal dwellers of the network economy.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=JvJTKEqeLz0C&dq=Cornucopia+Limited:+Design+and+Dissent+on+the+Internet&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Trace Element","description":"It is hard to imagine a more concise summary of the prodigious work and voluminous publications in this field...

Since then, there has been an explosion of interest in almost every aspect of research in environmental pollution. The aim of this new edition, however, remains the same i.e. to evaluate the global biological consequences of dispersal of trace elements, originally mined from localized limited deposits, in the environment. In treating the problems of metal contamination of the environment, the author considers the problems of environmental pollution involving metals and the problem of exhaustion of finite reserves of ores of metals, such as cadmium, copper, lead, mercury, nickel and zinc, as aspects of a single global problem. A broad picture is presented of the overall process of dispersal of trace elements in the environment and the biological consequences of this process are documented with the aid of an intensive list of references. The book will be invaluable as a definitive reference source covering this field of interest for a wide range of people (environmentalists and conservationists, those concerned with management of resources and waste disposal, and agricultural chemists and soil scientists.)","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=LzrUF3EYOlkC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Elements of Drama","description":"This introduction to drama explores the aims and techniques of the particular playwrights and their plays.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=bOnd4QuAJHgC&dq=The+Elements+of+Drama&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Death: The Time of Your Life","description":"Death incarnate, as defined by master storyteller Neil Gaiman (THE SANDMAN), is a genuinely likeable young girl with a fondness for ankhs who truly cares about people.

Neural networks is one of those areas where an initial burst of enthusiasm and optimism leads to an explosion of papers in the journals and many presentations at conferences but it is only in the last decade that significant theoretical work on stability, convergence and robustness for the use of neural networks in control systems has been tackled. George Rovithakis and Manolis Christodoulou have been interested in these theoretical problems and in the practical aspects of neural network applications to industrial problems. This very welcome addition to the Advances in Industrial Control series provides a succinct report of their research. The neural network model at the core of their work is the Recurrent High Order Neural Network (RHONN) and a complete theoretical and simulation development is presented. Different readers will find different aspects of the development of interest. The last chapter of the monograph discusses the problem of manufacturing or production process scheduling.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=83rkBwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Playing Joan: Actresses on the Challenge of Shaw's Saint Joan","description":"Interviews with 26 actresses who have played George Bernard Shaw's Saint Joan, including Eileen Atkins, Elisabeth Bergner, Judi Dench, Wendy Hiller, Barbara Jefford, Siobhan McKenna, Sarah Miles, Joan Plowright.

As her cornerstone, Koci uses Hans-Georg Gadamer's claim that there are two complementary paths towards understanding and knowledge: science and art. Thus, to be faithful to the creed of the great hermeneutist, Koci ventures into both topics, arguing that while science sets out historical-critical analysis of the promised land motif in the Hebrew Bible and its later receptions, art enriches the interpretation with its literary illustrations. This volume places particular focus on American contexts, since the concept of the promised land is so deeply intertwined with American religious-political mythologies, and with the art of John Steinbeck and Walter Brueggemann in particular. By discussing artistic interpretation in biblical hermeneutics, the context and reception of Genesis 15.7 and Exodus 3.8 in the Hebrew Bible and New Testament, and the history of the promised land motif and its interpretations, Koci argues that artistic receptions of biblical motifs are crucial for biblical scholarship in opening new hermeneutical and thematical horizons.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=4mw0EAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Tarzan of the Apes (Vol 1)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=dA53ibucUy0C&dq=Tarzan+of+the+Apes+(Vol+1)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Take What You Want (Harlequin Presents..., 126)","description":"One convenient download.

Marid Audran, an unmodified and fairly honest street hustler, lives in a decadent Arab ghetto, the Budayeen, and holds on tight to his cherished independence. Then, against his best instincts, he becomes involved in a series of inexplicable murders. Some seem like routine assassinations, carried out with an old-fashioned handgun by a man wearing a plug-in James Bond persona; others, involving whores, feature prolonged torture and horrible mutilations. Soon the problem comes to the attention of Budayeen godfather Friedlander Bey who makes Audran an offer he can t refuse. Nominated for the Nebula and Hugo awards, the highest honors in the genre, When Gravity Fails, which introduced the cyberpunk Budayeen Cycle, is a pioneering work the Denver Post called  superior science fiction  and Harlan Ellison described as  crazy as a spider on ice skates . . . plain old terrific.

Defying both civil authorities and the Mormon establishment in Salt Lake City, the renegade leaders of these Taliban-like theocracies are zealots who answer only to God; some 40,000 people still practice polygamy in these communities. At the core of Krakauer s book are brothers Ron and Dan Lafferty, who insist they received a commandment from God to kill a blameless woman and her baby girl. Beginning with a meticulously researched account of this appalling double murder, Krakauer constructs a multi-layered, bone-chilling narrative of messianic delusion, polygamy, savage violence, and unyielding faith. Along the way he uncovers a shadowy offshoot of America s fastest growing religion, and raises provocative questions about the nature of religious belief.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=0DQaTU7Opq0C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Simple Quilts that Look Like a Million Bucks","description":"Sew easy and simple blocks that turn into beautiful quilts almost by magic.

NAMED ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS OF THE YEAR BY THE WALL STREET JOURNAL When a desperate woman comes to Daniel Pitt seeking a lawyer for her boyfriend, Rob Adwell, Daniel is convinced of the young man s innocence. Adwell has been accused of murder and of setting a fire to conceal the body, but Daniel is sure that science can absolve him and Miriam fford Croft is the best scientist he knows. Miriam connects Daniel with her former teacher Sir Barnabas Saltram, an expert in arson, and together, they reveal Adwell s innocence by proving that an accidental fire caused the victim s death. But it s not long before Adwell is killed in the same fiery fashion. If these deaths are, in fact, murders, what essential clue could Daniel and Miriam have missed? As their investigation deepens, one of Saltram s former cases comes into question, and Miriam finds herself on the defensive. If the reasoning Saltram used in that case is proved false, several other cases will have to be re-tried, and Saltram s expert status not to mention Miriam s reputation will be ruined. Haunted by Saltram s shady tactics in and outside of the classroom, Miriam is desperate to figure out truths both past and present and protect herself in the face of Saltram s lies. What started as an accidental fire in Adwell s case seems to be linked to a larger plot for revenge, with victims accumulating in its wake, and Miriam and Daniel must uncover who or what is stoking these recurring flames before they, too, find themselves burned.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=lgOhDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Schooldays with Kipling","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=t_haAAAAMAAJ&dq=Schooldays+with+Kipling&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Best of Wedding Photojournalism: Techniques and Images from the Pros","description":"Get behind the images and see how award-winning wedding photojournalists capture the fleeting emotions and romance of the bride and groom's special day.

His promising early career, which left him marked for advancement, had run into the sand during the long years of peace after the Seven Years War (1756-1763). Indeed when Britain and France found themselves at war again in 1778 as a result of the latter's support for the American colonists, Rodney had exiled himself in France to escape his creditors. It was only due to he generosity of a French nobleman that he was able to return to England.The main emphasis of this work is on Rodney's final two years of active service as Commander-in-Chief of the Leeward Islands during the closing stages of the American War of Independence Of the 21 enemy ships of the line captured or destroyed by the Royal Navy during the whole of that War, Rodney accounted for 15. His years of glory culminated in the defeat of the Comte de Grasse's fleet at the Battle of the Saintes fought off Dominica on 12 April 1782, where he famously broke the French line.Despite his undoubted fighting qualities, Rodney was a hard superior and difficult subordinate. His aloof and autocratic character won him few friends and he was also accused of letting his desire for prize money cloud his professional judgment. But there is no question that his prowess inspired others , not least Nelson himself.For a better understanding of both this complex character and maritime history during the American War of Independence, Rodney and the Breaking of the Line can be strongly recommended.(First published as a hardback in 2006 by Pen & Sword Military)","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=6eLgDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Murderous Illusion","description":"Disputes the suicide verdict in the 1932 shooting death of director Paul Bern, and presents new evidence of a murder and cover-up","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=LIYdAQAAIAAJ&dq=The+Murderous+Illusion&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"New Practical Chinese Reader, Textbook Vol. 2 (English and Mandarin Chinese Edition)","description":"Dit e-book is een ePub3-bestand, dus geschikt voor tablets en de meeste e-readers met een kleurenscherm (niet geschikt voor zwart-wit e-readers).

Heydrich succumbed to his wounds on 4 June 1942. Two days later, Gestapo Captain Horst Kopkow s department at Reich National Security headquarters was given fresh orders. From 6 June 1942 until the end of the war, Kopkow was responsible for co-ordinating the fight against Soviet and British agents dropped in Germany or German-occupied territories.

These \\"blood diamonds\\" are smuggled out of West Africa and sold to legitimate diamond merchants in London, Antwerp, and New York, often with the complicity of the international diamond industry. Eventually, these very diamonds find their way into the rings and necklaces of brides and spouses the world over. Blood Diamonds is the gripping tale of how the diamond smuggling works, how the rebel war has effectively destroyed Sierra Leone and its people, and how the policies of the diamond industry - institutionalized in the 1880s by the De Beers cartel - have allowed it to happen. Award-winning journalist Greg Campbell traces the deadly trail of these diamonds, many of which are brought to the world market by fanatical enemies. These repercussions of diamond smuggling are felt far beyond the borders of the poor and war-ridden country of Sierra Leone, and the consequences of overlooking this African tragedy are both shockingly deadly and unquestionably global. Updated with a new epilogue.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=WZJVDgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Best of Damon Runyon","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=JFZLPwAACAAJ&dq=The+Best+of+Damon+Runyon&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Stations of the Nativity: Meditations on the Incarnation of Christ","description":"Illustrated devotions to enrich your understanding of the Nativity narratives. includes readings and prayers to help individuals and groups walk the Stations of the Nativity.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=ah0aa64ex28C&dq=Stations+of+the+Nativity:+Meditations+on+the+Incarnation+of+Christ&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Devil Incarnate: A Depraved Mercenary's Lifelong Swathe of Destruction","description":"Athol Visser, or 'Ivan the Terrible', is a ruthless torture technician who has maimed and murdered his way around the globe. He killed his first victim at 16, his last at 60, and, in between, has been a mercenary, drug smuggler, gun runner and spy. In his own words, Visser takes us on a chilling journey through his memory bank of horrors and gives his account of one of the most high-profile assassinations of the 1980s, that of the Swedish prime minister Olof Palme. Visser's chaotic instincts led him from one deadly right-wing organisation to the next, before he rose to the highest ranks of the CCB, South Africa's foreign assassination unit. He was posted to London, where he drew up his plans to eliminate key opponents of apartheid. Devil Incarnate is the disturbing story of a degenerate, evil man who killed for pleasure and then adopted it as a profession. In the end, now ravaged by Aids, he has taken it upon himself to find out the reasons behind his unforgivable actions.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=NcECL_oNT8wC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Historic Naval Aircraft: The Best of \\"Naval History\\" Magazine","description":"From history s earliest days men have gone down to sea on logs, then boats, and, subsequently, ships.

Wood draws on a range of unusual sources--from art and legal codes to chronicles and lives of saints--to present a new picture of medieval people and their concerns. Focusing on topics often neglected by other historians, he includes lively discussions of royal adultery scandals, child-kings and the problems they posed, and earlier people and crises that helped to shape the culture of sex and sainthood that was profoundly that of the Middle Ages. In so doing, he clarifies the historical contributions of Richard and Joan, and sheds new light on the political, social, and religious forces that shaped medieval government and made France and England such widely different countries.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=tplzx-OCEicC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Second Best Bed: Shakespeare's Will in a New Light (Contributions to the Study of World Literature)","description":"At the heart of coloniality and postcoloniality is the idea of empire.

After a resounding electoral triumph in 1906, the Liberals formed the government of the most powerful nation on earth, yet within a few years the House of Lords lost its absolute veto over legislation, the Home Rule crisis brought Ireland to the brink of civil war and led to an army mutiny, the campaign for woman's suffrage created widespread civil disorder and discredited the legal and penal systems, and an unprecedented wave of strikes swept the land. This is a classic account, first published in 1935, of the dramatic upheaval and political change that overwhelmed England in the period 1910-1914. Few books of history retain their relevance and vitality after more than sixty years. The Strange Death of Liberal England is one of the most important books of the English past, a prime example that history can be abiding literature. As a portrait of England enmeshed in the turbulence of new movements, which often led to violence against the pieties of Liberal England until it was overwhelmed by the greatest violence of all, World War I this extraordinary book has continued to exert a powerful influence on the way historians have observed early twentieth-century England.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=8HtnzzqrTOsC&dq=The+Strange+Death+of+Liberal+England:+1910-1914&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Bamboo Rod Restoration Handbook","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=3TXzPAAACAAJ&dq=Bamboo+Rod+Restoration+Handbook&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Hope in Barth's Eschatology-Interrogations and transformations beyond tragedy (Ashgate New Critical Thinking In Theology & Biblical Studies)","description":"Hope in Barth's Eschatology presents a critical investigation and survey of Karl Barth's writings, particularly his Church Dogmatics IV.3, in order to locate the character and nature of 'hope' within Barth's eschatology.

The 23 year old Austrian Emperor fell in love with the fine featured, long limbed, dark haired beauty Elizabeth instead, married her and loved her until her death in 1898 when she was assassinated by the Italian anarchist Luccheni. Elizabeth, though, was a ?modern? woman at a time when that notion was unheard of. Her love for sport, gymnastics, dangerous riding, sailing, poetry and all things Greek were not catered for by Habsburg family life. Her fairy tale romance went disastrously wrong quite rapidly and she fled from her husband and their four children and the confines of her duties as an Empress. For 35 years she went from one spa to the next; suffered the loss of her son Rudolph (who was found dead at Mayerling next to the body of his mistress) and suffered bouts of ill health. But her restless search for freedom became as legendary as her beauty. In this celebrated biography, Joan Haslip provides the answer to the enigma of Elizabeth?s flight from reality.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=jQh2K9jWdU8C&dq=The+Lonely+Empress&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Anatomy of a Dictatorship: Inside the GDR, 1949-1989","description":"Anatomy of a Dictatorship analyses the emergence in the 1980s of oppositional cultures in the communist German Democratic Republic.

Glomerulonephritis has multiple subtypes, each with different physiopathologies, clinical presentations, and management requirements, which makes treatment difficult. As a complex set of diseases, the choice of symptomatic and specific treatment is critical to ameliorating the relentless course of glomerulonephritis. Focusing on all aspects of primary glomerulonephritis, from their epidemiologies and classification, to their pathogenesis and treatment, this third edition of Treatment of Primary Glomerulonephritis has been fully updated to include the latest research and evidence-based practice. With a strong emphasis on drugs used for both symptomatic and specific treatments, mechanisms of action, effectiveness, and potential toxicity are considered for therapeutic strategies in the different subtypes of primary glomerulonephritis. Each chapter follows a clear and logical format, allowing easy access to key information. Featuring over 20 full-colour histological images of different diseases to aid diagnosis, and with commentary from internationally recognised experts in the field, this new edition is an essential resource for all practising or academic clinical nephrologists.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=B8-aDwAAQBAJ&dq=Treatment+of+Primary+Glomerulonephritis&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"DISSECTING A DISCOVERY","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=qL6IzQEACAAJ&dq=DISSECTING+A+DISCOVERY&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Indian Summer (BBC Radio Collection)","description":"This book offers a detailed account of the life and career of William Armstrong, the most influential civil servant in Britain in the 1960s and 1970s, and one of the most powerful and significant Whitehall officials in the post-1945 period. He was at the centre of the British government policy-making machine for over 30 years  the very incarnation of the  permanent government  of the country. He was the indispensable figure at the right hand of successive Chancellors of the Exchequer, and a reforming Head of the Civil Service. His role and power was such that he was controversially dubbed  deputy prime minister  under Edward Heath. The book also casts light on wider institutional, political and historical issues around the working and reform of the civil service and the government machine, the policy-making process, and the experience in office of Labour and Conservative governments from the 1940s to the 1970s. ;;;;;;;;;;;","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=vCpADwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Fine Night for Tanks: The Road to Falaise","description":"Although Operation 'Totalize I' was arguably the finest feat of Allied armoured action in both the world wars, it is perhaps the least studied and publicised. Using eye-witness accounts from tank crews and infantry, Ken Tout reveals how on 7 August 1944 a combined Canadian and British force sent four armoured columns south of Caen to close the Falaise gap. Caen had been an objective of the British forces assaulting Sword Beach on D-Day. However, the German defences were strongest in this sector, and most of the German reinforcements sent to Normandy were committed to the defence of the city. Driving through the night, the British tanks reached their objectives behind German lines and linked up with their Canadian colleagues. The elite Wittman Troop counter-attacked with Tiger tanks, the most feared weapon of the Normandy campaign, only to be wiped out for minimal Allied loss. Operation Totalize I was a stunning success and sealed the fate of the German forces now encircled and trapped in the Falaise Pocket. Praise for Ken Tout 'Gripping and full of tales of extraordinary bravery' - Tank Journal Ken Tout served with the 1st Northamptonshire Yeomanry during the Second World War, fighting in Sherman tanks and seeing action in Operation 'Totalize I'.

Do you ever wonder, \\"If Christianity is supposed to be so great and Jesus' life was so perfect, why is my life so messed up?\\" It is only when we drink deeply from the life of Jesus--understanding the main events of his life and teachings--that we can then be rescued. These studies (along with \\"The Death of Jesus\\") invite us to see the behind-the-scenes truth of the main events of Jesus' life--so that his life can affect our lives...today...right where we live...in the midst of our weaknesses and failures. With maps and pictures, outlines, key scripture verses, discussion questions, plenty of room for note taking, and a personal five-day Bible study for each session, this participant's guide will help you get the most out of The Life of Jesus, both in your group and in applying what you learn to your life.

In fact, a full one-third of each study is centered on modern application of Jesus' life and teachings. Hosted by Margaret Feinberg, who introduces each session from Israel, and filmed in locations as diverse as the Rocky Mountains, the Arizona desert, downtown Chicago, and Little Rock, Arkansas, each volume consists of six fascinating sessions. Each session is taught by a different teacher and emphasizes three components: 1. Historical and cultural background 2. An engaging, close look at the biblical text and its meaning 3. Accurate, encouraging, and challenging applications of the Bible's message to life today Are you seeking more from your Bible study? With three hours of teaching per DVD by Bible professors who know how to communicate the world of the biblical text to today's world, \\"Deeper Connections\\" will provide the depth for which you have been looking. Through alternating sections of teaching and group discussion or individual reflection, this Bible Study series will allow you to make DEEPER CONNECTIONS with three main areas: 1. Historical Background: Jewish, Old Testament, historical, social, and cultural backgrounds, along with New Testament parallels, will be examined in order to bring out the full and deeper meaning of the biblical text. 2. Biblical Text: Bible professors who teach this subject matter in Bible colleges and seminaries will teach the biblical text. This is not a study filled only with entertaining stories.

When sixteen-year-old Gia discovers her father with another woman and reveals his betrayal to her family, he deserts them. They lose everything, plummeting from a comfortable middle-class existence into a neighborhood rife with crime, gangs, racial tension and drugs. It is there that the stage is set for Gia to come of age under the obsessive sexual attentions of a neighborhood gang leader. Suffering from the belief that she is guilty of having shattered her family and that she has become a loose woman, she is convinced that she is condemned to hell. Her sins are so great in her eyes that she can never confess them to a priest or anyone for that matter. And if you cant confess, you cant be forgiven. This is the story of Gias battle, triumph and salvation from hell -- without ever confessing a thing to a priest. Insecure and reeling from the departure of her husband, Gias mother is not prepared to raise her three children and support her mother. Unable to accept her leadership role, she emotionally abandons her family in favor of her new boyfriend. The children are left under the watchful eye of Nanny, her mother, who is nicknamed The Iron Lady. Nanny is a tough, no-nonsense woman with a rough-edged sense of humor. She is caught between protecting her grandchildren and risking her already fragile relationship with her daughter. Keenly aware that her family is dangerously close to self-destructing, she fears losing them to their personal demons: Tony to gangs, drugs and drinking; Mario, inwardly, to the solitary pursuit of running; and Gia to sexual awakening. The stakes are raised when Gia, the object of obsession for Nicky, a neighborhood Greek gang leader, unknowingly rebuffs him in favor of his younger brother. A ballistic Nicky rapes her, warning her that if she tells anyone, he will kill her and her family. Obsessed with controlling her, he takes over every facet of her life, from choosing what she wears, chauffeuring her to and from school, to physically and emotionally assaulting her if she doesnt do as he says. If Gia thought she was knocking on Hells door before, she is absolutely certain that Satan has answered it in the form of Nicky. A man of starkly contrasting dark and light personality traits, Nicky alternately abuses Gia and treats her like a princess. All the while he asserts, You will love me. Despite her initial fear and hatred of him, she slowly, and with much guilt and confusion, finds herself drawn to him both emotionally and physically. She struggles to understand how she can possibly love the devil unless shes evil too. This sets her on a treacherous pilgrimage of self-discovery. What she comes to realize is that in order to face Nicky, she has to face herself, even if she doesnt like what she sees.

Smith wrote this book almost a hundred years ago he felt the most pressing need of the worldwide church was true revival the kind birthed in desperate prayer and accompanied by deep conviction for sin, godly sorrow, and deep repentance, resulting in a living, victorious faith. If he were alive today he would surely conclude that the need has only become more acute with the passing years. The author relates how there came a time in his own ministry when he became painfully aware that his efforts were not producing spiritual results. His intense study of the New Testament and past revivals only deepened this conviction. The Word of God, which had proved to be a hammer, a fire and a sword in the hands of apostles and revivalists of bygone days, was powerless in his hands. But as he prayed and sought God in dead earnest for the outpouring of the Holy Spirit, things began to change. Souls came under conviction, repented of their sins, and were lastingly changed. The earlier chapters of the book contain Smith s heart-stirring messages on the need for authentic revival: how to prepare the way for the Spirit s moving, the tell-tale signs that the work is genuine, and the obstacles that can block up the channels of blessing. These chapters are laced with powerful quotations from revivalists and soul-winners of former times, such as David Brainerd, William Bramwell, John Wesley, Charles Finney, Evan Roberts and many others. The latter chapters detail Smith s own quest for the enduement of power, his soul-travail, and the spiritual fruit that followed. In his foreword to this book, Jonathan Goforth writes,  Mr. Smith s book, The Revival We Need, for its size is the most powerful plea for revival I have ever read. He has truly been led by the Spirit of God in preparing it. To his emphasis for the need of a Holy Spirit revival I can give the heartiest amen. What I saw of revival in Korea and in China is in fullest accord with the revival called for in this book.

The poetry collected here is a response to this call. Rooted firmly in the  fleeting world,  Sadoff s poems find epiphanies of meaning in unexpected and even unpleasant experiences and emotions. The poems in Barter delve deeply into the past, the personal past of regret, travel, love, divorce, and bereavement, as well as the global past of Beethoven, Vietnam, and the fall of communism. Each poem is offered up by Sadoff as a barter, something to be traded for a little more time, a little more understanding. The poems in Barter comment on the power of culture to interject itself into our desire for an idealized self, the way our inner and outer lives lack correspondence, harmony, and integration. They also talk about commerce, the trading of bodies, the way we as a nation  use  and exchange and appropriate -- and like Tolstoy s Ivan Ilyich, try to bargain with and evade the urgency of our time on earth. In the poem  Self-Portrait with a Critic,  Sadoff makes what could be a succinct statement of purpose:  And inside, let s not make it pretty, / let s save the off-rhyme and onomatopoeia / / for the concert hall, let s go to the wormy place / where the problematic stirs inside his head.

By 1920 the US Geological Survey had surveyed the river s main courses, but still needed accurate charts of the last stretches of deep canyons and white-water rapids, accessible only by boat.Rough-Water Man is the first detailed account of these mapping expeditions by the USGS the San Juan Canyon in 1921, the upper Green River in 1922, and the Grand Canyon in 1923. Illustrated throughout with period photographs, it is also the personal story of twenty-four-year-old Henry Elwyn Blake Jr., the only boatman to crew on each of the three trips, evolving from novice waterman to expert rapids runner. Drawing on Blake s diaries, as well as the writings of other USGS surveyors, Rough-Water Man conveys the danger and hardships of navigating these waters with heavy wooden boats and oars. Even today, in rubber pontoons, traversing these canyons is an awesome and exhilarating experience. When Blake and his companions surveyed it, the Colorado ran free and wild from Wyoming to the Sea of Cortez. Westwood gives us mile-by-mile and day-by-day accounts of running these rapids before their canyons were flooded and waters tamed, before the rivers had ever been charted.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=QmyVDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Children at Risk","description":"This paper put focus on families and children who have had contact to the social service department because of problems related children's well-being, health or development.

As a living legend among sports fans, Red Auerbach -- the fiery coach who led the Boston Celtics to nine NBA championships, eight of them consecutive -- has long been renowned for his formidable personality: brash, opinionated, and unfailingly accurate. As a coach, he had a great eye for talent, drafting such Hall of Famers as Bill Russell and Larry Bird, and managed to build a powerful franchise with an abiding legacy. Red never stood still along the sidelines and was never seen without his trademark cigar. Now in retirement, at age eighty-seven, he remains a lively part of the game, still consulted by coaches, players, and general managers. And his admirers continue to be legion. Not long ago a former president postponed a meeting with Bill Gates so as not to pass up the chance to talk with Red. For the past several years, John Feinstein has met regularly with Red Auerbach and his friends in a series of raucous, unforgettable sessions. Out of those smoke-and-laughter-filled rooms have emerged the stories of Red's life, from his childhood on the playgrounds of Brooklyn to his triumphs at the famed Boston Garden, where he coached for sixteen years. Just listen as Red colorfully recalls all the players and coaches he has worked with and played against: Bill Russell, Larry Bird, Bob Cousy, Wilt Chamberlain, Sam Jones, and Michael Jordan -- you name them, the basketball greats are all here. Red holds nothing back. In Let Me Tell You a Story, Red Auerbach's unique experiences in sports and John Feinstein's unparalleled skills as a storyteller combine to produce one of the most richly entertaining books ever written about the game of basketball.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=hfQ6AQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Fall: Stories from the Collection News from Lake Wobegon","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=kDpSPAAACAAJ&dq=Fall:+Stories+from+the+Collection+News+from+Lake+Wobegon&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Sunday Times Diy and Decorating","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=5w1yzgEACAAJ&dq=Sunday+Times+Diy+and+Decorating&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"San Diego Architecture from Mission to Modern: Guide to the Buildings, Planning, People, and Spaces That Shape the Region","description":"Pocket-sized guidebook to the eclectic architecture of San Diego County.

American monopolies have also seized massive political power and use it to maintain their obscene profits and CEO salaries while crushing small competitors. But Thom Hartmann, America's #1 progressive radio host, shows we've broken the control of behemoths like these before, and we can do it again. Hartmann takes us from the birth of America as a revolt against monopoly (remember the Boston Tea Party?), to the largely successful efforts of both Presidents Theodore and Franklin Roosevelt and other like-minded leaders to restrain corporations' monopolistic urges, to the massive changes in the rules of business starting during the  Reagan Revolution  that have brought us to the cancer stage of capitalism. He shows the damage monopolies have done to so many industries: agriculture, healthcare, the media, and more. Individuals have taken a hit as well: the average American family pays a $5,000 a year  monopoly tax  in the form of higher prices for everything from pharmaceuticals to airfare to household goods and food. But Hartmann also describes commonsense, historically rooted measures we can take such as revitalizing antitrust regulation, taxing great wealth, and getting money out of politics to pry control of our country from the tentacles of the monopolists.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=zgznDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Red Cloud and the Sioux Problem","description":"From the mid-1860s until the end of organized resistance on the Great Plains, Red Cloud, the noted Oglala Sioux, epitomized for many the Indian problem.

All the tales are a variety of detective story,  wrote Bowles of his first collection, The Delicate Prey and Other Stories (1950),  in which the reader is the detective; the mystery is the motivation for the characters  behavior.  In such stories as  A Distant Episode  and  How Many Midnights,  Bowles pushes human character beyond socially defined limits and maps a transformed (often horribly transformed) reality. A master of gothic terror and an acute and at times diabolically funny observer of manners and motives both American and Moroccan, Bowles confirmed his mastery of the short story in such volumes as A Hundred Camels in the Courtyard (1962), The Time of Friendship (1967), Things Gone and Things Still Here (1977), and Midnight Mass (1981), all included here along with a selection of his final stories. This volume also contains Up Above the World (1966), a frightening novella set in Latin America in which a trusting American couple are lured into an annihilating trap, and the informed and fascinating travel book Their Heads Are Green and Their Hands Are Blue (1963).

Of het nu om werk, relaties of opvoeding gaat: het is eng en moeilijk om je kwetsbaar op te stellen, maar het is nog veel moeilijker om het niet te doen en jezelf af te blijven vragen: wat als ik het wel had geprobeerd?

Kwetsbaarheid is een emotie waar bijna niemand zich prettig bij voelt. We associ?ren het met onzekerheid en risico s.

Adrift and depressed, Jamie takes refuge with his father, in whose house he turns up a 19th-century daguerreotype bearing the initials  J.M.  and depicting a man who, as it happens, is Jamie s spitting image. Could this be the only existing photograph of his purported ancestor, the legendarily dissolute Irish poet James Clarence Mangan? Obsessed by this strange resemblance and aided by an unexpected financial windfall Jamie heads to Ireland thinking at last to discover that elusive entity: himself. Instead, in the dreary coastal village of Drishane, he meets the Mangans: derelict Eileen, sullen Dinny, drunken (and shrunken) Conor, and the sexy and very available Kathleen. They know something, for sure something to do with Jamie, and something they don t want him to find out.

Fred Sager, a Ph.D. geologist assigned to the Hawaiian Volcano Observatory, travels to Bogota to assist the local scientists interpretation of the horrendous January 1999 earthquakes. In no time, he also finds himself attracted to a Chinese lady, also a geologist, and also there on temporary assignment. But is she really there to help her geology brethern, or does she lead a dual life? The following is a brief excerpt from the book: He looked at Adolph and asked, Did you understand any of that gobbledygook? Yes, it was quite well articulated, in fact. Adolph replied, his somber expression lighting up with a smile and I assumed he had decided to pay attention to what was being said after his last lapse of concentration. Even though Fred isnt a petroleum geologist, most of us learn the basics of that branch of the discipline in undergraduate school. Fred is good that way; he retains everything except what he had for breakfast, or where he put his car keys. Sounded like doubletalk to me, Tweedledum mumbled, so what exactly are you saying then, that Okradana geologists are mistaken about the location of a rather large deposit of oil? That theyre looking in the wrong spot? Thats a distinct possibility. I said. He failed to answer. Ill bet both of these yo-yos are attorneys, theyre sure as hell not geologists. How do we know youre not lying? Intentionally trying to throw us off the track? Causing us to delay operations, screwing us around? Tweedledum demanded, his voice becoming a bit hoarse and raspy now. You dont know. I replied, with a modicum of self-satisfaction in my intonation. Youll have to take my word for it. If youre lying, would you say youre lying? He asked. No, I wouldnt. If I were lying, I wouldnt tell you I was lying, that would defeat the purpose of lying in the first place. I said. Where should they be drilling? Where is this oil reserve? He asked. I dont know. I said. Does this Chinese gal know? He asked. Do I know if she knows? I replied. If she knows would you tell me? If she said I that could tell you, yes. I said. And if she said that you couldnt? He barked. Then I would say that I didnt know. As youre saying right now. Well, at least youre truthful. He replied, scratching his head and pacing nervously about in front of Adolphs desk. From the expression on Adolphs face, I could see that Tweedledums response had him baffled. I try. I said, again studying the quizzical look on Adolphs wrinkled face. Even when you lie you seem to be truthful. Tweedledum said, Wait a minute, were talking in circles here. Did you know that the ancient Egyptians didnt like pigs? I asked, trying one last time to break his spirit. Otherwise, they couldve invented ham. Dr. Sager, how about some straight answers to our questions? Feigning his frustrations now, trying to conceal the fact that he knew that I knew that he was playing a game he was supposed to better at than me.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=NXpHiH8NuIoC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Miracle and natural law in Graeco-Roman and early Christian thought","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=KLFMAwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Contraception Sourcebook","description":"Human kind has been searching for the ideal contraceptive since the beginning of time.

Despite their iconic status as representatives of the spiritual East, and although they have been the subject of a number of studies, systematic research with Bauls themselves has been neglected.

One of the richest contributions is a seminar on Nietzsche s Thus Spoke Zarathustra, taught in 1959 during Strauss s tenure at the University of Chicago. In the lectures, Strauss draws important parallels between Nietzsche s most important project and his own ongoing efforts to restore classical political philosophy. With Leo Strauss on Nietzsche s  Thus Spoke Zarathustra,  eminent Strauss scholar Richard L. Velkley presents Strauss s lectures on Zarathustra with superb annotations that bring context and clarity to the critical role played by Nietzsche in shaping Strauss s thought. In addition to the broad relationship between Nietzsche and political philosophy, Strauss adeptly guides readers through Heidegger s confrontations with Nietzsche, laying out Heidegger s critique of Nietzsche s  will to power  while also showing how Heidegger can be read as a foil for his own reading of Nietzsche. The lectures also shed light on the relationship between Heidegger and Strauss, as both philosophers saw Nietzsche as a central figure for understanding the crisis of philosophy and Western civilization. Strauss s reading of Nietzsche is one of the important yet little appreciated philosophical inquiries of the past century, both an original interpretation of Nietzsche s thought and a deep engagement with the core problems that modernity posed for political philosophy. It will be welcomed by anyone interested in the work of either philosopher.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=IkU6EAAAQBAJ&dq=Leo+Strauss+and+Nietzsche&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Numerical Computation in Science and Engineering","description":"Designed for non-expert students and researchers, this text provides an accessible introduction to scientific numerical computation and its applications. It assumes no prior knowledge beyond undergraduate calculus and elementary computer programming. Fundamental and practical issues are discussed in a unified manner with a generous, but not excessive, dose of numerical analysis. The topics are introduced on a need to know basis in order to concisely illustrate the practical implementation of a variety of algorithms and to demystify seemingly esoteric numerical methods. Algorithms that can be explained without too much elaboration and implemented within a few dozen lines of computer code are discussed in detail; those whose underlying theories require long, elaborate explanations are discussed at the level of first principles, and references for further information are given. The book uses schematic illustrations to demonstrate concepts and facilitate understanding by providing readers with a helpful interplay between ideas and visual images. Real-world examples, drawn from various branches of science and engineering, are presented in those cases where it would be difficult for readers to produce their own. The text is further enhanced by an accompanying library of FORTRAN programs, freely available on the World Wide Web at http: //www-ames.ucsd.edu/research/pozrikidis/ncse. Drawing a direct connection between numerical analysis and numerical computation, Numerical Computation in Science and Engineering serves as an ideal text for courses in numerical methods and as a supplement in any course involving numerical computation, including fluid mechanics, solid mechanics, control theory, and thermodynamics.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=k1nywAEACAAJ&dq=Numerical+Computation+in+Science+and+Engineering&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Flapping inertia for selected rotor blades (SuDoc NAS 1.15:104125)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Lost Atlantis","description":"Reproduction of the original: The Lost Atlantis by Daniel Wilson","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=eetRDwAAQBAJ&dq=Lost+Atlantis&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Aloha, Delores (Melanie Kroupa Books)","description":"Certain that they will win a trip to Hawaii, Dolores enters her cat Duncan in the Meow Munchies contest and goes all out preparing for their trip.

This time-frame is the first eighteen years of his life where Jeff truly was the product of his family's \\"old school\\" influence and the small town rural environment in which he was raised. In the 1950's and 60's, Sisters, Oregon was a small mill town of about 500 souls. Being situated in the very heart of Oregon and nestled at the foot of the Cascade Mountain Range, it offered a unique setting for a young lad to live a life of unfettered adventure, joy, and security. Jeff's story is the story of perhaps thousands of young American lads raised in a bygone era, one which probably will never be enjoyed again as our culture continues to change so drastically, leaving no room for little rascals to run free and wild. Author's Biography Jeff Smith was born on August 11th in the year 1952 in Redmond, Oregon. Jeff was the last of six children born to William Ray and Naomi Belle Smith. Though born in Redmond, Jeff was raised in the nearby town of Sisters. As Sisters was so small it had no hospital, so most babies in those days were born either in Redmond's newly built hospital or in neighboring Bend. Jeff was definitely a product of his familial upbringing and the small town rural environment in which he spent the first eighteen years of his adventurous life. Shortly after high school graduation in 1970 Jeff entered a missionary training center in Bend, Oregon in pursuit of his dream of being a minister of the Gospel of Jesus Christ in Brazil. That dream was interrupted by a two year tour of duty in the US Army, having been drafted number 34 in the end of the old lottery draft system.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=23SUweObE2oC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Good Wood Joints","description":"This is a practical reference for all people in woodworking.

Before television and the internet, there was radio; and much of what defined the makeup of these newer media was influenced by the way radio was broadcast to people and the way people listened to it.Emergency Broadcastingfocuses on key moments in the history of early radio in order to come to an understanding of the role voice played in radio to describe national crises, a fictional invasion from outer space, and general entertainment. Taking the Hindenburg disaster,The War of the Worldshoax, Franklin Roosevelt's Fireside Chats, and the serial mysteryThe Shadowas his focal points, Edward Miller illustrates how the radio, for the first time, instantly communicated to a mass audience, and how that communication where the voice counts more than the image is still at work today in television and the World Wide Web. Theoretically sophisticated, yet grounded in historical detail,Emergency Broadcastingoffers a unique examination of radio and at the same time develops a complex understanding of the media whose birth is owed to the innovations and disembodied power established by it.

Milleris Chair of the Department of Media Culture at The College of Staten Island/CUNY.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=C0xSAwAdi6MC&dq=Emergency+Broadcasting+and+1930s+American+Radio&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"System 370/390 Job Control Language (Wiley Professional Computing)","description":"As the authoritative guide to JCL, this work has been revised and updated to reflect the recent changes in this dynamic field.

Martin and Mark A. Nicholas gather emerging and leading voices in the study of Native American religion to reconsider the complex and often misunderstood history of Native peoples' engagement with Christianity and with Euro-American missionaries. Surveying mission encounters from contact through the mid-nineteenth century, the volume alters and enriches our understanding of both American Christianity and indigenous religion. The essays here explore a variety of postcontact identities, including indigenous Christians, \\"mission friendly\\" non-Christians, and ex-Christians, thereby exploring the shifting world of Native-white cultural and religious exchange. Rather than questioning the authenticity of Native Christian experiences, these scholars reveal how indigenous peoples negotiated change with regard to missions, missionaries, and Christianity. This collection challenges the pervasive stereotype of Native Americans as culturally static and ill-equipped to navigate the roiling currents associated with colonialism and missionization. The contributors are Emma Anderson, Joanna Brooks, Steven W. Hackel, Tracy Neal Leavelle, Daniel Mandell, Joel W. Martin, Michael D. McNally, Mark A. Nicholas, Michelene Pesantubbee, David J.

GORDON'S last work was the publishing of his \\"Reminiscences of the Civil War.\\" This volume, written in his vigorous style and broad, patriotic spirit, has been most favorably received and read all over the country. Since his death this memorial edition is brought out; and it is appropriate that an additional introduction should accompany it, somewhat in the shape of a biographical sketch. General John Brown Gordon was an all-round great man--a valiant and distinguished soldier, an eminent statesman, a great orator, an author of merit, and a public-spirited and useful citizen. He was born in Upson County, Georgia, February 6, 1832. His father was the Rev. Zachary Herndon Gordon. The family was of Scotch extraction, and its members fought in the Revolutionary War. He received his education at the university of his native State, and by profession was a lawyer. At the breaking out of the war, in 1861, he enlisted as a private soldier, and was elected captain of his company. His career was perhaps as brilliant as that of any officer in the Confederate army. In rapid succession he filled every grade--that of Major, Lieutenant-Colonel, Colonel, Brigadier-General, Major-General, and, near the end, was assigned to duty as Lieutenant-General (by authority of the Secretary of War), and while he never received the commission in regular form, he commanded, at the surrender at Appomattox, one half of the Army of Northern Virginia, under Robert E. Lee. At the close of the war he had earned the reputation of being perhaps the most conspicuous and personally valiant officer surviving, and the one generally regarded as most promising and competent for increased rank and larger command. His imposing and magnificent soldierly bearing, coupled with his splendid ringing voice and far-reaching oratory, made him the \\"White-plumed Knight of our Southland\\" and the \\"Chevalier Bayard of the Confederate Army.\\" He had the God-given talent of getting in front of his troops and, in a few magnetic appeals, inspiring them almost to madness, and being able to lead them into the jaws of death. This was notably done at Fredericksburg, and again on the 12th of May, at the battle of Spottsylvania Court House. He greatly distinguished himself on many bloody fields. I mention now, as most prominent, the battles of Seven Pines, Sharpsburg or Antietam, the Wilderness, Spottsylvania Court House, Cedar Creek, Petersburg, and Appomattox. At Sharpsburg he was wounded five times, but would not leave his troops till the last shot laid him helpless and insensible on the field. A scholarly professor of history in one of our Southern universities recently stated that in his study of the great war on both sides he had found but one prominent general who, when he was in command, or when he led a charge, had never been defeated or repulsed, and that general was John B. Gordon.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=HiYEAAAAMAAJ&dq=Reminiscences+of+the+Civil+War&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Don't Get Caught With Your Pantry Down","description":"The ultimate reference guide for personal and family preparedness.

What responsibilities do we owe to them, especially since we have the power and authority to make literal life-and-death decisions about them? What kinds of relationships should we have with our companion animals? And what might we learn from cats and dogs about the nature and limits of our own morality? The contributors write from a variety of philosophical perspectives, including utilitarianism, care ethics, feminist ethics, phenomenology, and the genealogy of ideas. The eighteen chapters are divided into two sections, to provide a general background to ethical debate about companion animals, followed by a focus on a number of crucial aspects of human relationships to companion animals. The first section discusses the nature of our relationships to companion animals, the foundations of our moral responsibilities to companion animals, what our relationships with companion animals teach us, and whether animals themselves can act ethically. The second part explores some specific ethical issues related to crucial aspects of companion animals' lives-breeding, reproduction, sterilization, cloning, adoption, feeding, training, working, sexual interactions, longevity, dying, and euthanasia.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=2hPGDQAAQBAJ&dq=Pets,+Animals&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The United States and Britain in prophecy","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=o3NqsuWzyY0C&dq=The+United+States+and+Britain+in+prophecy&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Free Money and Help for Women Entrepreneurs","description":"Two out of every three businesses are started by women and the Federal, State and Local Governments offer thousands of programs that give money, help and information for women who are starting or expanding their own business.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=krpbSgAACAAJ&dq=Free+Money+and+Help+for+Women+Entrepreneurs&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"MATRIX ALGEBRA FROM A STATISTICIAN'S PERSPECTIVE","description":"A knowledge of matrix algebra is a prerequisite for the study of much of modern statistics, especially the areas of linear statistical models and multivariate statistics.

A musical genius, an innovator, a peace activist--John Lennon was all these and more, and he continues to be revered years after his shocking murder in New York elevated him to mythic stature. Bob Gruen first photographed Lennon in 1971 and became his personal photographer and close friend shortly thereafter. Over the course of the next nine years, Gruen would photograph him extensively. This book assembles the most revealing of those images, taken during Lennon's treasured years in New York, together with Gruen's reflections on the circumstances surrounding the photos, including John's relationship with Yoko, how he dealt with fame, and his experiences with fatherhood. The result is a remarkable behind-the-scenes look at John Lennon as a performer, a legend, and a person.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=vJlhrgEACAAJ&dq=John+Lennon:+The+New+York+Years&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Fundamentals of prosperity;: What they are and whence they come,","description":"People have forgotten the gospel of service.

Based on the true story of Joe Brown and his young, court-appointed defense attorney, this book examines the illusion of a neutral or impartial jury, particularly in a capital murder trial of a young black man in the South. The attorney s insight into the lengthy appeals process causes one to question the ultimate sentence of society the death penalty and the fight for life that ensues once it has been mandated. In broad strokes, this legal thriller paints a picture of the U.S. criminal justice system. Upon closer inspection, individual brush strokes reveal the underlying themes of racial and socio-economic prejudice, the concept of a  neutral  jury in capital murder trials, and the  good old boy  brand of justice so prevalent, still, in law enforcement agencies, courtrooms and judges  chambers, not just in Florida, where this story takes place, but throughout the United States. Although this is a work of fiction, and some of the names and places have been changed, the details of this story closely reflect the original case history and trial circumstances.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=TC7V-dBURc4C&dq=The+Penalty&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Seminole and Miccosukee Tribes of Southern Florida, The (FL) (Images of America)","description":"First Published in 1996.

The once friendly land of Cornwall was already but a thin gray line, and was dropping fast as Temptress lurched over the waves sent tumbling down theChannel be fore an easterly breeze. It was my departure from England. Settling myself more comfortably at the kicking tiller I sighed and said out loud, Well, Im off once more, and will not turn back this time. Not that I was feeling particularly brave, nor had I yet gained confidence in the boat. Indeed, she had only become mine a few months previously, and this was her first season afloat for ten years. Perhaps it was a bit foolhardy setting off direct for Gibraltar, but it was comforting to know that the French port of Brest could be used as a bolt hole for the next two days if anything alarming hap pened. At least the boat had had a shakedown cruise up Channel from Dartmouth to the Solent and back to Falmouth and Helf ord before setting forth on the ocean. 11 12 SINGLE-HANDED PASSAGE Morale Lad not been improved by the failure of my first attempt to reach Gibraltar the previous winter in the 20-ton cutter Content. Setting forth from Penzance at the end of November, I had waltzed into a series of biting gales. Vari ous gear had carried away, including the metal tiller jaws. This had left me with no means of steering for two and a half days, until repairs could be effected, during which time the loose rudder had worked open a seam in the lower part of the transom and water had poured in. Preferring to risk losing the yacht on a lee shore rather than foundering at sea, course had been set to return to England in a gale of wind with bad visibility. After a total of eight days at sea, the iron bound coast had been picked up shockingly close, but I man aged to scramble into some sort of shelter and anchor near Newlyn, too exhausted to enter harbour, and with the boat rolling ominouslywith tons of water in the bilges. I had had just enough strength to pump out before collapsing on my bunk. Repairs had taken some time in Penzance, the worst place I have ever met for yacht work. The firm, for some obscure reason, in spite of the fact that I had Lloyds millions behind me, insisted on payment before the work could be started, and finally we parted the best of enemies. In January, a friend and I bounced round the Lizard at night, over a ter rific swell, with the rigging lit up by the eerie blue light of St. Elmos Fire...","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=VVWr3gu4aJ4C&dq=Single-handed+passage&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Moose (Our Wild World)","description":"Discusses the physical characteristics, habitat, behavior, and life cycle of the comical-looking moose, whose appearance hides strength, speed, and agility.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=aqKQAAAACAAJ&dq=Moose+(Our+Wild+World)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Diamond Slipper","description":"Dear Reader, What comes to mind when you think of a diamond slipper? Cinderella, perhaps? That's what Cordelia Brandenburg imagines when her godparents arrange a marriage for her with a man she's never met--a marriage that will take her to Versailles, far from the rigid confines of her childhood home. The betrothal gift is a charm bracelet with a tiny, glittering diamond slipper attached...as befits a journey into a fairy-tale future. But Cordelia--young, headstrong, and completely adorable--runs into trouble right away. Her escort to the wedding is the golden-eyed, sensual, teasing Viscount Leo Kierston. For Cordelia, it's love at first sight. Yet Leo seems to see only a spoiled child--perhaps it's the way she cheats at chess--and Cordelia is determined to show him the woman beneath. There is, however, no escaping her arranged marriage. She's devastated to discover that her new husband is an utterly loathsome tyrant who will stop at nothing to satisfy his twisted desires. My heart went out to Cordelia as she struggles courageously against a man determined to break her spirit. But her husband has a secret, one that will bring down the vengeance of Viscount Kierston and all who have reason to hate him. I hope you'll enjoy this love story of two of my very favorite characters. Warmest wishes, Jane Feather P.S. The charm bracelet makes its next appearance in The Silver Rose.

In his critical biography, Neil Powell looks at the careers of these two very divisive, and hugely talented writers: how they were formed by their upbringings, developed as writers and in turn how they affected literature, and each other. He examines how success (which is the title of one of Martin Amis's novels) affected their relationship, and themselves as writers (Kingsley: \\"Martin's spending a year abroad for tax purposes. 29, he is. Little shit.\\"). Through this we see what it has meant to be a man, and a writer, (and, most importantly, a comic writer) in Britain over the last sixty years, following Kinglsey from jazz-loving iconoclast to Thatcher-loving Tory and Martin from wild young man of letters to God knows what.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=2jtXKaUoNKEC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Ambassador Chronicles (Warhammer)","description":"Ex-general-turned-ambassador Kaspar von Velten confronts new perils, power struggles, and intrigues at the court of Tsarina Katarin of Kislev as war threatens in The Ambassador, and becomes caught up in a desperate race against time to find the evil agents of Chaos hidden within the city, before the dark Lord Archaon and the forces of Chaos annihilate the city, in Ursun's Teeth.

GPRS is based on GSM communications and complements existing services such as circuit switched cellular phone connections and the Short Message Service (SMS). GPRS represents the bridge between 2G and 3G mobile telecommunications and is commonly referred to as 2.5G. Implementation of GPRS requires modification of the existing GSM networks in that GSM is a circuit switched technology while GPRS is packet oriented. GPRS enables packet data (the same as is used by an Ethernet LAN, WAN or the Internet) to be sent to and from a mobile station - e.g. mobile phone, PDA or Laptop. WAP and SMS can also be sent using GPRS and individuals working with GPRS need to learn and understand how the mobile stations, the air interface, network architecture, protocol structures and signalling procedures must be modified. GPRS offers much higher data rates than GSM and can be combined with 3G technologies such as EDGE to give even higher bit-rates. It offers many benefits for customers and network operators: such as volume (rather then time) dependent billing and more efficient use of network resources. Due to the worldwide delay in implementing 3G solutions such as CDMA and UMTS the demand for GPRS is still growing. GPRS Networks: Offers detailed information ranging from standards to practical implementation Answers 'how' and 'why' rather than just simply re-stating GPRS specifications Provides comprehensive coverage in a single volume Essential reading for all telecommunications project managers, field engineers, technical staff in network operator and manufacturing organisations, GPRS application and service developers, Datacoms/IT engineers.

G. Jung's early work on active imagination. Joan Chodorow here offers a collection of Jung's writings on active imagination, gathered together for the first time. Jung developed this concept between the years 1913 and 1916, following his break with Freud. During this time, he was disoriented and experienced intense inner turmoil --he suffered from lethargy and fears, and his moods threatened to overwhelm him. Jung searched for a method to heal himself from within, and finally decided to engage with the impulses and images of his unconscious. It was through the rediscovery of the symbolic play of his childhood that Jung was able to reconnect with his creative spirit. In a 1925 seminar and again in his memoirs, he tells the remarkable story of his experiments during this time that led to his self-healing. Jung learned to develop an ongoing relationship with his lively creative spirit through the power of imagination and fantasies. He termed this therapeutic method \\"active imagination.\\" This method is based on the natural healing function of the imagination, and its many expressions. Chodorow clearly presents the texts, and sets them in the proper context. She also interweaves her discussion of Jung's writings and ideas with contributions from Jungian authors and artists.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=CYcVBgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Every Earthly Blessing: Rediscovering the Celtic Tradition","description":"This concise and clear introduction to Celtic spirituality provides an overview of all aspects of Celtic understandings.

As many as three thousand masters, apprentices, and laborers regularly worked in the city's enormous shipyards. This is the social history of the men and women who helped maintain not only the city's dominion over the sea but also its stability and peace. Drawing on a variety of documents that include nearly a thousand petitions from the shipbuilders to the Venetian governments as well as on parish records, inventories, and wills, Robert C. Davis offers a vivid and compelling account of these early modern workers. He explores their mentality and describes their private and public worlds (which in some ways, he argues, prefigured the factories and company towns of a later era). He uncovers the far-reaching social and cultural role played by women in this industrial community. He shows how the Venetian government formed its shipbuilders into a militia to maintain public order. And he describes the often colorful ways in which Venetians dealt with the tensions that role provoked including officially sanctioned community fistfights on the city's bridges. The recent decision by the Italian government to return the Venetian Arsenal to civilian control has sparked renewed interest in the subject among historians. Shipbuilders of the Venetian Arsenal offers new evidence on the ways in which large, state-run manufacturing operations furthered the industrialization process, as well as on the extent of workers' influence on the social dynamics of the early modern European city.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=7xwAEAAAQBAJ&dq=Shipbuilders+of+the+Venetian+Arsenal:+Workers+and+Workplace+in+the+Preindustrial+City+(The+Johns+Hopkins+University+Studies+in+Historical+and+Political+Science)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Maze of Shadows (Bionicle Adventures #6)","description":"A new quest will test the Toa Metru in ways they can't anticipate.

Johnson's vast influence on twentieth-century American music, combined with his mysterious death at the age of twenty-seven, has allowed speculation and myths to obscure the facts of his life. The most famous of these legends depicts a young Johnson meeting the Devil at a dusty Mississippi crossroads at midnight and selling his soul in exchange for prodigious guitar skills. In this volume, Barry Lee Pearson and Bill McCulloch examine the full range of writings about Johnson and sift fact from fiction. They compare conflicting accounts of Johnson's life, weighing them against interviews with blues musicians and others who knew the man. Through their extensive research Pearson and McCulloch uncover a life every bit as compelling as the fabrications and exaggerations that have sprung up around it. In examining Johnson's life and music, and the ways in which both have been reinvented and interpreted by other artists, critics, and fans, Robert Johnson: Lost and Found charts the broader cultural forces that have mediated the expression of African American artistic traditions.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=sCN9zUe7f-YC&dq=Robert+Johnson:+LOST+AND+FOUND+(Music+in+American+Life)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Penthouse Adult Magazine:September 1983","description":"Prologue: Naked ladies and ice cream bars -- Introduction: Smaller than life : adult video, pleasure, and control -- Panorams, motels, and pirates: the origins of adult video -- Adult video news: selling xxx without the sex -- The means of production: vivid video and femme productions -- Solidifying shame: community standards, regulation, and adult video -- Epilogue: one last thing : limousines and legacies","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=PaswDwAAQBAJ&dq=Penthouse+Adult+Magazine:September+1983&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Youth Soccer Coaching: A Complete Guide to Building a Successful Team","description":"This is a complete guide to coaching young soccer players from the early teens upwards.

This final battle to crush Satan and his minions will be accompanied by a series of cataclysmic natural and anthropogenic events (hunger, economic crisis, war, pandemics), and unprecedented natural disasters that may be attributed to climate change. There is a consensus that the earth is facing a dangerous future. The United Nations projects that almost half of humanity is at risk of dying. While the scientific community link this danger to climatic impacts, many Christians believe that the end of age is imminent. Cryptic details of the events surrounding the Second Coming of Christ and end of age carefully hidden in the Revelation, predict a series of catastrophic events that will cause the death of over half of the world s population.

With daring and inventive conceits, Adams looks at the ordinary people, places, and events in the context of the social conventions and systems of thought and belief of the thirteenth century turning the study of history into a kind of theater. As Raymond Carney discusses in his introduction, Adams' freeedom from the European traditions of study lends an exuberance and puckish wit to his writings.

Harrington has written an informative and insightful history of the Nisei (Second-generation Japanese Americans), working for the U.S. armed forces in the Pacific during World War II. This is no whitewashed narrative, as it exposes U.S. internment camps, prejudices, and the frustrations of patriotic Japanese-Americans who wanted to fight for their country, but were initially rebuffed. As the book relates, not all Nisei were in favor of fighting, and even those that did encountered another kind of prejudice at first, from Hawaiian-born Nisei who more than occasionally felt that continental Japanese-Americans just didn't measure up, linguistically-speaking. Like other children of immigrants, the Nisei were, to a large extent, caught between Japanese tradition and U.S. culture. The concept of honor, an essential element in Japanese-American family life, ended up serving U.S. military interests well. The author has done an outstanding job of uncovering names and telling little-known stories. Especially fascinating are the ones that describe the analytical acumen of Nisei translators.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=ToRAAAAAIAAJ&dq=Yankee+samurai:+The+secret+role+of+nisei+in+America%27s+Pacific+victory&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Mickey's Gourmet Cookbook: Most Popular Recipes From Walt Disney World & Disneyland","description":"Gathers recipes for appetizers, soups, breads, salads, eggs, seafood, poultry, meats, vegetables, desserts, and sauces served at Disneyland and Walt Disney World","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=gy8PAAAACAAJ&dq=Mickey%27s+Gourmet+Cookbook:+Most+Popular+Recipes+From+Walt+Disney+World&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Dead Heat (Thoroughbred Series #35)","description":"From No. 1 New York Times bestselling author Patricia Briggs comes the next thrilling Alpha and Omega novel - an extraordinary fantasy adventure set in the world of Mercy Thompson but with rules of its own . . .

The Dancing in the Desert Devotional Bible in the New Living Translation encourages readers to take an honest look at the people in the Bible. Chris Tiegreen, author of many popular devotionals for both men and women, has written 270 devotionals that explore the lives of people in the Bible and how they faced their own life's wilderness and found meaning, significance, and purpose with God.

At the cutting edge of the conflict were the elite fighting men of the Crusader and Egyptian armies  the Knights Templar and the Mamluks, respectively. The Templars were the most famous and formidable of the European Military Orders, while the Mamluks were a slave caste whose fighting prowess had elevated them to the point of holding real political power, threatening their Ayyubid masters who relied on them so desperately for military success. This book draws on the latest research to tell the story of three key engagements from the Fifth Crusade to the Seventh Crusade.

Organizational theories offer lenses for understanding why colleges and universities appear to make athletics decisions that do not seem to be in their interests. Exploring the forces structural, legal, social and cultural, and market external to the institution leads to an understanding of the environment s role in constraining campus leaders  choices. The challenge is how to reap educational, social, and economic benefits from sports programs without harming the institution's academic and moral integrity. This volume explores how relatively independent forces constrain the ability of institutional, athletics, and faculty leaders to limit perceived excesses in the growth of intercollegiate athletics programs on their campuses and nationally. Academic and athletic cultures; historical precedent; external organizations and constituencies; external laws and regulations; and markets for athletics-related materials, entertainment, student-atheletes, and professionals: all bring outside forces to bear on the college culture, leadership, and decision making. This monograph explores how the unintended interactions of these forces constrain campus leadership of intercollegiate athletics and consider the resulting policy and leadership implications. It examines the unique historical role of football and its associated commercialization and culture of masculinity as shaping the foundational structure and regulation of college sports. The monograph concludes with campus leadership strategies and recommendations. This is Volume 30, Issue 6 of the of the ASHE Higher Education Report series.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=__QkAQAAIAAJ&dq=Who+Calls+the+Shots+Sports+and+University+Leadership,+Culture,+and+Decision+Making:+ASHE+Higher+Education+Report,+Volume+30,+Number+5&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"CNE Netware 5 Test Yourself Practice Exams, Core 5 + 1","description":"This \\"Test Yourself\\" book guides the reader through all topics of Novell NetWare 5 CNE certification, including analyzing, designing, and integrating a NetWare 5 network, administering NetWare clients, advanced administration, and optimization through troubleshooting.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=FRWxAAAACAAJ&dq=CNE+Netware+5+Test+Yourself+Practice+Exams,+Core+5+++1&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"To His Coy Mistress and Other Poems (Dover Thrift Editions)","description":"Rich selection of works by the great metaphysical poet includes \\"The Definition of Love,\\" \\"The Garden,\\" \\"The Coronet,\\" \\"On a Drop of Dew,\\" \\"Upon Appleton House,\\" and many others.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ZDzBDAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Women of the Western Frontier in Fact, Fiction And Film","description":"This work provides factual accounts of women of the Old West in contrast to their depictions on film and in fiction.

Kirshner lays the groundwork for the study of what he calls monetary power by providing a taxonomy of the forms that such power can take and of the conditions under which it can have effect. He then establishes the actual existence of monetary power by showing how the taxonomy is supported by the historical record, including cases from nations from all over the globe and throughout the twentieth century. He uncovers how monetary power is affected by different monetary regimes, the sources of its success and failure, and the factors that lead states to turn to its use. Kirshner thus succeeds in developing a generalized framework for the analysis of an important yet neglected form of state power that is likely to be of increasing importance in the post-Cold War era. Although some distinguished scholars have touched on the issue of monetary power, there has been until now no standard text on the subject. Integrating security studies and international political economy, this book is a timely synthesis that will be important to the entire discipline of international relations.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=lkT_DwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Significance of Silence","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=ttthwgEACAAJ&dq=The+Significance+of+Silence&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Her Dream Come True (Silhouette Romance, 1399)","description":"IF WISHES WERE WEDDINGS  Her dreams had been simple when she left for Little Haven.

It flew at over three and a half times the speed of sound at 88,000 feet, an altitude that was at the very edge of space. It had an unrefuelled range of 3,500 miles and its two Pratt and Whitney J58 bypass turbojets generated 60,000 pounds of thrust and guzzled 8,000 gallons of fuel per hour. It was an awesome airplane in every respect. In 1964 America's President Johnson announced that Lockheed had developed an aircraft dedicated to strategic reconnaissance and so fast that no other aircraft could catch it. It took the world by storm. It was developed by the renowned Lockheed Skunk Works and employed many forms of new technology made necessary by the excesses of speed, altitude and temperature to which the aircraft was subjected. It served for many years during the Cold War until superseded by satellite technology. This is the perfect introductory book for the general reader, enthusiast and modeler alike wishing to find a succinct yet detailed introduction to the design and history of the Blackbird. Why was the aircraft conceived? What was it like to fly in combat? Who were the people who designed it and became famous for flying it? What were its virtues and vices? These and many more questions are answered here, plus a host of illustrations that show variations of color schemes used in different operational theatres of combat and rare photographs taken when the heat was on.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=BQoBAAAACAAJ&dq=SR-71+Blackbird+(Combat+Legends)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Free College and Training Money For Women","description":"Describes a variety of funding sources open to women for study, research, travel, career development, and training.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=a49YAAAAYAAJ&dq=Free+College+and+Training+Money+For+Women&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"An Instrument of Revival","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=dO6iAAAACAAJ&dq=An+Instrument+of+Revival&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Why get up in the morning: A guide to the meaning of life","description":"Your life purpose consists of the central motivating aims of your life-the reasons you get up in the morning.

It is drawn from a rare journal, one of many kept by Mathias Hovius from 1596 to 1620 while he was Archbishop of Mechelen (part of modern Belgium). Elegantly written, the book focuses not only on the life of Mathias Hovius but also on key events and characters of his time; it portrays  lived religion,  so that we see people from all sides getting involved in the constant negotiation of what it meant to be a good Catholic. Craig Harline and Eddy Put recreate the eventful life and times of Mathias Hovius a world in which other-believers were outright heretics, the nagging fevers of old age were the result of unbalanced bodily humors, and a corruptible earth rested motionless at the center of the universe while God sat exalted on a throne just beyond the fixed stars. The authors also tell the stories of monks, nuns, priests, millers, pilgrims, peasant women, saints, town and village councils, and ordinary parishioners; each story, fascinating in its own right, illustrates a major theme in the history of the Catholic Reformation. In the end Harline and Put have painted a picture teeming with life and energy.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=FWWCR1WKctwC&dq=A+Bishop%27s+Tale:+Mathias+Hovius+Among+His+Flock+in+Seventeenth-Century+Flanders&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Mature Mind (Twenty-First Printing)","description":"In all six of its volumes The Broadview Anthology of British Literature presents British literature in a truly distinctive light. Fully grounded in sound literary and historical scholarship, the anthology takes a fresh approach to many canonical authors, and includes a wide selection of work by lesser-known writers. The anthology also provides wide-ranging coverage of the worldwide connections of British literature, and it pays attention throughout to issues of race, gender, class, and sexual orientation. It includes comprehensive introductions to each period, providing in each case an overview of the historical and cultural as well as the literary background. It features accessible and engaging headnotes for all authors, extensive explanatory annotations, and an unparalleled number of illustrations and contextual materials. Innovative, authoritative and comprehensive, The Broadview Anthology of British Literature has established itself as a leader in the field. The full anthology comprises six bound volumes, together with an extensive website component; the latter has been edited, annotated, and designed according to the same high standards as the bound book component of the anthology, and is accessible by using the passcode obtained with the purchase of one or more of the bound volumes. For those seeking an even more streamlined anthology than the two-volume Concise Edition, The Broadview Anthology of British Literature is now available in a compact single-volume version. The edition features the same high quality of introductions, annotations, contextual materials, and illustrations found in the full anthology, and it complements an ample offering of canonical works with a vibrant selection of less-canonical pieces. The compact single-volume edition also includes a substantial website component, providing for much greater flexibility. An increasing number of works from the full six-volume anthology (or from its website component) are also being made available in stand-alone Broadview Anthology of British Literature editions that can be bundled with the anthology.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=Y7vxBwAAQBAJ&dq=The+Mature+Mind+(Twenty-First+Printing)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Indian Scout","description":"The fascinating history of the Indian Scout motorcycle and the Wall of Death, revised and updated for 2016.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=y0KIAwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Breastfeeding And HIV/Aids: The Research, the Politics, the Women's Responses","description":"The spread of the AIDS virus has introduced a new element into the formula-versus-breastfeeding controversy. Mothers, particularly those in developing nations, have been urged to breastfeed in order to better nourish their infants and protect them from disease or contaminants in the water used to prepare formula. Now, however, mothers and healthcare workers must consider the danger of transmitting AIDS via breastfeeding. When HIV-infected women nurse their children, they significantly increase the risk of transmitting the virus. The issue is further complicated in countries where the alternatives are not very promising and in cultures that stigmatize women for even undergoing AIDS testing. This informative analysis includes the development of research into HIV and breastfeeding, the medical and political questions surrounding the controversy, and options and solutions for women to consider in feeding their infants. Fully indexed, this book is an important contribution to the social and medical studies of one of the most tragic facets of the HIV/AIDS epidemic.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=-OVngsFCpPAC&dq=Breastfeeding+And+HIV/Aids:+The+Research,+the+Politics,+the+Women%27s+Responses&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"FIXED POINT THEORY","description":"Metric fixed point theory encompasses the branch of fixed point theory which metric conditions on the underlying space and/or on the mappings play a fundamental role. In some sense the theory is a far-reaching outgrowth of Banach's contraction mapping principle. A natural extension of the study of contractions is the limiting case when the Lipschitz constant is allowed to equal one. Such mappings are called nonexpansive. Nonexpansive mappings arise in a variety of natural ways, for example in the study of holomorphic mappings and hyperconvex metric spaces. Because most of the spaces studied in analysis share many algebraic and topological properties as well as metric properties, there is no clear line separating metric fixed point theory from the topological or set-theoretic branch of the theory. Also, because of its metric underpinnings, metric fixed point theory has provided the motivation for the study of many geometric properties of Banach spaces. The contents of this Handbook reflect all of these facts. The purpose of the Handbook is to provide a primary resource for anyone interested in fixed point theory with a metric flavor. The goal is to provide information for those wishing to find results that might apply to their own work and for those wishing to obtain a deeper understanding of the theory. The book should be of interest to a wide range of researchers in mathematical analysis as well as to those whose primary interest is the study of fixed point theory and the underlying spaces. The level of exposition is directed to a wide audience, including students and established researchers.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=hH3oCAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Time of Miracles (Writings from an Unbound Europe)","description":"Borislav Pekic spent six years in jail as a political prisoner, his only reading material the Bible.

A set of parables based on the miracles of the New Testament, the book rewrites the story of Jesus from the perspective of Judas (who is obsessed with the idea prophecy must be fulfilled) and from that of the individuals upon whom miracles were performed--without their consent and, in most cases, to their eventual dissatisfaction. Filled with humor and poignancy, The Time of Miracles is a trenchant commentary on the power of ideology in one's life, upon what it means to hold beliefs, and upon the nature of faith.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=_qBMhjZKI9AC&dq=The+Time+of+Miracles+(Writings+from+an+Unbound+Europe)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Double negative: A novel","description":"Race, politics, identity, photography: South African writer Ivan Vladislavic reminds us nothing is black and white.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=jQSRmgEACAAJ&dq=Double+negative:+A+novel&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"THE STRANGE CASE OF DR.

He's established a utopian community on an estate outside the town of Jeckyll's Glen, where the faithful wait, work, and pray for the world to end. Vernelia, Amy, and Catherine Charter are the three young townswomen whose father falls under the Reverend Fitcher's hypnotic sway. In their old house, where ghostly voices whisper from the walls, the girls are ruled by their stepmother, who is ruled in turn by the fiery preacher. Determined to spend Eternity as a married man, Fitcher casts his eye on Vernelia, and before much longer the two are wed. But living on the man's estate, separated from her family, Vern soon learns the extent of her husband's dark side. It's rumored that he's been married before, though what became of those wives she does not know. Perhaps the secret lies in the locked room at the very top of the house the single room that the Reverend Fitcher has forbidden to her. Inspired by the classic fairy tales \\"Bluebeard\\" and \\"The Fitcher Bird,\\" this dark fantasy is set in New York State's \\"Burned-Over District,\\" at its time of historic religious ferment. All three Charter sisters will play their part in the story of Fitcher's Utopia: a story of faith gone wrong, and evil countered by one brave, true soul.

It witnessed the emergence of large-scale corporate capitalism; the beginnings of American imperialism on a global stage; record-level immigration; a rapid expansion of cities; and colossal events and structures like world's fairs, amusement parks, department stores, and skyscrapers. Size began to play a key role in American identity. During this period, bigness signaled American progress. These Days of Large Things explores the centrality of size to American culture and national identity and the preoccupation with physical stature that pervaded American thought. Clarke examines the role that body size played in racial theory and the ways in which economic changes in the nation generated conflicting attitudes toward growth and bigness. Finally, Clarke investigates the relationship between stature and gender. These Days of Large Things brings together a remarkable range of cultural material including scientific studies, photographs, novels, cartoons, architecture, and film. As a general cultural and intellectual history of the period, this work will be of interest to students and scholars in American studies, U.S. history, American literature, and gender studies. Michael Tavel Clarke is Assistant Professor of English at the University of Calgary. Cover photograph: \\"New York from Its Pinnacles,\\" Alvin Langdon Coburn (1912).

A must-read for anyone puzzling over why Americans today love hulking SUVs, Mcmansions, and outsized masculine bodies.\\" ---Lois Banner, University of Southern California \\"From the Gilded Age through the Twenties, Clarke shows a nation-state obsessed with sheer size, ranging from the mammoth labor union to the 'Giant Incorporated Body' of the monopoly trust. These Days of Large Things links the towering Gibson Girl with the skyscraper, the pediatric regimen with stereotypes of the Jew. Spanning anthropology, medicine, architecture, business, and labor history, Clarke provides the full anatomy of imperial America and offers a model of cultural studies at its very best.\\" ---Cecelia Tichi, Vanderbilt University","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=55x1AAAAMAAJ&dq=Everything+You+Need+to+Know+about+America%27s+Jews+and+their+History&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Jump Off: 60 Days to a Hip-Hop Hard Body","description":"The Jump Off; 60 Days To A (Hip Hop) Hard Body, Kindle Edition Mega-Stars don't have hours a day to waste at a gym.

There are  outlaws  of Halfaday Creek live, a band of doughty prospectors ruled by their self-appointed czar, Black John Smith, one of many John Smiths that inhabit that notorious lair.Law and order, however, are nowhere so well maintained as on Halfaday Creek, and Black John dispenses justice with the wisdom of a Solomon and a heart as big as the biggest nugget ever found in the gold rush days. Murder is one of the minor hangable offenses there; skullduggery, connivin  and conspirin  are punished by the rope, after a miners  meeting passes an irrevocable sentence. Confidence men, city slickers, anyone who would take advantage of another man, woman or child, are dealt with sharply, and with a geniality that disarms evildoers unfamiliar with Black John s swift, efficient legal procedure.In this warmhearted and humorous chronicle of strange doings on Halfday, Corporal Downey of the Mounted and Black John and Old Cush punish some murderers, claim robbers and scoundrels who have made the mistake of assuming that the  outlaws  are not men of honor.

Dolan is a gifted historian whose study of U.S. Cold War strategy led him to the broader context of increased security measures and secrecy since World War II. One aspect of such government policies that has continued to hold the public's imagination for over half a century is the question of unidentified flying objects. UFOs and the National Security State is the first volume of a two-part detailed chronological narrative of the national security dimensions of the UFO phenomenon from 1941 to the present. Working from hundreds of declassified records and other primary and secondary sources, Dolan centers his investigation on the American military and intelligence communities, demonstrating that they take UFOs seriously indeed. Included in this volume are the activities of more than fifty military bases relating to UFOs, innumerable violations of sensitive airspace by unknown craft and analyses of the Roswell controversy, the CIA-sponsored Robertson Panel, and the Condon Committee Report. Dolan highlights the development of civilian anti-secrecy movements, which flourished in the 1950s and 1960s until the adoption of an official government policy and subsequent \\"closing of the door\\" during the Nixon administration.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=T5J7mAEACAAJ&dq=UFOs+and+the+National+Security+State:+An+Unclassified+History,+Volume+1:+1941-1973&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Brazil's second chance: En route toward the first world","description":"Brazil is currently in a critical phase of a decades-long transformation from a patrimonial society--based on the cultivation and export of sugar and coffee--to a modernized industrial and service economy with effective democratic governance. It is the world's fifth largest nation-state in area and population, and ranks eighth in total economic output. Since World War II, Brazil has been a leader in international trade governance and negotiation, playing an important part in development of the GATT and the WTO. Currently, the country is a major factor in negotiations toward a hemispherewide Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA). However, Brazil's political record in the past half century has been erratic and it has struggled with high inflation and balance-of-payment deficits. In this major new work, a former American ambassador to Brazil examines the social, political, and economic history of the country since the 1930s and discusses whether Brazil is now ready to assume a place as an important participant among First World nations.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=fxiMDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"British Policy and the Weimar Republic, 1918-1919","description":"This book explores the making of British policy toward Germany in the aftermath of its defeat in the Great War.

These people, and many of their contemporaries throughout the Nile Valley, embalmed the bodies of their dead and then placed over the faces portraits painted on wooden panels or linen. These paintings, today known as Fayum, or mummy, portraits, were created to preserve the memory of each individual. The Fayum portraits are by far the most important body of portraiture to have survived antiquity. Reproduced in this arresting book are some 180 of the finest of the more than 1,000 extant images - of men, women, and children, young and old, plain and beautiful - all of whom seem uncannily alive. A few of these faces have become familiar to scholars and museum-goers, but as a whole they have been neglected by art historians and will be new to most readers.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=Yg_rAAAAMAAJ&dq=Mysterious+Fayum+Portraits&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"How to Become a Better Rider (Farnam Horse Library)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=w0q0XwAACAAJ&dq=How+to+Become+a+Better+Rider+(Farnam+Horse+Library)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Silver Rose","description":"From Brittany s fog-shrouded forests to the elegant dark heart of Paris s royal court, one woman must challenge a country s destinyand her own dangerous fate.

Today, with more than 38,000 stores in one hundred countries and annual sales exceeding $16.6 billion, Fred DeLuca's SUBWAY is a success story with a message... START SMALL FINISH BIG Publishers Weekly Review: DeLuca was only 17 when he started what is now the Subway restaurant chain in 1965; he needed money to attend college and a friend offered to back him with $1,000 to start a sandwich shop in Bridgeport, Conn. That beginning led DeLuca to an enormously successful career: in addition to being president of the chain, he runs MILE, a nonprofit organization that offers loans to entrepreneurs. According to DeLuca, there are 15 essential principles for anyone starting a small business, some of which, DeLuca confesses, he learned the hard way (he had never made a submarine sandwich before opening day of his first shop). Among these pillars: Believe in Your People; Never Run Out of Money; Keep the Faith; and Profit or Perish. DeLuca uses his own business experience as well as that of other successful entrepreneursAe.g., the founders of Kinko's and Little Caesar'sAin addition to those of less well-known business people. Written in a conversational style, the advice isn't especially original or creative. However, would-be millionaires who are sitting at their kitchen table wondering if they should take that big step and start a business will find the book both instructive and inspirational. Agent, Bob Diforio. Library Journal DeLuca, co-founder in 1965 of SUBWAY Restaurants and founder in 1996 of the Micro Investment Lending Enterprise (MILE), a nonprofit organization making microloans to entrepreneurs/microentrepreneurs, has written this humorous, down-to-earth guide to success as a small business owner. Coauthor Hayes is a writer (Computer Architecture and Organization, 1998), public speaker, and business trainer. Each chapter describes one of DeLuca's 15 key lessons and is illustrated with a real-life case study. None of the people in these cases is a household name, but businesses such as Kinkos, Little Caesars, and SUBWAY are. DeLuca doesn't claim that his guides form a master plan for success, but he optimistically believes that anyone can become Bill Gates, Lillian Vernon, or Henry Lay and that his lessons will increase the chances. His book also promotes and supports MILE, and the last chapter and appendix are devoted to information about it and its programs. Recommended for most small business collections. Susan C.

Now in his second outing, Jack finds himself caught in the midst of a deadly struggle for control of Biloxi's waterfront. For his entire life, Casper Perinovich has shrimped the waters off Biloxi's Point Cadet.

Trying to avoid hindsight, and drawing on a wide range of literary texts, Ritchie Robertson offers a close examination of attempts to construct a Jewish identity suitable for an increasingly secular world. He examines both literary portrayals of Jews by Gentile writers - whether antisemitic, friendly, or ambivalent - and efforts to reinvent Jewish identities by the Jews themselves, in response to antisemitism culminating in Zionism. No other study by a single author deals with German-Jewish relations so comprehensively and over such a long period of literary history. Robertson's new work will prove stimulating for anyone interested in the modern Jewish experience, as well as for scholars and students of German fiction, prose, and political culture.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=OMepNRndhN4C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Read It!

In these areas wavelet-like algorithms replace the classical Fourier-type expansion of a function. This unique new book is an excellent introduction to the basic properties of wavelets, from background math to powerful applications. The authors provide elementary methods for constructing wavelets, and illustrate several new classes of wavelets. The text begins with a description of local sine and cosine bases that have been shown to be very effective in applications. Very little mathematical background is needed to follow this material. A complete treatment of band-limited wavelets follows. These are characterized by some elementary equations, allowing the authors to introduce many new wavelets. Next, the idea of multiresolution analysis (MRA) is developed, and the authors include simplified presentations of previous studies, particularly for compactly supported wavelets.Some of the topics treated include:Several bases generated by a single function via translations and dilationsMultiresolution analysis, compactly supported wavelets, and spline waveletsBand-limited waveletsUnconditionality of wavelet basesCharacterizations of many of the principal objects in the theory of wavelets, such as low-pass filters and scaling functionsThe authors also present the basic philosophy that all orthonormal wavelets are completely characterized by two simple equations, and that most properties and constructions of wavelets can be developed using these two equations. Material related to applications is provided, and constructions of splines wavelets are presented. Mathematicians, engineers, physicists, and anyone with a mathematical background will find this to be an important text for furthering their studies on wavelets.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=axoQyAEACAAJ&dq=A+First+Course+on+Wavelets+(Studies+in+Advanced+Mathematics)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Element Encyclopedia of the Psychic World (The Element Encyclopedia series)","description":"This is the definitive A-Z reference book on all things psychic, mysterious and paranormal - the marvels, secrets and mysteries of the visible and the invisible world.

But this isn't the story of the Mayflower Madam or Hollywood's Heidi Fleiss. This is not about the rich and powerful. It is a true story about an everyday prostitute. I've titled the story '12th Street Rita' because Rita was my 'street name' and 12th Street was where I worked. I have written the story in three parts. Part I, 'Journey to 12th Street' begins at age 11 when my parents died and my brother, sister and I were sent to live with abusive relatives. Part II, 'The Life' is about prostitution in Kansas City in the 60's and 70's. Part III, 'The Awakening' is just that, coming out of a dream world and facing reality. The story ends at age 26. Over the years, I'd thought about writing this story, but didn't have time. I was a single mother trying to make ends meet after my prostitution career ended. As the years went by, I married and acquired in-laws I worried about. I didn't want them to know about my past. Then the grandchildren came and I said I'd never write the story. Almost three years ago I had open-heart surgery. I almost died several times, but I survived when everyone had given up hope. At that time, I realized I wanted to tell my story, because it too is a story of survival. The book contains profanity, but I couldn't be true to the story without it. This is a fast-paced, hard-hitting story, not for children, and not for those offended by adult language or sex.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=KIzFwAEACAAJ&dq=12th+Street+Rita&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Fortunate Man the Story of a Country Doc","description":"In 1966 John Berger spent three months in the Forest of Dean shadowing an English country GP, John Sassall.

One grows to womanhood as the frail, manipulative ward of the handsome young earl of Harcourt. The other becomes an enchanting, street-smart urchin who earns her way as a traveling player on the streets of England and France. The two girls' paths might never again have crossed if Harcourt hadn't run into Miranda in the midst of an exuberant performance. The resemblance to his ward is unmistakable--uncanny, in fact...and an ambitious plot begins to take shape in Harcourt's mind. His ward, Maude, will commit herself to a convent rather than marry the love-struck king of France, who will soon be traveling to London to claim her. What if Miranda were to take Maude's place? Harcourt is confident that with the right training, the right clothes, and the right attitude, the lithe, carefree Miranda will captivate society--and the king.

The self-serving attitudes of priestly sects of Jews were taken up by the hierarchy of Catholic and other Christian Churches, which are responsible for the hostility toward Jews and political actions which led to two millenia of persecution, suffering, and millions of deaths. Although Jews could cope with ancient antisemitism, they were powerless in the face of theologically-driven Christian antisemitism, starting with the Gospels and Paul.

Into this dry region came the homesteaders from the Midwest and from Europe seeking free land. Known by the cattlemen as the \\"wool hat people\\" they swarmed west of the Missouri River after 1890, built their sod houses, plowed up the prairies, and planted their crops. Many of them failed because of drought and grasshoppers, or went back because of the struggle, the loneliness, the hard life. One of the thousands who moved to this dry frontier west of the Missouri was Grace Fairchild. She had grown up in Wisconsin, graduated from Platteville Normal with a teacher's certificate, and had gone to Parker, South Dakota (east of the Missouri) to teach school in 1898. There at Parker she married Shiloh Fairchild, a widower much older than she, and in 1902 the Fairchilds went west of the Missouri seeking a homestead. They took up a claim of 160 acres in the old Sioux Indian cession, not far from the present Philip. Married to a man not fitted to be a pioneer farmer, she took on increased responsibilities as the years went by, and finally separated from her husband. When she left the ranch, she owned 1440 acres of South Dakota land. This is the story of a strong woman who succeeded on a harsh frontier where failure was common. South Dakota State University recognized her in 1952 with the title of Eminent Homemaker and now her picture hangs in the Hall of Fame. Few books tell the story of a woman pioneer who was a mother, a manager, a creative force in the building of her part of the last frontier. This is Folk History told through the original notes of a Frontier Woman.\\"--BOOK COVER.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=4Q96AAAAMAAJ&dq=Frontier+woman%3B:+The+life+of+a+woman+homesteader+on+the+Dakota+frontier&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Inventing Masks: Agency and History in the Art of the Central Pende","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=Ir3GugEACAAJ&dq=Inventing+Masks:+Agency+and+History+in+the+Art+of+the+Central+Pende&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Human Neuropsychology","description":"Fundamentals of Human Neuropsychology continues to keep pace with its dynamic field.

Hard-working, peaceful Northfield, Minnesota, was an orderly yet busy mill-town in the heart of prosperous farm country. On a serene autumn Tuesday in 1876, local shopkeepers, farmers, and citizenry went about their normal routines, little realizing that the infamous and deadly James-Younger gang had designs on tiny Northfield. The experienced robbers planned to target the single bank, which held the hard-earned money of the townsfolk. Jesse and Frank James and the Younger brothers had never experienced defeat. During a wild gun battle that raged between the outlaws and the bankmen up and down the town s main street, two unarmed townsfolk were murdered. Northfield s angered populace fought back. The townspeople killed two members of the James-Younger gang and wounded several more. The remaining bandits fled but were pursued across southwestern Minnesota by a posse that gradually grew to more than a thousand men. In Last Hurrah of the James-Younger Gang, Robert Barr Smith debunks the James-Younger \\"Robin Hood\\" image and shows that the real heroes of the Northfield raid were the ordinary people--the bankers who protected their depositors at their own risk, the townspeople who pitched in to chase the gang from town, and the posse members who pursued and triumphed over the retreating remnants of the gang.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=ctA4Spm7JIwC&dq=Last+Hurrah+of+the+James-Younger+Gang&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Brave Little Seamstress","description":"This 'tongue-in-cheek' traditional tale may have been invented when belief in giants (and unicorns, omitted from this brief retelling) had begun to fade.

Paul Craddock returns to England after the Boer War to resume civilian life. His father has died, leaving Craddock heir to a scrap-metal business. But instead of continuing the family business, he purchases an auctioned-off thirteen-hundred-acre estate, Shallowford, where he will be changed by his love for two women: fiercely independent Grace Lovell and lovely, demure Claire Derwent. Post of Honour: Through hard work and love of the land, Craddock has transformed his sprawling estate and enjoys a peaceful country life with his wife and three children. But war has begun its inevitable march across England, and this remote corner of Devon cannot escape its destruction. As the Great War ends and another threatens to erupt, Craddock s faith and the strength he derives from his family must sustain him and his village through trying, tumultuous times. The Green Gauntlet: Though Craddock s village has endured despite the sorrows of war, he has new perils to face. Emerging property laws threaten his livelihood, dividing his family over the future of his beloved Shallowford.

A place of shadow and light where thieves, whores, and dreamers mingle, where children play in the cobbled streets by day and a killer stalks at night, where bright hopes meet the darkest truths. Here, by the whispering waters of the Thames, a bright and defiant young woman dares to dream of a life beyond tumbledown wharves, gaslit alleys, and the grim and crumbling dwellings of the poor. Fiona Finnegan, a worker in a tea factory, hopes to own a shop one day, together with her lifelong love, Joe Bristow, a costermonger's son. With nothing but their faith in each other to spur them on, Fiona and Joe struggle, save, and sacrifice to achieve their dreams. But Fiona's dreams are shattered when the actions of a dark and brutal man take from her nearly everything-and everyone-she holds dear. Fearing her own death at the dark man's hands, she is forced to flee London for New York. There, her indomitable spirit-and the ghosts of her past-propel her rise from a modest west side shopfront to the top of Manhattan's tea trade.

An important contribution to the contemporary renaissance in systematic theology!  Timothy George Dean of Beeson Divinity School of Samford University, Executive Editor of Christianity Today As the Pentecostal/charismatic movement continues to grow, so does the need for solid theological resources for its members. While there are many volumes of systematic theology available, very few are written from a distinctly charismatic perspective. Truth Aflame seeks to meet that need. While academically sound, Truth Aflame is written with a practical, pastoral flavor. Larry Hart defines systematic theology as the process of taking what the Bible teaches and relating it to contemporary questions and knowledge. His passion for the subject is evident: he is concerned that the reader both grasps the magnificence of the study of God and allows these great truths to be transformative. This Truth, then liberating, enlivening, and transforming Truth becomes central to the ongoing renewal of the church that we are seeing in our day. Dr. Hart treats each of the traditional categories revelation, God, creation, humanity, sin, Christ, salvation, the church, and last things from a Pentecostal/charismatic perspective. He addresses other theological viewpoints but does not get bogged down in analysis and rebuttal. Further, he seeks to build bridges of understanding to those evangelicals outside the charismatic tradition. Clear, succinct, and readable, this revised and updated edition of Truth Aflame is well-suited not only for students, but for anyone desiring a greater understanding of Pentecostal/charismatic theology.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=mb61juZxXgcC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Henry Lee Lucas: The Shocking True Story of America's Most Notorious Serial Killer","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=Uy2jAAAACAAJ&dq=Henry+Lee+Lucas:+The+Shocking+True+Story+of+America%27s+Most+Notorious+Serial+Killer&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Luckman at quarterback;: Football as a sport and a career","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=cLBRAQAAMAAJ&dq=Luckman+at+quarterback%3B:+Football+as+a+sport+and+a+career&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A White Hat in Argo: Family Secrets","description":"Describes the survival of a close-knit Negro family, led by three sisters during the summer of 1951 in Argo, Illinois.

It chronicles the growing aerial threat from its inception in the First World War and the response of each of the major navies down to the end of the Second, highlighting in particular the widely underestimated danger from dive-bombing. Central to this discussion is an analysis of what effective AA fire-control required, and how well each navy's systems actually worked. It also takes in the weapons themselves, how they were placed on ships, and how this reflected the tactical concepts of naval AA defence. As would be expected from any Friedman book, it offers striking insights ??  he argues, for example, that the Royal Navy, so often criticised for lack of 'air-mindedness', was actually the most alert to the threat, but that its systems were inadequate not because they were too primitive but because they tried to achieve too much.??The book summarises the experience of WW2, particularly in theatres where the aerial danger was greatest, and a concluding chapter looks at post-1945 developments that drew on wartime lessons. All important guns, directors and electronics are represented in close-up photos and drawings, and lengthy appendices detail their technical data. It is, simply, another superb contribution to naval technical history by its leading exponent.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=7uGZBgAAQBAJ&dq=Jane%27s+Naval+History+of+WWII&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Five Star First Edition Mystery - Sirius About Murder: A Beanie and Cruiser Mystery","description":"Mystery novels are published in a number of subgenres to satisfy the tastes of every reader.

The lives of many men and women are robbed of their true value by twists and flaws of character and temperament, which, while defying the efforts of the will, would yield rapidly to the influence of autosuggestion. Unfortunately, the knowledge of this method has hitherto been available in England only in the somewhat detailed and technical work of Professor Charles Baudouin, and in a small pamphlet, printed privately by M. Coue, which has not been publicly exposed for sale. To fill this gap is the aim of the following pages. They are designed to present to the layman in non-technical form the information necessary to enable him to practise autosuggestion for himself. All readers who wish to obtain a deeper insight into the theoretical basis of autosuggestion are recommended to study Professor Baudouin's fascinating work, Suggestion and Autosuggestion.

Debra Nussbaum Cohen--Staff Writer. A new book by an Israeli legal expert, Aviad Hacohen, promises to return to public attention the legal technique used to dissolve the marriages of agunot, women whose estranged husbands refused to grant them a Jewish divorce, an approach which prompted waves of controversy in 1997, when it was first used. That was when Rabbi Emmanuel Rackman, chancellor emeritus of Bar Ilan University, went public with the fact that he was employing little-used aspects of Jewish law in order to free hundreds of women whose husbands were keeping them legally chained to dead marriages. Rabbi Rackman's work was met with criticism from rabbis in virtually all sectors of the Orthodox world. But, with the assistance of a handful of rabbinic colleagues and supportive women, he has continued to solve the dilemmas of agunot, doing so for several dozen in the last year or two and several hundred in total, he said in an interview. The heart of the new book The Tears of the Oppressed: An Examination of the Agunah Problem--Background and Halachic Sources (Ktav), is devoted to the same legal principle that Rabbi Rackman employed: kiddushei ta' ut, or mistaken marriage, a principle based on asserting that the marriage was never authentic and therefore need not be annulled. The book, edited by Blu Greenberg, a Jewish Orthodox feminist leader, offers 28 rabbinic legal decisions, originally published from the 12th through 20th centuries, as precedents for solving the agunot dilemma through this application. For scholars, the bookincludes facsimiles of the original decisions; some are well known, and others Hacohen unearthed from near-forgotten files at Israel's National Library.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=w7WsAeX_gDAC&dq=The+Tears+Of+The+Oppressed:+An+Examination+Of+The+Agunah+Problem:+Background+And+Halakhic+Sources&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Sir Archibald","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=gQDAzgEACAAJ&dq=Sir+Archibald&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Encyclopedia of Data Warehousing and Mining","description":"There are more than one billion documents on the Web, with the count continually rising at a pace of over one million new documents per day.

His published memoir - all 365 pages of it - stopped at 1927, when the twenty-two-year-old writer and his first wife, Andree, were about to settle in California. Now revised and expanded, An Autobiographical Novel includes reminiscences that cover another twenty years of literary life and two more marriages. Linda Hamalian, author of A Life of Kenneth Rexroth (W. W. Norton, 1991), sifted through more than 300 pages of raw tape transcriptions. Weighing fact against fictions (Rexroth loved a tall tale and relished gossip), Hamalian has prepared a valuable index that identifies obscure allusions and the real people who figured in Rexroth's emotionally tumultuous life. It adds up to a very good read,\\" she says. \\"I am willing to bet a nice chunk of money that readers will wish Rexroth had been able to go on and on loosening his talk-tapes.\\" \\"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=HjGvQgAACAAJ&dq=An+Autobiographical+Novel+(Revived+Modern+Classic)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"How to Read/Write a Dirty Story","description":"For aspiring erotica writers -- and authors in any genre who want to make the \\"good\\" parts great Susie Bright is the first and reigning queen of contemporary erotica.

It was seen as a social disease capable of poisoning the body politic and shattering the unity of the church. The study of heresy in late medieval England has, to date, focused largely on the heretics. In consequence, we know very little about how this crime was defined by the churchmen who passed authoritative judgement on it. By examining the drafting, publicizing, and implementing of new laws against heresy in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, using published and unpublished judicial records, this book presents the first general study of inquisition in medieval England. In it Ian Forrest argues that because heresy was a problem simultaneously national and local, detection relied upon collaboration between rulers and the ruled. While involvement in detection brought local society into contact with the apparatus of government, uneducated laymen still had to be kept at arm's length, because judgements about heresy were deemed too subtle and important to be left to them. Detection required bishops and inquisitors to balance reported suspicions against canonical proof, and threats to public safety against the rights of the suspect and the deficiencies of human justice. At present, the character and significance of heresy in late medieval England is the subject of much debate. Ian Forrest believes that this debate has to be informed by a greater awareness of the legal and social contexts within which heresy took on its many real and imagined attributes.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=wMhSDKhLelgC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The practice of process meditation : the Intensive Journal way to spiritual experience","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=MKDuzgEACAAJ&dq=The+practice+of+process+meditation+:+the+Intensive+Journal+way+to+spiritual+experience&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Old St. Paul's (Everyman's library, ed. by Ernest Rhys.

Konrad Jarausch describes how the European nations emerged from the nineteenth century with high hopes for continued material progress and proud of their imperial command over the globe, only to become embroiled in the bloodshed of World War I, which brought an end to their optimism and gave rise to competing democratic, communist, and fascist ideologies. He shows how the 1920s witnessed renewed hope and a flourishing of modernist art and literature, but how the decade ended in economic collapse and gave rise to a second, more devastating world war and genocide on an unprecedented scale. Jarausch further explores how Western Europe surprisingly recovered due to American help and political integration. Finally, he examines how the Cold War pushed the divided continent to the brink of nuclear annihilation, and how the unforeseen triumph of liberal capitalism came to be threatened by Islamic fundamentalism, global economic crisis, and an uncertain future. A gripping narrative, Out of Ashes explores the paradox of the European encounter with modernity in the twentieth century, shedding new light on why it led to cataclysm, inhumanity, and self-destruction, but also social justice, democracy, and peace.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=A3CYDwAAQBAJ&dq=Out+of+Ashes&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Pokmon Trading Card Game Fossil Expansion Player's Guide","description":"Provides advice for Pokemon players, and describes the cards","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=RrH_38qOX0IC&dq=Pokmon+Trading+Card+Game+Fossil+Expansion+Player%27s+Guide&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Living on the Unicoi Road","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=dd9BzQEACAAJ&dq=Living+on+the+Unicoi+Road&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Enterprise.com: Market Leadership In The Information Age","description":"Drawing on the work of Lotus and the IT innovators in industries such as insurance and aerospace, this text explores the more profound implications of the IT revolution, including why the Web is the most over-hyped but undervalued business tool.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=rpcpQAAACAAJ&dq=Enterprise.com:+Market+Leadership+In+The+Information+Age&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"CHRISTIAN MEDITATION AND INNER HEALING","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=0_cFAAAACAAJ&dq=CHRISTIAN+MEDITATION+AND+INNER+HEALING&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Aeolian Geomorphology (Binghamton Symposia in Geomorphology International Series)","description":"This book, first published in 1986, stems from the 1986 Binghamton Geomorphology Symposium.

With this long-awaited book, Ivo Banac becomes the first scholar to assess the domestic consequences of Yugoslavia's expulsion from the Cominform, and his findings will radically revise some of our most basic assumptions about Tito's revolution. Banac's subject is the nature and fate of those elements in the Yugoslav Communist party who were said to have sided with Moscow against their own country's leadership. He demonstrates that the so-called Cominformists represented as much as twenty-percent of the party membership and had widely divergent aims. He then reconstructs the history of the labrynthine factional struggles that preceded and accompanied the 1948 split and shows that, as always, the national question played the dominant role in Yugoslav politics. After identifying the members of the opposition and mapping its course, Banac recounts the harsh repression of the movement. He provides massive documentation of startling irony: the conflict with Stalin played the same part in the shaping of Yugoslavia's political system as the collectivization and purges of the 1930's did in the history of Soviet communism.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=_C1zDwAAQBAJ&dq=With+Stalin+against+Tito:+Cominformist+Splits+in+Yugoslav+Communism&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Dictionary of Surnames","description":"Anybody who has ever wondered about the origin of a family name will find the answer in this new dictionary, which explains the origin and meaning of all the common surnames in the English-speaking world, together with many other rarer English names and foreign names.

Guaranteed!","description":"Sad but true, statistics clearly show that less than 7% of all marriages in the United States can be considered happy, healthy relationships. But, despite the gloomy forecasts for marital bliss, Dr. Tom Merrill and Bobbie Sandoz Merrill offer you a new way to turn the tables on these odds and guarantee your success. In their desire to preserve the intensity of the love they had found, rather than allow it to fade and end in divorce as the authors had both previously experienced, they uncovered some powerful relationship secrets that are universally applicable. In addition to their personal discovery, the Merrills bring us the benefit of their extensive knowledge and research, as well as their own experience as therapists and seminar and community leaders who have helped thousands of couples. In Settle for More, the Merrills examine the cultural obstacles we face in trying to forge loving, harmonious relationships, and explode certain myths about the mechanics of a happy, successful marriage: Marriage does Not have to be \\"hard work;\\" it can be as light and playful as during courtship. Fighting is Not healthy for your marriage, but instead causes a serious breakdown of positive feelings. Marriage does Not require the restrictions and losses of \\"compromise,\\" which can actually put more strain on a relationship. Thomas Merrill, Ph.D., and his wife, Bobbie Sandoz Merrill, MSW, break it all down for us in astoundingly simple terms. But don't be fooled; these two renowned, successful family therapists - nationally syndicated columnists both - deconstruct the conventional wisdom about marriage and relationships, and offer a new approach to get the relationship we want by monitoring our own behavior and developing the very qualities we want to experience from our partners.

But now, with access to vast amounts of biological data contained in public databases, programming skills are increasingly in strong demand in biology research and development. Perl, with its highly developed capacities in string handling, text processing, networking, and rapid prototyping, has emerged as the programming language of choice for biological data analysis.Mastering Perl for Bioinformatics covers the core Perl language and many of its module extensions, presenting them in the context of biological data and problems of pressing interest to the biological community. This book, along with Beginning Perl for Bioinformatics, forms a basic course in Perl programming. This second volume finishes the basic Perl tutorial material (references, complex data structures, object-oriented programming, use of modules--all presented in a biological context) and presents some advanced topics of considerable interest in bioinformatics.The range of topics covered in Mastering Perl for Bioinformatics prepares the reader for enduring and emerging developments in critical areas of bioinformatics programming such as: Gene finding String alignment Methods of data storage and retrieval (SML and databases) Modeling of networks (graphs and Petri nets) Graphics (Tk) Parallelization Interfacing with other programming languages Statistics (PDL) Protein structure determination Biological models of computation (DNA Computers) Biologists and computer scientists who have conquered the basics of Perl and are ready to move even further in their mastery of this versatile language will appreciate the author's well-balanced approach to applying Perl's analytical abilities to the field of bioinformatics. Full of practical examples and real-world biological problem solving, this book is a must for any reader wanting to move beyond beginner level Perl in bioinformatics.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=S4inrd83htwC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Open Road: A Celebration of the American Highway","description":"A panoramic celebration of American ingenuity and engineering focuses on the myth of the open road as exemplified in the development of American highways and the roadside culture--franchises, motels, and ticky-tack--it has spawned","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=eQJtBS-_bXUC&dq=Open+Road:+A+Celebration+of+the+American+Highway&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Your Boy: Raising a Godly Son in an Ungodly World","description":"Guides parents as they navigate the most important topics related to raising sons.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=-fhQ3SuZzw4C&dq=Your+Boy:+Raising+a+Godly+Son+in+an+Ungodly+World&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Advertising Information or Manipulation?","description":"Discusses how advertising has developed, how companies use it to entice consumers, and the impact of advertising on people, particularly young people.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=rucEAAAACAAJ&dq=Advertising+Information+or+Manipulation%3F&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Mel Bay Barry Galbraith Guitar Solos","description":"Barry Galbraith was one of the best jazz guitarists of the 1950's.

They define the personalization process as one in which the actor discovers and explores in the self, characteristics, qualities, attitudes, and experiences that are legitimate dimensions of the role being created. Part I transitions from essential ingredients used in creating a role, such as focusing and speaking, to guidelines for auditioning and rehearsing, including role analysis. The discussions of basic acting principles are supported by skills-building exercises. Part II explores historical performance styles and shows how basic stylistic elements can be freshly adapted for modern audiences. Thus, in Part II, the authors center their discussions of voice, movement, character, and emotion around theatrical styles prevalent during certain historical periods and around sound acting theories gleaned from a wide range of acting traditions. Each chapter in this part ends with a helpful checklist that summarizes voice, movement, gesture, and other elements common to the era discussed.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=CccSAAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Concordance to the Greek Testament; Fourth Edition","description":"This book is a completely revised and reset edition of the best-selling A Concordance to the Greek Testament edited by W. F. Moulton and A. S. Geden. Originally published in 1897, it has remained in print ever since. It is beyond any doubt the most useful basic tool available for the student of the New Testament. The original edition was primarily based on the Greek text of Westcott and Hort, but gave all the variants in the edition of Tischendorf and in the Greek text underlying the Revised Version of the English Bible; quotations are given with grammatical completeness as far as possible; a significant feature is the inclusion of the Hebrew text of direct quotations from the Old Testament; asterisks and daggers indicate whether the vocabulary items in the New Testament are found in Classical Greek and in the Septuagint.This new edition retains all the features of the earlier editions, but it is primarily based on the Greek text in The Greek New Testament (4th edition), which is identical with that in Novum Testamentum Graece (27th edition), currently the two most widely used editions of the Greek New Testament; it incorporates the main marginal readings in the former of these texts; references to the variants in the older editions are preserved, so that the student has to hand every reading which by even a remote probability might be regarded as forming part of the true text of the New Testament. The Supplement incorporating the prepositions has been included in the main text of the Concordance. Where the same word occurs twice in the same verse, these occurrences are now printed on separate lines and individually verse-numbered so that it is easier to count the number of occurrences of any given word. Special new Greek fonts have been created to enable great clarity in the printing.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=U-9JOEaYZMsC&dq=A+Concordance+to+the+Greek+Testament%3B+Fourth+Edition&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Authentic Learning Environments in Higher Education","description":"While situated and constructivist theory has generated useful guidelines for the foundations of authentic learning environments, few concrete examples exist.

The volume followed a strengths-based approach to understanding why some mothers appeared resilient to the stresses of early parenting, compared to their peers, and what obstacles undermine resiliency for some of these young women. We hear their stories in their own words. We also see how many disadvantaged mothers go on to succeed in school, work, and parenting while avoiding many of the risk associated with teen parenting . The research is based on a six-year study of 120 young disadvantaged mothers and their children from New York City. It uniquely combines the analysis of longitudinal questionnaire data with qualitative analysis of extensive interviews conducted with these women focusing on the first six years after their child was born. A past winner of the Society for Research on Adolescence best book award, Growing Up Fast is a fascinating study of human resilience that will continue to be recognized for its contribution to individuals involved in program development and policymaking with teenage parenting. A new introductory chapter to the book suggests that we can look at the previous findings through a new lens that emphasizes not only the diversity of outcomes for young mothers and the sources of their strengths, but also asks what we can learn from these women about supporting their educational and work goals, as they transition to adulthood. New attention to emerging adulthood shows that this is a critical stage of life when the foundations for health and healthy life styles are laid down. Developmental tasks of this phase include building the capacity for financial and residential independence through post-secondary education and job training, and establishing stable sources of support from parents, romantic partners, and peers for all youth. Leadbeater addresses the societal changes that make these tasks particularly salient for young women and focuses attention on how we can support youth who make this transition with children.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=mnv8AgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Gather Comprehensive: Guitar Accompaniment","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=Wz7BAAAACAAJ&dq=Gather+Comprehensive:+Guitar+Accompaniment&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Full Tide of Night","description":"A science fiction take on The Duchess of Malfi.

No longer. Today, there is a philosophy of reason that provides a rational and objective validation of moral laws. The Fellowship of Reason exists to advocate, celebrate, and promulgate that morality based upon reality to a literate, thoughtful, reality-oriented, self-responsible general public worldwide. This book is divided into twelve chapters. Chapter 1 elaborates the reasons for the existence of our rational moral community. The objective human needs that until now have been served only by religion are explored. In chapter 2 I explain the details of our moral philosophy by identifying what we regard as the ultimate value. The choices of ultimate value include God, the state, the environment, and individual human life. Chapter 3 considers the meaning of life from three angles the purpose or goal of life, the intention of life, and the actual definition of a particular human life as manifested in the actions taken by that individual. We work through an exercise to discover the meaning (definition) of the reader's life. Chapter 4 advocates that each individual discover and deliberately pursue his or her own major lifetime goals, that he or she give his or her life a meaning in the sense of purpose or goal. Happiness, we hold, requires a life purpose. Chapter 5 considers the contents of human consciousness. Five components of the human soul are explored the other, your daemon, reason, emotions, and your parents' child. Chapter 6 presents techniques for working on your soul and explains the non-mystical, natural referents of the Holy Trinity. Chapter 7 concisely states our philosophy of reason. Chapter 8 introduces the new component to our philosophy of reason benevolence. The relationship between the virtues of benevolence and the penultimate values of a loving family, good friends, and community is revealed. Chapter 9 details the elements of a regular meeting of the Fellowship of Reason. Chapter 10 describes our rational rituals. In order to be happy, one must selectively focus one's attention. These rituals are institutionally structured disciplines designed to focus our attention upon the good things in life. Chapter 11 reveals the mythology of our new moral community. And finally, in chapter 12 we provide reasons why you should create a Fellowship of Reason in your city. We show how reason, if utilized consistently as the means of living, will spread human freedom, prosperity, and happiness throughout the world. An appendix concludes, addressed to our theistic friends. The purpose of morality is to teach you to enjoy yourself and live well on earth. Reason makes human life possible. The Fellowship of Reason proposes to bring to you, in regular weekly celebrations and in daily spiritual exercises, tools that will enhance your life and the lives of everyone around you. Read the book to learn more about the Fellowship of Reason.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=wMyb-r2nLwMC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"China's examination hell: The civil service examinations of Imperial China","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=CBQQAQAAMAAJ&dq=China%27s+examination+hell:+The+civil+service+examinations+of+Imperial+China&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Windows XP Professional -- The Ultimate Users Guide","description":"A guide to the features of Windows XP Professional covers such topics as personalizing a computer, using System Restore, installing applications, setting up networks, and performing disk management tasks.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=vTMJAAAACAAJ&dq=Windows+XP+Professional+--+The+Ultimate+Users+Guide&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Low Fire: Other Ways To Work In Clay (ILLUSTRATED)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=AN9UAAAAMAAJ&dq=Low+Fire:+Other+Ways+To+Work+In+Clay+(ILLUSTRATED)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The World Republic of Letters (Convergences)","description":"The \\"world of letters\\" has always seemed a matter more of metaphor than of global reality. In this book, Pascale Casanova shows us the state of world literature behind the stylistic refinements--a world of letters relatively independent from economic and political realms, and in which language systems, aesthetic orders, and genres struggle for dominance. Rejecting facile talk of globalization, with its suggestion of a happy literary \\"melting pot,\\" Casanova exposes an emerging regime of inequality in the world of letters, where minor languages and literatures are subject to the invisible but implacable violence of their dominant counterparts. Inspired by the writings of Fernand Braudel and Pierre Bourdieu, this ambitious book develops the first systematic model for understanding the production, circulation, and valuing of literature worldwide. Casanova proposes a baseline from which we might measure the newness and modernity of the world of letters--the literary equivalent of the meridian at Greenwich. She argues for the importance of literary capital and its role in giving value and legitimacy to nations in their incessant struggle for international power. Within her overarching theory, Casanova locates three main periods in the genesis of world literature--Latin, French, and German--and closely examines three towering figures in the world republic of letters--Kafka, Joyce, and Faulkner. Her work provides a rich and surprising view of the political struggles of our modern world--one framed by sites of publication, circulation, translation, and efforts at literary annexation.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=_1AoeXbMSZMC&dq=The+World+Republic+of+Letters+(Convergences)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Microeconomics Plus MyEconLab Student Access Kit (MyEconLab Series)","description":"If your course begins before 8/1/06, click here.

Aside from the usual MA theses and Ph.d. dissertations-almost all of them stiffly written attempts to isolate academically \\"workable\\" and degree-granting minutia-there is very little in print for the students of language that attempts to explain how contemporary languages in America have been and continue to be affected by their rubbing of elbows. What is noticeably true about the French dialectical variations in and surrounding New England is generally true of the Spanish dialects spoken along our Mexican border too: Both were at one time banned in their community schools. Both have created hybrid dialects in English; Both have retained vestiges of their rhythms and stresses in these hybrids; Both have adopted English nouns and altered them appropriately; Both have applied their verb structures to English verbs; Both have adopted English cuss and curse words; Both favor religious swears (unlike American English, which favors the sexual); Both have insinuated words and expressions into contemporary American English. Mutt Contay Saw is about French and what has happened to it in New England. But it's also about English. It's entirely in English, even the French pronunciations are rendered in English.

(\\"Red\\") Watson has published fiction, general nonfiction, and scholarly books. His essay \\"On the Zeedijk,\\" about Descartes in Holland and first published in The Georgia Review, was the lead essay in The Pushcart Prize XV, 1990-1991: Best of the Small Presses. Red knows writing. He also knows academe and has written Writing Philosophy as a kind of survival manual for undergraduates, graduate students, and junior faculty members in philosophy. Also helpful to those in the humanities and the social sciences, the book is a guide to the professional writing and publishing that are essential to an active participation in the conversation and discussion that constitute these professional fields. To the extent that publication is the crucial factor in tenure decisions, it will help the beginning scholar meet tenure criteria. Despite the importance of the oral tradition in philosophy and the influence of the dialogue, many philosophical points are so intricate and complex that they can be advanced, followed, and criticized only if they are written as stepwise arguments for study and contemplation at length and at leisure. Watson provides a set of basic principles and a plan for writing argumentative papers of 1,500 to 15,000 words (3 to 30 printed pages) and books containing a sequence of sustained arguments of 70,000 to 150,000 words (200 to 300 printed pages). Because the first book of most professional philosophers is a revised dissertation, Watson presents a plan for writing that dissertation in such a way that its chapters will serve as publishable articles and the dissertation itself will need very little rewriting as a book. His discussion of the principles of reason, clarity, and argument ranges from such topics as dangling participles and the proper usage of ellipses to matters of categorization and univocity.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=z5XCAAAAIAAJ&dq=Writing+Philosophy:+A+Guide+to+Professional+Writing+and+Publishing&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Astrology & Money: What's Your Wealth Quotient?","description":"Everything you need to get started with astrology, including how to read your birth chart and use astrological insights to plan and predict your life.

This powerful tale written by a consummate Charleston insider and set in the historic city resonates with universal appeal. Daring to touch on topics that had been taboo, Three O'Clock Dinner reveals how the modern world has intruded in a most unwelcome way upon the Redcliffes, a Charleston family long on pedigree but short on cash. Mortified when their son \\"Tat\\" elopes with the henna-haired daughter of the Hessenwinkles, an especially galling bourgeois clan, the Redcliffes are determined to respond with civility. They invite their son, his new wife, and her family for Sunday dinner, served at the traditional time of three in the afternoon. Tension builds across an expanse of white damask. After mint julep aperitifs, dinner claret, and Madeira toasts, a chance remark ignites the novel's climax amid a flurry of raised voices, hurt feelings, and broken china. Their new daughter-in-law's revelation further shatters the Redcliffe's well-ordered society but opens a door to forgiveness and redemption. Barbara L. Bellow's introduction places the novel in its historical context, illuminates the history of its publication and treatment in the hands of Hollywood producers, and provides an in-depth critical analysis.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=rRhMH0JS1QUC&dq=O%27clock&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Jack London 1 - Before Adam & other stories (Classic Science Fiction & Fantasy)","description":"Renowned as a writer of classic adventure stories such as The Call of the Wild and White Fang, Jack London also had a parallel career as a writer of science fiction and fantasy.

Their father, a selfmade man, had worked his way up from nothing to become a colonel in the Shah's army, and their mother, a woman of equally modest roots, had made a career for herself as a respected schoolteacher. But in February, 1979, Colonel Latifi was arrested by members of the newly installed Khomeini regime, and publicly pilloried as an \\"Enemy of God.\\" Some months later, after having been shunted from one prison cell to another, and without benefit of a legitimate trial, Colonel Latifi was summarily executed. Fearing for the safety of her children, Mrs. Latifi made a wrenching decision: to send her daughters, ages ten and eleven, to the west, splitting up the family until they could safely reunite. Out on their own, Afschineh and her sister, Afsaneh, were forced to become strong young women before they'd even had a childhood. Even After All This Time is a story of hope and heartache, a story of a family torn apart for six harrowing years, and finally coming together to rebuild in America. In the richly evocative tradition of the bestselling Reading Lolita in Tehran, this is a story of a family that had the courage to dream impossible dreams and to make them come true against impossible odds.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=e8SmPwAACAAJ&dq=Even+After+All+This+Time+:+A+Story+of+Love,+Revolution,+and+Leaving+Iran&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Police-Community Relations and the Administration of Justice (5th Edition)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=8fnjPQAACAAJ&dq=Police-Community+Relations+and+the+Administration+of+Justice+(5th+Edition)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Angels & Monsters: A Child's Eye View of Cancer","description":"\`Bij een benzinestation in Mariposa vroeg ik de weg naar Bass Lake. De pompbediende, een jongen van vijftien, adviseerde mij ernstig om ergens anders heen te gaan. De Hells Angels gaan daar de boel op stelten zetten. Jezus nog aan toe, waarom zou iemand nog naar Bass Lake willen? Die gozers zijn verschrikkelijk. Ze branden de hele boel plat! Ik zei tegen hem dat ik een karatemeester was en dat ik zin had in actie. Hells Angels is een sterk staaltje gonzojournalistiek waar Hunter S. Thompson zijn faam aan ontleende. Een jaar lang trekt Thompson op met een chapter van de Hells Angels en brengt deze notoire motorclub in kaart: hij beschrijft het ontstaan van de Hells Angels, de regels en gebruiken, de kleding, de motoren en de tatoeages. Aan de hand van politierapporten, verslagen van ooggetuigen en gesprekken met de leden zelf, ontkracht Thompson de mythische verhalen die de Hells Angels omgeven en waar zijzelf dankbaar gebruik van maken om hun reputatie van \`bad guys mee aan te dikken. Hoewel Thompson bevriend raakt met een paar Angels - tot grote afschuw van buurtbewoners, die van angst in elkaar krimpen als er een Harley het terrein komt oprijden - behoudt hij zijn journalistieke integriteit en weet daardoor een genuanceerd en feitelijk beeld te geven van deze legendarische motorclub. Hunter S. Thompson (1937-2005) groeide op in Louisville, Kentucky, en pleegde in 2005 zelfmoord door zich door het hoofd te schieten. Thompson maakte naam met Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, die in 1998 werd verfilmd met Johnny Depp in de hoofdrol. In 2011 verschijnt tevens Thompsons debuutroman De Rum Dagboeken, waarvan de verfilming gelijktijdig in premi re gaat. \`Er zijn twee bijvoeglijke naamwoorden waar schrijvers iets om geven briljant en buitengewoon Thompson bezit beide Tom Wolfe \`Thompson biedt ons een kijkje in een wereld waar de meesten van ons nooit voet aan wal zullen zetten. Zijn taal is briljant, zijn blik is fascinerend.

He is in financial trouble and suddenly finds himself in possession of a magical spell that allows him access to the realm of the gods. He may be a professor, but he's got no common sense--so when he goes there, he makes the mistake of inviting a con-man god and his companions back to Earth. What develops is a fantastic mess full of rich opportunities for humor, satire, and surprise. Arthur's mistake unbalances his own life, life on Earth, and the lives of the gods in their realm...and universal darkness threatens to cover all. Chaos spreads on a greater and greater scale until all creation is threatened. It's a good thing that Arthur is able to find the courage and self-confidence to save the day, even if the universe has to die and be reborn.

Here is an answer for the strategist who asks, 'What should I do differently next Monday morning?'. The object of strategy is to create financial value and the offering-centred approach of Creating Valuable Business Strategies provides a novel and pragmatic framework for setting strategic direction: choosing which markets to contest and how. This book: * Identifies the individual offering as the fundamental unit of strategy--the choices that customers make regarding individual offerings are at the root of a company's financial success. * Provides an innovative and comprehensive approach to profitable business strategy--designing each offering and also the collection as a whole. * Explains that strategy is a task for all businesses with offerings, even the smallest, not just the giants. The book first sets the scene and makes the case that each value-adding offering needs a competitive strategy: it must have a winning competitive position and use one or more winning resources. It provides the reader with a rich classification of how an offering can be competitively positioned vis- -vis rival offerings and customers. Winning resources and why offerings need them is discussed next. Corporate strategy, i.e. the managing of the company s whole collection of offerings is then examined. This is followed by a discussion of the implications for organizing and structuring for an offering-centred approach to strategy. Finally all the aspects of this new framework that may meet with resistance are explored. Creating Valuable Business Strategies is essential reading for anyone who is involved in designing tomorrow's offerings: from the backroom specialist to the CEO.

Beman, and Richard Morris Hunt. By the early 1900s, however, the neighborhood began a noticeable transformation as many homes were converted to rooming houses and offices, while others were razed for construction of large plants for the printing and publishing industry. The rescue of the landmark Glessner house in 1966 brought renewed attention to the area, and in 1979, the Prairie Avenue Historic District was designated.

Stop! Don't think! You already know what this book is about. That is the power of Blank: the power of not actually thinking at all. Using what scientific researchers call 'ExtraLean Deli Slicing' (or would, if they actually bothered to research it), your brain has already decided whether you're going to like Blank, whether its cover goes with your shirt, and whether it will make you look smart if somebody sees you reading it on the train. Chances are you and your shirt are both liking it a lot, you're going to buy several copies, and you don't even know why! That's why you've absolutely got to read Blank: to find out why your brain keeps doing these wacky things without your permission. In Blank, a hilarious parody of the No. 1 bestseller it looks eerily like (and sort of rhymes with) and that your brain wisely advised you to just read a review or magazine excerpt about while avoiding the actual book itself, the brilliantly impulsive and slightly irresponsible Noah Tall explains how people as diverse as General Custer, Roy Rogers, a semifamous rock star, and the entire New York City Police Department either won big or lost miserably as a result of their minds going completely blank.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=wzEhUja_VbQC&dq=Blank:+The+Power+of+Not+Actually+Thinking+at+All+(A+Mindless+Parody)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Sue Barton, visiting nurse","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=yBBWuAEACAAJ&dq=Sue+Barton,+visiting+nurse&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Access Principle: The Case for Open Access to Research and Scholarship (Digital Libraries and Electronic Publishing)","description":"Questions about access to scholarship have always raged.

This later culminated in her suffering the disabling effects of multiple sclerosis. In her deep desire to know God and His healing grace, she cried out to Him for help. He answered her with many miraculous encounters. Through them, the Lord revealed to her His true character, her broken understanding and finally after much healing of her body, her emotions and her spiritual life, she received many rich insights that are woven through each chapter.

The Rabbis had long ago acknowledged that it was in the merit of our righteous women that Israel was redeemed from slavery. The Passover \\"seder--the home celebration of our national liberation--is an appropriate place to acknowledge and honor women's expanded role in our public as well as private religious life. The commentary includes rabbinic comments on women associated with the Exodus, a discussion of those relevant aspects of Jewish law that apply to women, and homilies--\\"divrei Torah by women for the \\"seder, many written especially for this volume. In a generation, it should seem quaint that it was noteworthy that women's \\"divrei Torah constituted a significant part of a Haggadah commentary. That will be cause for yet additional rejoicing, as women's contributions on all levels of Torah scholarship will have become even more commonplace.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=qT30zAZ3KEAC&dq=Women+At+The+Seder:+A+Passover+Haggadah&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Silver Cord (A Play)","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=HcgBAAAAQAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Greek and Roman mythology,","description":"This captivating classroom supplement includes reproducible activities to develop higher-level thinking skills through mythological stories, maps, charts, and worksheets.

You will discover that at the same time her words make you squirm, you will wish you lived next door to her. You will want her wisdom and you will want her pickles.   Jen Hatmaker (from the foreword) Shannan Martin had the perfect life: a cute farmhouse on six rambling acres, a loving husband, three adorable kids, money, friends, a close-knit church a safe, happy existence. But when the bottom dropped out through a series of shocking changes and ordinary inconveniences, the Martins followed God s call to something radically different: a small house on the other side of the urban tracks, a shoestring income, a challenged public school, and the harshness of a county jail (where her husband is now chaplain). And yet the family s plunge from  safety  was the best thing that could have happened to them. Falling Free charts their pilgrimage from the self-focused wisdom of the world to the topsy-turvy life of God s more being found in less. Martin s practical, sweetly subversive book invites us to rethink assumptions about faith and the good life, push past insecurity and fear, and look beyond comfortable, middle-class Christianity toward a deeper, richer, and ultimately more fulfilling life.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=oxXxCgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"George Romney and the 1969-1973 FHA housing crisis","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=Rl3hAAAAMAAJ&dq=George+Romney+and+the+1969-1973+FHA+housing+crisis&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The troll garden,","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=EU9aAAAAMAAJ&dq=The+troll+garden,&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Post Captain (Master and Commander Series)","description":" If Jane Austen had written rousing sea yarns, she would have produced something very close to the prose of Patrick O'Brian.

The Worldly Philosophers not only enables us to see more deeply into our history but helps us better understand our own times. In this seventh edition, Robert L. Heilbroner provides a new theme that connects thinkers as diverse as Adam Smith and Karl Marx. The theme is the common focus of their highly varied ideas namely, the search to understand how a capitalist society works. It is a focus never more needed than in this age of confusing economic headlines. In a bold new concluding chapter entitled  The End of the Worldly Philosophy?  Heilbroner reminds us that the word  end  refers to both the purpose and limits of economics. This chapter conveys a concern that today s increasingly  scientific  economics may overlook fundamental social and political issues that are central to economics. Thus, unlike its predecessors, this new edition provides not just an indispensable illumination of our past but a call to action for our future.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=vIxtW9cw-DQC&dq=The+Worldly+Philosophers:+The+Lives,+Times+And+Ideas+Of+The+Great+Economic+Thinkers,+Seventh+Edition&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Teutonic mythology,","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=F9E3AQAAMAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Great Instauration and the Novum Organum","description":"This entirely new classroom edition of Francis Bacon's great work of 1620, a founding document of empiricism and the scientific method, contains a new introduction and notes by translators/editors Urbach and Gibson.

Seattle author David Williams shows us how we can get the best of both. Botany and bugs, geology and geese, and creeks and crows; living in a major city doesn't have to separate us from the natural world. Stepping away from a guidebook format, Williams presents the reader with a series of essays and maps that weave personal musings, bits of humor, natural history observations, and scientific data into a multi-textured perspective of life in the city--descriptions of his journeys as a naturalist in an urban landscape. Williams addresses questions that an observant person asks in an urban environment. What did Seattle look like before Europeans got here? How does the area's geologic past affect us? Why have some animals thrived and other languished? How are we affected by the species with whom we share the urban environment and how do we affect them? This book captures all of the distinctive flavors of the Emerald City, urban and natural.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=drbCCQAAQBAJ&dq=The+Street-Smart+Naturalist:+Field+Notes+from+Seattle&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Maya Wars: Ethnographic Accounts from Nineteenth-Century Yucatan","description":"\\"The documents included in this book came from British, U.S., French, German, Maya, and Hispanic-Mexican authors and were written over a span of a hundred years\\"--P.

Congress authorized the organization of the Women's Army Auxiliary Corps (later renamed Women's Army Corps) in 1942, and hundreds of women were able to join in the war effort. Charity Edna Adams became the first black woman commissioned as an officer. Black members of the WAC had to fight the prejudices not only of males who did not want women in their \\"man's army,\\" but also of those who could not accept blacks in positions of authority or responsibility, even in the segregated military. With unblinking candor, Charity Adams Earley tells of her struggles and successes as the WAC's first black officer and as commanding officer of the only organization of black women to serve overseas during World War II. The 6888th Central Postal Directory Battalion broke all records for redirecting military mail as she commanded the group through its moves from England to France and stood up to the racist slurs of the general under whose command the battalion operated. The Six Triple Eight stood up for its commanding officer, supporting her boycott of segregated living quarters and recreational facilities. This book is a tribute to those courageous women who paved the way for patriots, regardless of color or gender, to serve their country.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=8NzUzMhwuskC&dq=One+Woman%27s+Army:+A+Black+Officer+Remembers+the+Wac+(Texas+a&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Timing Verification of Application-Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs)","description":"Reviewers tell us that Case/Fair is one of the all-time bestselling principles of economics texts because they trust it to be clear, thorough and complete.

One of the great benefits of this approach, is that students of economics won't mistakenly apply what they learned about simple demand and supply to aggregate demand & supply. (A detailed summary of this approach can be found in the preface).","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=5HQeAQAAIAAJ&dq=Timing+Verification+of+Application-Specific+Integrated+Circuits+(ASICs)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Chariots of the gods?

Who was this legendary man and how did he create the internationally renowned company that still bears his name? He began as a debt-stricken blacksmith who, fleeing debt in New England in the 1830s, set up shop in a little town on the Illinois frontier. There, in response to farmers' struggles, he designed a new plow that cut through the impervious prairie sod and lay open the rich, heavy soil for planting. The demand for his polished steel plow convinced him to specialize in farm implements. In the decades before the Civil War, John Deere envisioned a company supplying midwestern farmers with reliable, affordable equipment. He used only high quality, imported steel and resisted pressure to raise prices. At the same time, he won respectful affection from his employees by working alongside them on the shop floor. Upon taking the helm in the 1860s, John's only surviving son, Charles, expanded the Moline factories to increase production, started branch houses in major midwestern cities to speed distribution, and began to transform the company into a modern corporation. The transformation didn't come without difficulties however: Charles found himself battling the Grange, facing threats of labor unions and strikes led by his own employees, and enduring patent suits and blatant thefts of product designs and advertising.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=a3qAQgAACAAJ&dq=The+John+Deere+Story:+A+Biography+of+Plowmakers+John+and+Charles+Deere&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Managing E-Learning Strategies: Design, Delivery, Implementation and Evaluation","description":"\\"This book provides readers with a broad understanding of the emerging field of e-learning and also advises readers on the issues that are critical to the success of a meaningful e-learning environment\\"--Provided by publisher.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=WVL9ix9EZskC&dq=Managing+E-Learning+Strategies:+Design,+Delivery,+Implementation+and+Evaluation&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The King James Version Debate: A Plea for Realism","description":"D.

With the perspective of more than forty years' residence in the Coto Brus, Cole-Christensen ably describes both the settlers' dreams of bringing civilization and progress to the rain forest and the sweeping and irreversible changes they caused throughout the ecosystem as they cut the rain forest down. Writing neither to apologize for nor to defend their actions, he instead illuminates the personal and subjective factors that cause people to risk danger and hardship for the uncertain rewards of settling a frontier. In his own words, Cole-Christensen says, \\"This is a book for the scientist who wants to recapture a sense of an incalculable world departed, for the student who asks: How is it that our forebears changed and restructured this land?

In doing so, he achieved both a great victory and the notoriety of being the first American general to ever suspend civil liberties in America. Andrew Jackson and the Politics of Martial Law tells the history of Jackson's use of martial law and how the controversy surrounding it followed him throughout his life. The work engages the age-old controversy over if, when, and who should be able to subvert the Constitution during times of national emergency. It also engages the continuing historical controversy over Jackson's political prowess and the importance of the rise of party politics during the early republic. As such, the book contributes to both the scholarship on Jackson and the legal and constitutional history of the intersection between the military and civilian spheres. To fully understand the history of martial law and the subsequent evolution of a theory of emergency powers, Matthew Warshauer asserts, one must also understand the political history surrounding the discussion of civil liberties and how Jackson's stature as a political figure and his expertise as a politician influenced such debates. Warshauer further explains that Abraham Lincoln cited Jackson's use of the military and suspension of civil liberties as justification for similar decisions during the Civil War. During both Jackson's and Lincoln's use of martial law, critics declared that such an action stood in opposition to both the Constitution and the nation's cherished republican principles of protecting liberty from dangerous power, especially that of the military. Supporters of martial law insisted that saving the nation became the preeminent cause when the republic was endangered. At the heart of such arguments lurked the partisan maneuvering of opposing political parties. Andrew Jackson and the Politics of Martial Law is a powerful examination of the history of martial law, its first use in the United States, and the consequent development of emergency powers for both military commanders and presidents. Matthew Warshauer is associate professor of history at Central Connecticut State University. He is the author of the forthcoming Andrew Jackson: First Men, America's Presidents. His articles have appeared in Tennessee Historical Quarterly, Connecticut History, Louisiana History, and New York History.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=cLcK50SQHBkC&dq=Andrew+Jackson&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Assessment of Student Achievement (8th Edition)","description":"The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive departments and agencies of the United States Federal Government.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=x3buAAAAMAAJ&dq=Assessment+of+Student+Achievement+(8th+Edition)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"E-Legalines Software: Contracts","description":"This study aid provides detailed explanations of the cases in Farnsworth's contracts casebook.

Born in Poland, and originally named Josef Teodor Konrad Walecz Korzeniowski, he went to sea at the age of seventeen and eventually joined the crew of an English vessel, becoming a British citizen in the process. He retired from the sea in 1894 and took up the pen, writing all his works in English, a language he had only learned as an adult. Despite this, he was a master stylist, both lush and precise. His outsider's eye gave him special insights into the moral dangers of the great age of European empires. In his prefactory note to this volume, Conrad wrote, \\"Of the five stories in this volume, 'The Lagoon,' the last in order, is the earliest in date. It is the first short story I ever wrote and marks, in a manner of speaking, the end of my first phase, the Malayan phase with its special subject and its verbal suggestions. Conceived in the same mood which produced 'Almayer's Folly' and 'An Outcast of the Islands,' it is told in the same breath (with what was left of it, that is, after the end of 'An Outcast'), seen with the same vision, rendered in the same method -- if such a thing as method did exist then in my conscious relation to this new adventure of writing for print. I doubt it very much. One does one's work first and theorizes about it afterwards. It is a very amusing and egotistical occupation of no use whatever to any<->one and just as likely as not to lead to false conclusions.\\" The Idiots His first short story, written March 1896. The Lagoon What Conrad considered his first authentic short story, written in July 1896. A white man stops at a gloomy lagoon where a solitary Malay has his hut along with his woman. The woman is dying of fever. Through the night the Malay tells the story of their doomed love, how they ran away from the king and queen who owned her as a servant girl, how they were pursued, how his brother gave his life to save them. At dawn she dies and the man is left utterly bereft. Quintessential Conrad  a tale of utter bleakness, told in lush, decadent, tropical prose. An Outpost of Progress Published in two parts in Cosmopolis magazine in June and July 1897, Conrad considered this his best short story. It is set in the Congo, drawing on his experiences there seven years earlier, and strongly linked with Heart of Darkness i.e. pretty much the same plot. Two white men are left high up the river, deep in the Dark Continent, to run a trading station. They fall to pieces physically and mentally and the end comes when a group of African slavers steal away their native staff, leaving ivory tusks in payment. Having lost their self-respect they go quickly downhill, bicker about nothing until, after a trivial argument, one shoots the other then hangs himself. Conrad all over. The tropical setting; the complete degradation of the protagonists; the vision of futility; the lush prose. It is a bit mind-boggling that  An Outpost  appeared just at the moment of Queen Victoria s Diamond Jubilee, June and July 1897. On 22 June there was a vast procession of colourfully-dressed colonial subjects through London to an open air service outside St Paul s cathedral. On 23 June the Queen met some young Indian princes. On 2 July the Queen surveyed her colonial troops at Windsor. Both the June and July editions of Cosmopolis included length celebrations of the greatness and benefits of Empire (some quoted in this article). The Times published Kipling s great poem, Recessional, on 17 July. And over exactly this same period, Conrad was publishing this bleak nihilistic tale. You wonder how he avoided being lynched! The Return Completed in early 1897. In his preface Conrad says he hated writing this story. Arrogant, successful middle-aged businessman Alvan Hervey returns on the Tube to his smart West London house to find a message from his wife saying she has left him for a magazine editor. He is devastated, his world collapses, everything he has valued is torn away from under him etc. He is just starting to feel like all the turmoil which Conrad heroes usually luxuriate in, when his wife, embarrassingly, returns. She s changed her mind! How does Conrad make such a slight incident (man comes home, reads note, is unhappy, wife walks back in) last 60 pages? With great torrents of prose describing Hervey s anguish, mental collapse, fury, despair. Despite its untypical setting (London) it is classic overripe, hysterical Conrad, redolent of Strindberg or of a strung-out existentialist play like Jean-Paul Sartre s play, Huis Clos. Karain: A Memory Published in Blackwoods Magazine in November 1897. From the safety of Blighty the narrator remembers the days when he was a gun smuggler around the Malay archipelago. The striking figure of the native chief, Karain. Fine figure of a man. Everyone loved him. Yet he seemed somehow nervous. One stormy night (lol), he swims aboard the white trader s schooner and tells them his story, viz: A Dutch trader steals away a woman from his tribe. He and his best friend vow to track them down and erase the shame. For years they are on the trail together, travelling all over the archipelago in pursuit. But slowly the beautiful girl s voice and then figure come to him in dreams and visions, talking, defending herself. Finally they find the Dutchman and the girl and his friend gives Karain a rifle and tells him to shoot the white man while he slays the girl with his dagger. But, as his dearest, oldest friend leaps from the bushes to carry out this plan, Karain is overcome by the secret memory of the voice of the girl and her secret presence. Before he knows what he has done, he has shot his friend. He has spared the vile white man s life. He gets away. But that night the girl s voice doesn t come to him. His friend s voice and shape come to him. And from that night onwards he is pursued, followed, haunted ! About the Author: Joseph Conrad, original name J zef Teodor Konrad Korzeniowski, (born December 3, 1857, Berdichev, Ukraine, Russian Empire [now Berdychiv, Ukraine] died August 3, 1924, Canterbury, Kent, England), English novelist and short-story writer of Polish descent, whose works include the novels Lord Jim (1900), Nostromo (1904), and The Secret Agent (1907) and the short story  Heart of Darkness  (1902). During his lifetime Conrad was admired for the richness of his prose and his renderings of dangerous life at sea and in exotic places. But his initial reputation as a masterful teller of colourful adventures of the sea masked his fascination with the individual ...(100 of 2481 words). Joseph Conrad was a Polish-British writer regarded as one of the greatest novelists to write in the English language. Though he did not speak English fluently until his twenties, he came to be regarded a master prose stylist who brought a non-English sensibility into English literature.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=EK9IEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"America is My Neighborhood","description":"A collection of portraits features the author's special circle of American working-class heroes and heroines, from an old-fashioned milkman to a young girl who conquered leukemia","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=lnIVq0qW_-kC&dq=America+is+My+Neighborhood&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Gas War: The Truth Behind the American Occupation of Afghanistan","description":"At first glance, the United States invasion of Afghanistan seemed like an obvious response to the horrifying attacks of September 11th, 2001.

In Stealing God s Thunder, the story of Benjamin Franklin s invention of the lightening rod and the resulting consequences, that sense of wonder and excitement and even fear comes beautifully to life. Philip Dray does a remarkable job of illuminating the ever-fascinating Franklin and, more than that, the way that he, and his invention, helped create the new scientific world.  Deborah Blum, author of Love at Goon Park: Harry Harlow and the Science of Affection Stealing God s Thunder is a concise, richly detailed biography of Benjamin Franklin viewed through the lens of his scientific inquiry and its ramifications for American democracy. Today we think of Benjamin Franklin as a founder of American independence who also dabbled in science. But in Franklin s day it was otherwise. Long before he was an eminent statesman, he was famous for his revolutionary scientific work, especially his experiments with lightning and electricity. Pulitzer Prize finalist Philip Dray uses the evolution of Franklin s scientific curiosity and empirical thinking as a metaphor for America s struggle to establish its fundamental values. Set against the backdrop of the Enlightenment and America s pursuit of political equality for all, Stealing God s Thunder recounts how Franklin unlocked one of the greatest natural mysteries of his day, the seemingly unknowable powers of electricity and lightning. Rich in historic detail and based on numerous primary sources, Stealing God s Thunder is a fascinating original look at one of our most beloved and complex founding fathers.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Hjw4TwsfeqgC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Mistletoe Magic (Harlequin Promo)","description":"A hospital clerk finds herself falling for an older physician in Betty Neels's \\"A Christmas Romance,\\" while an Australian reporter is reunited with her estranged husband in \\"An Outback Christmas by Margaret Way, and an abandoned child brings together a lonely woman and the local sheriff in Rebecca Winters's \\"Sarah's First Christmas,\\" in a trio of holiday romances.

Kolonel Jon Smith wordt gevraagd het militaire potentieel te bepalen van het apparaat en de bijbehorende implantaten. Hij ontdekt dat de Merge een nieuwe manier van oorlog voeren mogelijk maakt. Een uitvinding die niet in handen van Amerikas vijanden mag komen. Maar is de Merge wel zon zegen voor de mensheid als Dresner beweert? En wat is het verband met een bizarre slachting in Afghanistan? Het is duidelijk dat Dresner iets verbergt, maar wat?

In contrast to previous works, which have typically focused on the social and political relationship between blacks and Jews, Black Zion places religion at the center of its discussion, thereby illuminating a critically important but little explored aspect of black-Jewish relations in America. The essays gathered here examine groups such as the Nation of Islam and the Hebrew Israelites, individuals such as Martin Luther King, Jr., and Abraham Joshua Heschel, and topics such as the transformation of synagogue space into African American churches and the symbolic role of the Jew in the Haitian religious imagination. This collection draws on sacred texts, interviews, and ethnographic and archival research to discuss the shared elements in black and Jewish sacred life, as well as the development and elaboration of new religious identities by African Americans. Featuring contributions from a group of renowned scholars and writers, this groundbreaking volume reveals a great deal about both African American religions and the meaning of Judaism in the contemporary world. It is essential reading for students of religion, history, cultural studies, black studies, and American studies.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=wEU4_su7tNgC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Karen's School Mystery (Baby-Sitters Little Sister #57)","description":"Taking pride in their school safety patrol badges, Karen and Addie enjoy keeping the hallways safe, until things start disappearing all over the school and the girls decide to include detective investigating among their duties.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=LBEmCwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"At the Crossroads","description":"This book was written as a plea to the Muslims to avoid a blind imitation of Western social forms and values, and to try to preserve instead their Islamic heritage which once upon a time had been responsible for the many-sided historical phenomenon comprised in the term 'Muslim civilisation'.

Ivan Strenski traces the history of sacrificial thought in France, starting from its origins in Roman Catholic theology. Throughout, he highlights not just the dominant discourse on sacrifice but also the many competing conceptions that contested it. Strenski suggests that the annihilating spirituality rooted in the Catholic model of Eucharistic sacrifice persuaded the judges in the Dreyfus Case to overlook or play down his possible innocence because a scapegoat was needed to expiate the sins of France and save its army from disgrace. Strenski also suggests that the French army's strategy in World War I, French fascism, and debates over public education and civic morals during the Third Republic all owe much to Catholic theology of sacrifice and Protestant reinterpretations of it. Pointing out that every major theorist of sacrifice is French, including Bataille, Durkheim, Girard, Hubert, and Mauss, Strenski argues that we cannot fully understand their work without first taking into account the deep roots of sacrificial thought in French history.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=omgFVXAehg0C&dq=Contesting+Sacrifice:+Religion,+Nationalism,+and+Social+Thought+in+France&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"GREEK-ENGLISH LEXICON TO THE NEW TESTAMENT.","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=1E4VAAAAYAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"To Tame a Highland Warrior (The Highlander Series, Book 2)","description":"Gavrael McIllioch from the Berserker clan has sworn to defend his heart from love and serve his king, but Jillian of Ishtar once managed to penetrate his armor and she will one day draw him back to his home town.

At the end of the Civil War, a large study of racial difference employing the spirometer appeared to confirm the finding, which was then applied to argue that slaves were unfit for freedom. What is astonishing is that this example of racial thinking is anything but a historical relic. In Breathing Race into the Machine, science studies scholar Lundy Braun traces the little-known history of the spirometer to reveal the social and scientific processes by which medical instruments have worked to naturalize racial and ethnic differences, from Victorian Britain to today. Routinely a factor in clinical diagnoses, preemployment physicals, and disability estimates, spirometers are often  race corrected,  typically reducing normal values for African Americans by 15 percent. An unsettling account of the pernicious effects of racial thinking that divides people along genetic lines, Breathing Race into the Machine helps us understand how race enters into science and shapes medical research and practice.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=My90DwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Greek Way","description":"Originally published: New York: W.W.

She writes about the revolutionary efforts of RAWA, the genocidal campaign of the Taliban to extinguish the Hazara ethnicity in Afghanistan, the failure of the international community to ameliorate the alarming situation of Afghan refugees, and offers a first-hand account of the atrocities Afghan women have been suffering at the hands of the Taliban. The Silenced Cry is not only timely, but also compelling. With extremely evocative and poetic writing, Tortajada conveys the beauty of the landscape, and the wonderfully inspiring optimism of the people. In heart-wrenching detail, we see just how debilitated and wretched the conditions were, yet we also see people who still fought for freedom, democracy, and basic human rights. Candid and compassionate, never condescending or pitying, The Silenced Cry is a human, approachable, and provocative look at the best and worst in the human spirit.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=8AxOAgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Safe at Home: A Baseball Wife's Story","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=h5W1AAAACAAJ&dq=Safe+at+Home:+A+Baseball+Wife%27s+Story&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Commentary on the Dream of Scipio: By Macrobus (Records of Western Civilization)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=G-W8vwEACAAJ&dq=Commentary+on+the+Dream+of+Scipio:+By+Macrobus+(Records+of+Western+Civilization)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Desiring God's Own Heart: 1And 2 Samuel/1 Chronicles (The International Inductive Study Series)","description":"This invaluable study invites readers to discover the depths of God's grace and explore His provisions for their every need.

Janet and Steven Alger contend that the anti-social cat is a myth; cats form close bonds with humans and with each other. In the potentially chaotic environment of a shelter that houses dozens of uncaged cats, they reveal a sense of self and build a culture a shared set of rules, roles, and expectations that organizes their world and assimilates newcomers.As volunteers in a local cat shelter for eleven years, the Algers came to realize that despite the frequency of new arrivals and adoptions, the social world of the shelter remained quite stable and pacific. They saw even feral cats adapt to interaction with humans and develop friendships with other cats. They saw established residents take roles as welcomers and rules enforcers. That is, they saw cats taking an active interest in maintaining a community in which they could live together and satisfy their individual needs. Cat Culture's intimate portrait of life in the shelter, its engaging stories, and its interpretations of behavior, will appeal to general readers as well as academics interested in human and animal interaction.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=cqGf69mrUGwC&dq=Cat+Culture:+The+Social+World+of+a+Cat+Shelter+(Animals,+Culture,+and+Society)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Food Markets of the World","description":"An illustrated tour of the food markets of the world.

But first the submariners must face another danger...  It is regretted that hope of saving lives... must be abandoned.  Admiralty signal to C-in-C Plymouth, 1610 hrs on 3 June 1939 As the shadow of Nazism descends on Europe, Britain at last begins to prepare her defences. Trials start for a new class of submarine in the mouth of the Clyde. Royal Navy submariner Rufus Chalk, on board as an observer, has misgivings. There are technical problems, small enough in themselves but together possibly dangerous. On this first dive in the open sea, with numerous observers on board, if there were an accident the precious air supply would last only half as long as normal... Written by acclaimed naval veteran Alexander Fullerton and based loosely on the tragic loss of H.M. Submarine Thetis in Liverpool Bay in 1939, Not Thinking Of Death is an unputdownable novel.

The tradition took shape in the nineteenth century, motivated by a desire to map a modernist \\"third way\\" between orthodoxy and rationalistic deism/atheism. It is defined by its openness to modern intellectual inquiry; its commitment to the authority of individual reason and experience; its conception of Christianity as an ethical way of life; and its commitment to make Christianity credible and socially relevant to modern people. Dorrien takes a narrative approach and provides a biographical reading of important religious thinkers of the time, including William E. Channing, Ralph Waldo Emerson, Horace Bushnell, Henry Ward Beecher, Elizabeth Cady Stanton, and Charles Briggs. Dorrien notes that, although liberal theology moved into elite academic institutions, its conceptual foundations were laid in the pulpit rather than the classroom.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=rfV6FmMFzdoC&dq=The+Making+of+American+Liberal+Theology:+Idealism,+Realism,+and+Modernity,+1900-1950&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Johns Hopkins Atlas of Surgical Pathology (Cd-Rom For Windows and Macintosh, Individual Version)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=_x8QAQAAMAAJ&dq=The+Johns+Hopkins+Atlas+of+Surgical+Pathology+(Cd-Rom+For+Windows+and+Macintosh,+Individual+Version)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Next of Kin","description":"The death of Caro Meredith turns the lives of her grieving husband, in-laws, brother-in-law, and stepdaughter upside down as they all struggle to cope with the loss of a woman who had been the central figure in all their lives.

Origins of the Revolutionary Faith","description":"This book traces the origins of a faith--perhaps the faith of the century. Modern revolutionaries are believers, no less committed and intense than were Christians or Muslims of an earlier era. What is new is the belief that a perfect secular order will emerge from forcible overthrow of traditional authority. This inherently implausible idea energized Europe in the nineteenth century, and became the most pronounced ideological export of the West to the rest of the world in the twentieth century. Billington is interested in revolutionaries--the innovative creators of a new tradition. His historical frame extends from the waning of the French Revolution in the late eighteenth century to the beginnings of the Russian Revolution in the early twentieth century. The theater was Europe of the industrial era; the main stage was the journalistic offices within great cities such as Paris, Berlin, London, and St. Petersburg. Billington claims with considerable evidence that revolutionary ideologies were shaped as much by the occultism and proto-romanticism of Germany as the critical rationalism of the French Enlightenment. The conversion of social theory to political practice was essentially the work of three Russian revolutions: in 1905, March 1917, and November 1917. Events in the outer rim of the European world brought discussions about revolution out of the school rooms and press rooms of Paris and Berlin into the halls of power. Despite his hard realism about the adverse practical consequences of revolutionary dogma, Billington appreciates the identity of its best sponsors, people who preached social justice transcending traditional national, ethnic, and gender boundaries. When this book originally appeared The New Republic hailed it as \\"remarkable, learned and lively,\\" while The New Yorker noted that Billington \\"pays great attention to the lives and emotions of individuals and this makes his book absorbing.\\" It is an invaluable work of history and contribution to our understanding of political life.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=ucsMAQAAQBAJ&dq=FIRE+IN+THE+MINDS+OF+MEN.+Origins+of+the+Revolutionary+Faith&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Arts and Crafts Design in America: A State-by-State Guide","description":"Looks at stylistic examples from the arts and crafts movement of the late ninteenth and early twentieth centuries across the United States","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=rCE4AQAAIAAJ&dq=Arts+and+Crafts+Design+in+America:+A+State-by-State+Guide&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Archaeological Encyclopedia Of The Holy Land (Illustrated)","description":"Few theologians and historians have had direct access to the ancient buried city of Jerusalem, let alone to remains dating specifically from the time of Jesus.

Enter the Humanity Test: in a future when other techniques can change the forms of animals, so far it has been a guaranteed one hundred percent successful means of determining whether a life form started out as human. But now strange life forms, vicious and bestial, are proliferating throughout the Solar System. They are clearly not human, and clearly their nervous systems are too underdeveloped for them to have been human. But though the beasts threaten havoc and death to all the far flung isolated stations, the simple solution of shooting the varmints is impossible: for life forms that according to the Humanity Test started out human the law is very clear: Thou Shalt Not Kill.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=UnqZxpdZQooC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Standard Catalog of Buick, 1903-2000: Wouldn't You Really Rather Have a Buick","description":"Covering over 80 years of Buick heritage, this book includes information on identification data, engine specs, wheel and tires specifications, and many other details. 500 b&w illustrations. color photos.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=tUO8PQAACAAJ&dq=Standard+Catalog+of+Buick,+1903-2000:+Wouldn%27t+You+Really+Rather+Have+a+Buick&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Eblaitica Essays on the Ebla Archives and Elaite Language","description":"The first two volumes on patrimonialism in Ugarit and the ancient Near East, this book opens with a lengthy introduction on the interpretation of social action and households in the ancient world.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=tt6mDwAAQBAJ&dq=Eblaitica+Essays+on+the+Ebla+Archives+and+Elaite+Language&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Death and Life: An American Theology","description":"Of course, death will happen to all of us someday, but until then, it's not something to think about or grapple with.
