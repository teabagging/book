The methods are testable by anybody ready to put a sincere effort. The method of \`free streaming' has similarity to \`watching one's own thoughts' in various forms of meditation practised in oriental cultures. Written with insights and anecdotes it is nice reading although the price is a little high for people from the third world. It aptly justifies the importance of \`thinking in terms of images' i.e. the geometric way. But considering the fact that many great physicists like Dirac and others made their valuable contributions following the algebraic way i.e. thinking in terms of abstract symbols and mathematical forms, one wonders if genius can be attributed to \`thinking in terms of images' alone !

Also very interesting were the sections describing how the brain loses neuronal connections unless it is constantly exercised. This book inspired me to want to improve.

If he has been image streaming (etc) as much as this book implies, shouldn't he have some ungodly IQ and at least have a couple amazing intellectual accomplishments to show for it? There seems to be an intuitive feel to a lot of what he is saying, though. I don't see how doing something as mentally jogging as image streaming could do nothing for one's mind. Conventional IQ tests are not necessarily a good measure of a person's actual intelligence anyway. I would not be the least bit surprised if image streaming supplemented the ability to write and speak creatively, and perhaps solve problems.Another thing about the book--the very reading of something with so much emphasis on intelligence will make someone far more aware of their own intelligence. This can make people feel more intelligent, or even free them to ways of thinking they hadn't thought possible.Finally, placebo effect, anyone? What if people read an equally motivating and intriguing book about a method that just plain did not work? Doubtless, some of them would try the method and convince themselves that it worked, largely due to the principle in the above paragraph."},{"Title":"The Einstein Factor","review":"Wenger and Poe's book The Einstein Factor is an ideal primer on brainstorming both individually and in a group setting.The authors contend that the primary distinction between you and the geniuses of yore (Einstein, Edison, Rabelais, etc.) is their &quot;combinatorial play&quot; of other senses and thoughts and their openness to ideas. Through the technique of Image Streaming, the authors contend that normal folks can achieve similar results. In Image Streaming, you close you eyes and describe (aloud) the first image that you see without repressing any images.Sound like &quot;new age&quot; brainstorming to you? Perhaps, but the technique is a valid alternative to free association (writing down all the ideas that one comes up with and linking ideas and expanding on others). In addition to Image Streaming, the authors also suggest writing down your ideas citing the Mankato nuns of Mankato, Minnesota who lived longer lives because of the increased neural connections formed when writing.There are other valuable techniques contained in the text, but most are centered around the Image Streaming technique. If you are interested in alternative brainstorming techniques, this is the book for you. If you are looking for more general texts on improving one's mental abilities I suggest Scott Witt's How to Be Twice as Smart.Paul Erdos"},{"Title":"The Einstein Factor","review":"At the time of this writing, when I click on 'See all 91 reviews' ALL OF THE 5 STAR REVIEWS on the page (reviews 1-10) are written by a reviewer who has reviewed ONLY THIS BOOK!

I'm a college student interested in psychology - particularly learning and memory.In my opinion, the book offers a number of interesting strategies for becoming more creative. Win loves to explain everything in a crisp, clear manner. His lucid writing style will enable you to understand how things work - and also makes the book a very intersting read in general.Some of the things discussed in the book:1. Dream Recall - Actually remember your dreams each and every night.2. Using the First Law of Behavioral Psychology Advantageously - You get more of what you reinforce. Reinforce your own creativity so that you become more creative.3. Image Streaming - Use visual imagery and rich description to boost brain power.4. Photoreading - Absorb entire books and unlock the details you need.5. Freenoting - Remember everything you read or hear in a lecture with startling clarity.6. Achieving Flow - Strive to create a learning experience which puts you in a state of pleasantly absorbed concentration.This is not everything in the book - far from it. The book is chocked full of other little tidbits, stories, and ideas pertaining to accelerated learning which makes the book a great overall read.I do not agree with everything Mr. Wenger says. Photoreading, for example, seems to be a mixed-bag AT BEST. Cognitive Structural Enhancement also seems to be a shady, unlikely-to-produce results adventure. Borrowed Genius is plausible - it mainly just tries to get you to shift your perception, which will always be short-lived without conscious effort.The majority of what Mr. Wenger teaches I agree with. Image Streaming has great potential and I feel it does indeed aid my mental prowess. However, Mr. Wenger claims it is \\"proven\\" and makes outrageous claims about its power. Bottomline: It probably depends on the person. Give it a fair trial - it might be the most useful exercise you have ever done.Freenoting is probably my favorite technique in the book. Freenoting is a simple way to remember practically everything you read in a book or hear during a lecture. It operates on psychological principles and I have used it enough to know it works wonders. Try it - you will not be disappointed.Mr. Wenger makes great use of the First Law of Behavioral Psychology. He has lots of little applications for this one little principle - and they all work. You can use it to remember your dreams and become more creative - guaranteed. These techniques work and are also easy.Achieving flow is difficult to purposefully create - it seems to be one of those things that just happens naturally. I have yet to actually sit down and try to create a learning experience based on flow - but if I could, I am certain it would be the greatest learning experience of my life. I will look into that.The rest of the book describes various tidbits to try, such as image streaming in a way to increase blood flow to the brain, swimming underwater more often, etc. These are interesting theories and deserve a fair trial. An interesting story Mr. Wenger uses to talk about the power of the subconcious mind involves a japanese mathematics teacher and a unique teaching method. He has his students essentially complete math worksheets as fast as they can - racing against the clock essentially. A perfect score must be obtained before moving onto the next worksheet. This technique would be fun and practical - and you may want to try it yourself.All in all, the book is a great read. The theories are interesting and Mr. Wenger has a very lucid and engaging writing style to hold your attention. Some of the things in the book are very questionable; use your own judgement. Don't believe that image streaming will make you a genius overnight - that would be ridiculous. Will it increase your mental awareness and overall power? Maybe - and you should give it a fair trial in my opinion. Just because something is not proven does not mean it is not true, or even more important - that it cannot be proven to be true. The Theory of Evolution is not a proven theory - yet most scientists believe in it. Take everything with a grain of salt and use your own judgement."},{"Title":"The Einstein Factor","review":"Hello everyone, I truly believe that you can raise you IQ but it requires a little more work than Mr. Wenger suggests. His book I think is very important for it suggests a method that if used correctly may help people increase their IQ. Here is my method:1. Obtain a book named \\"How to Solve It\\" by George Polya (ISBN 0691023565), it contains great advice on how to go about solving nearly any type of problem, the ideas are a little abstract and sometimes difficult to apply. Don't just skim the book, do every single problem in the book.2. Obtain a book named \\"The Art and Craft of Problem Solving\\" by Paul Zeitz (ISBN 0471135712), this is the best book on problem solving. It will teach you how to think so you can solve nearly any type of problem. Don't just skim the book, do every single problem in the book.3. After you have gone through those two books, obtain a book named \\"Giant Book of Mensa Mind Challenges\\" (ISBN 1402710496). Solve every single problem in the book, go through the problems until you can solve any variation of the problems in a reasonable amount of time.4. Use Mr. Wengers image streaming technique, but instead of thinking of random \\"virtual worlds\\" in your head, focus on a Mensa problem and image stream your manipulation of its solution in your head. Do this until you can solve nearly any Mensa problem completely in your head never opening your eyes and writing something down.If you follow these 4 steps I guarantee that you will increase your IQ.More advice on how to increase your IQ:1. Obtain a memory improvement system by Harry Loraynehttp://www.harrylorayne.com/index.htmlUse it to memorize as many solutions to Mensa problems as possible, when test time comes and you notice a similar problem, it will be as easy as cake.2. Obtain or take part in a speed reading course, this will greatly facilitate reading the Mensa problems, also you can easily read more books on solving Mensa problems.3. Though research shows that Gingko Biloba alone does not increase mental ability, it does increase blood flow to your brain, so what you do is take a slow release Iron supplement (read the label don't over do it). The gingko runs more blood to your brain and the extra iron allows more oxygen to reach your brain cells increasing their efficacy, allowing you to think faster. Combine this with gotu kola. You should take the gotu kola every other day and the ginkgo twice a week. Drink coffee as often as possible. All of this is like nitrous injection or supercharging for your brain.(...)"},{"Title":"The Einstein Factor","review":"if you've ever been serious about bringing out the genius within, you must get this book!

The book is very interesting and fascinating to read. I found myself being skeptical of some of the author's techniques but everytime that happened I would read more and find more and more concrete information supporting such techniques. The author uses a ton of great examples and touches on so many different techniques. After reading the book I have researched some of the techniques and found that they are supported by many other \\"accelerative learning\\" groups. I also followed up on prelimary studies referenced in the book and they do in fact check out. I also followed up on the effects of music on intelligence and it also checks out. In addition the very premise of the author's theory about pole-bridging - a technique used to create associations between all parts of the brain and therefore increase intelligence, is exactly what learning music does. It has been proven that children who learn to play an instrument and read music score exceptionally higher on SAT's, etc. than those who don't. The reason is because reading music uses the eyes, pattern recognition, timing, touch, listening and feedback. All different areas of the brain. It is these complex associations which allow someone to problem solve with ease. If you find yourself saying that the techniques in the book are ridiculous then you don't have an objective open mind.

They do one of two things. They either take sperm from great scientists and hope that genius is easily inherited (which it isn't) or they bomabard their young children with information that is taught in school in the hope that they will learn it all and be a genius on the level of Newton and Einstein. They fail miserably so the programme concludes that &quot;Genius is beyond science&quot; (occasionally they get their child into university earlier than most people but that is ultimately superficial). It is clear that these people do not even understand what genius is:Genius is what creates something brilliant and originalBy &quot;brilliant and original&quot; I mean ideas such as Newton's Laws of Motion, Einstein's Theory of Relativity etc. These are not achieved by everyone except the rare geniuses because our natural ability to think on our own is squelched. As Einstein said of Faraday's dynamo &quot;Faraday never went to school, and therefore preserved the rare gift of thinking freely&quot;.This book is about restoring that gift.

Personal I had tried the techniques described in this book and it worked for me. Image streaming works by bringing into consciousness all the thoughts and perception that the brain produces which it shows in image form. That is the very reason why we have dreams when we sleep because DREAMS ARE ANALOGIC representations of the thoughts and perception that we had experience from the day or throught our whole lifetime. One of the techniques of image streaming is for the image producing faculties itself to interpret what the images means. This form of mental exercise conditions the brain to be more sensitive to relationships and analogies by stretching its powers in interpreting the analogies ( if training your mind to form associations from what seems to be unassociable ( which by the way is associable only on the deepest, deepest, sense )then how easy would it then be to form associations with more direct lines of learning such as logic?) that then forms our perception, and learning something ( not route memorization )requires us to perceive such relationships and analogies. This is what separates man from machines, the ability to see relationships and analogies. That is why I believe that creativity is synonimous with intelligence because understanding gets your brain to create such associations and if more of the different faculties of your brain are put into such operation ( through bringing them consciously online ) then learning and understanding would be quicker and more prominent. Remember the story of the great prophet Daniel of the bible, whose prophecies have mesmerized even the great minds that they devoted some of their time into studying it ( Isaac Newton ). He is said to have had been thought by God on the interpretion of dreams and was also said to have impressed kings ( King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon, The kings of Medo-Persia ) with his great WISDOM ( then termed as intelligence ) and excellent spirit. The readers that said &quot;it did not work for them&quot; possibly did not realise the importance of saying the images aloud and the describing of it in reach sensory detail. Describing the images aloud in reach sensory deatail conditions your mind to be alert and perceptive to even the tiniest, minutes, details, forcing you to realise things that you had never realised before which then increasess your intelligence. Put it this way, an intelligent man sees more of the world than that of his lesser intelligent self. For those of you who thinks the author claims the things he claims for business purposes then just go to his online &quot;Project Renaissance&quot; were you could get the image streaming method described in the book for free. Just one more thing, being aware of something gets the microscopic effect going. The microscopic effect is the effect that you get when you observe something and you tend to find yourself learning more and more about the thing. Now we all posses this ability, its a law of our minds, but imagine how intelligent you could be if this process is accelerated through mental conditioning? Your consciousness would be elevated to another level. Think of how you view the world now compared to when you were a little child. Dont you see and perceive more of the world now, obviously yes and that is because accelerated microscopic effect ( from your much mature mind ) forms more associations between the elements of your world and the more associations in turn forms a much deeper kind of association ( harder concepts and perception ) and in turn forms a much, much, deeper associations. You see, the bigger the number of assocations you begin with ( through an accelerated microscopic effect ) the more deeper in concept the final associations become. Image streaming conditions your mind in the forming of such associations."},{"Title":"The Einstein Factor","review":"This book has continually been bringing me joy in life because of the wide expanse of growth it has given me.

An even wiser person will also spend a balanced amount of time increasing his or her ability to learn. This is what this book is about. It is a very interesting read. The pages are dense with good info. I found the book to be difficult to understand. There were certain parts that I got stuck on for awhile. With patience, I was able to figure it out. Some of their claims are hard to believe at first. Read through it anyway. They explain how the techniques work. After you read for awhile you'll realize the authors are for real. There is only one technique that I have explored fully and made a habit. I know that the &quot;portable memory bank&quot; technique works from personal experience. It is basically writing in a notebook, but with a few rules. You take your notebook with you where ever you go (except on dates). When you get inspired, start writing. Keep your pen moving, writing any thought that comes to consciousness. You have a steady stream of thoughts in your unconscious. Let these thoughts enter your consciousness instead of choosing your thoughts. If you want you can consciously direct these thoughts at the start and in the middle if needed. Let your mind go free and be creative. Don't worry about structure, just trust the natural flow of your association process. When you have played with an idea to the point that you are content, enter phase two. Using what you have wrote, do an analysis on the subject. Use sound reasoning to come to your conclusions, and write these down. Michael Gelb's &quot;How To Think Like Leonardo da Vinci&quot; and &quot;Discover Your Genius&quot; also talks on keeping a notebook. To explain the technique better, I used what I learned from these two books also. These are two good books, and I think they compliment &quot;The Einstein Factor&quot; well, but they don't compare. My opinion is that &quot;The Einstein Factor&quot; is in a leage of it's own. And I'm a guy who loves self-help books. I have been using the &quot;portable memory bank&quot; technique for a year now. Writing in this manner brings about many quality, creative and perceptive thoughts. It has helped me: recover from clinical depression; learn that depression is the best thing that could have happened to me; learn what I want my life to be like; understand my dad; and learn about life in general. One time I almost got in a fight at a pick-up basketball game. Confused and upset, I resorted to my notebook. I learned the best way to handle the situation for when I would go back. Armed with this understanding, I showed more courage than I ever had before. We put aside our differences. The &quot;portable memory bank&quot; is a crude form of &quot;image streaming&quot;, which is the main technique of the book. &quot;Image streaming&quot; is the far more powerful technique. Each one stimulates brain faculties that the other doesn't, and it is best to use the two in tandom, especially if used on the same subject. You should look forward to these techniques and countless others. &quot;The Einstein Factor&quot; is a gold mine."},{"Title":"The Einstein Factor","review":"I purchased this book almost seven months ago and have followed its teachings to a T. I am displeased to report that I have experienced no significant increases in my IQ, memory, creativity, or any other mental faculty that this book claims to improve. I would like to stress, though, that I feel Dr. Wenger's intentions are genuine and that there probably are people who have experienced marvelous gains of mental ability through his teachings. I am not one of them, and that is why I tossed the book in my garbage this morning. I will try The Memory Book next and report back on that."},{"Title":"The Einstein Factor","review":"The Einstein Factor is a fascinating book with bold claims of cognitive exercises that can dramatically increase intelligence and enhance academic performances. Wenger outlines and discusses each of them, and all of his ideas are worthy of reading.The topic of image streaming is quite noteworthy. I agree that it is amazing how, while you are in a relaxed state while recording your thoughts, your mind works. For instance, you might recall names and events that were not discussed in years, or you might see objects that mysteriously \\"appear in your mind\\" and upon exploration realize that it is an important connection to an essential that could be so significant as being either life-changing or life-saving, or even both. Sometimes, you might have moments of clarity that almost make you want to cry, \\"EUREKA!\\"As an educator, not only did I find the topic of image streaming fascinating, but I was also impressed that Wenger so much as tackled the term Socratic dialogue. He discussed that if one is an advocate of this educational practice, then he or she must deem it important to not only be able to think critically and independently but to also deepen investigation while searching for truths. Wenger goes on to suggest that many so-called pedagogy reformers and administrators have unfortunately eliminated it from classroom settings and should possibly be regarded as culprits of a failed modern-day American school system.The topics and viewpoints are interesting. However, I did find the suggested idea of \\"putting yourself inside a noteworthy genius\\" and then following through with an approach based upon some interpretation of what he or she might have done quite disturbing. There are perhaps those geniuses whose cognitive achievements can leave one in awe; however, many of them have, unfortunately, also exercised habits that reflected not those of a great thinker but, instead, those of an individual with little or no character.All in all, it is a fascinating read. The exercises are mind-expanding, but they can be potentially quite time-consuming . They can demand that you find a quiet place when you actually have no choice but to remain in a public area.If you are a student and you need to develop cognitive exercises that can be used in both open and closed settings, I recommend Brain Building: Exercise Yourself Smarter by Marilyn vos Savant. For those who want to read accounts of how one's genius and creativity have overcome obstacles to make great contributions to society, I suggest The Creative Spirit by Goleman, Kaufman, and Ray."},{"Title":"The Einstein Factor","review":"This book is fantastic; it set off cognitive fire alarms for me.While Wenger's claims about a set amount of Image Streaming increasing IQ linearly may not be scientifically verified, i can say that this book has helped me to become far more focused and creative in my thinking in the six months since I bought it.The Image Streaming method allows you to play around with all sorts of images and ideas and new associations between them. The Hidden Question method has unbelievable power to make you think of quesitons in new ways. The discussons on the importance of feedback, questions and oxygen among others are invaluable.This book is simply a godsend if you want be to a creative artistic type. Just buy it."},{"Title":"The Einstein Factor","review":"I don't have to say anything about the methods listed on this book. They really are helpful. Besides that, it also sparked my interest in Quantum Cosmology(there's a page on Superstring theory, really interesting), philosophy (Plato's Cave and the Socratic Method)etc. If you may be a bit disbelieving about the methods outlined, at least buy it for its informative quality(I mean, at least it tells you new things)"},{"Title":"The Einstein Factor","review":"This book will not do what it claims. Almost all people who pick up this book will do so to try to reach the hightened IQ that it promises. I see no way that it can work. The \\"proof\\" really does not exist, and the \\"scientific\\" explanations behind the method could only be called pseudoscience, or quackery.Now, there is some science there that is reasonable, such as the background on flow, and some basic concepts about association, but it does not hold together at all.The only possible saving factor is that it attempts to get the reader to use their imagination to explore knowledge. This is normal, simple free association, and nothing really special. One may do the same using keyword lists, free association, or stream of conciousness writing (all are accepted learning strategies), but these are not new. It is just one way using your imagination.Although it is a good idea to find ways to use your imagination, this book will still mislead. The left/right brain mythology used is similar to other books, such as the mind mapping literature, and will have a similar effect; It leads people to buy further dubious products.There are other arguments, such as - Einstein didn't need it, so why should you?, but in general, there is no need for them. Nothing is proven here. There is one guarantee though; This book is going to be disappointing people for many years into the future.If you like imagery, then ok, but an IQ booster? Give it a miss!"},{"Title":"The Einstein Factor","review":"The author tried some experiments within a process caled image-streaming. A dubious measure of IQ both before and after indicated that an increase of 1 IQ point per hour was yours for the taking if you applied the technique.I guess the authors are pretty confident that most of the potential audience are pretty thick since average to 'gifted' is just 30 hours away and genius levels of IQ are just 50 hours of this technique away. Sounds about right, yes?Frankly there's nothing wrong with image-streaming - it's an interesting technique and you're likely to enjoy a number of the exercises in the book. BUT - they aren't going to make you as smart as Einstein nor are the purported levels of IQ gain likely to occur. If it really happened as suggested don't you think you would have heard about it somewhere other than on the back cover of this book?Please Mr Wenger, prove me wrong and reproduce the results in controlled tests. With calibrated tests? No? Says a lot really."},{"Title":"The Einstein Factor","review":"This book is total nonsense. It does not raise IQ one iota. Just more new-age mumbo-jumbo.One would be much better just doing a standard relaxation/meditation every evening after work/school.Work needs to be done to test the claims of these techniques, since many more hardworking, overworked professionals such as myself, are being suckered into buying them. The subsequent waste of time , just causes more stress etc !!Go a walk, a jog, play with the kids, just spend your 30mins a day doing something worthwhile."},{"Title":"The Einstein Factor","review":"Very interesting book.

I'm not trying to be (too) facetious here, but I have grown increasing frustrated with books, web sites, and other media that try to reduce \\"genius\\" to a matter of will and technique. The intentions might be honorable, but there are at least two serious problems with this approach. First, like too many other products pitched at effort-averse Americans (and I count myself in this category!), they promise far too much for far too little investment, and they prey on widespread insecurities. Whether it's books like this that offer \\"genius\\" in return for \\"image-streaming\\" (which sounds suspiciously like daydreaming), or CDs that promise you the ability to \\"meditate like a Zen monk,\\" or similar products, the bargain they offer seldom pays off and also devalues the real effort required for personal growth (intellectual or spiritual). Second, like most self-help products, they are marketed at the insecure and self-doubting, those who feel that they are insufficiently intelligent, capable, and disciplined to succeed. Now, there's nothing wrong with trying to become more intelligent, more competent, and more self-disciplined, but there's something disingenuous about offering a glorified form of day-dreaming as a means to this end. Sadly, there's no substitute for committing oneself to doing the hard work of learning something in excruciating, sometimes tedious detail."},{"Title":"The Einstein Factor","review":"I read this paperback years ago and I enjoyed it. But there's nothing about it that warrants even the $28 price tag on the used copies, let alone $150+ on the new ones. Save your money; this is highway robbery."},{"Title":"The Einstein Factor","review":"I am a 12 year old boy with an expectional memory. Just ask my classmates.When my teacher asked the class where should they look if they wanna find information for an assignemnt he was assigning us, my friend said ask Dmitri.But anyway getting back. I must read 200 hundred books a year and I can honestly tell you this is so far the best book on geniuses and how to become a genius. The techniques in the book are absolutely incredible.One of the things that impressed me by the book was how it explained how geniuses such as Einstein thought about things. For example one of the methods in the book is freenoting. What it is is basically reading a chapter of any book than getting a piece of paper and write and draw things on the paper. It can be anything. Lines drawing anything. After your done look at the picture and ask yourself what do with picture want to tell me. For example if you read a chapter of this book and drew picutres of a brain, you would ask yourself about why you drew that brain and you would find out that you drew that brain because you remembered that in the book they talked about how einstein's brain had many neurons.This explains so much about me cause I have the same thing but the pictures are in my head. By looking at the picture in my mind I can recall what that picture stands for. For example, sometimes I have the image of Einstein with a gray coat sitting and facing me while laughing. This reminds me of the quote that einstein says in the book. The quote is that education is everything that you remember after leaving school. I don't know if I wrote it down correctly.The image streaming is also good and after I did it I immediately felt dreary just as one of the reviewers said before me.This book is honestly good. Honestly. If you don't believe me ok. Just go to the library and get this book. You don't even have to do all the things the book tells you to do to know that it works.I am usually a person that does not do the exercises in a book I am reading but this one even before I did the exercises for real. The exercises are good.So in conclusion get this book. It is good. If you wanna improve your memory get the memory book by harry Lorayne. Please excuse my grammar and my typing and don't take this as a lie that says I am faking when I say that I am above average as a child."},{"Title":"The Einstein Factor","review":"I am neither a PhD nor a specialist, in fact I am an ordinary individual that pursuit being more happy and smart. I could hardly measure the value and the impact that that book made in my life. Image Streaming is a door you have to open, and if you believe to yourself and give to your subconscious a chance, something will wait for you on the other side. It can be anything! Your subconscious will tell you. A grain of sand may have a whole universe, and some complex image could mean a single step you should take in your life. Worth reading, scientifically supported and very much needed for everyone. Thanks Win Wenger and Richard Poe. I'll spread the word. I.Q is just a minor detail, but if you mind about it, any person will feel more intelligent and capable by the end of each session."},{"Title":"The Einstein Factor","review":"Describing an image links the visual part of your brain to the linguistic part, causing an increase in synaptic connections. We learn best when we balance mental input with output. For example, a good conversation is better than just talking or just listening. You learn alot more when your mind actively organizes, instead of passively reading. So take notes and write a brief review of what you have read; if you make a habit of just that, you will get smarter.I don't know about &quot;Image streaming&quot;, but several other concepts in this book are very valuable."},{"Title":"The Einstein Factor","review":"I have been fascinated by a description of a process called STREAMING for connecting the unconscious mind to the conscious brain in the book 'The Einstein Factor,' and noticed how it corresponded to descriptions of what happens to a person when they go into what scientists in Europe call orgasm.Specifically they both talk about turning off the frontal cortex in the brain to connect with something deeper underneath the stream of normal consciousness. Dr. Charles Reinart did research indicating that people's IQs went up 0.4 points per hour when they practiced this technique. I have been wondering what it does to the Orgasmic Quotient.The authors note that as you begin these exercises your sensation stream may be weak because you have been ignoring and repressing it. As you begin practicing the sensations will become stronger and more vivid. A form of resistance, they call the squelcher block us from achieving our full mental capacity. At the root of the activation process is your daily practice of Sensual Streaming. Once you have opened you mind to the subtle messages of the right brain and limbic system, the other components of the Genius Meme will fall into place naturally. Your own perception will guide you on the way showing you at every step what to do next.The Squelcher is the mechanism in the brain that tends to shut down ingenious thought. It is mainly a left-brain function. Its natural mode of expression is logic, language, and analysis. It squelches insight with questions like 'Does this idea make sense?' or 'Is there any precedent for this?' To bypass the left-brain, we must learn to squelch the squelcher. Allow ideas to flow in freely, deferring critical judgment for a later time. A speedy input of data can short-circuit the right brain. When Streaming, we talk, listen and generate imagery at a normal pace, yet we experience an overload as great as if we were trying to understand a fast talking auctioneer. As our perceptions collide in a feedback loop of rapid flowing perception, left-brain thinking is broken up, and the violence of that collision gives rise to 'standing waves' of insight in startling elegant new forms. The more complexity we bring into our thought process, the more room we create for dramatic state changes.Sensations enter the brain at a distinct port of entry. Then it is processed, tagged, and shunted around the brain for further processing. To get an 'aha' effect you need to get as many different parts of the brain as possible working on that stimulus simultaneously. You want the sequence by which the different brain regions fall into phase with one another to be times so closely that any given stimulus is discharged across the brain before close out instructions can be attachedHow To Sense Stream1. Describe the sensations aloud either to another person or a tape recorder. Describing them silently will defeat the purpose.2. Use all 5 senses and conceptual thought in the descriptions. Describe taste, texture, smell, colors, and sounds.3. Phrase all of the descriptions in the present tense.The Principle of Description1. When you describe any object, real or imaginary at the same time you are observing it, the very act of description focuses your attention in such a way that you perceive more and more detail about the object being described.2. Describing an object aloud to an external focus, such as a live listener or voice recorder is the strongest way we know of to build this additional discovery effect.3. The more sensory your description and the less abstract and explanatory, the more powerful the effects, especially when you are describing abstract or complex situations (as distinct from concrete ones).The feedback principle: The more you describe something the more you get. Fudging or making up experiences is a legitimate imaginative process that feeds back to the unconscious mind and triggers more spontaneous imagery.The goal is to achieve a completely spontaneous flow of uncensored uninhibited imagery. At a certain point you will not have to struggle to get an image. You will be surprised by the abundance of images, their startling clarity and their bizarre and unexpected subject matter. When this has happened you have begun to Sensation Stream.[...]"},{"Title":"The Einstein Factor","review":"Being quite motivated to take my intelligence to the next level, I bought this book with high hopes. What I found was that the author has never proven any of his techniques and leaves the reader with a messy set of guidelines from which to follow. The good reviews coming before this are probably just a consequence of people following each other's lead. No one has yet provided IQ scores( which is the result of image streaming - the main technique ). Don't buy this book if you have hopes of increasing your intelligence"},{"Title":"The Einstein Factor","review":"Great Price! Book was in great shape! Fast Shipping!

I have always been a wiz in school, I never study anything I guess I just have a good memory. I always wondered why I was this way and why others weren't. I don't remember doing anything special as a kid besides playing an instrument, which the author touches upon. However I see no evidence that his methods work, no studies except one done by a Physics professor. There's really nothing scientific about what he's done. I think that maybe your intelligence can be improved slightly, but not in the monumental proportions that this guy is talking about.The book appeals to most of the population who have trouble in school and who are looking for a quick fix. I seriously doubt that Image Streaming does anything but increase visualization. If Dr. Wenger can provide adequate evidence that his method works then great. However until then I will remain skeptical about his work."},{"Title":"The Einstein Factor","review":"This is for the person who said image streaming has no credible evidence of producing results. Also they claimed they tried image streaming for 15 minutes everyday for six months. Really you must have been doing something wrong, I have not read this book but I can tell you 15 minutes is a very short time for image streaming. You're meant to be pushing yourself, for me personally after I have image streamed for a minimum of 30 minutes all at once my head feels heavy like I have done something. Just thought people should know so they don't get mislead by one person's subjective opinion."},{"Title":"The Einstein Factor","review":"As we all probably realize reviewers are often writing reviews to gain insights for themsleves and not necessarily for the gain of the people who may be reading these criticisms. It is in this spirit that I am writing this review.I have read &quot;The Einstein Factor&quot; several times now and I do truly enjoy the personalities of the author's as the book does seem to brighten my day when I venture onto it's pages. However trying some of the techniques initailly made me uneasy and after reading the reviews on this page I tend to be even more weary about actually employing them. I am speaking specifically of the technique called Image Streaming in which you conjure up images from your right brain. Readers on this site have confessed that they often experienced hallucinations that made it difficult to concentrate after trying these techniques and I am afraid this may happen to me. Does anybdody have evidence to the contrary? Has this worked for anybody? Did any laymen out there experience measurable gains in their intellect?I find Win Wenger to be a very wonderful writer with what seems like benevolent intentions and the book is a wonderful read. I just have to admit to a certain uneasy apprehension, am I justified in this?"},{"Title":"The Einstein Factor","review":"Scientists at Princeton University recently discovered that the brain can grow new cells throughout life.

Purchase the book and commit to 80 minutes image streaming daily for a year and see if you aren't the world's smartest person at the end! This is the method I used to go from being a high school dropout to a tenured professor at Harvard Medical School."},{"Title":"The Einstein Factor","review":"Win Wenger's Einstein factor is fabulous. I have listened to it on the audio CD set. I bought the book also but the CD's are so incredible I have not gotten around to reading the book.I was skilled in hypnotism and the subconscious mind before theses cd's, so what Win says on them already makes lots of sense since it is not all new to me. But plenty new even for me.Before these cd's I already knew the subconscious contained tons more power than modern science currently understood or has yet chartered. Definitely more that colleges or society teaches us.I have been using image streaming for one year before I bought these cd's so when I began listening to them, they instantly began taking me to a higher level (WELL, WITHIN ONE WEEK). Plus it helps that I was already hungry for more and listened to them with sincere expectations of purer more powerful results.If faith has no value, then why does science consistently get 33% results in improvment with all tests containing placebos?When I got them, I listened to 4 out of 6 all in one sitting to get a feel for them.Some was for beginners (CERTAINLY A GREAT PLACE FOR STARTING & THE ADVANCED) and other parts were beyond my current skill set. I grabbed the pieces that fit me and began working with it. Only a little at a time, 10-15 minutes a day. Recording my dreams and practicing my power of observation while recording has surpassed my expectations by miles. Two weeks after the first listen, I began to notice my mind getting much sharper and my observation deeper in depth (WITH ONLY 5-10 MINUTES A DAY OF PRACTICE). The incredible results fueled me to increase my image streaming to 45 minutes daily. Again the results totally astound me and I'm only into the cd's about 3 or 4 weeks. I'm up to cd's 3 & 4. I practice what I learn about 1 week before moving on to the next part.As Win promised, I have found a source of supreme infinite information within myself and now that me and my subconscious are practicing communicating together, I am able to receive the answer to any question that I wish to receive an answer for.Think about this, name the answer you want, then ask that question properly, add a little patience and you can have it. Wont the proper answers give you anything you want in life?This is within the realm of magic as far as results go. I am learning to control powers and my thinking to achieve or acquire anything I want. But its not free, its not welfare. Its you reap what you sow. If you put the energy and action into seeking it for real, then its yours. Wishing alone does not work.For years I am and was a bible scholar, the bible steered me to chase knowledge which led me to search accelerated learning and then found Win Wengers website.Proverbs 2:3 Yea, if thou criest after knowledge, and liftest up thy voice for understanding;4 If thou seekest her as silver, and searchest for her as for hid treasures;5 Then shalt thou understand the fear of the LORD, and find the knowledge of God. Proverbs 2:10 When wisdom entereth into thine heart, and knowledge is pleasant unto thy soul;11 Discretion shall preserve thee, understanding shall keep thee:12 To deliver thee from the way of the evil Proverbs 3:20 By his knowledge the depths are broken up, and the clouds drop down the dew.21 My son, let not them depart from thine eyes: keep sound wisdom and discretion:22 So shall they be life unto thy soul Proverbs 5:1-2 Proverbs 8:8-12 and tons and tons more.I am also learning to read other people concisely and understand their driving factors so I can influence them for my own entertainment. While I use this for my own entertainment, I of course wish well for everyone and enjoy improving their lives as my own.I am able to reprogram myself faster and easier than NLP taught me.I also fully believe another factor that is assisting me in receiving such spectacular results, is I'm slowly reading an e-book called \\"master key system\\" This book is free on the net so search for it. Its as powerful as Win Wengers material. Studying these two simultaneously is bringing me supercharged results as catalysts do in chemistry when you mix the right certain ingredients. My results are explosive and so much fun.Finally the key to anything I pursue.Even if your not mixing a supreme combination of studies for explosive results, certainly buy the Einstein Factor book or Cd's and actually do the image streams. In merely a few weeks you shall be astounded with the other brain power you have that you never even imagined you had.If you only get 15% of the results that I am, then it will still be the best money you ever spent in your life.3 weeks ago I needed reading glasses for reading. Now I have commanded my brain to rejuvenate my eyes as my brain created them previously. I add action of forcing myself to read without glasses, and now my eyes are getting faster and faster at adjusting perfectly for me to read without glasses. There are tons of other results but I am not ready to write a book for you yet.Warning: having the study material but not actually practicing and exercising it is the same as having a million dollar check you don't actually take to the bank and cash.Just do as you wish to reap. Yes, its golden.If anyone else is receiving results along the realm of true magic/science, I would be interested in conversing with you.SincerelyChrisproinvent1(at)arc.net"},{"Title":"The Einstein Factor","review":"If You want to smell third thousand year thinking, READ IT"},{"Title":"The Einstein Factor","review":"Este libro y el sitio mantenido por Win Wenger son un claro ejemplo de la pseudociencia al estilo de la Dian&eacute;tica y la Cientolog&iacute;a.

Win Wenger has worked in the area of accelerated learning for 25 years before he wrote this book. My personal experience has convinced me that accelerated learning has significant credibility.For example; during an MBA program I took back in the late 1980s I had a sixteen week Micro Economics class taught by Dr. Gertmenian (affectionately called Dr. G) who believed in accelerated learning. In those short sixteen weeks he taught us the basics of micro-economics, macro-economics, and spice it with religion, law and investing. It was one of the toughest, most fun sixteen weeks I have ever had.Dr G. explained the faster one learns, the more is retained. I found this to be true in my own life on many occasions. When have little time on a subject of interest, we are much more focused on the things that really matter. Consequently, we retain the important points. And, our brains aren't cluttered with less significant issues.The Einstein Factor Image provides a wealth of ideas on how to improve ones mental abilities using accelerated learning. It does this by providing compelling examples of how the geniuses of yesterday and today were/are able to do what they do by using methods such as image streaming.Wenger's upbeat tone encourages everyone to tap into their genius potential. It makes this read insightful, powerful and encouraging.For example, in the Are You a Genius Chapter Wenger states: \\"Over the years, my studies have led me consistently to the conclusion that geniuses are little more than ordinary people who have stumbled upon some knack or technique for widening their channel of attention, thus making conscious their subtle, unconscious perceptions.\\"We all have amazing critical thinking abilities that frequently go untapped. This book, and others like it help many people to begin to realize their potential genius...or at least consider it. It won't be right for everyone. No book ever is.

I find Dr.wegner's theories very convincing yet somewhat skeptical. I am still studying the book currently and have found the techniques beneficial so far.In any case, I am inclined to agree with another reviewer who stated that image streaming and its benefits do take a matter of years for full fledged benefit.

Much of the hype and propoganda, however, has been that the process can create a 20 point gain in IQ, relying on the 1989 study by Dr. Charle P. Reinert, the \\"Reinert Study\\". The following link will take you to the abstract -http://www.themindaccelerator.com/research/rp2.htmThe study, however, does not detail a 20 point gain in IQ through image streaming, unless I am reading the abstract wrong. It discusses a much lower gain, less than half the advertised 20 point gain in certain circumstances. As for the validity of the test, not enough detail is noted in the abstract for one to objectively judge for themselves. Unfortunately, this discrepnancy has resulted in a diminished outlook on this technique to several persons. It is unfortunate, because the technique is worth learning and can be very beneficial when combined with other cognitive techniques, such as the Sedona Method."},{"Title":"The Einstein Factor","review":"This book lifts the veil of how geniuses throughout history have thought, thereby allowing the reader to try on the thinking styles of the great minds. Regardless of the debate as to whether this book increases IQ, the insight into how geniuses think is worth the cost alone. It covers the infamous scientists such as Einstein, to the creative genius of DaVinci and the less known thinkers such as Russia's journalist Shereshevesky.Although it may not be scientifically proven to live up to it's claims of a drastic increase in IQ, the tactics used in this book are great for expanding and exploring your mind. Sure image streaming may not primarily produce IQ increases in logic, vocabulary or math like A Customer and other reviewers were angered about, but that's not the goal. Image streaming does help with memory, creative thinking, relaxing, and visualization, and boosts in these areas can secondarily increase test scores but that is only if used in a tool for studying the standardized test categories."},{"Title":"The Einstein Factor","review":"Convinced by the reviews I had read in Amazon, I decided to 'take the plunge' and buy this book. I was not disappointed. The book contains a wealth of information for increasing your intellect and gaining access to the subconscious mind. I was hopeful, but at the same time somewhat cynical about techniques such as Freenoting, Photoreading and Socratic Learning, but I gave them the benefit of the doubt. I have put all three into effect, among others, and have learnt to trust my unconscious insights and to control my 'Editor'. I am a university student studying macroeconomics, and I was cramming for my exams weeks before. Usually I would have been anxious, but since I had become familiar with some of the methods in the book I felt confident in my ability to learn before the exam and to perform on the day. I felt relaxed (the book teaches you about that as well). My enthusiasm for study has increased greatly. It's wonderful to know that after a short period spent Photoreading you can go to bed, because the brain absorbs what you have learnt during sleep! And instead of tedious notetaking I make amusing comments and witty remarks about what I am reading, often scribbling on the text itself (in pencil). When reviewing, I made fun.Photoreading is based on relaxed unconscious learning. It is so powerful that when reading through copious amounts of academic texts I merely flick through the pages, without focusing on the words on the page. eye with no conscious effort on my part. I kid you not. It took me a bit of time to realise this and I'm still learning to confine myself to reading only the bits that this intuition leads me to, but I'm getting there. subtle in their effects. If you consciously look out for your 'inner voice' or for subtle insights, the chances are that you won't find them. You've got to be relaxed and you've got to be patient and learn to not put your mind under pressure to perform. You will not be disappointed.I wasn't Factor's instructions, I proceeded to Photoread my entire macroeconomics textbook several times over a number of weeks. The book is hundreds of pages long, yet each Photoreading session only took about 15 minutes. Soon, I found myself focusing on certain chapters, which I 'sensed' were the areas I needed to read. When I eventually sat down to learn macroeconomics the conventional way, I was getting insights before the author had confirmed them in the text, and new information felt familiar and comfortable. I was 'drawing it out' of my unconscious and creating something new. I was reaching fresh insights. I couldn't believe it. Needless to say, I now find macroeconomics rather enjoyable!The Einstein Factor has become a part of my life. Not only do the techniques accelerate your mind, but the book's a good read as well. It's written in a clear manner with informative diagrams, is well paced in its progression and has snippets of intriguing information on topics ranging from quantum physics and the 'ideal realm' to Mozart and the evolution of man's intelligence through the ages (memetic evolution). It's a quality product; a pleasure to spend time with. I'm getting it for my sister as a birthday present. Trust me, you want to get it too. And y'know what? I haven't even been concentrating on Wenger's main technique, Image Streaming. I've only tried it a handful of times. And yet during this time I have started to dream (or rather, started to recall my dreams) during REM sleep. I have had brainwaves coming out of the blue, and I mean 'Eureka!' I have begun creative writing and consciously use all my senses in my day to day life. The potentials for further development with time and persistence are mind-boggling.I didn't even realise how much this one book had impacted on my life until I sat down to write this review. That's how subtle the the event, because you'll be in flow and totally focused. You'll be in that state that's referred to as 'being in the zone', when anything is possible. Win Wenger has dubbed it 'creative fire'. And anyone can get there. It's certainly my goal.Win Wenger and Richard Poe have put together a masterpiece. Buy this book and prepare yourself for a glad, rich and waiting for a genius like YOU."},{"Title":"The Einstein Factor","review":"Recently there seems to be a lot of books being released on how to increase one's intelligence, this book seemed to be the only one that actually gave a method that worked. Image Streaming works, there's no doubt about it, but one thing that I cannot stress enough - if you want to become a genius or become more intelligent you need to put in the effort. The book suggests 15 minutes of Image Streaming a day but if you really want results you should practice for at least an hour. The reason is, according to the book and other studies* one's IQ raises 0.9 pts for every hour put in, if you put in 15 minutes a day your IQ will raise gradually of course but best results are achieved through more practice.The reason this book is called the Einstein Factor is because of the notion of how Einstein developed his intelligence. Einstein as many people have heard was dyslectic. People who knew him as a child assumed he would never amount to anything. At the age of 16, while he was sitting in class, he thought about what it would be like to ride on a beam of light. He then pondered what would happen if he put a mirror in front of his face - would he see a reflection? This thought/idea is what apparently accelerated Einstein into his genius. Over the next 10 years Einstein contemplated this idea using methods apparently such as Image Streaming. He was heralded as a genius when he was 26 so the process wasn't overnight, but going from a dyslecsic/&quot;retarded&quot; state of mind to genius is quite a leap and that is what Dr. Wenger is trying to show the reader. When Einstein died in 1955 his brain was disected, researches found that he had a significantly larger number of neurotransmitters/neuroconnections, especially in what seemed to be an extremely well developed corpus callosum (the nerves that bind the hemispheres of the brain). Image Streaming is about arousing new areas of the brain and having the hemispheres of the brain work together.The reason I gave this book 4 stars was because of the &quot;photo reading&quot; section of the book. I tried to go into it with an open mind, but the simple concept of reading at 32,000 words per minute is somewhat absurd, regardless of the claims that Dr. Wenger makes. He says that you're supposed to view the pages with your subconscious and the information will come to you when you need it. That's not very reassuring when one needs to ensure that he/she knows the information, for instance if someone has a test he/she needs to study for. If you are interested in speed reading I suggest picking up Power Reading - ISBN: 0960170618. It is an excellent book on how to accelerate one's reading capabilities.Looking at Einstein as a model, it took Einstein 10 years to shift into a &quot;genius&quot; - testimonial to this method's validility based upon his contributions to physics, and impact on society. Intertwined with the tutorials, Dr. Wenger provides insight into some of the most recognized minds, detailing on how each person recognized their gift and utilized it to their advantage.*Mind Accelerator (ISBN: 0973197102) is another book that seems to demonstrate the method of Image Streaming. More information can be found about this book at http://www.themindaccelerator.com/"},{"Title":"The Einstein Factor","review":"\\"Einstein Factor\\" by Dr. Win Wenger purports to raise I.Q. by 1 pt per 80 minutes of \\"Image-Streaming\\", the main I.Q. building exercise prescribed in the title. This claim is largely based on anecdotal reports and the \\"Reinert Studies\\" for which no crucial details of experimental design are given; nor have these \\"results\\" (Increased I.Q.) been replicated by credible researchers anywhere. As noted in the Washington Post, the erstwhile \\"professor\\" Charles Reinert is currently a practitioner of long distance healing therapy. Draw what conclusions you may from this.Perhaps most damning to Dr.Wenger's hypothesis is the fact that current learning theories and present neuroscience make no allowance for such dramatic increases of I.Q. Save of course for children suffering from massive nutritional deficiency who are consequently well fed and cared for. Intelligence to a large extent is biologically determined, just like height. Roughly speaking, you get what you were born with. That is why it is so difficult to \\"increase\\" intelligence except in exceptional circumstances such as the one illustrated above.I have personally \\"Image-Streamed\\" for the last 6 months as per the explicit directions stipulated in \\"Einstein Factor\\" for 12 to 15 minutes everyday with no appreciable difference in I.Q. as measured by a battery of standardized tests (SAT, LSAT, GMAT) or in any numinous aspects. And it is not as if I previously scored near the very top percentile of these exams so as to preclude any improvement on subsequent attempts. I have yet to take the Raven's Matrices though I have no reason to believe that the result will be any different. I simply have no evidence of any kind of advancement in any aspect of my \\"intelligence\\" via \\"Image-Streaming\\".Aside from ballot box stuffing and confirmation bias I suspect that some of the superlative reviews are due to the fact that \\"Image-Streaming\\" does seemingly produce a few side effects, mainly the stirring up of old memories. I can personally attest to this myself. However this side effect does not equate to an improved memory but rather just the remembrance of a few random images. Interesting, but nothing to hang your hat on. Perhaps I am an outlier and if most people undertaking Image-Streaming are indeed experiencing massive I.Q. surges it is then only a matter of time before mainstream scientists pick up on this and conduct legitimate studies. One would think this would have already happened, as a number of years have elapsed since \\"Einstein Factor\\" was published. But alas, no such events have transpired.At any rate I find it entirely disingenuous to base the validity of \\"Image-Streaming\\" on anecdotal evidence and one flimsy pseudo-experiment, not even double-blind from what I can tell. As Carl Sagan stated, \\"dramatic claims call For dramatic evidence\\", here we have a dramatic claim with with not even an iota of evidence. I cannot recommend \\"Einstein Factor\\"."},{"Title":"The Einstein Factor","review":"Win Wenger's book is very clearly written and, unlike most books on &quot;how to use the power of your subconscious mind&quot;, this one provides actual exercises you can do - not vague claims and advice. As to whether image streaming makes you smarter, I don't know, but it does open up access to an endless source of ideas and insights. This practice is particularly useful for creative people. It's not unlike freewriting - only it's spoken and you use a tape recorder. This book is SO worth the money, because Wenger includes so many concisely presented ideas - enough for several books. (The reviews on this page claiming that image streaming can make you &quot;lose control&quot; strike me as strange. It should IMPROVE your sense of control and calm.)"},{"Title":"The Einstein Factor","review":"Win Wagner writes a book about Albert Einstein and his hypothesis on how to be an Einstein. In this book, he basis the intelligence of Einstein upon the number of axons and other nerve pathways as compared to normal humans. Basically, he believes that to become more intelligent, we must increase our number axons in our brain. To do this, he introduces his method called Image Streaming. In theory, his discoveries are profound, and revolutionary. Yet, in practice, they are hard to accomplish. Using Image Streaming to increase intelligence is difficult. First, you must have the will power to practice it day after day for a very long time. Secondly, his method is not a quick fix. It took Einstein at least 15 or 20 years of his life to grow that many more axons than the normal human. At 9, Eistein was still considered stupid. It wasn't until he was 26 before he was considered a genius. How can Image Streaming make you that much intelligent so quickly? Is it not true that the! methods taught in this book also require much time to implement? To use this book efficiently, one must devote sufficient time to produce an &quot;Einstein effect.&quot; In reality, all geniuses already use, in one form or another (though they may not know it), what he calls &quot;Image Streaming&quot; since they were very young. Although he is probably correct to say the use of Image Streaming will improve your mind, it is more likely that if you wished to really become a genius, then you must begin using this technique since you was very young. Although Image Streaming is his major method described to improve the mind, he is very brilliant to incorporate other methods such as Free Noting, and Photoreading. Throughout this book, he brings up many very possible or intriguing theories about improving the mind. Yet, Free Noting cannot be supported by his claim to improve your notetaking. In fact, there has been scientific evidence to prove that activities such as Free Noting do! not improve your notetaking, and instead is worse than not! etaking. Also, the technique of Photoreading to read faster, invented by a different author, which Wagner agreeablely teaches is a difficult process to implement. It requires much practice have its full usefulness extended. The important thing to remember about this book is that it is not a quick fire way to improving the mind. Possibly a years worth of patience must be attended to his excercises before results truly pour in. His book is well written with numerous interesting facts. It isn't a bad idea just to read it for those interesting facts. In reality, it can be extremely useful to understand the concepts that he does bring up in this book for they are very insightful. If this book is read with other self-mind-help books, one can properly put together what is truly necessary to improve one's mind. Although it is quite difficult to accomplish and although I rate it 4 stars, comparared to other books of this nature, it is one of the best I have seen, if not the best."},{"Title":"The Einstein Factor","review":"This book describes itself as a proven new method for increasing your intelligence. There have certainly been many years of experimentation, research and teaching behind the methods presented. If you like learning, then you'll probably love a book about learning, and this is no disappointment: plenty of practical techniques to try out and a guarantee, I would say, that even if your intelligence doesn't change, your intuition will definitely have improved for practising these methods.Central to the book is the technique of \\"image streaming\\". The main idea behind this is that we all have a constant stream of images flowing out from our subconscious minds, but traditional education and upbringing has generally taught us to screen out these images. So successful has our screening become, many of us believe that we don't have such images at all, and cannot \\"visualise\\" with eyes closed. The authors however reassure us that everybody has these images. Image streaming is the way to kick-start and develop our awareness of them. One particularly effective part of this technique is to use your own voice as a kind of feedback loop to reinforce and solidify the process of visualisation. I was surprised at how well a rich, sensory, and vocal description added to the vividness of my images.Having laid the foundations with this basic technique, it can them be put to practical use is all sorts of ways: re-examining your own past, solving problems, answering questions intuitively for yourself and others. The research behind the book shows in the scientific theorising behind these and other techniques although, very often, the authors have to conclude that they don't really know why these intuitive techniques work; they just do!There are plenty more goodies to try too: borrowing identities from your greatest heroes, modelling musical genius, photoreading at lightening speed, freenoting, achieving flow, and boosting brain power through oxygenation.This book has an upbeat energetic style, which is probably a benefit of being co-written. It gave me a lot of new ideas, and I feel confident that the benefits will continue well beyond the simple enjoyment of reading."},{"Title":"The Einstein Factor","review":"I am compelled to write this review to aid potential buyers who are on the crux of making the decision on whether or not to purchase this book. It is not a panacea, but an excellent starting point in learning the procedures used by highly regarded, recorded &quot;geniuses&quot; in history.As I have gone through and practiced some of the concepts such as &quot;Image Streaming&quot;, &quot;Freenoting&quot; and &quot;PhotoReading&quot; I have found that indeed, my subconscious thoughts and memories have indeed started to surface when I need them most. This is from one week of practicing. I have also found my self-awareness and skills of observation have additionally been improved. This book is a guide that aids people in improving their overall mental performance and creativity, and experiencing the rise in confidence and self esteem. The melding of the &quot;Socratic Method&quot; of thought and the visualization techniques indeed has some great side effects. I find that my intuitive processes that always guided me to my right answer in any situation, are sharper, faster and have surfaced more often. I also understand why I have felt far less creative over the past number of years, and even why I was an average academic achiever regardless of the fact that I had scored over 140 on IQ tests as a child, and was always in the top 1% of children on accumulative learning tests. This is also a great book to own if you have, or are planning to have children in the near future and want your kids to be creative and happy, without using knowledge force feeding/funneling techniques pervasive in today's academic/learning environments. It will keep them from feeling the lack of self-esteem symptomatic of poor academic performance.Please feel free to visit Win's site at www.winwenger.com.

Win Wenger has discovered one of the most formidable methods for improving human intellegence and HE DOESN'T EVEN REALIZE WHY IT WORKS!To understand what I'm saying you have to understand what image streaming is. Wenger thinks it's a way to unlock hidden mental processes buried within the unconscious that the average person has \\"learned\\" over the course of growing up to shut out of his awareness. This could be true, but I haven't made it work.What I have experienced with image streaming is this:Imagine a virtual reality device that allowed you to totally immerse yourself in any environment or any combination of environmental elements that you have ever experienced. Imagine that these environments involved ALL FIVE OF YOUR SENSES. Imagine that the reproduction of these environments was so complete, convincing, and compelling that you might even need to turn off the device from time to time in order to remind yourself of which was the real world (no this ain't the Matrix). Now imagine that you already carry around such a device with you all the time and all you need is the instruction booklet on how to turn it on.The device does exist. It's your brain. And the instruction booklet also exists. It's \\"The Einsten Factor.\\" Or rather it should have been \\"The Einstein Factor\\" and would have been \\"The Einstein Factor\\" had Wenger not been so focused on unlocking subconscious potentials as a road to genius. I'm not saying that those subconscious powers don't exist. I'm just saying that I believe the true power of image streaming lies not in hidden messages from the unconscious mind, but in the virtual reality capabilities of the your image stream. And in order to use them you have to do what Wenger specifically instructs you not to do, learn to control your image stream. To elaborate you have to learn to gain as much or as little control over your image stream as you wish at any given moment. Once you do will have in your possession the device of which I speak and you will also have the ability to still use image streaming in the way that Wenger suggests.Although I haven't mastered it yet, I have gained a measure of control over my image stream. I can use it as Wenger suggests or I can drop an order into my image stream, which will then serve up what I have asked for in the most minute detail as if I were really experiencing it. I have image streamed places that I have been to and have had to open my eyes and sit up off the bed in order to remind myself that I wasn't really there. I have image streamed places no human being has been to and have had to quit a session of image streaming for fear of forgetting what was real and what was not. I have image streamed my living room and walked around it picking up various items WITH MY EYES CLOSED AND BLINDFOLDED functioning properly as if I had them open and unencumbered.Think about that for a moment.What does that mean? It means my image stream somehow reproduced in every detectable detail what I would have seen had I had my eyes. And I do mean every detectable detail in ALL FIVE SENSES.What could you do with a device like that?My only problem with this book is Wenger's obscession with supposed unconscious resources and the misnomer \\"image streaming.\\""},{"Title":"The Einstein Factor","review":"After reading a whole bunch of reviews, I've decided to address some of the negative ones that either has 1) did not gain any results and 2) did not read the book and wrote a bad review.I believe that this book works. I know it and tested it. My IQ before I read the book was 120, the average IQ score of a college student. However, after image streaming for a couple of months for 15-20 minutes and sometimes an hour, my IQ jumped to 135. Afterwards I stopped doing the exercises as I became too busy with my school work. After a year so however, I tried to image stream again but this time I didn't get any results.I was very disappointed and I did not know whether I reached my peak or the exercises was just a hoax. I tried for a few weeks, but I couldn't muster any random images in my brain and gave up on the whole Image Streaming idea. I didn't pick up this book for a while until I decided to make some changes in my life.After reading many performance psychology books I decided to revisit image streaming to see if it would help me get a big IQ boost again. To my surprise it started working again and I was receiving steady results! Although I didn't check my IQ scores I really felt my mental capacity to absorb and learn grew. I realized there are a few things you must do in order to gain the benefits of image streaming:1) SLEEP EARLY!!!! As a college student I did not do this very often and when I tried to perform image streaming before I go to sleep, my mind was too tired to focus on any random images that came up or it wouldn't allow me make any images in random.2) Manage your stress levels!!! Stress can affect your intelligence greatly! Being stressed actually brings your IQ down, therefore maintaining some kind of physical exercise routine, sleeping on time, and maintaining a balanced life is important to combat stress.I hope my review helps any readers that have any hesitations of getting this book.Thank you."},{"Title":"The Einstein Factor","review":"Between the two - book or recording, please choose the book! The materials are useful, provided you have both time and motivation to embark on a long course of self-development, with a lot of exercises, a lot of daily work.The problem with this recording is, however, that it is read not by a professional reader, but by Dr. Wenger himself. He probably is a smart man, but not smart enough to understand that his voice is quite senile, lacks energy, his diction is blurred, with no persuasiveness, no impact on listener, very boring and totally non-convincing. I have no problems when youthful Tony Robbins reads his own materials recorded on tapes and CDs with his unmatched Passion, but I do have a problem with something as life-less and monotone, as the recording of this otherwise excellent course.

The translator was only 21 at the time. It is written in the style and spelling of the time, so is not totally accessible to a modern audience. Since this is a somewhat racy work, I also found that the sections that were considered pornographic were left in the original Latin. As you read through this work, you will come upon entire sentences, paragraphs, or even pages that are in Latin. Since I don't read Latin, I wasn't able to understand these sections; but since the pornographic parts don't interest me, I wasn't too offended. This is an interesting method of 17th century censorship. If you want the whole thing in English, you will need to read translations from the 1960's or newer.There were many racy parts left in, but the translator did his best to make them acceptable. Given the strong homosexual theme, it was still considered very controversial.It should also be noted that the original Latin is very fragmentary, and this as well as other translations have been filled with interpolations by others. I understand that the original manuscript left to itself would be too incomplete to make for a coherent story.To me this work is interesting from a historical perspective; it shows that bawdy humor has always existed and probably always will. The supposed author, Petronius, lived during the time of Nero and was the ultimate party animal. He was an intimate friend of Nero. This book reflects that lifestyle and shows the decadence of the age.This is not a book I am interested in reading again, even in a more modern translation, but now I can say that I have read it. There are no morals taught or great insights into the human soul; it is just a raunchy tale. If you do want to read this book, I would recommend a more modern translation."},{"Title":"Book of Fortune Telling","review":"I have loved this book since I was 20 years old.

Traditionally the concept of vocation have been divided into the two points: 1. divine calling; 2. professional calling in status quo. However, I think that the writer doesn;t consider the distinction between the two and just provide the informtion not divided in the way of enumerating some information. This fact is shown remakably in the author's interpretaion of karl Barth's doctrine of vocation in Church dogmatics. As far as I see, the author fail to the detailed difference between the concept of vocation in terms of Reconciliation, and such the thing discussed in the doctine of creation.Thus, It never gives reader opulent infomation and knowledge.

My library only had this one, so I had to begin on a seemingly already well-traveled joruney. All I can say is this is one book I'll never forget. It was amazing, and yet indeed troubling for me because I've never heard anyone talk about life quite the way he explains it in a Sorcerer's eyes. I love, as a woman myself, that there are females Sorcerers that helped him, because indeed wherever men have been, women have as well. But other than that, I found them to be weird characters, people that don't sound like they live in our world whatsoever. The men, Nestor, Beningo, and Pablito and the women Gorda, Lidia, Rosa, and Josefina are just souls that could confuse any of us average kind, and I truly felt like Carlos- confused and severely curious throughout the entire novel. That's why I don't appreciate them all calling him stupid constantly, I mean, cut him slack. He's learning as they learned. And what things he learned, as well as myself.Dad asked me if I believe it, or cast it aside as a really well- written story. I say...maybe. Look at it in my perspective. I'm young, confused, and just starting to get my own 'form'. I believe there is much more out there than can be proven under a microscope, but I need to be level- headed and realistic and understand how pessimistic viewers see it as well. There's no proof what this man wrote is true, but there's absolutely no proof he's lying either. It is eerie how good he is at writing such a story, making it sound so true, but there have been stories that have fooled us before. So I'm not sure. This man has really put me in a bind, and I don't regret it. The more you think, the more broader your mind and soul get.

I have still many questions, and regardless of if this is a story or not, I want them answered.Just a note, try to get his very first book if can, and if you want a book on enjoyment instead of study, don't even pick this up. It's no fantasy novel. It's a whole other world of study that derives basically on shamanism in the vast and mysterious lands of Mexico."},{"Title":"The Second Ring of Power","review":"This is the 5th book in the Carlos Castaneda series. One could read this book without having read the other books, but this would not be advisable. Here, Carlos returns to the deserts of Mexico in Search of Don Juan and meaning as to the events of the last book \`Tales of Power'. The Nagual's, Don Juan and Don Genaro are not to be found. As is stated from the \`editor's review', the first few chapters of this book deal with Carlos interacting with the sorceress Dona Soledad. Carlos's teachings continue not under the direction of these Nagual's, but with instruction left to the other disciples for Carlos Castaneda to work through. The interaction with these other disciples gives us a clearer understanding in the workings of Carlos Castaneda and Don Genaro.This book presents us with \`The art of dreaming' and \`second attention'. Attention of Tonal \\"The capacity of average people to perceive and place their awareness on the ordinary world of everyday life. The first ring of power is our \\"awesome, but take-for-granted ability to impact order to our perception of our daily world.\\" \\"The second domain (2nd ring of Power) was the attention of the Nagual; that is to say, the capacity of the sorcerer to place their awareness on the non-ordinary world\\". \\"Don Juan had said that our \\"first ring of power\\" is engaged very early in our lives and that we live under the impression that that is all there is to us. Our \\"Second ring of Power,\\" the \\"attention of the Nagual,\\" remains hidden for the immense majority of us, and only at the moment of our death is it revealed to us. There is a pathway to reach it, however, which is available to every one of us, but which only sorcerers take, and that pathway is through dreaming.\\" \\"Dreaming\\" was in essence the transformation of ordinary dreams into affairs involving volition. Dreamers, by engaging their \\"attention of the Nagual\\" and focusing it on the items and events of their ordinary dreams, change those dreams into dreaming\\". Pg 278.\\"First Attention, where we experience the Tonal, or the Second Attention where we experience the Nagual. To Castaneda the Tonal is often associated with the masculine aspect of the universe and the Nagual to the feminine. The Tonal can roughly be linked to the concept of Ego and the conscious mind.\\" Wikipedia (Nagual Castaneda).Carlos gives us the example of a table in the desert. The realm of the tonal deals with the objects placed upon the table. The 2nd ring of power of the Nagual, deals with standing back and becoming aware of all that goes beyond the table that is situated in a vast desert.\\"The Nagual told me that human beings are frail creatures composed of many layers of luminosity. When you see them, they seem to have fibres, but those fibres are really layers, like an onion. Jolts of any kind separate those layers and can cause human beings to die\\" pg 290\\"Sorcerers have to do their best to keep their own layers closed. That's why the Nagual taught us dreaming. Dreaming tightens the layers. When sorceress learn dreaming they tie together their tow attentions and there is no more need for that centre to push out\\". Do you mean that sorcerers do not die?\\" \\"That's right. Sorcerers do not die.\\" Pg 291.Carlos teaches us to access the second intention we should learn the art of gazing. For Carlos, Don Juan had taught to look into the distance without focusing onto specifics. In this book however we find that Don Juan has taught his other disciples the opposite depending upon the individual in question. Interesting to note here, for those that think that they can do the esoteric work themselves; having a master to guide us can pinpoint and expedite our progress depending upon our makeup, our personality etc. To one was given the task of gazing at a leaf (pg 294), a plant, a tree or rock; to another a fog or the rain (pg 297). \\"One could also gaze at water (still or running), smoke, fire or even a hung piece of cloth (pg 303).\\"The difficulty in gazing is to learn to quiet down the thoughts. The Nagual said that he preferred to teach us how to do that with a pile of leaves because we could get all the leaves we needed any time we wanted to gaze. But anything else would do the same job. Once you stop the world you are a gazer. And since the only way of stopping the world was by trying, the Nagual made all of us gaze at leaves for years and years. I think it's the best way to reach our second attention. He combined gazing at dry leaves and looking for our hands in dreaming...The Nagual said that once you have trapped your second attention with dry leaves, you do gazing and dreaming to enlarge it. And that's all there is to gazing...The Nagual said that all we needed to do in order to trap our second attention was to try and try. All of us stopped the world by gazing at dry leaves.\\" pg 295.\\"The mad reign of King Monkey Mind can be overthrown by shifting the focus towards the second attention. The second attention can be cultivated by relaxing the search for meaning. This can be experienced by relaxing the tendency to project and/or assume meaning onto whatever is perceived, in lieu of direct perception of the phenomena. This can also occur by dropping labels through an agreement to experience the world without naming what you are experiencing. Infants and very young children see this way most of the time. This begins a process of flexing a perceptual muscle that was at one time active and vital before it weakened and/or atrophied.\\" (Paratheatrical dot com)\\"How do you learn?\\" \\"In my dreaming. Dreamers must gaze in order to do dreaming and then they must look for their dreams in their gazing. For example, the Nagual made me gaze at the shadows of rocks, and then in my dreaming I found out that those shadows had light, so I looked for the light in the shadows form then on until I found it. Gazing and dreaming go together\\". Pg 308. Selah.Having read this book one is still left wondering what has happened to these two Nagual's that gone to another dimension. Guess I'll have to read the 6th book in the Carlos Castaneda series - \`The eagle's gift'."},{"Title":"The Second Ring of Power","review":"For those who are yet to read this book - im not going to tell you what is it about. Im just gonna say that this book is very different from prequel (i believe that was Tales of Power) In fact, here we are revealed something about Carlos' overall mission as a new nagual - something mind boggling.It is interesting to see though, how he must react to ceratain things as a nagual, while at the same time realizing to himself that he is not. That is a one of many conundrums that this book offers a reader. I recommend it especially to those who find that little (or big) something in Carlos Castaneda writings and way."},{"Title":"The Second Ring of Power","review":"This used to be my least favorite of Castaneda's books. Now I'm re-reading it, and can honestly say that it's far more complex than it seems at first.In all of his earlier books, Castaneda focused on Don Juan. Now his teacher is gone, and Carlos has to live life, and write bestselling books, without him.Long ago, I stopped pondering whether or not the books were made up, and started thinking of them as wonderful stories with allegorical meaning. And this is the point: The Second Ring of Power is all about what happens when Mommy and Daddy are gone. Or maybe it's about Carlos opportunizing on his fame to justify the creation of a harem for himself (the Nagual's women). Or maybe it's even more subtle, and about what we all have to face: the fear of not being able to blame anyone else for your lot in life.Castaneda ends his previous novel, Tales of Power, with these words: \\"And then I was alone.\\" Now, he has to deal with the second generation of Sorcerers after Don Juan and Genaro, the Second Ring of Power. In effect he is rounding up his new cast of characters.Does he get away with it? Does it come off as being convincing? I don't know, because I'm not finished with the re-read. I do know that the rest of the books' some with and without Don Juan and Genaro, are very well done.There is a final allegory in Castaneda that came home to me in dealing with several individuals in my own life. And that is that some of the craziest people we know, personally, have a power about them. Are we all, in a way, sorcerers, and don't know it?"},{"Title":"The Second Ring of Power","review":"This is not my favorite of Castaneda's books, but it is the only one that presents some of the unique teachings for women offered in this tradition. In this book, Castaneda returns to Mexico after Don Juan and Don Genaro, his teachers, have 'left the world'. Prior to this visit, Castaneda didn't know that Don Juan also had female apprentices, and this book is his introduction, and at times battle, with them. It's the battles that get a little tiresome and dark (as also happens in several other Castaneda books), and without Don Juan and Don Genaro's levity and heart, this book gets quite heavy in parts.On the other hand, the women in this circle share aspects of the teachings that they received from Don Juan and Don Genaro, and these are unique. The womb is considered the center of a woman's power, and give her a unique energetic fluidity and doorway to the sorcerer's world when she is able to fully own and access it. Some aspects of these teachings are quite disturbing - parents and children are pretty much presented as at war for each other's personal power - but they are never dull. Because Castaneda spends much of this book in conversation with these sorcerers of his circle, other teachings from Don Juan and Don Genaro are presented in a new light, which is also helpful.Overall, I would only recommend this book to hardcore Castaneda fans and/or individuals specifically interested in women's spirituality or energy body teachings. If you're interested in the latter, another book to look at isThe Sorcerer's Crossing: A Woman's Journey (Compass), written by a woman who studied with others in Don Juan's circle. If you're new to Castaneda, I would start withJourney to Ixtlan: The Lessons of Don Juanand thenTales of Power.As for all the controversies surrounding Castaneda, I recommend simply reading a book or two, and seeing if they resonate. Their source is irrelevant really, and we may never know the full truth (if there is such a thing.)"},{"Title":"The Second Ring of Power","review":"In this book, Carlos makes it clear that warrior means WARRIOR. Awareness only grows through life-or-death struggles, and this is not a bit of poetry. He makes clear how disastrous it is to confront Infinity with even a tiny amount of pity.

Now I have read it again with better results, however there is something special in this book that keeps me asking myself lots of questions regardless of how many times I read it. I might say because this is the first book in which Castaneda talks about sex. One must be 'complete' in order to access the 'other world' becomes the basic idea. This is particulary scary when talking about having a son. I think Castaneda goes thru the bushes instead od talking straigth. (Maybe he could not say it in plain words due to potential impact to society). This is why this book left me with a void. In net, Castaneda did very well talking about dreaming basics, recaping as well as showing new characters and their relationship,in particular I liked the 1st chapter 'the story of Dona Soledad',,,but anyway Castaneda has never been clear when it comes to talk about sex. I hope the other books that I still have not read help me get a better understanding."},{"Title":"The Second Ring of Power","review":"When P.T. Barnum wanted people to leave the circus he put up a sign: &quot;This way to the egress.&quot; People thought the &quot;egress&quot; was an animal instead of an exit. I suppose today some of those same kind of gullible people think Casteneda's books are fact instead of fiction...it's a shame how he ran a 30-year con on the naive. Sometimes, I suppose, even the stupid. I'll bet he laughed all the way to the bank."},{"Title":"The Second Ring of Power","review":"That might not come from reading this book alone, as it is the fifth most believable of the series. When I was a student, I like many others I know who will confess to having read a Castaneda book or two when pressed, went through a couple of years of Castanedism, reading the 8 classics 2 - 3 times each, and even the later four, quite different books a couple of times. Being someone who likes to give the benefit of the doubt until conclusive evidence proves otherwise, I must admit to only getting suspicious by Journey To Ixtlan, the third book. The second book, A Separate Reality, picks up on the supernormal happenings, but still these are within the realms of possibility, when one considers Spiritualist literature. By Tales of Power, when at the end Carlos throws himself off a cliff and only survives by becoming pure perception, bouncing elastically back and forth 17 times between the two inherent realms of all creation, the tonal and the nagual, the game was up. In Carlos' terms, my assemblage point had just experienced a considerable shift into the realms of disbelief. The cocoon had burst. I read the remaining books still interested, but with the growing realization that I'd been had. Bizarre ideas not found in any other spiritual traditions, such as the necessity for people on the path of knowledge to kill their children to reclaim the power they'd lost to them, plus fill in the holes in their cocoons the children had caused, made me wary. This was surely not a philosophy the whole world should turn to, or else we'd be living in a fearful, lonely world with every man for himself.However, this would be fine if the books weren't made out to be non-fiction. While I have seen these books placed with science fiction books in many libraries, in most European bookshops they're still sold with real, non-fiction 'Mind, Body, Spirit' books. The reason I give this book such a low rating is that an intensive study of his works, the books by his various colleagues, plus Richard De Mille's intelligent criticisms, can only lead to the conclusion that Castaneda, the writer, used Don Juan and Carlos, two fantasy characters, to verbalize his own beliefs, which were culled from his own spiritual and academic experience. That there are not some useful nuggets of wisdom, or advice in these books I do not deny. That is their very attraction, plus the belief that it all really happened, and is a new spiritual revelation. But as these are mixed up with increasingly bizarre assertions and beliefs (by the Art of Dreaming it seems all pretence at non-fiction had been given up), it is doubtful whether a lifetime devoted to these practices (as opposed to say, real shamanic practices) would lead to spiritual improvement. If you must have a Castaneda book in your library, rather get The Wheel of Time, a selection of the spiritual highlights of the first eight books, but consider it rather 'The best of the personal philosophy of Carlos Castaneda' than anything to do with Don Juan or Shamanism. This understanding may not have the romantic mix of wild Mexican deserts, ancient wisdom, wise old men and naive westerners which captures the hearts of so many, but it is a lot closer to the truth.The anonymous ghost-writer at Schuster and Schuster who corrected Peruvian immigrant Castaneda's English for at least all of his earlier works (a sample of his writing from 1969 reveals it was still far from perfect, not like what is in books), giving the books their special character, certainly deserves more credit than he or she gets. But they are not written well enough to succeed as fiction, hence their continued classification as non-fiction, besides the intense academic embarrassment it would cause copyright holders UCLA to have to admit such a dramatic change in classification, from fact to fantasy, after having previously given the author a doctorate for his work! [...], so I must give the minimum rating allowed. The day this book is reclassified as Fiction, I will up my rating to 3 stars though, as it is a quite entertaining and authentic piece of fiction-posing-as-non-fiction."},{"Title":"The Second Ring of Power","review":"The knowledge of Juan Matus is powerful and these books can be used as something of a manual if you're interested in doing such a thing.Warning; Castaneda is a fool.

All of his books about his apprenticeship with Juan Matus are full of his idiocy, which seems to increase, oddly enough.He just cannot accept that there are some things you can't explain with reason, because they are out of the bounds of reason. His academic prowess hinders him greatly, as he thinks there's nothing his mind can't wrap itself around.This can be useful tho.

Judging from previous reviews, all of them are not at the highest level of literacy, but they do seem to have confidence in the tales he relates.I often wonder how it is that people will believe stories that can only be described as preposterous--stories at which they would scoff, if told them by a friend or coworker, simply because they are in book form.Castaneda achieved great success with his 'Tales of Don Juan,' which the New York Times called &quot;an extraordinary spiritual and psychological document.&quot; This book is a follow-on, only the sorceress, Dona Soledad, is a female who was trained by Don Juan, this gaining the loyalty of a feminine audience.I have met a sorcerer's apprentice who lived with the Weshaw Indians of Mexico and used the sacred mushroom with them, and learned to use the water drum, and experienced other aspects of their culture. There are many deep mysteries to examine, and I am open to them.Carlos Castaneda, however, does not resonate with me. Well-written, perhaps.

While the &quot;Spanish Basque&quot; chefs have remained adamantly Basque, and have indeed &quot;Basquified&quot; to a large extent all of modern Spanish cookery, the &quot;French Basque&quot; chefs have let themselves, for many decades, become thoroughly &quot;Frenchified&quot;, learning in French culinary schools and following the edicts of classic French cuisine. This becomes apparent in Mr. Hirigoyen's constant use of butter, not to mention many of his techniques.One of the top two chefs now working in Iparralde (i.e. the French part of the Basque Country), Christian Parra of L'Auberge de la Galupe in Urt (the other is Firmin Arrambide, of Les Pyr&eacute;n&eacute;es in Saint-Jean-Pied-de-Port), once told the French magazine Gault-Millau: &quot;You know why the Spanish Basque chefs are better and more creative than we are? Because we all have a well-worn copy of Escoffier's cook next to our kitchen, and the Spanish Basques haven't even heard of Escoffier.&quot;Jokes aside, Parra and Arrambide are now the leaders because they have rejoined the overall Basque movement led by Juan Mari Arzak of Donostia (San Sebasti&aacute;n): a return to the Basque sources (and some important Spanish ones, like Jabugo ham and virgin olive oil) to start creating from them and not from Paris-inspired fashions, products and techniques.I have the impression that Mr. Hirigoyen left the Basque Country before this movement took off on the French side of the border, before French Basque chefs became Basque again. His ignorance of southern (Spanish) Basque recipes and culinary traditions, which represent a large majority of the Basque cooking heritage, is rather amazing, as other reviewers have pointed out.By the way, in case anyone's interested: I am a journalist, and occasionally a wine and food writer, based in Spain, but with extensive experience in France and the United States. So I think I know what I'm writing about in this case."},{"Title":"The Basque Kitchen: Tempting Food from the Pyrenees","review":"I'm a tough customer for cookbooks, but this one is a winner on many fronts for me. The recipes are exciting and different from the many other European regional cookbooks, the history is interesting, the photos are beautiful, and best of all for me, the recipes are nearly fool-proof. I delighted my friends one night recently with the lamb stew - fabulous - and my husband has made the haricots verts salad a staple in our home. The gateau basque and chocolate &quot;rocks&quot; are both unforgettably wonderful. I highly recommend the book to anyone interested in adding some wonderful new flavors to their kitchen."},{"Title":"The Basque Kitchen: Tempting Food from the Pyrenees","review":"I scanned Mr. Hirigoyen's book and did not buy it, even though I am always on the lookout for books on the cuisines of Spain and Spain's Basque Country. What put me off was the recipe for patatas a la riojana, which called for no chorizo and included butter and white pepper (as did many of the so-called Spanish Basque recipes). Patatas a la riojano just happens to be one of my favorite folk dishes in Spain. As the name implies, it comes from the great Spanish wine region, La Rioja, which also has a Basque section, La Rioja Alavesa. In my trips to La Rioja, probably 30 by now, I have had patatas a la riojana numerous times, never without chorizo. In fact, patatas a la riojana is also known by its more common name, patatas con chorizo. I have also helped make bacalao al pil-pil and I can assure you, there is nothing easy about the versions I have seen made, contrary to Mr. Hirigoyen's assertions. As a widely-published writer on the wines of Spain, I was shocked by Mr. Hirigoyen's lack of knowledge about the wines of the Spanish Basque Country. As to French Basque food, perhaps the book is much stronger, but I know little about the subject. Spain and France, Basque or not, are much different in their approach to food, IMHO"},{"Title":"The Basque Kitchen: Tempting Food from the Pyrenees","review":"Hirigoyen should have based his book on the french basque recepies and left the spanish basque recepies to the ones who know better. I have not seen a single spanish basque dish in the book that is authentic! Hirigoyen should know that we never cook with butter and white pepper."},{"Title":"The Basque Kitchen: Tempting Food from the Pyrenees","review":"Three years ago my son gave me a copy of The Basque Kitchen, written by his good friend Gerald Hirogoyen. The book has sat on my coffee table ever since, and whenever I am in the mood for something challenging and different, I have been trying out some of its recipes.Then, a few days ago, my son treated me to a memorable dinner at Gerald's restaurant in San Francisco, \\"Piperade,\\" which features many of the delectable dishes described in his book, and I had a chance not only to meet this kind and gentle chef but to sample firsthand his culinary skill with genuineBasque cuisine.The restaurant itself is a delightful place, its decor simple and rustic yet warm and friendly -- like the Basque people and countryside itself. We were treated like royalty and feasted on various Basque specialties: lamb chops with roasted Macheco cheese and potatoes, steak with mushrooms, fish with asparagus, and white wine from Gerald's own vineyards in Penedes, Catalunya.Because my son and I lived in Spain for 13 years, we have visited all four of the Basque provinces, enjoying the beautiful Pyrenees mountains, the local culture, and their native foods. Lamb barbequed over an open hearth oven and bacalao (codfish) were special favorites.Having worked my way through college as a part-time cook, I thoroughly relished reading about and then experimenting with many of the recipes. I found the directions easy to follow and, while my results may not have reached the perfection of Gerald's restaurant offerings, everything I prepared was tantalizingly tasty. A true gourmet delight! My personal favorites are stuffed squid in its ink, lamb chops, steak, steamed red snapper, and honey-glazed spare ribs, to mention only a few.Anyone who has been fortunate enough to visit the Basque region will enjoy recreating some of its culinary specialties, and anyone willing to experiment with new tastes and techniques will consider The Basque Kitchen a real find."},{"Title":"The Basque Kitchen: Tempting Food from the Pyrenees","review":"I have seen the book in a bookstore but i haven't bought it because i was very surprised to see that the Spanish Basque recipes are anything but authentic: &quot;patatas a la riojana&quot; is NEVER cooked with butter and the main ingredient is &quot;chorizo sausage&quot; which is missing in Hirigoyen's recipe. &quot;Bacalao pil-pil&quot; will never work if you follow the recipe in the book because you will need more olive oil for that amount of cod and onion is certainly never used for this dish. It is a very difficult dish to make. I don't understand why Hirigoyen says it's easy. There are many more examples why i decided not to buy the book even though it looks very pretty."},{"Title":"The Basque Kitchen: Tempting Food from the Pyrenees","review":"A pretty book with some nice pictures, but it does little to portray veritable Basque cuisine. I am a Spaniard from Catalunya who loves good food and knows the kitchen. I was bothered by many things in this book -- his overuse of butter, for instance... Gazpacho is a dish from southern and central Spain, not the Basque country. Gazpacho does not need an &quot;earthy&quot; flavor as Mr. Hirigoyen suggests by adding red beets (What an aberration!). The dish &quot;Hake San Sebastian&quot; is unheard of anywhere in the Basque country, unless he means his own version of the traditional &quot;Merluza en Salsa Verde&quot;. &quot;Bacalao al Pil Pil&quot; is one of the most ancient and sophisticated dishes of the Basque country (possibly of Europe)and is taken for granted without giving it due respect... In sum, quite a disappointing and misleading view of Basque food."},{"Title":"The Basque Kitchen: Tempting Food from the Pyrenees","review":"This book is full of gorgeous pictures and inviting, unusual recipes. Most of the recipes are relatively simple, although some hard-to-find ingredients are used. Its a great book; it could have used some more careful editing. Some of the directions seem puzzling or incomplete. A good book for an experienced cook, but probably a poor choice for a novice."},{"Title":"The Basque Kitchen: Tempting Food from the Pyrenees","review":"Excellent cook book, very authentic with a touch of refinement illustrated by many pictures and cultural background. Many recipes have been in my family for generations but the book gave me more information about where to purchase some of the needed ingredients.Eskerik'asko Gerald !"},{"Title":"The Basque Kitchen: Tempting Food from the Pyrenees","review":"Try the marmitako. This is to the Basque country as clam chowder to New England. The version in this book is excellent and can serve as a springboard for you to create your own version."},{"Title":"Repair: The Impulse to Restore in a Fragile World","review":"This is a tremendously insightful and helpful view of human beings defined by their impulse to fix things: machinery, buildings, relationships, artworks, clothing, each other. The impulse to repair is examined as a distinctive stance toward our history, our present community, and our future hopes.The writing is clear and accessible--even when Spelman is gathering comments from a broad range of sources across many topic areas. She starts from concrete everyday examples. I have selected this book as one of three to assign to an undergraduate class in ethics.The analysis of apology in chapter five was especially gripping for me. In chapter six, I was astonished and intrigued by the suggestion that some memories cannot or should not be \\"healed.\\" There are applications to be drawn from this for clinical practice in psychotherapy. The comments on the \\"restorative justice\\" movement and the deplorable American prison system, in chapter 2 and throughout the book, are quite good. The range of interests addressed and applications proposed or evoked in the book is exceptionally broad.The argument, exposing \\"Homo sapiens\\" as \\"Homo reparans\\" (the species who fixes), is fascinating. It often runs against the tacit or explicit assumptions of popular culture. Spelman is probably right when she remarks that we haven't paid due attention to this aspect of our humanity, for several reasons including our recoil from acknowledging that we are breakable beings in a breakable world, and the taboos of our consumption-driven economy which favors replacement over repair.I would have devoured this book even if it were twice as long, and I would recommend it highly even at twice the price."},{"Title":"Repair: The Impulse to Restore in a Fragile World","review":"This short book came off to a satisfying start: a comparison between a small-town fix-it man, a motorcycle restoration devotee, and art conservators faced with an uncommonly demanding situation. It discussed the various ideals of \\"whatever works\\", the sacred factory spec, and the professional responsibility of anyone who touches priceless works of art.It turned out that those cases formed the first half of a set of analogies - Spelman's true interest seem to lie in the social repair of ruptured human relationships. OK, I was a bit disappointed, but I reserve the author's right to her choice of topic. I tried to shift gears to follow her.First, Spelman proposed the home as the first line of repair for the broken spirit or body. This turned into a woman vs. man competition that I found frankly disappointing. The discussion seemed to center around a \\"Leave it to Beaver\\" household of Mom, Pop, and their children by each other. Last I heard, that described about one in six US households. Spelman completely ignored the modern piecemeal family: his, hers, theirs, and other, plus a baffling array of outliers and part-time parents. My limited experience says that there is the real need for repair - the little rifts and the interactions that never worked quite right, needing continuous soothing for any semblance of harmony.She goes on to a chapter about restorative justice, built around context-dependent bargaining between the victim (referred to as \\"her\\") and the wrongdoer (\\"him\\"). There certainly is merit in exploring alternatives to punitive justice. I'm not sure how far this concept can be pushed, though. Context-dependent bargaining inherently favors the slicker bargainer, and inherently favors the people with sufficient power to define the social context.Spelman also makes much of the power of apology. I acknowledge that apology can have power, and Spelman cites Clinton's apology to those wronged by the notorious Tuskeegee study. My own experience is less rosy, though. I've heard the same apologies repeated for the same wrongs by the same people too many times. Apology, too often, does not take responsibility for wrongs done. Instead, it is the height of irresponsibility, a self-declared amnesty, a cheap and easy alternative to making a difference.I expect other reviewers to rank this book very differently than I do. I was not at all happy with shallow gender stereotypes about how familes work. Perhaps \\"restorative justice\\" is effective in some limited circumstances - I would have to see it work more, and I'd have to see handling of its failures before I follow her enthusiasm. I think this title tried to include too much under one heading, and left all of its topics under-served."},{"Title":"Singing with Dennis Day","review":"In his heyday, Dennis Day was the epitome of Irish singers with his tenor singing. The along came the three tenors, albeit from separate countries, they sang Irish mostly. Daniel O\\"Donnell was good on the PBS special, using only a couple of Irish songs. I was surprised that he had taken the reportroi of old songs by such as Don Gibson (O Lonesome Me), several Ray Price songs, and even a hymn, \\"It is no secret,\\" which I sang in my first amateur show at school. His fans out in the audience all knew the words to these '40s and '50s American recordings, even though they are from Ireland. Amazing!"},{"Title":"Lexical Semantics (Cambridge Textbooks in Linguistics)","review":"A mature science, like Physics, has a panoply of formalisms, apparati, and methods for making epistemic progress. But in a newer science, like semantics, how do you even get off the ground?Cruse here provides a marvelous exposition of the methods employed by semanticists, and some results obtainable from them. His intellectual honesty is such that he never claims more for them than what is warrented--he never tried to make too much stew from one oyster. There are vast areas of semantics and linguistics which just can't be formalized. But Cruse here shows us how at least to get started.The approach he describes is one he calls a \\"contextual\\" approach--\\"the semantic properties of a lexical item are fully reflected in appropriate aspects of the relations it contracts with actual and potential contexts\\". Astute readers will note the perhaps surprising agreement here between Cruse and Quinian Holism. To get a grip on the meaning of a word, the best way is to systematically examing sentences which contain that word, and see if the sentences seem intuitively \\"wrong\\" somehow or \\"right\\".For example, it tells us something about the meaning of the word \\"light\\" that the sentnece \\"It was too light for me to lift\\" seems wrong somehow. Certain readers might at first consider this intuition-based method to be hopelessly unscientific, but as Cruse points out, every measurement, at some point, depends upon human judgements--e.g. when measuring temperature, you have to judge which line on the thermometer is closest to the mercury. Indeed, that is what a measuring device does--makes quantities easier to make judment calls about. A great insight. Cruse developes analogous \\"measuring instruments\\" to help with investigating what words mean. Again, Cruse's intellectual honest is such that he never presses these too far, and he always fully respects the limits of these tools.Using these tools, Cruse then goes on to examine several ways in which words can be related to each other. These are:Taxonomical relations -- if fido is a dog, then he _is_ an animal, he _might_ be a poodle, but is _not_ a cat.Meronomies -- a finger is part of a hand, but not a subset of a hand.opposites -- if something is hot, it is not coldand many others. Always clearly written, always clear about the limitations, this book should be on the shelf of every semanticist. This book could also be profitably read as a case study in an advanced course on philosophy of science, showing how to extract scientifically useful information from an as-yet-unformalizable body of knowledge. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Lexical Semantics (Cambridge Textbooks in Linguistics)","review":"I am a huge linguistics reader. After reading much of Halliday's material, alongside Stanley Porter, and many others out of the Cambridge series, this resource was absolutely right when it asserted that \\"lexical semantics is unduly neglected\\" in literature today. D. A. Cruse here has put together an excellent examination about how words flow with meaning throughout the flow of a discourse. Issues such as modulation, Zeugma (i.e. cohesion), and established sense, all contribute what I consider to be an indispensable foundation for linguistic understanding. Written in a what the author admits is a style \\"for those with no background in linguistics\\" seems to presuppose that this is foundational teaching. I could not imagine a linguistic library without this resource.If you enjoy a direct style, combined with depth and breadth of examination on the topic of how words in a discourse (i.e. Lexical units) flow into an author's intent behind them to ultimately craft a accumulated reference of meaning--you will love and continue to come back to this resource."},{"Title":"How to Charleston correctly,","review":"This is a nice, inexpensive way to get started with the classic Charleston dance, and it is also an interesting historical document providing insight into the popular culture of the roaring 20s from the contemporary perspective of that time period.It would have been nicer if this book had additional sections dealing with more advanced moves, but one can always search for instructional DVDs on this dance, such as those available in the \\"World of Swing\\" series:World of Swing DVD #12 - CharlestonandWorld of Swing DVD #13 - Charleston 2.Since this seems to be the only book currently available that specifically deals with the Charleston dance, it is definitely a useful reference.Please disregard the mistaken review somebody posted last year alleging that this book is defective. As clearly stated on the back cover, the blank pages were added intentionally to bulk up for binding. So there is in fact NO missing section here. The content just goes only to page 30."},{"Title":"How to Charleston correctly,","review":"Interesting little book. I'm uncertain whether anyone could learn anything from a book about dance, but used as an aid or reference to enhance live instruction, it might be useful... perhaps.

As an undergraduate history student at the University of Mississippi in 1975, I was privileged, as a graduating senior, to pass on the final exams of any class where I was satisfied with the mid-term grade. With four \\"A's\\" already in the bag, I coasted throught that last half of the glorious Spring semester at Ole Miss. But I did avail myself of the opportunity to search those \\"dusty volumes of forgotten lore\\" in the history stacks of the great University library. And there I found, and read, this little treasure.A key phrase that the gifted author employs in his initial chapter has lingered with me ever since:\\"We must know justice, and love mercy; while yet there is time\\".Now this book was written in the critically important period between the World Wars. And the book can well be seen as the author's valiant attempt to alert his readers to the coming catastrophe. It can also be seen as a righteous denounciation of the absurd \\"wicked nation\\" theory that evidently animated much of the failed Treaty at Versailles. In regard to said treaty, I can still remember Ole Miss History Professor Colonel Dr. James Cooke, when completing a series of lectures on that treaty, opining as follows:\\"With this, we have the treaty at Versailles a signed, completed document; and World War II is virtually assured.\\"This is a wonderful, beautifully written book. And, as we may again be in a critical period between World Wars, its message still resonates. Find one, if you can, through Amazon's excellent Marketplace system. Enjoy this little treasure. And commit yourself to knowing justice and loving mercy still, while yet there is time.

Their lavish language and imagery is mirrored in the lush natural landscapes (primarily those of tropical Florida) in which the poems are set, landscapes charged with significances the poems usually leave just out of reach, \\"a sweet, negligent sentence//that the mind magnifies.\\" Frost loves listing the objects of her enchantment, the objects of the physical world which enchant her: \\"I consider my own similes-gardens, trees,/an orchard still rooted, light marine/in the blown air, fruit drunken on the swirl.\\" Like the fecund landscapes they portray, these poems are full to bursting. But they aren't simplistically or evasively pretty; they don't whitewash or evade the refuse and detritus of the world: knowing that \\"The body has a season and hungers,\\" their response is \\"Whatever it means, why not say it hurts.\\" The beautiful in these poems doesn't exclude pain; indeed, sometimes it's pain's source. Conversely, pain can be a resource, out of which beauty is made. We see this process of making something of pain in a poem like \\"The Gross Clinic,\\" which juxtaposes the speaker's troubled nephew's psychic scars, her sister the veterinarian's surgeries that both inflict and heal wounds, Michelangelo's investigations of the sometimes tortured forms that human flesh takes, and the scarred and grizzled protagonists of the Trojan War, wearing their battles on their skin, to teach us \\"this lesson of body.\\" The syntax of these poems is highly elastic and flexible, able to take in all the things with which the poems are brimming; at times the syntax gets a bit tangled and hard to follow, but this is only an occasional problem. Overall, this book shows Carol Frost to be a very fluent and often eloquent poet. As she insists in the last line of one poem, \\"I _will_ say beauty,\\" and so she does."},{"Title":"I Will Say Beauty","review":"It is a cliche to assume that the fading of light, the turning of the day is sexy. There is nothing cliche about I Will Say Beauty. Frost exacts a kind of perfect attention to the unguided details of life creating a kind of seductive landscape that is truly like no other.

When they kick the chair out from under me I can only hope to hear Frost saying Beauty."},{"Title":"I Will Say Beauty","review":"It is a cliche to assume that the fading of light, the turning of the day is sexy.

Greene never won an engagement, but never lost a campaign. In many ways he was the American Turenne, relentlessly campaigning through the Carolinas, respected and feared by his enemies, diligently followed by his disciplined, intrepid, and indefatigable Continentals, and served by a talented, tough group of subordinates such as Robert Kirkwood, Otho Williams, William Washinton, John Howard, and Edward Carrington. It was there, in the humid south, that the Revolution was won. It was the mauling given the British at Guilford Couthouse in March 1781, so soon after Camden, that drove Cornwallis to the decision to go into Virginia and to Yorktown. In that alone, the campaign was decisive.Lumpkin tells the story with wit, vigor, relentlessness, but not a few errors, which are minor. It is well-illustrated (I especially liked the picture of a member of Lee's Legion done by Clyde Risley-one of my favorite military artists), and the appendices are very helpful. In some areas of smaller detail, the book should be used with caution, but if used in conjunction with Wright's Continental Army and Ward's War of the Revolution, it is a reliable reference, a good story, and gives these long-forgotten campaigns a deserved look and the men who conducted the war in this theater long overdue recognition."},{"Title":"From Savannah to Yorktown: The American Revolution in the South","review":"Henry Lumpkin did a superb job detailing the battles leading to the close of the Revolutionary War. One of very few histories to mention/detail the massacre at the 1st Seige of Augusta (Sept 1780), his information clarified old family papers about my 6th great-grandfather's death there. This book is well-researched, easily read, very informative, descriptive, and cannot help but evoke emotion from its readers. Mr Lumpkin was quite successful in his discription of the viewpoints of the non-soldiers, the brother-against-brother, militiamen, Loyalists, Continental Army, the British, the trained officers, the untrained leaders, and the Native American's participation during their desparate fight for victory. This book is just different enough, it draws you into history as if it were happening now."},{"Title":"From Savannah to Yorktown: The American Revolution in the South","review":"I recommend this book for those interested in a clear ande concise narrative account of the American Revolution in the South.

His analysis is solid, a description I would not give to THE ROAD TO GUILFORD COURTHOUSE."},{"Title":"From Savannah to Yorktown: The American Revolution in the South","review":"Lumpkin has written an excellent account of the American Revolutionary War in the South in which family members and friends fought each other - the original Civil War!The author describes the actions in the South from the 1776 British attack on Charleston to the British surrender at Yorktown in 1781. In between the two engagements, Lumpkin also includes: Savannah, British capture of Charleston, Camden, Cowpens, Kings Mountain, Guilford Courthouse, Ninety-Six, and several smaller engagements. Since the war was won in the South, it is only fitting that such a text would be devoted to the southern theatre.While the narrative was extremely interesting and readable, there were few campaign and battle maps. Including more maps would have made the strategies and tactics easier to understand and would have merited (in my humble opinion) a 5-star rating.Complaint aside, I highly recommend the book as a very interesting account of what happened in the South during the American Revolution!Read and enjoy!"},{"Title":"From Savannah to Yorktown: The American Revolution in the South","review":"Gotta gotta gotta read this book. While the South is treated like a sideshow by northern historians the reality is the British lost the war there. This is a chronological study beginning with the fall of Savannah. After the disaster in South Carolina it is difficult to believe the war was not in fact lost. Yet somehow, with pluck and courage and unorthodox tactics these tough rural people brought down the mightiest army in the world. Modern historians, especially of the cultural marxist ilk are trying to reframe the campaign as a sadistic civil war. There was that component but it misses the larger picture. The Revolution was not only idealogically framed by Southerners (Jefferson), and led by a Southerners (Washington), it was won by Southerners (Marion, Sumter, Pickens and Morgan)."},{"Title":"From Savannah to Yorktown: The American Revolution in the South","review":"Very nice as advertised.

Mr. Lumnpkin's writing style is far better and keeps the reader interested & engaged. My only disappointment (preventing a 5 star review) is the lack of maps and illustrations.

This would be an excellent reference book for an assigned paper on the war. Also, the resources listed provide even more information.In summary, I highly recommend the book for anyone who is highly interested and well read on the southern battles. But, if you're just beginning your study of the revolution, you'd be much better off reading faster paced, more specific book.

In between are descriptions of Camden, the British capture of Charleston, Cowpens, Kings Mountain, Eutawville, Guilford Court House, and several smaller engagements.While the book is an excellent read, the battle descriptions and strategic manuevers are accompanied by too few maps.

The interactions between the adults and the boys are particularly wonderful, reflecting the hope, fear, love, pride, self-restraint, and occasional doubt we can't help but feel as we try to raise and release the young men who are so much a part of our souls.The Secret Lives of the Sushi Club is also an exciting pageturner, leaving you wondering until very near the end if the misguided and guilt-ridden religious zealot will actually strike out at the infidels he likes.In a red state/blue state nation, it's delightful to find an author of Ms. Yorke's calibre, who not only sees shades of gray, but can make a cogent argument for appreciating friends with different interests, religions, and political beliefs. She advocates a big tent, and knows where to draw the line.I'd encourage men and women alike to buy this book and allow themselves the time to read it. You'll feel as if you've entered another world. Your new best friends are more than a little hard to leave behind. Just don't be surprised if they whisper a few suggestions in your ear, before you close the book."},{"Title":"The Secret Lives of the Sushi Club","review":"The Secret Lives of the Sushi Club is a fabulous book that stayed with me long after I finished it. It is exceedingly well written and the characters leap off the page, inviting you into their flawed but all too human lives. Everyone can find something in this book that speaks to them, some part of it that you recognize from deep in your soul."},{"Title":"The Secret Lives of the Sushi Club","review":"I bought this book yesterday. It looked like a fun read. Little did I know I'd stay up all night to finish! Amazing story, and even more amazing characters, from foul-talking movie stars to mousy legal aides to gun-toting prom queens to psychics to river runners to terrorists, each one of them written without cliche or stereotypes. I loved it!"},{"Title":"The Secret Lives of the Sushi Club","review":"I've read Summer of Glorious Madness and Song of the Seals by Christy Yorke, and found both deep, engrossing, and magical. The Secret Lives of the Sushi Club has many of those same qualities, but seems lighter somehow, maybe because it focuses on four main characters instead of one. Still, the author's unique voice is there, as are the beautiful descriptions and deep insights into people's desires and demons. To me, this qualifies as more of a \\"beach read\\"--not as demanding but just as enjoyable!"},{"Title":"The Secret Lives of the Sushi Club","review":"The back cover sold me. Four friends, one of them betraying the others with a revealing novel. But that's not really what this is about. The dynamic of the friendship is lost somewhere. I kept waiting for it to get better and it just got worse. I decided to stop reading it about two-thirds through and I'm not the least bit curious about how it ended.

It was readable, but hardly exciting, profound or wondrous. In fact, parts of it were laughable. An elk that thinks he's Elvis? Give me a break! A man who may be \\"part fish?\\" Yeah, right.Then there's the ambiguity surrounding the character Jina. Why does she spell her name like that? Is it just exoticised Italian, or something more? I happen to know that Ji-na can be a Korean women's name, and there are hints that she might be Asian, but this needs to be made clear long, long before the book ever goes to print. And don't even get me started on the requisite Arab bad guy.A nice \\"pitch\\" novel, full of elements designed to appeal to readers. In terms of achieving something as a novel, though, it's a mess."},{"Title":"The Usborne Jigsaw World Atlas (Usborne Jigsaw Books)","review":"The pieces in the puzzles are not the shapes of the countries, they are just regular jigsaw pieces. I don't think this is as good for learning."},{"Title":"The Usborne Jigsaw World Atlas (Usborne Jigsaw Books)","review":"This six picture jigsaw world atlas was a Christmas gift for our five-year-old. One of the reviews states that the puzzle would be better if the jigsaw pieces were in the shape of the countries, but even most adults would find it extremely challenging to locate the 190+ countries of the world. We need to remember that the puzzle is geared for four to eight-year-olds. Although this atlas is designed for the little ones, there are few adults that will be unable to take something from this book. There are many colorful pictures to look at and discuss in addition to locating the countries. Unfortunately there are several smaller countries missing from the atlas. I am guessing Usborne Publishing feels it does matter since most people do not know about little nations such as Andorra, Maldives, Trinidad and Tobago, and Sao Tome and Principe. As a former geography teacher, I find it rather disappointing. A slight criticism of the book that some have had is that the puzzle pieces can be a little challenging to put in place. However, I would much rather have this challenge as opposed to pieces that are falling out of the book. My daughter really likes the book and will learn a great deal from it.

The reader is not bogged down by scientific descriptions [I mean, why is it necessary to give the latitude and longitude coordinates, or the location of an asteroid in relation to Alpha Centauri? Yes, I've seen it done.

I figured, &quot;I love all of his other books, how could I go wrong?&quot; Five pages into this book I was silently screaming for the torture to stop. Obviously, this is a novellete or short story that Niven read and decided to slap his name onto. As a science fiction story it is fair to midling, as literature, however, it is complete and utter drivel. The social commentary is so elementary, so tired, so totaly washed up, that I have pains in my head from trying to block it out. The whole thing with Wilville and Orbur, bycicle carvers turned air-machine makers, and the introduction of coins as &quot;spell tokens&quot; just makes me retch. Throw in a pinch of woman's lib and assebly line technology, and what we get is a seventh grader's story about an interesting and even exiting culture that could have really worked, had Niven actually put any work into the darn thing.It left a bad taste in my mouth.

Re-read All the Myriad Ways again."},{"Title":"The Flying Sorcerers","review":"Gerrold and Niven are both excellent SF writers. I usually enjoy their books, and both have built up large and high-quality bodies of work. That's why the badness of \\"Flying Sorcerers\\" is so baffling. It's like they banged this out in a weekend on a bet.Much is made of the alleged humor of this novel. Fannish jokes and puns belong at Worldcon, not in a book put out for sale to the general public. Their humor value fails to rise over the level of Granpa's thighslappers. For example, two young alien boys who build a flying machine are called \\"Wilville\\" and \\"Orbur.\\" Ho, ho. My sides! And the gags go downhill from there.So why 2 stars instead of one? Despite all of its flaws, this is still an amiable book. \\"Ringworld Throne\\" aside, both Niven and Gerrold have enough talent to make this book at least somewhat interesting, and to keep the thin plot moving.If you're interested in these authors, and you should be, pick out almost anything from their extensive catalogs before you purchase this."},{"Title":"The Flying Sorcerers","review":"I picked this up (or it was loaned to me) because I was tickled by the title.

I recently read this book with my 8 year old son, and both of us found it hard to put down. The story takes place during the Civil War. A young naval engineer is called upon to help with the development of the the North's first ironclad ship. This ship is vital to the Union's defense because the Confederacy already has such a ship - a ship that is causing a great deal of damage. Ms Sappey has a wonderful way of bringing the past alive."},{"Title":"The Civil War & Reconstruction (Eyewitness History of the Civil War)","review":"This is a pretty good history of the Civil War. It has good pictures and an easy to read narrative of the war. It also has a lengthy appendix that includes many of the relevant historical documents, such as the Constitutions of the USA and the Confederacy, Lincoln and Jefferson's inaugural addresses, the Gettysburg Address, short biographies of the major personalities of the era and battlefield maps.At the end of each chapter, there is a lengthy section of quotes from participants and commentators of the day. This interesting addition makes the narrative read much quicker, but allows the reader to look at the topic in more detail if he/she chooses.Unfortunately, there are some errors in the book due to poor editing. Two, in particular, bugged me. I used this book to look for info on the battle of Gettysyburg and I was unable to find it. Its in there, but the chapter it is included in is mistitled. It is entitled: \\"Closing the Ring: The East: November 1863-March 1865.\\" It should be November 1862. My difficulties arose from the date of the Gettysburg Battle which is included in this chapter - July 1863.The second error came when the Grant's forces in Kentucky were called the Eastern army, rather than Northern or Union. Some might say, but were they Easterners in a Union army in Kentucky? No, they were mostly from Illinois - out West in the 1860s.So, I will keep this book as a reference, due to its fantastic appendices, but I will lower its grade due to sloppy editing. Grade: \\"B\\""},{"Title":"The Civil War & Reconstruction (Eyewitness History of the Civil War)","review":"It is uncommon because it is chock full of interesting, often pivotal facts; it has well-thought out and economically written introductions to the various chapters; and it is a fast read. And although the organization facilitates easy reading, at times (for instance when discussing the arcane aspects of the various battles) it seems inappropriate for that particular substance. It is often difficult to untangle the various players or to discern the objectives of the military leaders.But that said, there are many opportunities for the reader to recover: Often the material in the chronologies and in the excellent eyewitness reports repeats that contained in the main text, albeit at a slightly different angle and often in a slightly different context. This repetition allows the reader a chance to get a stereo view of the substance. This is especially true in the discussions of the various battles, which even under the best of circumstances are difficult to keep track of. [A word of warning to the reader: Please have a handy collection of Civil War maps available. The ones included in the appendices are keyed only to specific battles, and do not allow a general strategic geographic overview. If the reader hopes to be able to \\"play along\\" with the general's strategies he will need his own maps to follow along side the text.]A few of the facts that came as news to me were:(1) The attack on Fort Sumner was really militarily unnecessary, but was a political fait accompli aimed at lower class Southern whites who owned no slaves, but who would be expected to bare the brunt of the war (that is become foot soldiers and cannon fodder for the landed gentry and the slaveocracy, which they dii indeed become). Gen Anderson, the Union Commander of the Fort, had made clear that in three days his provisions would run out and he would have to surrender in any case. No one was killed in this attack although more than 4000 artillery rounds were fired.(2) At Bull Run, the first battle of the Civil War, spectators came out to watch it as if it were entertainment, and many were caught between the lines when the Feds were send scurry back across the Potomac.(3) Most of the Indian Tribes - many caught behind southern lines -- were forced to join the Confederacy.(4) Sam Houston, then Governor of Texas, resigned after Texas sided with the Confederacy.(5) General John C. Fremont issued the first act of emancipation of the slaves. It was issued for the State of Missouri in the aftermath of a Union lost to the South near the Missouri-Arkansas border. Lincoln, engaging in tactical politics to woo the remaining fence sitters -- quickly rescinded that order.On balance though, this is a tasty addition to the Civil War literature.

This cross-dressing she later took into her real life.If anything this seems like a slow unfolding and destruction of a life. Much of it seems to be from her original autobiography published in the mid eighteenth century - no doubt to boost her finances as well - but gradually she was forced into all kinds of generally male dominated occupations.Saddening to read, at times heavy going, but enlightening. This is an excellent portrayal of the limitations on women in this period, and the consequences."},{"Title":"Charlotte: Being a True Account of an Actress's Flamboyant Adventures in Eighteenth-Century London's Wild and Wicked Theatrical World","review":"Good historians are often dismal writers, but Shevelow's narrative is engaging without veering off into conjecture or baseless fluff. The story of the actress Charlotte is an interesting skeleton which the author uses to support more general historical detail about the period. This context adds greatly to the story. Another strength is that Shevelow never falls prey to the twin failings of biographers - slavering adoration or spiteful condemnation. She also doesn't accept uncritically the image of Charlotte offered by either Charlotte herself or her contemporaries.The book does tend to drag a bit when Charlotte's official stage career ends, but that is more due to the factual circumstances of the woman's life than the author's fault. In fact people who want insight into the lives and lifestyles of England's less fortunate citizens may find this section very rewarding. Personal preference really.Overall a well-researched, compellingly-written biography."},{"Title":"Charlotte: Being a True Account of an Actress's Flamboyant Adventures in Eighteenth-Century London's Wild and Wicked Theatrical World","review":"This book is of interest to anyone who cares about 18th century England but it also could work well for someone looking for an introduction to those extraordinary days.

The main characters are Anglo-Irish, ruling class, aristocracy and gentry, and the novel focuses upon their relationships to eachother, both real and perceived. The title character, Charlotte, is an unmarried, middle-aged woman who behaves differently with each person with whom she interacts. She is romantically interested in Mr Lambert, an old (and married) friend, and does much for him, including lending him money. She behaves another way with Sir and Lady Dysart, and with their son and heir Christopher (respectful, accommodating). She has far less patience and love for young, beautiful Francie Fitzpatrick, a distant relative who is sent to live with her when Francie's family falls upon hard times financially. She (quite rightly) perceives Francie as a threat, and treats her poorly from the moment Francie arrives at Charlotte's home. Charlotte is outright mean and cruel to servants, Lambert's wife (who is supposed to be a good friend), tenants, and anyone she ranks as below her socially.Charlotte is not the only one who hides her true nature. Mr. Lambert married for the income his wife brought to the marriage, but pays no attention to her, obviously does not love her, and openly courts Francie and displays jealousy and anger when he notices the mutual attraction between Francie and a young British army officer. He acts respectful to Christopher Dysart's face, but privately despises him and talks about him behind his back. He uses Charlotte--borrowing money from her, being friendly with her (which Charlotte interprets to mean something more than mere friendship), yet privately acknowledges to himself and others that he is not attracted to Charlotte. He also embezzles money from his employer's estate to pay for his horses, drinking, and gifts to Francie, without so much as a single thought that what he is doing is not only morally wrong but is a crime!Francie is perhaps the most honest of all of the characters in this Irish tragedy, but even she is not entirely honest, not to others nor to herself. I find it easier to excuse her because she is a teenager in a difficult situation, has extremely limited options, and acts accordingly. She is honest about her growing feelings of love for Gerald Hawkins, the British officer, but he does not reciprocate that honesty--he is engaged to another woman (who will bring money to the marriage) but does not tell Francie. When she learns about his fiancee and realizes that the love between them is not enough, she breaks off her relationship with Gerald. Francie also receives the attentions of the socially-challenged (shy) Christopher Dysart, but she turns down his marriage proposal. A huge fight with Charlotte ensues, and she returns to her family in Dublin.After Lambert's wife (conveniently) dies, Lambert follows Francie to Dublin, and makes an offer for her (in marriage), even though she has no money. He is physically attracted to her youth and beauty, and she, seeking to escape the hopeless poverty she faced with her family in Dublin, marries him even though she does not love him. It is this marriage, which set Charlotte over the edge, and she seeks her revenge upon him in a manner true to the saying \\"hell hath no fury like a woman scorned.\\"This Irish tragedy could have been averted had all of the characters displayed greater moral turpitude and honesty with both themselves and with others in their lives. The novel presents an interesting glimpse into a society which places a value upon people relative to the class into which they are born, and illustrates how unhappy people are when they marry for money instead of love. The characters are dishonest because the society in which they live values and rewards dishonest behavior and superficial values. Physical appearance (beauty) is valued above integrity, love, kindness, etc. One of the reasons Lambert is so taken with Francie is because she is young and beautiful, even though they are not a good match. Francie receives most, if not all, of the male attention because of her physical appearance, and has a greater chance of marriage than Charlotte, who is not physically attractive.The novel is well-written, the characters well-developed, and, even though I found none of them to have any redeeming characteristics, the story was compelling to the end. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Real Charlotte","review":"Don't buy the Kindle edition of this book. It consists only of Volume 2. Basically you are getting a book that starts out in the middle and omits the entire first part."},{"Title":"The Real Charlotte","review":"I really wanted to point out that the first customer review had a strange misuse of the word turpitude in the sentence, &quot;This Irish tragedy could have been averted had all of the characters displayed greater moral turpitude and honesty with both themselves and with others in their lives.&quot;A sort of moral turpitude is the problem all the characters have. Displaying &quot;greater moral turpitude&quot; is not the solution needed!!! I read this book because I had enjoyed the Masterpiece Series &quot;Experiences of an Irish R.M.&quot; but The Real Charlotte is a completely different and very disturbing novel. I don't know many people who dissemble to this degree, and I hope I never meet many. The feeling of the book is disturbing, though I think it is well written."},{"Title":"The Real Charlotte","review":"everything you hope for in a classic. complex characters, interesting plot, the story pulls you along and it makes you think. when you are finished you feel you have gained something."},{"Title":"Easy Games for Youngsters : A Compilation of Indoor-Outdoor Games, Designed For Use by Teachers and Parents With Kindergarten Through Fourth Grade","review":"This book for parents or teachers of younger grades is filled with great ideas for games with sections on \\"Paper and Pencil Games\\", \\"Games to Improve Basic Skills\\", \\"Easy-to-Make Contests\\", and \\"Easy Indoor-Outdoor Games\\"."},{"Title":"Kundalini from Hell to Heaven","review":"Namaste, readers. (Peace)The other five star reviewers say it very well. I have just finished buying and reading this book this June, 2009. I can only add that this is the most important book I have read in the last 30 years because I find myself in the midst of major Kundalini symtoms right now.I have been meditating since the early 1970's. No yoga or exercises. Just meditating. In those days not much was written and understood about Kundalini. I am blessed to have found this book and its author Ganga Karmokar, also known as Swami-G at this point in my life. I did not know 99 per cent of this book, but without a doubt she knows. Many of the things she has written have happened to me since. Kundalini keeps expressing itself (sometimes daily) over a long period of time.Kundalini experiences can be very frightening to the experiencer who has little or no prior knowledge of the subject because the unknown scares. With the help of this book I can now understand more of what is happening to me and where I am going. I know I will re-read this book many times. It is one of the few books I would want on a deserted island with me. Yes, it is truly that important to me.This book also explains what a guru is and the importance of finding one who has completed the whole journey as there are so many trappings of the ego with the journey.I am also thankful the book has a dictionary at the end as I am a Westerner, a Texan, in fact. There are a few Eastern words that I had to look up several times but the book is for All. The Eastern words used are commonly used in other books. The book is very easy to read and very concise. No extraneous verbosity here. No life story of the author, etc. She gets right down to business and stays on the subject matter!To some it may seem that I am going overboard with this review but it is a lifesaver for me. This book is priceless to me."},{"Title":"Kundalini from Hell to Heaven","review":"Namaste Dear One -i am the author of the book and it is a bit different in that it is not a book that shows how to start the kundalini and activate it, but rather what to do once you are in the midst of an awakening... it also shows health professionals what to look for in diagnosing kundalini versus any of the other numerous catagories and labels that get acquired... this book does not show chakras and pathways but tells how kundalini works with consciousness and how to navigate the experience successfully... it is ALSO great for others that are one the path to Liberation in this lifetime by means of Self Enquiry...Love to All who find this book... shanti shant Maha Shanti OM...g."},{"Title":"Kundalini from Hell to Heaven","review":"Ganga Karmokar's book From Hell to Heaven is an invaluable book for anyone on a spirtual path, but without doubt a crucial read and continual guide for one actually going through a Kundalini Awakening.I am in the midst of an Awakening and have kept the book at my side continually. It has become my working manual, one in which I can make notes and continue to reread as the process unfolds.Everytime I reread passages I find that I come to a deeper and even richer understanding of this sacred path. It is a book that has a positive and energetic life flow to it, and seems to be able to address the question or need of the moment.The book comprehensively describes what the process is, and the tools and directions for forward movement and balance through the process. It also has Question and Answer sections with Ganga answering myriads of relevant questions that have answered many of my own questions along the way.I have the great fortune of knowing Ganga personally and being her student. She enabled me to understand what was happening to me, and was tireless in her guidance and continues to be as well as her book. She is totally dedicated to helping others through this process as well as on other spiritual paths. It is important for one to have the steering guidance of one who has successfully forged through this amazing and difficult process to Self-Realization such as Ganga Karmokar has!Hopefully, this book will be widely read and used not only by those seeking spiritual guidance and growth, but also by Health Care professionals of which I am one,(psychologists, psychiatrists, counselors, and general practicioners, etc.)who are called upon as helpers by individuals going through Spiritual Transformation. In many cases, these clients can be in spiritual crisis, and this book is a Life-Saver. From Hell to Heaven is a ground-breaking and vitally important book, offering vast experiential knowledge and guidance, love, and sacred motivation to anyone seeking spiritual growth, but especially to those in the process of an Awakening and to those who are assisting them through it. Thank you Ganga!!"},{"Title":"Kundalini from Hell to Heaven","review":"Many authors write about the Kundalini experience only, how to awaken it through yoga etc. Some of these books are frightening, offer no direction and lead to further confusion. Ganga's book not only explains the Kundalini process, but gives tools and direction on how to proceed. When one is lost in the Kundalini experience, clear direction from one who has sucessfully navigated out of this process is crucial. Ganga is this one.Most health professionals (though many are well intentioned) have no understaning of the kundalini process, even though some claim they do. The remedies they offer can create further confusion, fear and dependency. Ganga's book lists clear kundalini symptomotology. It his her hope that all individuals with a kundalini awakening will receive the right guideance. All that I write about I know from my own experience. I had a kundalini awakening years ago and believe me in the midst of this I was desperate for answers that I was unable to find until, to my good fortune, I met Ganga. All that she has laid out in the book she has told me personally and more, and the benefit is beyond description. If I could give this book more than five stars, I would.It is my hope that this book begins to circulate in the public and professional sphere. It is a highly useful book which I can't say about any other I've read. It is encouraging, supportive and not frightening at all. If one is truly serious about completeing the kundalini process this book offers answers and the rest is up to the individual. It is a must read!"},{"Title":"Kundalini from Hell to Heaven","review":"&quot;With personal accounts (including the Author's own), many questions and answers, information concerning the 7 realms of conciousness (chakras), valuable tools and how to use them, i found this book full of pearls-no occultism, no esotericism or complex and unusable information here. In my opinion, a complex process needs straight-forward explanations. A confusing and often fearful experience yearns for grounding guidance-and that's what i found in this book. The explanations are based on the expert knowledge of one who has traversed the path to its full length and now wants to help others in finding their way home&quot;."},{"Title":"Kundalini from Hell to Heaven","review":"I bought this book after coming across website of Ganga Karmokar ( a.k.a Guru Swami-G ). It was a mandatory reading to be her student. And I am glad I bought the book .The book clearly explains the different symptoms of an awakened Kundalini. It shares different practices which will bring immediate balance to one with an awakened kundalini. It also has many revealing questions and answers which brings in more clarity to one seeking the truth. My favorite poem in the book is \\"Contemplation of Self\\". Reading it itself expand's one's consciousness. It also shares the kundalini journeys of many other students. All in all, the book is filled with wisdom that will help anyone with an awakened Kundalini.I would 100 % recommend anyone to buy this book because of all the above.--Santhip"},{"Title":"Kundalini from Hell to Heaven","review":"SO down to earth, so understandable, this unique journey from the \\"ancient mind\\" of man into the \\"new\\" mind destined for all of us! I couldn't put this book down and have underlined all over it. I found myself wishing that I were spiritually sensitive and advanced enough to call her, for her wisdom. If you are on a spiritual path which includes digesting and integrating your entire human experience, and then experiencing its transcendance after your kundalini \\"decides\\" to rise permanently, get this book. The journey sounds like Christ's words, \\"I have overcome the world,\\" to tell you the truth. It happens when the lens through which you see life, physiologically and spiritually moves out of what you think of as your normal \\"mind\\" and takes up residence in the totally conscious, aware background underlying all of our existence: this is who we are before we came to earth, this eternal consciousness. We come home, and merge with who we deep-down KNOW ourselves to be. This consciousness includes love, peace, the stillness-holding-all-potential, etc., and through our new lens, we now perceive our mind as our handy tool to use whenever we want, but no longer are we at its mercy. We still grow in understanding of life and ourselves after the shift, but the paradigm in which we live is transformed forever. Whew! I can't wait! But will it happen in this lifetime? For some, it has, and these folks are out there trying to encourage us to \\"go for the gold.\\" Personally, I think regular \\"Oneness Deeksha\\" speeds up the progress toward the shift. It definitely, gradually stops the self-critical thoughts we all have, and life feels more abundant and peaceful. They're given free, most places. Sounds like I'm hawking, but I want you to be happy and move as fast as you can, too! We're all in this together! The book is wonderful."},{"Title":"Kundalini from Hell to Heaven","review":"If your Kundalini is active this book is a must read.

Oh My Oh My Oh Dinosaurs!","review":"We received Barnyard Dance! and Oh My Oh My Oh Dinosaurs! when our son was born. We started reading them to him before he could talk. There is a wonderful, enchanting way that Boynton uses words and drawings to create an exciting connection for young children. In addition, I will remember until the day I die the joy of my son pointing at words or characters as I read the text with enthusiastic expression. Six years later, our daughter was born and we renewed our connection with Boynton's books with the same heart-warming experience. These are simply great pre-reader books. Both my wife and I recommended them and we have given sets to friends who have also found them to be fun and joy-full."},{"Title":"Big Box of Boynton: Barnyard Dance! Pajama Time!

Oh My Oh My Oh Dinosaurs!","review":"This set of 3 Boynton books costs about $12 on Amazon, and buying any 2 would cost the same price. You basically get a free book. This particular set includes 2 of my top 4 Boynton books - Barnyard Dance! and Pajama Time! (the other 2 beingHappy Hippo, Angry Duck: A Book of Moods (Boynton on Board)andHippos Go Berserk). Oh My Oh My Oh Dinosaurs! is OK, but I won't complain since I basically got it for free!Barnyard Dance! is wonderful. It's the story of an animal square dance with pigs, ducks, cows, chickens, etc. promenading and swinging around the room. It's super-fun to read and has a wonderful rhythm and beat, and I feel like a square dance caller whenever I read it (which it turns out is a very nice feeling to have). I think the fact that it makes me behave silly and enthusiastically makes the book resonate more with my daughter.Pajama Time! is also a good one. I have some trouble figuring out the rhythm (as other reviewers have noted as well), but it's still fun to read and very silly. Basically, this book is a celebration of the pajama and going to bed ritual. It is lost on my 10-month old, but I have a feeling the \\"Pajammy to the left! Pajammy to the right! P.J.\\" will become an important going-to-bed-mantra in our household when my daughter gets a bit older. I sort of imagine the Menomena song from the Muppets as I read it.I do not think Oh My Oh My Oh Dinosaurs! is one of Sandra Boynton's best, in all honesty, but it is fine as a throw in (essentially, it's free with the other two) and kids like dinosaurs so I'm sure it will be appreciated by my daughter when she's a bit older. This was the first Boynton book I ever read and I really didn't get why people like her so much (very basic, \\"Dinosaurs big, and dinosaurs small\\" type stuff), but then I read some of her other books and grew a fondness even for this one by association."},{"Title":"Big Box of Boynton: Barnyard Dance! Pajama Time! Oh My Oh My Oh Dinosaurs!","review":"The Boynton books are fun and silly, but never sappy. Adults will chuckle, and kids will love to hear these over and over again.

Pajama Time! Oh My Oh My Oh Dinosaurs!","review":"We received \\"Oh My, Oh My, Oh Dinosaurs\\" free during a pediatrician's check-up. My daughter wanted it read to her every night. After 3 months we had to replace the book. That is when I found out about all the other books by Boynton. I am impressed. These books are good for short bed time stories just before bed for 18 months and over."},{"Title":"Big Box of Boynton: Barnyard Dance! Pajama Time! Oh My Oh My Oh Dinosaurs!","review":"Sandra Boynton did an amazing job with these books. Of course, in true Boynton style, they all rhyme and have cute illustrations. Pajama Time is my FAVORITE! It's sing-songy and my son smiles when we say, \\"Pajammy to the left, Pajammy to the right...Jamma jamma jamma jamma, P.J.!\\" He also reaches out to touch some of the pictures even though they aren't touch and feel books. Barnyard Dance is also sing-songy and cute. The dinosaur book has opposites and is very clever.My other favorite books of hers are What's Wrong Little Pookie?, The Belly Button Book, The Going to Bed Book, and Doggies. (Although, I like every book of hers I've read.) In some ways it seems like Far Side for kids."},{"Title":"Big Box of Boynton: Barnyard Dance! Pajama Time!

I love them too, I really like the way Boynton plays with words and sounds in all of the books. Also, my son loves animals and all of the books illustrate animals in them. These books are fun and silly and my son loves me to read to him, he likes them so much that he has them memorized and sometimes reads to himself or to his little brother.

We love the books, they have great artwork, memorable recurring characters, and age-appropriate (but not heavy-handed) themes. The books in this set complement the rest of our Boynton collection, and our daughter loves them as much as the rest. The rhymes in this set are a bit more sing-song then in our other Boynton book, but in a good way.We can't recommend all of the books by Sandra Boynton more highly for parents...and their kids!"},{"Title":"Big Box of Boynton: Barnyard Dance!

The illustrations are adorable and the stories are funny, sweet, silly, and quick (which is a huge bonus if it's aready past bedtime). Our hands-down favorite is \\"Barnyard Dance\\"...it's especially funny if you can read it as if you're actually the caller at a hoedown. Another favorite is \\"But Not the Hippopotamus\\" and \\"Horns to Toes and In Between\\" which is great for teaching body parts. If you're looking for silly, cute, and funny, Sandra's books do not disappoint."},{"Title":"Big Box of Boynton: Barnyard Dance! Pajama Time!

My kids absolutely love these books."},{"Title":"The Lively Art of Writing","review":"Whether it is developing a thesis or hooking paragraphs, the Lively Art of Writing is a waste of time and energy. It teaches absolutely nothing and only gives a very tight form rather than allowing students to develop their own style. Used in English classes for God knows how long, it gets worse with age. About the only thing this book has going for it is that it's so fun to make fun of-- the dumb analogies and Lucille V. Payne's obsession with drag-racing, especially, have kept my English class highly amused."},{"Title":"The Lively Art of Writing","review":"This book has no point to it. It teaches you common sense stuff. It has no value in real life. This book is very boring and useless. A student can not read this book, it is too boring and useless. Waste of Money. This is a waste of [$]. If you have already bought this book, it can be used as pretty good fire wood, and that's what the one star is for."},{"Title":"The Lively Art of Writing","review":"Unfortunatly I was required to read this atrocious book for school. I am a very forgiving student when it come to books that are dull, but this one drove me past my limit. The examples are outdated and pointless. There are too many references to dreag racing and silverware.Granted she might have some good points but you can't see them because they are buried so deeply in her ramblings. It was THE MOST BORING BOOK I have ever read!! It was difficult staying awake.This torture may have been worthwhile if there was something to be learned. Unfortunately there is nothing to be learned!!!You could condense the book down to ONE sentence- Writing is important, like drag racing, and never say the word there. Okay thats the book.I just saved you 7 bucks and the pain of deciphering the boring words in MICROSCOPIC PRINT. Ilearned as much froim her book as I do from SWEDISH PROPAGANDA that i do not understand.Only Swedish propaganda wasd more interseting!!"},{"Title":"The Lively Art of Writing","review":"Can't stand it.

English for my homeschooling kids. This magical little book is by far the easiest to apply to homeschooling formats, the most thorough, and far and away the cheapest solution to our problem. I can't rave about it enough.Please don't be put off by some reviews here that call Payne's little book &quot;boring&quot;---it's not MTV, certainly, but it's succinct and gets right down to business in a chatty style. The examples are dated, true, but I find that a plus: teens are more willing to properly evaluate the arguments for or against, say, drag racing (a puzzling social &quot;problem&quot; to our kids)than more volatile modern issues that kick in a more knee-jerk emotional response. The dated examples are quaint rather than distracting, and they don't detract from her lessons.Essays can be excruciatingly formulaic, or they can blend, in Payne's words, &quot;fact with imagination, knowledge with feeling, never giving itself over wholly to one or the other. But its purpose is always the same: to express an opinion.&quot; Learning the format and developing elegant, personal style is what this gem is all about. And a book that combines an all-in-one guide to constructing an essay (as opposed to a report or a manual) combined with a VERY useful style section is really hard to find! It's funny, too--her crusade against the passive voice, &quot;A Plan For Self-Protection&quot; is a good example: &quot;At this extreme, passive voice aquires a peculiar aura of its own, a subtle undertone of ah-how-sweet-and-sad-and-strange the world is(always pleasing to the young, and to the young writer almost irresistable). Resist it. It's just secretarial prose with its face painted: all dressed up but still going nowhere.&quot;Thoughtful questions at the end of each short chapter help with comprehension. This would be a great &quot;text&quot; to use in a co-op setting, although it would work well with a student learning alone. Thank goodness it's still available!"},{"Title":"The Lively Art of Writing","review":"There tend to be two levels of achievement in everything we do: the functional level, and the superb level. In school, we are taught the functional level; in life, we admire the superb level. Drivers education will not make you a race car driver, and your english class will not make you a good writer.In this book, however, are the skills and techniques necessary to take your writing and expression beyond the current level. Since I've read the words in that book, the words in my papers have suddenly been lining up for me and saying things in clever ways.The book talks about specific ways, and gives specific examples, of how good writers write. There is no bull in this book. If you read it, apply it, and write a lot - you will improve your writing.It used to take me about eighteen hours to write a single page paper because my mind would go off in so many directions trying to get my idea on paper. It now takes me about twenty minutes, because I am able to think through an entire paper before I write it.It sounds rather fanciful, but in reality it isn't. The book helps select what literary methods to use. It is your caddy. In your bag are many tricks which you use to drive ideas home or push thoughts along. Each trick, like a golf club, is useful in certain situations. The caddy helps you pick them.Most other books give you the clubs but not the caddy. This book is different because it tells you how and when to use them - and it knows. This is not your pimple-faced 12 year old caddy... Oh no, this is the real deal. This is the caddy that will get you off of the torn up local greens and onto your neighbors TV screen... Leave the functional and join the superb. This book will help you get there."},{"Title":"The Lively Art of Writing","review":"This book has helped me tremendously, not only as a writer but as a teacher of writing, as well. I often recommend this book to students who want to improve their writing style; it is easy to read and practices the art that it preaches. I find it much more useful than most of the handbooks that appear on composition course syllabi, and I even prefer it to that classic text by Strunk and White, The Elements of Style. The chapter on Passive Voice is especially good. I think that this book ought to have a place in every writer's library!"},{"Title":"The Lively Art of Writing","review":"I'm aghast that this invaluable book has received only a single review, and a poor one at that. My high school freshman English class used this book, and I still have my copy a decade and a half later. It's the single most useful book I've read on writing fundamentals, and I recommend it highly to those who are actually interested in learning to write. There has never been any point in trying to achieve a personal style before mastering the fundamentals of logical organization and tight writing.Some of the examples, perhaps, could use a little updating, but the fundamentals of good writing have not changed appreciably since the book was published. I've learned a lot about writing since high school, of course (I now write professionally), but I can't imagine any better book for teaching the basics."},{"Title":"The Lively Art of Writing","review":"Lively Art of Writing (LAW) has been my bible all throughout school when I first read it in high school. Every writing class, every English class, every class I had to write a paper in, this book was beside me.LAW teaches you the correct way to format and brainstorm and create an essay. It's a quick reference guide with shortcuts and help for fluid writing. Through the numerous years of school, I never got marked down for formatting on any of my papers...all because of this book. I would recommend it to anyone who might have trouble with writing or formatting. Even those who don't have trouble could learn a thing or two from LAW.Yes it is a bit boring (hence the 4 stars instead of 5), but it is not nearly as mind-numbingly irritating as an MLA handbook with its contradictory insturctions."},{"Title":"The Lively Art of Writing","review":"I read this in my 10th grade english class. It was tedious, outdated, and often boring. However, it holds a lot of good tips and techniques that I now use all the time.I'm not sure why Lucille's lessons have stuck with me. All I know is my writing is effortless now, and very much improved. This book isn't always enjoyable, but it is a valuble resource for any student."},{"Title":"The Lively Art of Writing","review":"I used this book because it was required as part of the curriculum for our 10th grade honors english class. We were required to do the assignments at the end of each chapter as homework. Although i have to agree sometimes with the people who think Lucille can get very very boring, looking beyond that, she has some great insights on how to write an essay and thesis statements, intro and conclusions. Her examples can get a little outdated(who cares about why a woman wants sterling silver!), but she has insights that i foud to be very helpful and that showed me on my way to becoming a better writer."},{"Title":"The Lively Art of Writing","review":"This book has proven to be invaluable in teaching writing skills. I have used it for College Composition classes at the 11th- and 12th-grade levels with great success. Its graduated step-by-step process and explanation of the thesis statement provide students with clear guidelines. The examples may lack imagination, but their effectiveness is undeniable."},{"Title":"The Lively Art of Writing","review":"This book is a well-organized and well-written primer on essay writing. Payne provides a &quot;nuts and bolts&quot; approach that helps beginning writers understand how to structure persuasive essays. Whether discussing the introduction, the body, or the conclusion of an essay, or her advice is sensible and her techniques are practical. I've used this book as a resource to teach high school students how to think about and organize the persuasive essay. If your looking for practical advice and useable techniques for essay writing, this is the place to begin!"},{"Title":"The Lively Art of Writing","review":"The LAW was something I used 30 years ago as a high school student; now I recommend it to my university students who need help writing. While the examples are a bit dated, the lessons are still apropos. Those reviewers who found it boring and tedious are showing their immaturity. This is NOT a novel, it is not entertainment, it is a how to book on how to WRITE an essay. Lucile Vaughan Payne wrote a fabulous little book 42 years ago and it is still useful today. If you cannot get past the lack of entertainment value then you will not be able to learn the lessons anyway. If you want to learn to write, get this book!"},{"Title":"The Lively Art of Writing","review":"the book itself is awesome!

I read it during summer, and it's very easy to understand. I grasp the basic concept that this author is trying to teach, but after my teacher taught me with it, I had understand even more. This author is right! People write for others to understand. You can write about a topic that is very difficult to write on, yet, wrote it as if it's a very easy to write about. This is the skill that this book is trying to teach you.Love this book!"},{"Title":"The Lively Art of Writing","review":"I continue to order copies of this book (and give the copies away) because it contains information that most textbooks omit and many English teacher never read or forget about."},{"Title":"The Lively Art of Writing","review":"I have read many books on the mechanics of writing; Payne's is the best.

It's not the best. It does tell the student a lot of the typical mistakes. The book tells you what NOT to do but not what to do. This book is very very dated.

I use strictly as a reminder of all the bad habits I should stay away from"},{"Title":"The Lively Art of Writing","review":"I am a Junior high school student in the International Baccalaureate Program and i must say, i have been praised by many teachers for my writing abilities. Yet, this book, assigned in our Rhetoric class, is a juvenile attempt to teach the art of writing. The LAW merely teaches subjects that are, to many, common sense, such as the avoidance of passive voice, but any valid points made by the book are nearly invisible in the horrible examples, such as drag racing or teen-agers. (yes that's how old the book is. It was written when \\"teenager\\" was not its own word.) Ultimately, the book teaches a style of writing that does not nurture the natural abilities of a writer, but dumbs them down. If i were to write a paper based on Mrs. Paine's guidelines in a college course, my professor would certainly look at me, as if i were a child, and ask if i wanted a lollipop, for it would definitely match the maturity of Mrs. Paine's writing rubric."},{"Title":"The Lively Art of Writing","review":"I am a senior at Champaign Central High School.

I took a big step into going to a University right out of highschool - Writing being a weak point of mine, this book put me up to speed in 2 weeks. If you apply what you learn and write alot while reading this, you will see your self impove!! Best book to buy for someone in highschool, or first year in college. Or maybe if you going back to college. It's my bible, I look to it everytime I wright!"},{"Title":"The Lively Art of Writing","review":"As a college English teacher, I find Payne's method of teaching essay writing invaluable. While I find the sample essays a bit simplistic, the method itself is wonderful and can be adapted to all kinds of writing situations. Even students who are gifted writers often have difficulty with organization. With Payne's system, they can write fluent essays that stay on point, and the sophistication and depth will come from their finely written sentences and insight into the subject at hand."},{"Title":"The Lively Art of Writing","review":"Having tried to teach style to students who have no clear concept of what an essay actually is, or how it's supposed to be organized, I've found this book to be a godsend.

I found this gem among the countless books written on the subject, and, I kid you not, I wasn't able to put it down! I know that sounds strange. That's the kind of thing you expect to hear about a great novel but certainly not about a how-to book on writing. But it's true! I have to admit, however, it is a bit outdated, but that's of little concern to those of us who are more interested in writing than complaining.

If guidebook authors are going to say or imply that they have actually TALKED to students or visited campuses, then the authors should actually SPEAK to current students not just regurgitate previously published quotes. This is especially true when those same quotes are available FOR FREE on college review sites.Not all of the quotes in the book are taken from web sites like these, but enough are to make me feel that the authors aren't the &quot;insiders&quot; they claim to be.

However, I wasn't very far along into it when I began finding factual errors -- errors in major categories that easily could have been corrected had the author or editor bothered to check. In Chapter One, for instance, the author claims that Hugh Griffith won the Best Supporting Actor Oscar in 1963 for &quot;Tom Jones&quot;; in reality, Melvin Douglas won for &quot;Hud.&quot; (Griffith won in 1959, for &quot;Ben-Hur.&quot;) Later, in a question regarding consecutive wins, the book omits Tom Hanks for his performances in &quot;Philadelphia&quot; (1993) and &quot;Forrest Gump&quot; (1994), although the book was published in 1999.

One of the best parts of the book is that the Oscars are shown to be just as falliable and prone to politicking as anything else in life, but that doesn't make Jones cynical - if anything, he seems to relish the endless opportunities for guessing and second-guessing what the Academy is going to do in any given year.

It may be of interest to different readers for different reasons:(1) It's a study of a particular period in JAPANESE HISTORY, highlighting &quot;the dominant ideological concerns of the period and the consequences of those concerns for individual and institutional action.&quot;(2) It's a study of PERSECUTION and responses to it, using as a case study the Meiji Buddhists, who managed to transform themselves from heretics to martyrs.(3) It's a study of JAPANESE BUDDHISM. Meiji Buddhism was &quot;caught in the crossfire between Shintoists, enlightenment thinkers, nationalists, imperialists, economists, Confucians, and the newly emergent scientists and historians . . . as they did battle over the correct interpretation of 'civilization and enlightenment.'&quot; Japanese Buddhism not only survived persecution but, in responding to this persecution and also to critiques from within, managed to reconstitute itself as nonheretical. This was done so effectively that the Meiji persecution of Buddhism &quot;is all but forgotten in chronicles of Japanese history,&quot; and the &quot;modern Buddhism&quot; produced by the Meiji Buddhists came to be central to Japan's self-understanding.Ch. 1 examines the critiques of Buddhism in the Tokugawa era that set the stage for persecution in the Meiji era--historicist, nativist, and economic critiques. Ch. 2 examines the Meiji persecution of Buddhism and some Buddhist responses to it. Ch. 3 examines the creation of a national ideology and the institutions designed to promulgate it, including the Great Teaching Academy, and the Buddhist-led countermovement that closed the academy and transformed Buddhism &quot;from a persecuted other to a paradigmatic martyr of the illustrious heritage of the nation.&quot; Ch. 4 examines the 1893 World's Parliament of Religions in Chicago and its role in Japanese Buddhism's self-(re)definition as modern, cosmopolitan, and universally applicable. And Ch. 5 examines the way in which a unified vision of Meiji Buddhism and a new history were created and how they were used in producing a Buddhist claim to religious universality.I read this book mainly to learn about the Japanese Buddhism that was transmitted to the U.S., and I was interested to learn that it wasn't just Western Buddhists who were responding to accusations that Buddhism is passive or who were touting Buddhism as an eminently rational religion. Japanese Buddhists were already refiguring Buddhism as socially useful and as compatible with an enlightened society and a scientific worldview."},{"Title":"The Letter on the Tree","review":"Provincial Canada. Ten year old Albert Caron is a good student and a hard worker, although he wishes the cows did not need attention every single morning and evening. They have no TV but listen to the radio almost every night. His family is adequately provided for with the basics but there is no money for extras...such as the accordion he wants so badly for Noel (Christmas).This gentle and charming story starts slowly, then builds, as we watch young Albert learn life lessons such as gratitude, values, hard work, perseverance, honor, and resourcefulness. His family's outlook on life ends up influencing a vagrant who has taken up residence in their defunct maple sugaring cabin. Very well-told. The family is Catholic and some of the church traditions are part of the story. Independent read for grades 3-6.

Lady Elizabeth Hartleigh Compton of Manor House tries to set a good example helping when she is needed. The offices of the United States Army Air Force are billeted in her home so they can be near the base, but that doesn?t sit too well with the villagers.Even though the Americans are fighting for their country, the people of Sitting Marsh resent their brashness, their flirting with the local women, and the quality of goods they have on the base while the villagers must make do with rationing. Four red haired men on the base have died after eating at the local pub and the authorities believe they were poisoned. Lady Elizabeth finds this intolerable and decides to do her best to flush out the perpetrator.Kate Kingsbury?s manor house mysteries are charming and whimsical historical tales that give the reader an understanding of the hardships and the sorrows of village life during World War II. The heroine is a strong-minded woman who leads by example with action and kindness especially to those less fortunate than herself. The secondary cast is a delightful bunch of eccentrics, who add humor when the plot turns too maudlin.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Berried Alive: A Manor House Mystery","review":"Which is not necessarily a bad thing.

There are a few suspects from which to choose, making it fun to guess which is the guilty party.More interesting, Elizabeth and Earl come closer to admitting their feelings for one another.

It?s a winning mix for Kingsbury.In _Berried Alive_, Lady Elizabeth Compton wants to see the American Major more. Polly wants to see the Three Musketeers and the Manor House ghosts less. Sadie wants others to see Winnie Churchill, like she did. And Violet wants Martin to ?just see.?Major Earl and Lady Compton eventually do spend more time together, but mostly due to the deaths of four American servicemen. Everyone at Sitting Marsh can feel the animosity building between the Brit and US soldiers. The Americans are based at Sitting Marsh for England?s protection, but some resent their occupation. Tense moments, pranks, and fights are expected, but not four murders in a row. Lady E., feeling responsible for the actions of Sitting Marsh, investigates the deaths and comes up with the possible conclusions.The folks at Sitting Marsh and the Manor are feeling love struck, spooked, some what muddled, and definitely temperamental. Only Lady E., with the comfort and guidance of the Major, can keep them on track. But for how long? Lady E. maybe responsible and generous, but she also has feelings. And right now her emotions are quietly wrapped up in one man, who gives her some startling news once the mystery is solved._Berried Alive_ is mystery number six. Clues are scattered throughout; the twists are as curvy as Sitting Marsh?s dirt roads, and the surprise conclusion is well hidden.

Lady Elizabeth Hartleigh Compton feels it her duty to solve the mystery of the recurrent deaths of American airmen who have been billeted in her manor. Complicating her efforts is village resentment of the Yanks, whose success with local girls is evident, as well as the myriad problems suffered by homefront areas such as Sitting Marsh during the war. Referred to in the story is food rationing, the \\"Housewives League\\" whose purpose was create comfort items for Britain's soldiers abroad, and the mobilization of women who were needed to assume positions in factories, farms, and other employments formally held by the men. Even Elizabeth's unsolicited role as the region's \\"lady\\" is new, a title she recently inherited after the untimely death of her parents in a bombing raid. As lady she must avoid becoming the center of gossip - a difficult task given her growing feelings toward Earl Monroe, a handsome but unfortunately already married American Major.This is Kingsbury's sixth and most recent book in her series.

Things like concentration, cheerfulness, challenge, memory, and other traits are measured at various times using a self-reporting mechanism. The merits and faults of the methods used to study the subjects are also discussed. The book is intense.I'm sorry I can't encapsulate it better than this. The authors (Mihaly and Robert) do an extremely admirable job of presenting the information in a readable and complete format.Again, it should be stressed that this study was empirical. No judgements are made. Content of television was not part of the study, content of the subject's psyches was.A landmark work."},{"Title":"Television and the Quality of Life: How Viewing Shapes Everyday Experience (Routledge Communication Series)","review":"This book is an exploration into the effect television has on the viewer's state of mind. The organization and style of the book read very much like a dissertation that has been reworked slightly for publication. The style of writing is very academic, and is geared to academic rather than general audiences. The first two chapters are pure literature review covering information reception and previous research about television viewing. The next chapter discusses the research methods. The main study involved a group of about 100 adults living near Chicago in the 1970s, who were asked to keep activity and mood diaries over the course of a week. The data from this study were combined with data from a number of other studies that examined television viewing habits of mostly Americans and Canadians. The remaining chapters cover various aspects of the results and discussion, including: how television fits into the scheme of leisure time, how television affects viewer's moods, how television affects family life, why some people view more than others, uses of television, television and marketing, and television and personal growth. As with a dissertation, sources are cited within the text and each chapter has extensive endnotes for further explication and references. The questionnaires used in the study are reproduced in the appendices. A full list of references is included, as well as an author index and a subject index.So what did they find out from their study about viewers in the 1970s? First, participants in the study watched about 1.4 hours of TV each day, which represented 6.6% of the participants' total waking hours. TV viewing was the most time-consuming activity engaged in at home, and TV viewing absorbed 40% of all leisure time, or another way to look at it, 25% of all time spent at home was spent watching TV. Ninety-three percent of TV viewing occurred in one's own home. Most viewing occurred between 7:30 and 10 PM on weekdays. Twenty percent of the time, people watched TV because they had nothing better to do, giving TV the highest nothing-better-to-do ranking of major home activities including reading, eating, cooking, chores, talking, and grooming.People tend to watch more TV when they are in a bad mood or when they just want to relax with something mindless. When compared to work, other leisure activities, or meals, participants reported that TV required the least concentration, challenge, and skill of all, and people were most passive when watching TV than when engaging in any other leisure activity. Watching TV had the lowest mood and activation ranking of fifteen common daily activities that included such items as resting, transit, and chores. When compared to sports and other leisure activities, it was found that TV required much less concentration during the activity, and that participants found it harder to concentrate after watching TV than before they began. TV viewing is quite relaxing while participants engage in it, but once they turn the set off, they tend to feel less relaxed than when they began, which is the opposite of what happens with sports and other activities. Marketers are well aware of the fact that people watch TV for relaxation and try to keep people in front of the set by offering soothing or entertaining programs rather than material that will require concentration or upset viewers. The difficulty that people have eliminating TV viewing altogether from their lives suggests that some aspects of TV viewing may be addictive.For the most part, I found the results of the study to be quite predictable- -we all hear from many sides that TV viewing is not good for our mental health. There were a few interesting points that Kubey and Csikszentmilhalyi uncovered that weren't fully explored, however. They note that families that watch more TV tend to get along better, and posit that one possible reason for this could be that TV watching helps to diffuse tensions, as well as provide an activity whose skill level is so low that children and adults can participate in it together. The authors note that surprisingly, the most well-adjusted teenagers have the highest levels of viewing, but they point out that teenagers with problems don't tend to spend a lot of time at home, and since most TV viewing is done in the home, there is probably no cause-and-effect link between level of adjustment and TV viewing. They note that heaviest viewers tend to be women living alone and married men living with families (married women with families give up some of their potential TV viewing time to do housework). Elsewhere in the book, they note that Blacks seem to watch more than Whites, and that viewing time increases with education. I have a hunch, however, that the most educated people in their study may have been precisely those married men whose wives were doing the housework, and that their level of education was predicted by their gender, and that their gender and family status determined how much TV they watched, not their level of education. It would have been worth it to pair up people of different family status and similar educational backgrounds to see if the observation that educated people tend to watch more TV really holds water.By now, the data from the study are quite dated, with our cable TV possibilities far out-numbering the 3 major networks of the 1970s, as well as the advent of the Internet and development of the computer game industry to compete for leisure time with TV watching. It would be quite interesting to re-do the study in light of these developments, to see how TV relates to our leisure time and mental state today."},{"Title":"Television and the Quality of Life: How Viewing Shapes Everyday Experience (Routledge Communication Series)","review":"Take steps towards enhancing the quality of your life - explore FlowNet and exchange ideas and experiences associated with Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi's Flow theory @ http://www.flownetwork.com"},{"Title":"Television and the Quality of Life: How Viewing Shapes Everyday Experience (Routledge Communication Series)","review":"Take steps towards enhancing the quality of your life - explore FlowNet and exchange ideas and experiences associated with Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi's Flow theory @ http://www.flownetwork.com"},{"Title":"Chasing Darkness","review":"I found it quite unexciting and more like a romance of Mills & Boon rather than a suspense thriller.

It is always with anticipation that one reads an author for the first time because you do not know what to expect.When I finished this book I wrote \\"Excellent\\" on the cover, which is where I make comments on most of the books I read to keep them distinguished from the books I have not read.This is a typical mystery, thriller in which the main character gets into a lot of trouble that they do not see coming and then have to work their way out of the trouble - sometimes alone and sometimes with another person. In this case there is another person, Nick Thomas.Would happily read other books by this author.J.

It had good plots and was well written and well formatted to the KINDLE. I suggest this as an INTERESTING read sometime"},{"Title":"Chasing Darkness","review":"I don't know whether the subtitle (A Taut Psychological Thriller) refers to a 'Taut' series or is meant to describe the book, but 'taut' is what the book is missing. There are too many loose ends and unanswered questions. Motive, Detective - what was the killer's motive?I did like the multiple points of view, and most of the characters are complex and genuine. However, there is a gaping hole in the plot (explained further in the spoiler section below). The motive for murder is clear, but the other things the murderer does don't make sense and are never quite explained.There is also a problem with time jumps that are difficult to recognize and place properly in the story's timeline. One chapter will finish in the present and the next will take place one week ago, and there is no way to tell that you've jumped back by a week. In terms of pacing and suspense, this must have seemed necessary, but more skillful storytellers manage to keep everything in order.Spoilers here:********- Gerry is especially well-drawn, but his exit feels too easy - once you figure out what he's not doing, it's not clear what he has been doing or planning to do.- Why frame Sam? It's a bit much to believe that the killer would deliberately implicate Sam. Some of the evidence is planted by someone else, but some of it is defintely left by the killer with the cold-blooded calculation that it will lead the police to Sam. In fact, I find it difficult to believe he has the presence of mind to cover his tracks as well as he does. It also doesn't make sense that he would frame his brother, but he's obviously using their resemblance to his advantage. Moreover, he has to have been planning to do it for some time, given that he must have been covering up his improvement in physical therapy for at least a year - or more. At the time of the killings, he doesn't know that Rob caused the accident, so that's not the motive. I found him rather unbelievable as the killer. Of all the characters, the boys are the least genuine. We don't really get a good feel for the mess in their heads."},{"Title":"Chasing Darkness","review":"I pushed myself through this book because I absolutely hate starting something and not finishing it.I hate to criticize peoples work, because it takes a lot to write a book and I appreciate that.... but I am going to give my honest review.This book was all over the place. I downloaded it thinking it would be a story about a serial killer and it turned out to be a cat and mouse love story, baggage from the past been done too many times story with a \\"serial killer\\" thrown in the background.Some of the characters were completely unnecessary and that little girl Whitney with all her stupid rambling was a waste of time. I really didn't care about any character in the book enough to get attached or concerned with the outcome.If we had more history on why she was possibly being framed that may have been more believable also. The person who turned out to be the killer and the explanation behind it was so totally farfetched it was sad.I will be deleting this from my Kindle to make space for a better book.p.s. Where all those 5 star ratings came from??????????Don't believe it."},{"Title":"Chasing Darkness","review":"I found this author while looking for something different to read and was so happy with this book. The characters are believable and the suspense it great."},{"Title":"Chasing Darkness","review":"This suspenseful thriller will have you at the edge of your seat as you find yourself getting entwined in the main character's drama as it unfolds. The ending is shocking and totally unexpected. You will not be able to put this book down."},{"Title":"Chasing Darkness","review":"The author provides interesting details in the leading to the resolution of the mystery involved. It did provide a few tense moments; however, I did not find the details to answer the &#34;why&#34; to any degree of satisfaction.

At the same time she transferred jobs Sam Chase unexpectedly gained guardianship of her twin eight-year-old nephews. Their parents died in a car crash and their deceased mother (Sam's late sister) did not want her family in Mississippi even getting near them.Eight years later Sam and her two nephews Derek and Rob are a family. Sam is a success at work and envied by her peers when one of her old cases comes back to haunt her. The mother of a child abuse victim is found murdered and Sam is forced to work with Derek Thomas of the Sheriff's department since the victim looks like she was murdered by a serial killer that Sam once caught. Since the killer is dead, the police are working on the assumption that it's a copycat killer until another homicide is committed and Sam is linked to both deaths.Danielle Girard is a name to watch because she's rapidly reading the level of a Nancy Taylor Rosenberg or a Sandra Brown. CHASING DARKNESS is a tightly woven thriller that shines a dark light on the evil things done to children and shows how it affects them long after the abuse stops. The strange and off beat romance that develops between Sam and Derek is a realistic necessary subplot to reduce the tension, which becomes unbelievably high voltage at times. This one sitting read entertains as well as educates.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Chasing Darkness","review":"If you've read Danielle Girard before, then chances are you're among her growing legion of fans. As with her previous thrillers, in CHASING DARKNESS she once again layers a frightening plot with finely crafted psychological backstory that invests the reader in the characters. Because she takes the time to craft these characters so deeply, these people come alive on the pages, and when the twists and turns arrive you find yourself dizzy along with them. In a publishing world in which the so-called &quot;big&quot; books are too often nothing more than annointed marketing strategies penned by average writers, Danielle Girard is the real deal, a writer of great craftsmanship and skill who is unafraid to open dark doors and shove you down into the cellar of her vision, leaving you breathless when you emerge, touched and entertained and hungry for her next novel. Get on board now, because her career is headed to the moon. Buy this book, because this is what you're looking for in a great mystery/thriller read."},{"Title":"Chasing Darkness","review":"This is the first book that I have read by Danielle Girard. I only hope her others are as good because I will be reading them all. \\"Chasing Darkness\\" is a great thriller. It contains enough suspense to keep me reading long into the night. However, it is the disturbing yet artfully revealed details about the child abuse and family relationships that made me want to keep reading when the story had ended."},{"Title":"Chasing Darkness","review":"I've been a fan of danielle girard's excellent suspense thrillers from her very first amazing debut, SAVAGE ART,which was so well written that i honestly thought she was an established nytimes bestselling author writing under another name. Her second, RUTHLESS GAME, was equally awesome and exceedingly suspenseful. CHASING DARKNESS is her third brilliant suspense thriller and competely grabs you with the very first page. Her characters are so throroughly fleshed out that you just KNOW these people. Page turning suspense with a truly surprise ending! So does she qualify to be at the top of the ranks? you betcha!!! looking forward to more and more from this phenomenal writer! I just wish that her publisher would afford her the respect that she deserves and provide her with better marketing for this terrrrrific book!!!"},{"Title":"Chasing Darkness","review":"The story kept my interest from beginning to end.

Are some of the adjectives I'll use to describe this incredible psychological thriller by Danielle Girard. The story of abuse, how it is interwoven in the lives of the abusers and victims; along with differing family dynamics and relationships form the backdrop of a story which Danielle weaves with such intricacy, dexterity and ease. The story is complex, the characters richly varied, realistic with a great degree of truth to them. It's an incredible book with an unpredictable ending that simply left me amazed....shocked and sad. I'm definitely looking forward to reading more from this author."},{"Title":"Chasing Darkness","review":"'A Taut Psyhological Thriller' ? ABSOLUTELY! Chasing Darkness is frightening, dark and absorbing. It takes you into a chilling world where children have no protector, a place where the 'boogeyman' is the very person who should be tenderly, lovingly caring for them.Sam Chase is part of a special victims unit and the murder of a child abusing parent she unsuccessfully took through the courts brings her together with Detective Nick Thomas. The two try to track down the killer, while another of Sam's cases turns up dead.This is a compelling read, very well orchestrated with shocking twists and turns. I highly recommend this book if you like Psychological Thrillers."},{"Title":"Evaluation Thesaurus","review":"Actually the same could be said of the man himself. The evaluation thesaurus is difficult to define and place. It is not so much a thesaurus or dictionary as a series of mini (and not so mini) essays from one of evaluation's leading philosophers.Michael Scriven has strong views about the place, role and requirements of evaluation, and he uses this book, amongst other things, to lecture on these subjects. The book starts with an extended introduction to (Scriven's view of) the place of evaluation within the academic world, much of which is focused on an over-extended geographical metaphor of academic disciplines. The point of this is an attempt to stake elevaluation's claim to independence as a &quot;trans-discipline&quot; servicing other disciplines in a similar fashion to statistics. (Despite this declaration of independence, Scriven himself is employed within a School of Education)More useful are the entries themselves, which alert readers to issues such as the &quot;Harvard fallacy&quot; (the assumption that a programme must be good because of its outcomes, without considering any advantages that it might derive, for example from having exceptional student intakes) and the fact that evaluators cannot avoid making value judgements.You do not have to agree with Scriven, but you need to address the issues he raises if you are serious about evaluation."},{"Title":"Evaluation Thesaurus","review":"Scriven is one of the &#34;grandfathers&#34; of evaluation and it does provide background that quite a number of writers refer to. One of the three copies I ordered had a price tag stuck to the cover that was difficult to remove; one price label was impossible to remove; one cover was in pristine condition.Don"},{"Title":"Evaluation Thesaurus","review":"This may be a 1991 publication but it's still a crucially important addition to any serious evaluator's bookshelf.An added bonus is that fantastic Scrivenesque humor that will give you a chuckle when you stumble across some of the all-time classic entries. One of my favorites:TERROR An effect frequently induced by goal-free evaluation (sometimes by the *thought* of it) in most of the cast of evaluation actors -- evaluators, program managers, evaluees. The \\"terror test\\" is the use of this awful threat to weed out the incompetent. Since everyone uses goal-free evaluation whenever they buy anything for themselves, it is not a good sign of their concern for consumers that they think it inappropriate for program evaluation.Got to love it! Get this book!!![Those wanting user-friendly \\"subtitles\\" on some of the more difficult concepts may, like Michael Scriven's graduate students, find this book useful:Evaluation Methodology Basics: The Nuts and Bolts of Sound Evaluation:) ]"},{"Title":"Evaluation Thesaurus","review":"We used this book in one of my education classes. This book is a good tool for aspiring school administrators. It focuses on different aspects of education and how to handle school issues and situations. Thanks!!!"},{"Title":"Evaluation Thesaurus","review":"Addresses the question of subjectivity in evaluation, and recommends new approaches to overcome subjectivity."},{"Title":"Valuation of Interest Rate Swaps and Swaptions","review":"Like all other Fabozzi books this one also just scratches the surface of the topic (swap and swaptions) with text book style examples which are not seen in real world. He starts with an example where both the fixed and floating leg of a swap is semiannual and actual/360 which is not the case of US Swaps and nowhere through out the book he discusses how to deal with different day counts (30/360 &amp; actual/360) in the fixed and floating legs as well as different payment styles (semianually for fixed and quarterly for floating). Anyone who is trying to build a swap valuation tool will realize the importance of the above meniotned topics which is not covered in this book. Even a slight change in numbers can change the P&amp;L by several hundred thousand dollars as the notional are generally upwards of 100 million. This book may be good for an undergrad student who is taking the first course in finance and trying to understand what a swap is. But even then it will facilitate only an abstract theoretical knowledge which he/she will never be able to relate to in real world swaps. Avoid this book, it's a waste of your hard earned money."},{"Title":"Valuation of Interest Rate Swaps and Swaptions","review":"I dont work for a trading desk, but work for IT that supports the trading desk and needed to understand the workings of swap pricing etc. This book gives a very clear explanation of how to price a swap at inception and through the life of the swap agreement. It ties all together volatility, swap curve/term structure of interest rates etc. If you were looking for a more detailed explanation and are actually going to be trading swaps then this is probably not the book."},{"Title":"Valuation of Interest Rate Swaps and Swaptions","review":"I trade derivatives, and this book was amazing to get me started in the valuation of IRS and swaptions. It provides very clear steps used to value an IRS from a sting of libor futures. It describes the swaption valuation with an introduction to binomial trees in a very simmple manner. Everything is explained very clearly and takes you through the math step by step. I own more than 10 books that describe the valuation of an IRS and by far this is the best."},{"Title":"Valuation of Interest Rate Swaps and Swaptions","review":"Relying solely on literature and books , with input by experienced traders to implement derivative pricing models.My part of the world, quants that are involved in the development of pricing libraries from the ground up are very,very rare or non-existent. Usually the banks will just purchase black boxes and do a high level validation on it.If the reader is interested in the latest techniques, then this book is not for you.If it is to get simple, explicit examples on how trees are used to price Interest Rate Derivatives ie swaptions/variations on IRS, then it is extremely suitable. It serves as a base template and the knowledge base gained can easily be build upon to move forward towards callable range accruals/effect of skew etc..For those that do not have the benefit of past legacies, this is a great starter for tree pricing methods.For example use this book after the tree is constructed as per Hull-White's \\"Super Calibration\\" paper.Do note that tree pricing methods are quite limited in scope, there are other methods ie PDE, LMM etc."},{"Title":"Valuation of Interest Rate Swaps and Swaptions","review":"Differences between the mathematical examples shown and what's written in the accompanying text seem to be a trademark of Fabozzi books. This book is no exception. There were mistakes from the very beginning and, though I am currently only halfway through the book, I have not stopped encountering more of them. The text is reasonably explanatory albeit somewhat elementary but the amount of mathematical errors is astonishing. Difficult to recommend this book unless you enjoy solving puzzles (ie trying to figure out what the correct numbers are, based on the text)."},{"Title":"Valuation of Interest Rate Swaps and Swaptions","review":"The book is terrific for a classroom setting. It is far easier to understand the interactions between valuation inputs (term structure, volatility, level of rates, etc) than any other book in the market. The use of the lattice approach is great - and very original. Most students find the lattice approach more easy to understand and therefore more able to better understand these instruments. The book is not designed for a swap dealer by any stretch of the imagination. I have used it in a training program several times with great effect."},{"Title":"Valuation of Interest Rate Swaps and Swaptions","review":"A book written on \\"valuation of swaps and swaptions\\" is obviously not for the lay man. I was extremely disappointed to go through this book, which seems to be fit for 5th graders. It's a shame that a supposed leading thinker like Fabozzi can write such a shallow, meaningless book. Mr. Fabozzi, please name one practitioner who cares to use this good-for-nothing book of yours. Perhaps a better title for the book would have been, \\"Swaps and swaptions for dummies\\"."},{"Title":"Alien in a Bottle","review":"Middle-school student Sean dreams of becoming a glass artist so he is always picking up odd looking glass. He finds a bottle that turns out to be the damaged spacecraft of interstellar junk yard dealer and con artist Tagg Orion.

However, Sean's stellar find turns nasty as Dinn Tauro comes after Tagg for selling him a non-detachable Dream Ring that animates cretins previously residing in nightmares. Now Sean and Olivia are caught in the middle between an irate customer and a con artist junk dealer.Aimed for an upper elementary school audience, ALIEN IN THE BOTTLE is a fabulous fantasy tale that adults will enjoy too especially those who remember Krypton's Kander.

We look forward to any more of Mr. Sobczak's books."},{"Title":"Six Mornings on Sanibel","review":"Though this is his first novel, Charles Sobczak writes like a seasoned pro. The characters are tough and smart, the dialogue is fast and savvy and the plot is absolutely engrossing and fresh....from the first sentence to the last I, like the big ol' snook, was hooked. Great job, and lots of fond memories."},{"Title":"Six Mornings on Sanibel","review":"While on a recent vacation to Captiva, Florida, I picked up Six Mornings on Sanibel at the Library and found it great reading. Great book for anyone who can appreciate the pressures of work verses the beauty of Sanibel. I hope I will have the pleasure of reading more books by the author soon."},{"Title":"Six Mornings on Sanibel","review":"It was a wonderful story. I had brought the book for my husband as a gift but I read it before I gave it to him. We spend time on Sanibel, so perhaps that is why it meant so much. Or perhaps, because we are both seniors, it gave us much to ponder. Or perhaps, it was the simplicity and honesty between two men of different backgrounds that gave the book that specialness. Very much like &quot;Tuesdays With Morrie&quot;, this book provided thought and a good read."},{"Title":"Six Mornings on Sanibel","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed Mr. Sobczak's book, and would recommend it to anyone looking for an easy read meant to send their mind on vacation.

Florida. As a child, I spent every Saturday at the Sanibel pier fishing with my friends. Now as a busy attorney I enjoy the pier whenever I can sneak a weekend at Sanibel. I have always met different characters at the pier and have always been entertained by their stories. In the book an unusual friendship between a retired charter boat captain and an overworked, streesed out divorce attorney produce unsettling views into their lives. These views are sometimes brutally honest and eye-opening. While this dialogue is taking place, the author accurately discribes the natural beauty of Sanibel. You can almost smell the salt water and hear the waves as the story progresses. The story of these two friends produces a roller-coaster ride through the different emotions that culminates in an unexpected, controversial ending. It leaves you asking yourself &quot;What would I have done?&quot; I look forward to his next book."},{"Title":"Six Mornings on Sanibel","review":"If you haven't visited Sanibel Island, you'll probably have limited interest in this story. The other reviews are correct - it's easy reading - but that doesn't make this a 5-star book. The story is about the relationship that develops between two strangers over the course of 6 mornings spent fishing from a pier. Unfortunately, one of characters is not developed nearly enough to make the relationship credible. Overall, the book is a pleasant read if you have been to the island and are familiar with the landmarks that play a critical role in the story. But much better character development would be necessary to make it a really good book."},{"Title":"Six Mornings on Sanibel","review":"This book is beautifully written and takes me back to Sanibel. More importantly, I now understand why my father loved fishing so much. I never knew what actually took place on fishing piers or charter boats. I now know why he had to measure and weigh all of his catch, and where the root of his crazy stories came from. The characters are written in such a way that you feel you know them personally. I was saddend when the book ended. I wanted it to continue. I am looking forward to his next novel. What an incredible writer!"},{"Title":"Six Mornings on Sanibel","review":"Having spent time on Sanibel Island and feeling like it is the one place on earth that I can find the real inner strength I need to survive until I revisit the Island, I enjoyed the book immensely.

It is an easy read, and while somewhat predictable, it is still very enjoyable."},{"Title":"Free Fall","review":"This is one of the most beautifully-written books I've read. There are only maybe two or three moments where every word is not perfect. It's like reading poetry, only it lasts for the entire length of a novel. Furthermore, everything that Mountjoy describes, tangents though they may seem, fits perfectly into our understanding of his character. And, to top it all off, the last sentence is one of the least predictable I've ever seen."},{"Title":"Free Fall","review":"Here is a mind-boggler of literary art. Golding takes you in--in through the portals of the main character's mind. And then the true adventure begins. This is an exploration on the theme of freedom lost, which goes into an existential search, taking you through a labyrinth of broodings and memories deep, deep within the psyche, and in the end you (together with the protagonist) will experience something stirring and substantial. It is the turning of freedom outside-in, and in and in and in, and then out again. Just read one chapter. That's all it will take to enter uncharted territory."},{"Title":"Free Fall","review":"Samuel Mountjoy is an artist. Does it matter if he is a Christian, a Marxist, a rationalist? He is the narrator. Samuel doesn't know his father. His mother bets on horses and drinks. She is enormous. He doesn't dislike dirt, begins school barefoot, and his house is in the vicinity of the area called Rotten Row. It is a slum.Sam's escort to the infant school, Evie, is more interesting than the school. (Later things change. There are housing estates and tellies.) Sammy and Johnny Spragg play at the airfield. The kids are caught and police action is threatened. They are chased from a hill where there is a general's house. The narrator carries around with him a load of memories. It seems that Johnny and Sam are bullies, but the third pal, Philip,is not necessarily a victim. He can run fast, for one thing.When Sam is hospitalized for a mastoid operation, his mother dies. This is a case of happenstance. Next Sam, now in foster care, is nineteen years old, attending art school, and in love with Beatrice Ifor, a model. Sam and Philip draw Beatrice. They are Communists. In the party there is generosity, martyrdom, and a sense of purpose.Beings of awful power determine the fate of some of the characters in this interesting, Dickens-like book."},{"Title":"Free Fall","review":"The aesthetic of Free Fall is akin to painting and that is a stroke of brilliance. The lack of judgment is what prevents the madness and uncleanliness of the book from being ugly. The imperfections are treated with such care and self-love that they become beautiful. I believe that Golding was extremely good at accessing his past as a vital source of inspiration, and he here re-enters various cognitive states. As with any human, the illusion wears and a weightier sensibility takes over. Yet it is obvious that this character, like Golding, has what would now be termed a mental illness. The seriousness of such conditions shouldn't be taken lightly, and even Golding's shouldn't be seen in a glamorous light, by which I mean paying mind only to this novel as, e.g., his, most autobiographical. Darkness Visible reveals the very depths of horror, and yes Golding new such delusions and madness. He was very brave to deal with those experiences in writing. A demon is not scary for what it will do to you, but for what it means about you; thus the horror. It's implicit in Golding's writing as it is in Dostoyevsy's. However, I believe this book is extraordinary in its redemptive power. Here Golding shows something that I know very well. Suffering and madness are not a source of creativity (As the wives' tale goes), yet, when spiritual, they are often caused by true visionary experience. It is also true that some people seek the visionary and get it-get it and a heavy dose. Let's just say if it gets too intense, you can't handle or interpret it--not until the dust settles anyhow. You might get 'blinded' in the middle. Yet, on the other side, when the suffering, confusion and the overwhelming pain of light passes, the reward is the knowledge of the initiate, esoterica, and finally, the song of the muses. If the visionary experience were to die, the pain would with it, but then, the doorway to the invisible would close, too."},{"Title":"Free Fall","review":"I am still under the spell of enchantment of this book. I picked it up by chance at a used-book store going out of business just because I had so enjoyed Lord of the Flies in high school. I don't think I have ever read anything that impacted me so much as the simplicity and painful beauty in Golding's use of the language. This is a book to read again and savour. I'm surprised there is not more literary criticism of it to be found on the web. I agree with the reviewer who states that the last line is the book is totally surprising. I'm not sure yet that I understand it."},{"Title":"Free Fall","review":"This book doesn't need to be introduced, as well as its writer, Nobel Prize for Literature laureate, Booker Prize literature winner, one of my favorite writters. I bought this book for my son along with \\"Inheritors\\" and hope he will love them as much as I do."},{"Title":"Life Form","review":"This is another great novel from the Dean. Though there were at least five sentences that had misplaced and wrong words in them, the novel was fast paced enough to interest the most jaded SF reader. The idea is quite good and original for a modern SF adventure story. I would have given it 5 stars, but for the sloppy grammatical boo-boos in the actual text."},{"Title":"Life Form","review":"The book begins like a movie, you know, panning over the scene and meeting all the characters one by one in excrutiating detail. You could tell by how charismatic they were which ones were going to die first. And then they landed on the planet and a few characters slowly develop a &quot;misgiving&quot; to foreshadow the later action. They meet cute child-like aliens, and Foster can't help but introduce human-and-alien sex at this point, of course. (He's like that. I guess it sells.) So we have a few people die under mysterious circumstances, and people falling in love and having sex with the cute aliens, and a mysterious human already on the planet who adds to the body count -- and everyone is mystified, horrified, and made nearly insane by the final discovery of mystery of the planet and its inhabitants. And I'm waiting to feel the same sense of &quot;OH MY GOD&quot; as I turn the pages. I'm waiting to be wrapped up in the fitful panic of the characters I just spent the first half of the book being introduced to. But, I tell you, it never happens. The characters seem to feel all sorts of emotions, but the writing never invoked it in me. I mean, hearing the narrator tell me how frightened and freaked out the characters were is NOT the same thing as the narrator spending time to describe something to me that might freak ME out. I was an outsider. It seemed like the characters were poorly motivated to feel what they felt, since the author never seemed to stop long enough to try to make *me* feel anything. I think this book ends up being nothing more than a shallow, superficial action-adventure story gilded with just the faintest glint of science fiction and psychological drama. If that sort of thing appeals to you, then &quot;Life Form&quot; will too."},{"Title":"Life Form","review":"I personally loved this book and read it straight through but a word of warning to all alan dean foster fans like all of alan dean fosters books this book is very good but alan dean foster has I guess two ways of writing because like all the reviews on amazon.com either his books are 5star or 1star it is your choice to decide but in the end but I loved this book and I definitely want a sequal"},{"Title":"Life Form","review":"Lifeform was an enjoyable book about planetary exploration. I captures a great deal of the unbridled spirit of discovery of the unknown that lies deep in the heart of all adventurers. My only disappointment with this novel was that it seemed at many times to take the reader almost 80% there in the excitement, but would fail to cross that line that would make it a gripping page turner. I loved the entire concept of the world, and any science fiction fan will enjoy the creativity in this area. This book could have been an explosive breakthrough in the SF, but was a little short on the plot. It seemed that Foster had this great idea for this world, but when he got all the characters there and the world evolved, he ran out of ideas of what was going to happen to really make this an epic. I did enjoy this book tremendously, however, as it does give you a journey to a far away place."},{"Title":"Life Form","review":"I have read a large number of Foster's works. I just reread this after many years away from it. I came away with mixed responses.Foster does an excellent job of finding new ways to look at things and in this book the basis for life forms is fairly original and captivating. More fantasy than true scifi the premise requires only a small suspension of disbelief. A good basis for a good yarn.I was disappointed in the story, however. As others have pointed out none of the characters were well developed. We have a beautiful lady biologist who is on the trip to avoid something and we are never told what it is/was. Suddenly she is the teams' health care provider and we never know why she is the person in that role. Biologist does not equal doctor or nurse. It is this way with all of the characters. Questions are raised but Foster breaks the implied contract with the reader by never providing the answer. I found at least half of the characters irritating. There was also an annoying propensity to perseverate on a theme.The plot moves along like an automobile running out of gas. It spurts ahead and is then stuck for 40 pages or more on why two groups fight and are then friends. Then a fume accelerates the pace and the unlikeable leader decides to move the whole project somewhere else. Another cough and the story is over.I really had the feeling that this one was sent to the publisher before it was finished and then sent on to us with about the same amount of care.Like many other reviewers have said, I was very disappointed in the ending. Almost the literary equivalent of \\"And then I woke up.\\" I had hopes that a sequel might finish the tale the right way and then I could have forgiven the weaknesses in this volume. But after 17 years I guess we are not going to get it.But don't let this stop you from reading other fine works by Foster, when he is on he is terrific."},{"Title":"Life Form","review":"I'm not a big SF reader, but I liked the book a lot. I enjoyed the early character development and the scene setting of the planet Xica. I agree with a reviewer about the appearance of Conc. He could have been less mysterious acting and more human. The end was not appealing. I'd never read anything by Foster before but I probably will check out some of his other books. I too would like a sequel."},{"Title":"Life Form","review":"ADF's great talent lies in creating strange new worlds populated by bizarre creatures. In this regard, Life Form doesn't disappoint. It sometimes reminded me a little too much of Midworld, but it kept me interested enough to finish the book. However, relationships are not the author's forte, and it shows particularly painfully in this story. Overall, the book suffers from a wobbly narrative that is either some sort of third-person limited (which hops from one narrator to another, sometimes within the same paragraph), or a poorly executed third-person omniscient. Too much \\"tell\\" and too little \\"show\\" is the result, which leaves the reader unengaged."},{"Title":"Life Form","review":"I found this book to be rather boring at the start. But this all changed as the characters discovered more about their surroundings and their host. Rather exciting from a space exploratory view but the real twist comes when the explorers see the local host for who they really are!A tremendously compelling book!"},{"Title":"Life Form","review":"Every so often Allan Foster turns an idea into a book that doesn't quite make it, It's a well crafted book and readable, but the plot isn't one of his best.A nice read but not up to Fosters usual high standard."},{"Title":"Life Form","review":"Nothing interesting happens throughout the book. There's almost no action going on except for some childish discussions between a bunch of scientists who stumble around on a foreign planet. And these &quot;scientists&quot; are really a poor example of human explorers of the unknown. They have as much imagination as the dirt under my shoes. Totally blind for the obvious. In other words, you would never want to meet any of the protagonsits of this story. This is what makes the story extremely improbable and even boring. You wouldn't want to read that book. Spare yourself the 311 pages and read something else instead."},{"Title":"Life Form","review":"This book was my first exposure to Alan Dean Foster. I though the beginning was somewhat slow, but it was character development. I really loved the pendju, but I was upset when I conc was introduced.

I have played and ST'ed all but Wraith and this BUT! it would definately be my next choice.I think the KotE are some of the most defined characters a player can make. That said, the KotE are also some of the more complicated to play because the book KotE is not a stand alone game. It was produced to add more flair and versatility to VtM.There were only a few questions I had. Agravated damage was never covered.. or not that I saw. I read about them being able to do it with several of their powers but I could only find 2 ways that they could soak it. the lvl 2 or 3 bone shentai and the demon shentai with the armor. ohh well something else to e-mail WW about.Definatly a game for intermediant to advanced players. I'm not sure if I would suggest it as a starter though."},{"Title":"Kindred of the East (For Vampire, the Masquerade)","review":"One of the best white wolf sourcebooks I have read. The vampires of Asia are completely different and more deadlier than their western counterparts. My only quibble is that some parts of Asia were not detailed such as Malaysia and the Phillipines.

Keep up the good work."},{"Title":"Kindred of the East (For Vampire, the Masquerade)","review":"This book is simply amazing.Even if you don't like vampires or the entire White Wolf line of monster rpg's this is a very interesting book. The subject matter is unique and it isn't just European vampires transplanted to Asia.Before this book came out I was skeptical that W.W. would do Asian &quot;vampires&quot; justice but they exceeded my wildest expectations.It mostly focuses on N-E cultures (China/Japan/Korea) but there is even a bit on Malaysian &quot;vampires&quot;.W.W. has even done an excellent job of putting out supplements for the game."},{"Title":"Kindred of the East (For Vampire, the Masquerade)","review":"The Cathayans are quite unique since they aren't like Cainites. All the secrets that you wish you knew about the Eastern vampires that could quite possibly occupy areas like Chinatown or even back at the mainland of Asia are now yours to share once you have this book.

And then they publish Kindred of the East. It's an anticlimax that should never have happened; someone fell asleep at the switch. Between the over-numerous virtues, restrictive societal protocols, uberdisciplines that let a KoE crush an opponent, and an unbelieveably complex system of rules that makes playing next to impossible, this book is not worth the nearly $30 you have to pay for it.

The art work is amazing, the concept is very intriguing, and the entire idea of a race of vampires in no way relate to the curse of caine is wonderful.

I love the fact that there is more to worry about than blood, health, and willpower; but i can't figure out what the heck you do with the rest of it! P'o? Hun? Yin Chi? Yang Chi?

One of my finest in my collection, and I have a rather large collection at that. This book Rivals none for the entire WoD setting. I give it up completely for the authors of this book. And it is truly hard for me to give a rating of 5. I was at first very skeptical about even making the purchase. But now I dont know what I'ld do without it. Though, I did notice one thing particularly frustrating about it, and that is that I had to read through it twice, and constantly check back over what I had previously read to make sure I was properly understanding the presented material. Some places it was confusing to read. All in all, very, very good book."},{"Title":"Kindred of the East (For Vampire, the Masquerade)","review":"I, myself, am a Taoist, and so was overjoyed to hear that White Wolf had decided to pay attention to the far East in it's new supplament: Kindred of the East. I like this book because the theory upon which the Kuei-jin's powers are based follows Taoism without making it silly. However, the book fails to do what every good book must: be logical. The vampires in China and the surrounding areas sound much more like automatons then humans become monsters. This, in and of itself, is well and good, but when you add this to the MASSIVE and uncalled for abilities avalable to the Demon People - It get's just plain silly. The Kin-Jin, that is, the Kindred, don't have a chance, I fear, nor do the Lupines, thanks to the Demon Arts. Only the Mages have the power to destroy them, thus making the game rather one sided. Again, the powers are POWERFUL beyond belief! The Chi Rift, I think it's called, is more then even a master of Spirit could handle. My suggestion? Buy this book, but don't let your characters play them! Use them as bad guys exclusively, for that's what what they seem to be anyway."},{"Title":"Kindred of the East (For Vampire, the Masquerade)","review":"Nice ideas, well that's what's positive about it. But White Wolf has gone the wrong way with this one: The deadlier, the better is seldom true. The Kindred of the East are by far mightier than Western Vampires, Mages, Werewolves, Faeries and Wraithes. This might be okay if you stay in system, but forget to play them in crossovers. They'll kill everyone - fun first."},{"Title":"Kindred of the East (For Vampire, the Masquerade)","review":"Congratulations to White Wolf on this book. It offers a good view of a new type of supernatural to add to the World of Darkness (but, carefully.) I like the openness of the players moral decisions; they're much closer to Sabbat Paths than Humanity, yet they're not evil- they just have a different world view than the Western Kindred are used to. The book does a good job describing it and setting the feel for it. Contrary to the other reviews, I find the Eastern and Western Kindred to be fairly balanced power-wise. If you're interested in extending your World of Darkness setting into the East, this book is a must."},{"Title":"Kindred of the East (For Vampire, the Masquerade)","review":"I thought that KoE was one of the best books that I have read from White Wolf. It takes and enforces the original intention of Vampire: the Masquerade, the struggle between keeping your Humanity and succumbing to your Beast. It is designed to keep players from becoming ungodly strong power characters really quickly and simply ignoring the enlightenment part. In my opinion that alone makes it a very worthwhile game since it focuses on roleplaying more than how much power you can grab. And yes the Kuei-jin are strong, but they also have disadvantages that equal them out so they have no more of an advantage than any other group does. All in all, an extremely excellent book."},{"Title":"Kindred of the East (For Vampire, the Masquerade)","review":"White Wolf has captured the mysticism and uniqueness of the Orient in KotE, and describe an imaginative race of vampires that in no way are a copy of western vampires. In fact, after reading KotE, I think western vampires are quite boring and without purpose. Together with the rest of WW's Asia-oriented books, like Hengeyokai, KotE is a masterpiece. The only downside is that maybe it's not very easy to play KotE compared to Vampire, and it's definitely harder to find the right Asian atmosphere. But other than that, it's perfect."},{"Title":"Kindred of the East (For Vampire, the Masquerade)","review":"The new Kindred of the East book has proven to be a great use for me and my friends. The all new ways of Dharma and the different kuei jin disciplines prove to be a nice taste of something different than just V:tm. The option of being a kindred of the east or just the flavor it adds to the chronicle is more than enough to make me feel that purchasing this book was well worth the money."},{"Title":"Kindred of the East (For Vampire, the Masquerade)","review":"When I first read this book, I was skepitcal: I had heard that the vamps of the east used chi instead of blood. That sort of turned me of...till I read deeper into the book. In short, the being inside are both uggly and beautiful, malignant and bengin. They have a goal some what like that of the Hengeyokai...that is, when it comes to preserving places of high chi. Their true quest is one of enlightenment and redemtion...unlike their western counterparts, who are often turned into vamps against their will, the Kuei-jin, as they call themsleves, are souls who have fallen out of sinc with the Great Wheel due to bad Karma. This book is a must have for any Vampire player."},{"Title":"Kindred of the East (For Vampire, the Masquerade)","review":"Now here you see some serious ****. When I first met an Asian vampire, I was surprised by her obvious gentleness and passion. And then by her really intimidating beast ! Man, these guys sure ARE serious trouble. Stay out of their way if you can ! You better believe what I tell you, because, although they are powerful and influential (and hard to play), they are also some of the most unnerving and deep reaching characters in the WoD. A doubleedged sword with a sharp handle, so to say. But beware, they won't tolerate you if you are a Cainite, a Kin-jin, since you are a barbarian, and deserve to be destroyed. *OOC: If you want to play one of these guys, prepare for a complete new experience, together with a relatively rebuilt rule system, and a totally new philosophy.*the Marquis, vmapire hunter and leech himself"},{"Title":"Kindred of the East (For Vampire, the Masquerade)","review":"Gorgeous artwork. Fantastic new world. Great reinterpretations of things. Wonderful use of mixing history with the World of Darkness. They promised to deliver a vampire alien to the kindred of Caine, and they succeeded; the setting is exotic, interesting, and definitely recommended. I especially liked their take on lycanthropes. I didn't like the lack of information on India, which would have been a great setting and prime conflict ground with British vampires. The Russia/Mongolia/China boundaries could have been interesting as well. It's impossible to play without the original Vampire book, which irks me; a completely new setting could use a reexplanation, I think. Lastly, the nature/demeanor/dharma split isn't quite clear. It's obvious that some traits are connected to and sympathetic with others, but what this sympathy does in terms of the game is never well-explained."},{"Title":"Kindred of the East (For Vampire, the Masquerade)","review":"Definitely a fascinating entry for the WoD series, and in my mind, a candidate for its own 'line,' rather than just a supplement to V:tM's Western Kindred. Complex, yes -- but reflecting the complex patterns of history and society of the Far East and the philosophies animating these mysterious creatures. If you look at just dots and damage dice, indeed, it is easy to create formidable fighters from these creatures--but there are lots of other opportunities and paths to follow, if you're willing to open your mind to them. It's especially important to remember how crucial &quot;setting&quot; is to these creatures...just as a lone Ventrue stands little chance of surviving in the Middle Kingdoms, in the West, the Kuei-jin are still making inroads. On a sigular basis, the challenges the West presents should keep these powerful Kindred in check."},{"Title":"Kindred of the East (For Vampire, the Masquerade)","review":"Well Well.

Due largely to Ronald Reagan's hawkish presidency, people were much more fearful of this looming prospect -- and, of course, rightly so. Reading this reminds me of 1981, when I was in eighth grade, and tensions over Poland were so severe that I recall becoming a regular fixture at our local library, reading and reading, trying helplessly to understand all the forces which, it seemed, were conspiring to destroy us all.The really touching thing, about the couple portrayed in this book, is that they are normal people. Almost completely uninformed about the world, their mental picture of the world is shaped by a haze of half-remembered patriotic propaganda that is decades out of date, and was heavily distorted to begin with. Their efforts to prepare for a nuclear attack are so pathetic that you would laugh, if you weren't already busy crying.Those weapons are still out there. This book is important. Everyone should read it. If you half-suspect that you yourself might be slightly un-informed about nuclear war issues, I would like to recommend that you seek out \\"The New Nuclear Danger,\\" by Dr. Helen Caldicott. It just came out in 2002, and includes a fantastic bibliography which could help you understand nuclear winter, medical effects of fallout, and current weapon stockpiles. There is also a great collection of relevant websites, which we should all be a lot more familiar with.... if you'd like to communicate you concern to your kids with another illustrated book, aimed at a younger audience, I would like to recommend \\"Hiroshima No Pika,\\" by Toshi Maruki.You may also like to seek out \\"Threads,\\" a tremendous docudrama on nuclear war done in consultation with Carl Sagan, in 1984. \\"Threads\\" is out of print, except in the UK, but you can find it on the largest online auction houses if you put the terms \\"threads\\" and \\"nuclear\\" in the search field.So, if you know anyone who actually went out and bought duct tape in February, 2003, I would like to recommend that you sit down with them, and spend an hour leafing through this horrifying book.

After I read it, I was so struck by the story that I knew I needed to get my own copy but never found it in any bookstore anywhere. For the past 16 years, I've been trying to find this book- that's how strongly 'When the Wind Blows' affected me. I finally found it on Amazon and after reading it again, am still struck by the beauty of the illustrations and the horror of war and how it affects ordinary people. When I turned the last page, I felt the same sadness and emptiness for the couple as I felt the first time I read it. The strength of this book is that it's written in comic strip form- the images will stick in your mind far longer than any words can. Therein lies the beauty of Raymond Briggs' classic- not only does the comic form simplify the telling of the story, it pushes home the point that these are ordinary, simple, village people, but because illustrations are used, it becomes a far more powerful story. I'm keeping this one and NOT letting it out of my sight!

Unlike his other graphic novel, When the Wind Blows is not as uplifting or heartfelt. Instead, Briggs tells the story of a happily married couple and how they are effected by nuclear war. The couple survived the Blitz in London during WWII and therefore have very interesting reactions to the Cold War. While the husband is extremely trusting of the government and creates a plan in case nuclear war occurs, his wife is less trusting and believes that no such atrocity will occur. When a nuclear warhead is dropped on England, the couple must try their best to survive.Being that the graphic novel was written in 1982, it seems a bit dated to the contemporary reader. Still, it is incredibly interesting to read a graphic novel that was written during the Cold War about the Cold War. All of the anxieties and fear feel extremely raw and despite it being almost twenty years later, those feelings still affect the reader. While the subject matter is extremely depressing, Briggs does give his characters a sense of humor that creates a bit of comic relief but the impending doom is still hanging over the tale. As is true with Snowman and Ethel & Ernest, the graphics are gorgeous and look almost like watercolors. Overall, I think that this is an excellent read and in many ways better than Ethel & Ernest."},{"Title":"When the Wind Blows","review":"When one talks about Raymond briggs they think about the snowman or father Christmas.

Another example would be Animal Farm by Orwell. This film did make some strong opinions and i find it diffcult to forget them now. Just one week agao i was watching the news about the devastation in the US and the one thought whcih came into my head was of this film. What if we did have a 3rd world war?? remebering this film made me scared as i have never knwn of a direct war with Britain as i was only a baby in the falklands and this book, whether it was aimed at Children or not, is a very compelling tale.

I'm amazed that this subject has not been the focus of other writers in this format. Whilst some may argue that such topics should be severely censored in storybook form, it must be seen as a necessary evil to relate to contemporary (and future) youth the very real prospect of the inevitable realities of nuclear war, we do them no favours by sheltering them (no pun intended) from that which appears possible in the foreseeable future. Let's hope we see more of this in the future (whatever that may be....)."},{"Title":"When the Wind Blows","review":"Reason for Reading: I was posting a review on another site when this book was recommended for me. I'd never heard of it before but since I love apocalyptic books and Brigg's Snowman is a treasured favourite I knew I had to read it..The only reason this book doesn't get a full five star rating from me is that it does show it's age and is a product of its times. This is a sad, despairing, dark book lightened with black humour. It packs quite the punch and at the time it was written during the Cold War, when the Russian threat of Nuclear War was a real threat the book''s impact would have been even more chilling. One must first note that *this is NOT a book for children*. Briggs takes us from just before the announcement that a nuclear bomb is likely to be aimed at Britain to several days after the impact. At the centre is an innocent rural WWII survivor couple who don't understand all of modern day's technologies and still believe in the government taking care of its citizens. They have pamphlets, issued by the government, on how to cope during a nuclear attack and trust in them as they would the word of God, while in reality it's all rather useless and though they survive the bomb they unknowingly waste away from radiation poisoning. Their innocent banter between each other is compelling and heartrending and yet one must also place oneself in the past to the era the book was written in for it to be believable.The book is still relevant today, however. While Russia is not the big threat anymore, there are any number of smaller countries in today's world that have the ability to \\"push the button\\" and cause the same scenario of dealing with the fall out.

The author was born in India, where she lived most of her life. Her love of that country is evident in her loving, descriptive passages of the land of her birth. Her assessment of Anglo-Indian relations during the time of the British Raj is infused in the characters of her spellbinding novel. With exotic, mid-nineteenth century India as a backdrop for most of this engrossing story, the reader is swept away by its beautifully descriptive narrative. It is in India that the fate of a beautiful, young, Anglo-Spaniard heiress with the improbable name of Winter Ballasteros and that of Captain Alex Randall, a commissioned officer with the East India Company, are irrevocably intertwined.Born in India and orphaned at an early age, Winter is brought up in England but is always longing for the land of her birth. The opportunity to return home to India presents itself when she is betrothed at a tender age to the debauched Conway Barton, the grasping Commissioner of Lunjore, who is many years her senior. Captain Randall, who is sent by the Commissioner to escort his betrothed to India, is loathe to do so, knowing the Commissioner to be no fit husband for a seventeen year old girl, Moreover, Captain Randall is keenly sensitive to the potentially dangerous feelings of unrest that seem to be sweeping India, as its native population begins to chafe under the insensitive rule of its colonial masters.Once in India and against a backdrop of native unrest, Winter and Captain Randall slowly begin to develop a relationship. When the Sepoy Rebellion of 1857 occurs, Winter and Captain Randall are thrown together. They discover that they must struggle to survive the madness and bloodlust that is all around them, as they witness atrocities beyond comprehension. The author gives a vivid re-creation of the Siege of Delhi, as well as a plaintive telling of the massacre of women and children at Cawnpore, a horrific bloodbath from which even the natives themselves shrank. It is against this tumultuous, historical backdrop that the personal drama of Winter and Captain Randall is juxtaposed.With a wonderful cast of Indian and Anglo characters, the author gives the reader a sense of the vastness of India with its many different religions and castes. She successfully depicts the colonialist attitudes that would serve to unite Indians whose paths might not ordinarily cross and galvanize them to take violent action in an attempt to break the oppressive, colonial yoke. The Sepoy Rebellion of 1857 would be a lesson that England would long remember.This is a riveting novel that those who love well-written historical fiction will enjoy, as will those who simply love a well told tale. Bravo!"},{"Title":"Shadow of The Moon (Part 1 of 2)","review":"If you liked M.M. Kaye's &quot;Far Pavilions&quot; of TV miniseries fame, you may find this earlier work by the author even more enjoyable. A romance novel to be sure, but non-fans of the genre (I am usually amongst their number) will find it a very pleasant surprise, especially if you can get a copy of the early editions, which were considerably shorter than those that came out after the success of the &quot;Far Pavilions&quot;. Ms. Kaye's outstanding attention to Indian historical and cultural detail surrounding the Great Sepoy Mutiny supplements the central love story wonderfully. Actually, the reader soon becomes aware that &quot;Shadow of the Moon&quot; is a tale of two love stories - one between Alex and Winter and one between Ms. Kaye and the people, culture and land of India. If you like a good love story, lots of action, many interesting secondary characters, and a generous dose of education about a fascinating and pivotal time in Indian and British history, this book is a must read."},{"Title":"Shadow of The Moon (Part 1 of 2)","review":"M. M. Kaye's extraordinary novel &quot;Shadow of the Moon&quot; combines historical fact with a wonderful love story set against the beauty and complexity of India during the British Raj. One of Ms. Kaye's gifts as a writer is her ability to create three-dimensional characters and plausibly insert them into historic events. Here she intertwines her cast of characters with history and through the microcosm of their lives we view the dramatic events of the past.The action in M. M. Kaye's novel pivots around the Mutiny of 1857,&quot; also called the &quot;Sepoy Rebellion.&quot; Indian soldiers in the Bengal army of the British East India Company rose against their British rulers in May 1857 and the violent uprising quickly spread throughout British ruled India. &quot;Shadow of the Moon&quot; is the love story of an Anglo-Spanish heiress with vast land holdings in India and a political officer of the East India Company. The author intertwines the lives of these two central characters, and a large supporting cast, with historical events to create a wonderful epic novel.Ms. Kaye has written more than a historical novel here, although the book is full of romance, intrigue and the extraordinary colors of India. The author is the daughter of Anglo-Indians and writes with an obvious love of the country and all its varied cultures. She portrays many of the colonialist characters with the arrogant and superior attitudes so prevalent at the time and juxtaposes them and their narrowly focused lives against the realities of the world which surrounds them. These Victorian colonial attitudes, beliefs and zeal to spread their culture and religion appear to have made the uprising an inevitability.I couldn't put this novel down and can't recommend it highly enough!Jana"},{"Title":"Shadow of The Moon (Part 1 of 2)","review":"I first discovered this book (the earlier 1956 edition) when I was a young teenager. I grew up in a house filled with books and was always an avid reader. One rainy day I was browsing through my parents' bookshelves looking for something to read, and found Shadow of the Moon. The title caught my eye, so I took it out, and after the first page I was hooked. I could not put the book down until I had finished! I read it many times over my teenage years, and my young 20's.Then, after the success of Kaye's The far Pavillions, they reissued this book in an expanded version. I had to buy my own copy and loved it even more than the original. I've never been a fan of &quot;romance&quot; as a genre, preferring mysteries and SciFi, and historical fiction, but I do enjoy a touch of romance in my novels, as long as that is not the total purpose of the book. And this one just fits the bill. An interesting romance but set against the background of the Indian Sepoy Rebellion of 1857. The history really takes center stage, and I loved that part of it.This book was that one that triggered a lifetime fascination with India, and also led me to read many other books on the subject, as well as all the other books by author M.M. Kaye. I've enjoyed all of them, but this one remains my favorite."},{"Title":"Shadow of The Moon (Part 1 of 2)","review":"MM Kaye is an engrossing story teller with an eye for easy and vivid descriptions. She wrote two epic tales of India, The Far Pavillions and this one, Shadow of the Moon. Both are stories of characters torn between countries and cultures - searching for identity, but Shadow of the Moon is by far the more traditionally romantic of two. This is the story of Winter de Ballesteros, the only child of a marriage between an British Earl's grand-daughter, and dashing Spanish hidalgo. The first few chapters introduce us to her family history, from Ware, in the bitter cold of Northern Britain, through the tragedy of Waterloo to India where Winter's parents meet, marry and eventually face tragedy. After their death, isolated without relatives in India, Winter is brought up by her father's sister who has married a Hindu. When she is finally sent back to Britain to the care of her great-grandfather it is to disastorous results. Winter doesn't speak English well, is quiet, and 'sallow', her relatives hate her and her great-grandfather is too old to protect her. In this lonely state she is given the chance to marry a man she has only met once in her youth, and with it the chance to return to India where he works - that one meeting has left her with highly romantic memories of him and probably because she desparately misses India, she accepts. Unfortunately when she returns it is to a troubled country, for India in the mid 1850's is in ferment - boiling on the edge of the forthcoming mutiny - and her husband is a prize prig. In this all is Alex, her husband's aide and source of great conflict for her emotions - and for his - for events in the country rapidly move out of control Alex finds himself in conflict - does he protect Winter?- or does he leave her and think of the greater good he can do for the country as a whole?Kaye's story has less of the personal conflict over identity which was evident in The Far Pavillions but I still found the story of Winter and Alex gripping, and it is told against the background of India in turmoil. And she is so good as a story teller, you can literally smell the country, the bazaars, and the heat."},{"Title":"Shadow of The Moon (Part 1 of 2)","review":"I put off reading this book due to the bulk of it, but once your'e into it - you're hooked. The story is beautiful, of the charming Winter de Ballesteros and the dashing Alex Randall, and M. M. Kaye weaves you into the plot by making you feel as if you are in the midst of the war, running for your life, screaming, hiding. It has been written absolutely beautifully. Although I must admit that there is a bit too much history, I cannot get down to returning this book to my friend - its mine for keeps! Its a must own, and enchanting, capturing book, a haunting story, which &quot;will haunt you forever, as long as the heart remembers&quot;"},{"Title":"Shadow of The Moon (Part 1 of 2)","review":"This was just an amazing book. Once the author set up her characters and story line things just cooked along -- be prepared for the last 200 pages, because you will not surface for air until it's done! We have Winter, a wealthy heiress born and orphaned in India and sent to England to be raised by mostly uncaring relatives(except for the great-grandfather). When her great-grandfather dies, she is sent at the age of 17 to join her fiancee under the care of Alex Randall, who unbeknownst to her is now a debauched, obese drunk. Alex does try to tell her, but she maintains her childhood image of her \\"hero\\" and will not listen, to her great regret.Lots of trials and tribulations as our hero and heroine travel back to India, the meeting and marriage to Conway and the Sepoy rebellion, and vividly portrayed by an author who has a great knowledge and love of the country and it's history. This is not only a story of two lovers, but one of stubborn, bigoted officials hiding their heads in the sand, treachery, intrigue and the brutal way in which the rebellion played out against the British, even shocking some of their own people. As withThe Far Pavilions, it is shocking to see after 150 years not much of life and politics has changed in the Far East, nor should the Europeans (or Americans now for that matter) be interfering in their life, culture and religion.Highly recommended for any lover of historical fiction, India, or just a darn good book. This would make an awesome mini series, the sequences from the attack on the British and Alex and Winter's escape are just breathtaking. As a side note for those loooking for well written books for younger readers, this should be a good choice. Originally written in the 50's, the love scenes are quite chaste. Just be prepared for some gory, though accurate, portrayal of the violence aginst the British (including women and children) during the rebellion.If you enjoy this book, I would also recommendZemindar. The same topic, the Sepoy rebellion, and beautifully written. The author's prose was gorgeous, very reminiscent of Charlotte Bronte."},{"Title":"Shadow of The Moon (Part 1 of 2)","review":"This is a superlative work of beautifully written, well-researched historical fiction by the author of the best selling, sweeping epic, \\"The Far Pavilions\\".

Bravo!"},{"Title":"Shadow of The Moon (Part 1 of 2)","review":"\\"Shadow of the Moon\\" is the story of the time before and after the Sephoy rebellion. It is the story of two people who are passionate about India, Winter and Alex. As an officer in the Indian army, Alex is asked to escort seventeen year old English/Spanish/Indian heiress Winter back to the land of her birth, to the man she has been engaged too since age eleven. Alex expects an older woman-a spinster with no other option than to marry his corpulent, drug and alcohol addled chief. But Winter's true age, and her childish attachment to the handsome man she was affianced too brings out a resented sense of responsibility in Alex and he continues to watch over her in India.I read in the back of my copy of \\"Shadow of the Moon\\" that the original version, published in the 1950's, contained less than half of the original manuscript, which was re-printed in its entirety in the 80's. It's easy when reading this book to see what would have been cut out-M.M. Kaye is great at describing social interactions, clothing and landscapes but she isn't so good when describing the politics that went on before the Sephoy rebellion. So the original book would have been (I imagine) a romance with very little insight to the political ramifications of the British occupation of India. It's a pity that the real manuscript took too long to come out because while it has its slow parts it is a very complete picture of two very different societies occupying the same space and expecting to co-exist.Winter and Alex, our main characters, represent two very different aspects of India. Though both were born and to some extent, raised there, neither is actually of the land (though they both posses physical traits which allow them to fake it.) Winter, because of her sex and marriage is incorporated in British India, and Alex, even though he works for the British army, has an understanding of the Indian feelings toward the British that most people can hardly grasp. So he spends the majority of the novel sneaking around, finding information about the rebellion he believes will happen soon. Naturally, no one believes him because with the conceit of the conquerors, the British believe they are enhancing and improving Indian society and culture.Naturally our hero and heroine develop feelings for each other-which come to a head at the worst possible moment when they are hiding from Indians who are outraged enough to commit atrocities beyond belief.LikeThe Far Pavilionsthis an amazing novel full of romance, vivid descriptions of culture, places, clothing and attitudes of the time. While not quite as engaging as \\"Pavilions\\" (mostly because of the political discussions, which Kaye never really manages to make all that interesting though they should be fascinating) it is head and tails aboveTrade Wind.(Though of course everything Kaye writes is wonderful, it only varies by slight degrees.)Five stars.

The richness of detail in which she sets her breathtaking sagas make the places come alive for the reader and the land, their climates, and indigenous peoples all become as integral to her intricate plots as the major characters themselves. Would that I could tell a story like she can!"},{"Title":"Shadow of The Moon (Part 1 of 2)","review":"This is an acceptable story if you can take it on its own merits. It doesn't stand up well to my other favorite about the Indian Mutiny, Zemindar. That is history for grownups. This is romance novel fantasy. However, if exotic escapism is what you are after, this does provide.The plot is full of incredible romantic conceits, from Winter, the European heroine, having a background that will allow her to pass flawlessly as Indian (convenient during a mutiny); Winter's parents, beautiful, highborn, perfect lovers who die young, leaving her with a Spanish title and lots of money; the series of coincidences that lead to her voluntarily marrying a real \\"rotter\\" (although given the total innocence in which Victorial girls were kept, not totally unbelievable).Then there is Alex, superior to Winter's husband in every way. He has a way of being present at historic moments, or running across historic figures, and like Winter can blend at will into the Indian landscape. He is the perfect English soldier-gentleman. His conflict over protecting Winter vs the greater good, though, is a believable one with which the reader can sympthize.My worst criticism of the love story is that, even though Winter is pregnant before it's all over, there are no good love scenes. From a strictly romantic POV, that leaves the story lacking.For the rest, there are the usual stock characters: Young Englishwoman, Innocent Victim; Loose Woman with a Heart of Gold; Native Mistress with a Heart of Stone; Villain Motivated By Lust, etc. To give her credit, they are real enough while you are reading. It's good, historical-romance escapism for the right mood."},{"Title":"Shadow of The Moon (Part 1 of 2)","review":"Shadow of the Moon, is an epic tale of politics and war in India. I found it to be a very long drawn out book that took 3/4 of the way through before I was hooked into the story. I bought it under the understanding that it would be a gothic romance, but it really is more in the epic category. I found the writing to be tedious, and it dragged on and on. When I read the author's note at the back, I came to realize that is was once published abridged, and really that is what it needs. It was so hard for me to connect all the political drama with how long it took to get the story going. Once I got into it, the climax of the book was 3/4 of the way through it, and then the rest of the book got back to the dragging format as before, only not as tedious. I am sure if you love books that are epic in nature you will love this one. Still it is no where the match to Gone With the Wind or The Thornbirds in the writers ability to tell the tale. I personally did not like the book that much.3 bookmarks out of 5"},{"Title":"Shadow of The Moon (Part 1 of 2)","review":"This is a superlative work of beautifully written, well-researched historical fiction by the author of the best selling, sweeping epic, \\"The Far Pavilions\\".

M. Kaye, is a sweeping novel of Regency and Victorian England and India. The bulk of the novel is set in India in the dying days of the Company Raj, when India was ruled by the East India Trading Company of Britain.Warning: Spoilers Ahead. The latter part of the book contains many graphic descriptions of people being violently killed during the Mutiny, when the Indians of the British Army in India rebelled against their British masters.This is a very good book. I enjoyed it very much, although I was unprepared for the violence. Mrs. Kaye is an excellent writer, and although she herself is British and sympathetic to the British rule of India, she does present the Indian perspective, too. It did cross my mind to wonder how accurate that presentation is, but as far as I can tell from the distance of 150 years and thousands of miles, it seems fairly accurate.I have also read Mrs. Kaye's autobiography, The Sun in the Morning, and so I know Mrs. Kaye grew up in India. It was British policy to have children go home (to Britain) at the age of seven or eight for schooling, but she was prevented from doing so by World War I, so she spent many more years in India than most British children and did not go to Britain until she was a teenager. According to the jacket of In the Shadow of the Moon, she also returned to Britain as an adult, with her husband, in the 1950s. I believe these experiences of India as a teenager and an adult helped her to see the perspective of Indians, not just Britons.I find In the Shadow of the Moon to be deeply frightening, in that the the British leaders willfully ignored the signs of impending mutiny and refused to take any action that might have prevented it (on the grounds that mutiny was not going to occur and it would cause a loss of morale to be seen doing anything that might prevent it). Reading this book, and descriptions of the genocide in Rwanda of a few years back, I realize that when the mob comes for you, there is nothing you can do."},{"Title":"Shadow of The Moon (Part 1 of 2)","review":"I read this book as a teenager and remembered it fondly. I wanted to read a long, involved novel that would hold me spellbound so I thought again of this novel and knew that I had to read it again. Dealing with British India and colonial rule, I found myself paying closer attention to the political details outlined in this novel than to the romance as I did the first time around. The truth is that the characters are well-rounded and real. We've all met people like them in every society we've ever been in touch with. The story deals with the life and trials of Winter, a European child born in India who is sent to England to grow. She forever recalls the color and warmth of her native India and is not happy in England. She finally returns to India and all of the momentous changes in the country affect her. Although it is a romantic novel, it focuses on the historical much like \\"Gone with the Wind\\". I liked it even more thirty years later. I highly recommend it for a good read and a good time.

At first I wanted to put it off because of the size but my highschool history teacher kept edging me on. So when I finally read it I felt like I was apart of the whole story. I just could not put it down. Thanks to MM kaye I have become a book reader."},{"Title":"Shadow of The Moon (Part 1 of 2)","review":"I love M. M. Kaye. I've read all of her novels and mysteries. She is an easy read and very entertaining. Her books are filled with exotic places and romance. I highly recommend this book!"},{"Title":"Shadow of The Moon (Part 1 of 2)","review":"First off, this is a great book. It does have a very old-school writing style (think Charlotte Bronte or Charles Dickens) which I love, but others might not enjoy. The setting, story, and excitement level are all there but it is a little shy of a 5 star rating in my book. Here is why:1. The characters were not as realistic or as developed as I would have liked. The main female protagonist is almost frustratingly naive while the main male is distant and exceedingly unemotional.2. Sometimes it reads a little too much like a history book entry.3. There are very similar but better books. A book called Zemindar focuses on the same period in history (with a similar writing style) only is much more engaging. M.M. Kaye's second novel, The Far Pavilions, is also much better.So if you are thinking about purchasing this book my suggestion would be to try either Zemindar or The Far Pavilions first and then read this novel if you want more."},{"Title":"Shadow of The Moon (Part 1 of 2)","review":"If you loved The Far Pavilions, you will love Shadow of the Moon as well. This beautifully written book withstands the test of time. I was able to get the original version from my library as opposed to the abridged version which evidently came out some years later.M.M. Kaye writes of a time in India surrounding 1857 and places you there with exquisite descriptions of the land, its people and that time of unrest. My favorite aspect of her writing is her female heroines; they live up to that role and are not reduced to inane conduct for the story's sake. She writes about them in a consistent and believable way. The secondary characters fill out the depth of the tale for a complete array of personalities. She does not hold back conveying the idiotic manner some Brits behaved during this event, adding the perfect touch of realism to this story. Very highly recommended."},{"Title":"Shadow of The Moon (Part 1 of 2)","review":"The author portrayed how common emotions such as; hate, love (sex) are affected by the hardship of war.

Kaye's writing. I've read the other books and look forward to this one."},{"Title":"Shadow of The Moon (Part 1 of 2)","review":"This is a superlative work of beautifully written, well-researched historical fiction by the author of the best selling, sweeping epic, \\"The Far Pavilions\\". The author was born in India, where she lived most of her life. Her love of that country is evident in her loving, descriptive passages of the land of her birth. Her assessment of Anglo-Indian relations during the time of the British Raj is infused in the characters of her spellbinding novel. With exotic, mid-eighteenth century India as a backdrop for most of this engrossing story, the reader is swept away by its beautifully descriptive narrative. It is in India that the fate of a beautiful, young, Anglo-Spaniard heiress with the improbable name of Winter Ballasteros and that of Captain Alex Randall, a commissioned officer with the East India Company, are irrevocably intertwined.Born in India and orphaned at an early age, Winter is brought up in England but is always longing for the land of her birth. The opportunity to return home to India presents itself when she is betrothed at a tender age to the debauched Conway Barton, the grasping Commissioner of Lunjore, who is many years her senior. Captain Randall, who is sent by the Commissioner to escort his betrothed to India, is loathe to do so, knowing the Commissioner to be no fit husband for a seventeen year old girl, Moreover, Captain Randall is keenly sensitive to the potentially dangerous feelings of unrest that seem to be sweeping India, as its native population begins to chafe under the insensitive rule of its colonial masters.Once in India and against a backdrop of native unrest, Winter and Captain Randall slowly begin to develop a relationship. When the Sepoy Rebellion of 1957 occurs, Winter and Captain Randall are thrown together. They discover that they must struggle to survive the madness and bloodlust that is all around them, as they witness atrocities beyond comprehension. The author gives a vivid re-creation of the Siege of Delhi, as well as a plaintive telling of the massacre of women and children at Cawnpore, a horrific bloodbath from which even the natives themselves shrank. It is against this tumultuous, historical backdrop that the personal drama of Winter and Captain Randall is juxtaposed.With a wonderful cast of Indian and Anglo characters, the author gives the reader a sense of the vastness of India with its many different religions and castes. She successfully depicts the colonialist attitudes that would serve to unite Indians whose paths might not ordinarily cross and galvanize them to take violent action in an attempt to break the oppressive, colonial yoke. The Sepoy Rebellion of 1857 would be a lesson that England would long remember.This is a riveting novel that those who love well-written historical fiction will enjoy, as will those who simply love a well told tale. Bravo!"},{"Title":"Shadow of The Moon (Part 1 of 2)","review":"For some reason this book's plot comes back to me occasionally. So something in it has caused it.

Only the Lutheran Church of Australia's Small Catechism even comes close, with very distant second when it comes to useful diagrams. This Small Catechism with explanation is right up there in overall quality with the LCMS's and the ELS' (Evangelical Lutheran Synod) Small Catechism.Some of the explanations, however, decidedly support Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod (WELS) positions. For example, any prayer, even grace before a meal, is taught as an \\"act of worship\\" and, thus, one should not pray with others with whom he is not in fellowship. This of course is one of the more &quot;extreme&quot; WELS positions being espoused. But then again, this is a WELS catechism! So a reader should be aware of the doctrinal positions being taught when using this catechism.Only two negatives, however, mar this fine production. First, this Catechism uses the NIV translation exclusively as its Bible text. The LCMS's catechism uses the NIV, but favors the NKJV where the NIV strayed from the original text. The ELS catechism uses the NKJV exclusively. Second, the translation of Luther's Small Catechism is a bit breezy and slightly paraphrastic.

I found it well written and fun reading. Any teenager will find themselves somewhere in this book. It expresses very well the range of teenage emotions and feelings. Although I am far from being a teenager I had to read it since I spent five summers working at the seashore as a teenager. The book just took me right back in time. It's not only a good summer read but I could just see someone cuddled up in a comfortable chair on a cold day reliving their summer experiences. It's really a very delightful book. I'll be giving it to the teens in my life for Birthdays and Christmas. I hope Beth Mayall decides to write some more. She has talent."},{"Title":"Mermaid Park","review":"At first I was concerned about the geographical inconsistencies stated by another reviewer. Wildwood's bridge is actually a four-lane affair instead of two? The veracity of every book on my shelf was called into question. Can anything be real? Does this mean there's no Narnia? No Swiss Family Robinson? No -- gulp -- Winnie the Pooh?Then I realized it's just a novel - this kind of gaffe would be notable in a AAA guide, but in a fiction story? Please.\\"Mermaid Park\\" is a fast and pleasant read, full of fun characters and delightful twists. The lead character, Amy, is an excellent model for girls her age, struggling with romance, family issues, and her sense of self - and learning along the way that she's not perfect. Her time with the mermaids goes from fantasy to reality and back again, providing a fun journey for the reader while it propels the story forward.

This is going to be one of the best books you are going to read. The book is Mermaid Park. The author of this book is Beth Mayall. This book has a bit of adventure and a bit of romance in it. Most of all I think it has a mystery behind this entire book.The main character in this story is Amy Rush. The thing is that Amy is tired of always being the outsider in her family. She is tired of the distance between her sister, Mel. Nothing in sixteen-year old Amy holds the promise of anything but disappointment until a nightmare weekend at the New Jersey shore with her mother, sister and Tom, her stepfather, and tom leads to a discovery that will change her life. She never really liked her stepfather Tom.When she was in New Jersey shore she first lays eyes on Mermaid Park. She felt like she stepped into a living, breathing fantasy.

So reading in the middle of winter (like I did) can either make you crazy, or make you sweetly long for summer. Hopefully the latter.Moments of gorgeous writing... By the end, the narrator is painfully real, and flawed. And her family is, too. There plot moves fast and is engaging... A few threads don't add up if you look too close, but I was along for the ride, and by the end, couldn't put it down. I kept thinking that it would make a great movie, with Orlando Bloom as Dylan... sigh."},{"Title":"Mermaid Park","review":"When I got my kindle fire HD at Christmas, I looked at so many books and this book stood out.

Readers will identify with Amy's battle to become more self confident and find it a truly pleasing summer read. This coming of age story is one not to be missed!"},{"Title":"Mermaid Park","review":"Both my daughter (age 12) and I enjoyed this book. It wasn't exactly what I was expecting, which means it was actually better. It includes good characters, not all likeable, but important to the storyline and did a good job of including realistic personality conflicts without going overboard."},{"Title":"Mermaid Park","review":"Spoilers are in my review, you have been warned!!!After reading all the reviews, I had big hopes for this book. I couldn't find it in any of the stores so I had to order it online. For the record I'm 29 years old and I find that I enjoy teenage books alot more than adult books.I have a few unanswered questions:1) Who was the mermaid she saw so late at night?2) Why was Lynn so against her going to the North side and hiding Mermaid Park from her? You'd think that she'd certainly tell her about the towns greatest attraction. So that lead me to believe that Lynn NEW about Skip.The book started off great, build up of characters, our girl is the classic spoiled teenager that is used to getting her way. She also has to deal with a stepdad that has no respect for her, thus she has no respect for him. I believe that if a parent or an adult wants respect from their child, they are to respect them in return. I don't think it's fair that your parent can sit there and cuss and yell at you all day long and all you can do is take it. They TEACH us to act this way... sorry getting off topic, I grew up with a strict stepmother and an abusive dad. Moving on. The build up of Dylan and her relationship was great, it reached the climax and just... dropped. I don't mean fell down slowly, it DROPPED. One min she was so into this guy, build up, build up, I do mean ALOT of build up, and BOOM, she gets him to kiss her and the very next day she goes \\"oh wow.. his ears are to big\\". And she suddenly doesn't like him anymore. Her obsession with becoming an actor in the Mermaid act was exhausting.I found the scene where she fell threw the window, or pushed through it with her hand, a little had to believe.I find.. the secret... I just don't get people like her mom. She keeps this huge secret about Amy being the daughter of another guy, finding out that Bruce was really her grandpa. How the heck is a teenager supposed to respect or trust their parent after this? Maybe I'm being to harsh.Overall, the book was so so. It reminded me of a time when I was a teenager and my family took me to a show just like this. Underwater mermaids and men swimming around, breathing threw tubes and so forth. I really don't believe that she learned anything, maybe to be more nicer? It would seem her sister learned more than our main girl did.I have 1 sister that's still a teenager and I can already say she wouldn't care much for this book, course right now, it's all about the vampires. But for other teenagers, I'd say give it a go. It's not a romance, it may have built up into one but dies, completely dies in the middle of it. The book is more about her obsession with Mermaid Park then anything."},{"Title":"Mermaid Park","review":"3.5 starsMermaid Park is a story about Amy, a teenage girl who is sick of her family. Her mother never listens to her, her sister is a big phony and her stepdad is, well, a big jerk. She goes to vacation with her family at Jersey Shore. She ends up staying for the summer with her godmother and works at the Mermaid Park, where mermaids perform underwater in a huge tank.This is a coming of age story. We see Amy discover herself and learn to deal with the people around her. Even though this book isn't what I expected, I enjoyed it. Amy reminded me of some of the things I went through as a teenager. I think we all feel like the world is out to get us at sixteen, at least I did.I was dissapointed by the romance. It set it up in the beginning for romance, but it fell short in the story. But like I said, this is a coming of age story. Amy can't be sure of someone if she is not sure of herself. The mermaid park is what makes this story. Dressing up as a mermaid and performing underwater in a huge tank is like the all time little girl dream job. The Jersey Shore was a fun setting to read about. I felt like a was on vacation again with my family while reading this. This is a great beach read, or a read when you are wishing for warm weather."},{"Title":"Mermaid Park","review":"I picked Mermaid Park up at the bookstore because the cover intruiged me. At first, I wasn't sure whether or not I would like the book. But as I got farther into the book, I loved it. The characters are well developed and they each have their own personality.The plot has just enough twists and turns to keep you waiting. At first, I thought it would be very predictable but it turned out not to be, especially on the romance side.If you're looking for a fun summer read, this is the book for you!"},{"Title":"Mermaid Park","review":"I found this book to be written well with great description but also thought that several situations were pretty improbable, such as a manatee swimming into the swimming tank and Amy's becoming the mermaid queen seemed a little too convenient. Amy's surprise parentage seemed a little unbelievable as well, although I had guessed that her mother had worked at the park after several clues about her affection for mermaid merchandise.Despite this, this book is a good read and I would recommend it! It's filled with summer romance, adventures, and all that can come from a teenager living in a new town for the summer without her family. It really makes you thirst for summer."},{"Title":"Mermaid Park","review":"I have been a fan since the West Chester Days. Came a across this in the book store. Great read. Five stars! Dr. Browne would be proud."},{"Title":"Mermaid Park","review":"I like novels with a mermaid theme and I haven't read anything for a while, so I thought I'd give this book a shot. The story is about sixteen year old Amy Rush who is on vacation in New Jersey with her somewhat backbiting family, who finds a mermaid park and ends up working there and later on, starring in the show. The story itself wasn't too badly written and the author certainly shows promise, but there are many things that put me off recommending this book.Throughout this novel, it felt rather unpleasantly like I was being led through someone else's teenage fantasy and what's more, it felt like a 'Mills and Boon' fantasy. I groaned every time I read the description of Amy's latest love interest, about his gorgeous eyelashes and- well, I'm sure I don't need to go any further.That's not all though. As other reviewers have commented, there were certain scenes that made little sense and at times even stretched beyond the boundaries of belief. For instance, have you ever seen the mermaids at Weeki Wachee, where they breathe through those air hoses during their act? Well the protagonist was watching a similar show and didn't notice these hoses. Oh no. Not until someone told her about them. So this supposedly champion swimmer spends the following few nights looking for these hoses at the bottom of the tank without success, displaying an unlikely ignorance of knowing how to dive without her ears hurting (this is after we've seen her picking up pennies from the bottom of a swiming pool earlier in the book). But it was as I feared; the hose-hunt was merely a McGuffin intended to lead us into yet another romantic encounter with the aformentioned hunk of the novel. Ouch. And if this wasn't bad enough, a few pages later, she's swapping spit with *another* local boy named Curt (who she's known for all of ten minutes).Anyway, a series of bizzare events leads to Amy starring in this mermaid show, namely the former mermaid having to back out at the last minute because her autistic brother beat up his room mate who he didn't recognise, despite having lived with him for two weeks. Rather convenient, especially considering that that many autistic people have photographic memories. And when the revelation came at the end concerning Amy's parentage, I lost all interest in the book. Luckily, there were only a few dozen pages left, so it was no real loss."},{"Title":"Mermaid Park","review":"This book was Fantastic! I couldn't put it down! I hope she coumes out with a sequel!"},{"Title":"Mermaid Park","review":"I picked up Mermaid Park because it claims to be set at the Jersey shore. It tells of 16-year-old Amy, trying to survive a family that consists of an immature, petty, and verbally abusive stepfather, a younger sister who is learning to emulate him, and a mother who seems oddly detached, as if she is drifting along in an air-headed haze, not noticing her family disintegrating around her. Amy's father lives in another city, too involved in his hobbies to connect with his daughters.A weekend trip to the Jersey shore motel of an old family friend ends in a fight and the insistance that Amy stay behind, as her mother & stepfather place all blame for the family's troubles on her. Amy moves into the motel apartment with owner Lynne, with the understanding that she will stay out of trouble and get a job. She finds work at the Mermaid Park of the title, an old-fashioned amusement where girls in sequinned tails perform in a huge water tank. Eventually her job leads to the uncovering of old family secrets and lies.It's a decent book for the most part, capturing the anger & frustration of a girl being unfairly blamed as the troublemaker in an already troubled family, touching on the loss she feels at being distanced from her sister and father, and at losing the former closeness shared with her divorced mother when she re-marries a cruel man.Scattered inconsistancies jump out at a reader deeply familiar with the Wildwood, NJ setting, however: Amy's family arrives in Wildwood via a \\"tired whitewashed two-lane bridge\\" with a rattling wooden deck. In reality, the main road into Wildwood crosses a tall, arching four-lane bridge constructed of concrete and asphalt; even the smaller two-lane bridges north and south of the city, along the ocean drive, are sturdy paved structures, and have been for years.Amy, a strong, competetive swimmer, goes swimming in the ocean, entering near a lifeguard stand and then swimming without turning down the beach. In reality, as soon as she got too far from the lifeguard stand, she would have been whistled back. Swimmers are not allowed to take off for mile-long swims.No mention is made of Wildwood's incredibly wide beaches, so wide that some locations have trams to ferry beachgoers across the quarter-to-half-mile of sand to the water's edge.Lynne's motel swimming pool has a sign stating \\"No lifeguard on duty\\", something most assuredly not permitted in New Jersey.Lynne seems to run the motel alone, yet no mention is made of the difficulties of doing so; she has an amazing amount of spare time, and there isn't even a throwaway line about the rigors of cleaning dozens of motel rooms daily, of late linen deliveries, of mechanical breakdowns or any of the myriad problems that face a small independant motel owner.North Wildwood purports to end at \\"First Street\\" and a dark, rural highway bordered by heavy woods. In reality, the city ends at Spruce Avenue and Anglesea Drive, a curving road lined by a huge stone jetty, Hereford Inlet, condos, and a commercial district, followed by Route 147 lined by the wetlands that leads to the Garden State Parkway.The lighthouse is described as a small conical structure at the end of a jetty. In reality, it is a square-towered Victorian-style house set near the inlet by the State Police marine unit station.Only scant mention is made of the teeming boardwalk and vibrant nightlife in Wildwood; Amy never visits, nor even mentions, the huge amusement piers and waterparks that dominate the skyline of Wildwood.The \\"natives\\" refer to the backbay area as \\"swamps\\"; however, no one in South Jersey calls these saltwater marshes \\"swamps\\"-- they use the terms wetlands, marshes, and backbay.The event that most raises eyebrows is when a manatee swims up the drainpipe of the mermaid park water tank, peeking out at Amy and a friend as they take a forbidden, middle-of-the-night swim. A manatee. In New Jersey. Yes, it's supposed to emphasize the mermaid theme of the book, but belief just can't be suspended that far. Not only is this manatee incredibly far north, but it also leaves the saltwater ocean to find its way to a freshwater creek, and from there to the drainpipe, and then to the watertank-- a watertank that is fed by an extremely cold, freshwater spring, lending to the unbelievability of the scene.The story is nice enough, though ultimately it leaves a bothersome amount of questions unanswered. How was Amy and her mother's relationship affected by the 16-year lie? How did Amy's father feel when told she wasn't his biological daughter, and that he had been paying child support for a child not his? How did her stepfather react to finding out his wife had been keeping such a major secret? Did they ever tell Amy's biological grandfather that his son had fathered a child before his death? What was the relationship between Amy & her sister like after Amy exposed her sister's fake penpal and they learned they have different fathers?The whole subplot of Amy's co-worker with the autistic brother was odd, too-- too detailed to be merely a throw-away plot device of getting the lead mermaid out of the way so Amy could save the day & perform as Queen in the last show of the season, yet the girls' friendship was too stilted and stand-offish to be real. What did Amy learn from the relationship, that autistic doesn't equal retarded, that people can be cruel about disabilities? That loving someone means giving up a job you enjoy to rush off & solve his problems when he hits a difficult patch?And the family friend who owns the motel, Lynne, was strange without explanation: willing to see her old, old friend, Amy's mother, in a bad marriage, to see the daughters suffer because of it, and quick to jump on the blame-Amy bandwagon. She seemed strangely unmoved when Amy's sister ran away, unable to put up with the stepfather's verbal abuse: her dear friend's daughters were suffering, and she seemed above it all, some sort of blind trust that Amy's mother had made the right choice to marry a cruel man since the true love of her life was dead anyway. She never stepped in when the stepfather was making vicious remarks in her home-- it's not interfering to say \\"This is my home and you may not talk that way in it.\\" She even joined in with lies to keep Amy from finding out about her mother's past as a mermaid park swimmer and her love affair with her biological father, saying that North Wildwood was a dangerous ghetto & should be avoided, to keep Amy away from the park.Lies were a recurring theme in the story: Amy's mother lied to her first husband about loving him & being pregnant with his child, she lied by omission to her dead lover's parents that their son had fathered a child before his death, Amy's sister lies about having a cancer-stricken penpal, Amy lies about her summer job, Lynne lies about North Wildwood and Amy's mother's past.A little effort to address the issues raised above would have resulted in a much improved book. Perhaps a sequel will deal with the fallout of the secrets exposed."},{"Title":"Mermaid Park","review":"I'm really getting irritated by publishers, authors and their friends writing five star reviews for their own books.

They use charts, illustrations and other devices to convey difficult ideas. The book has been laid out well and that is critically important when you weigh in with over 1,100 pages. There are only a few pages in the entire work that don't have a subsection heading.This is a good book and quite servicable as it is, I think it could even be used as a text in a semester long college course on Unix. When this goes to 5th edition I would recommend losing about 100 pages and not try to cover things like Snort, it is better to do one thing well and the Unix coverage is excellent. I would also like to see a bit more effort in meeting the promise of the title in the Towards Better Sysadmin section of the book, this is such an important topic and Andy and Robin clearly have the knowledge, experience and writing ability to help us in our journey to be better system administrators."},{"Title":"Unix Unleashed (4th Edition)","review":"All perfect, but there r too many words I can't understand at first sight(not technically) , such as \\"gotchas\\" &iexcl;weired... etc. ..."},{"Title":"Inside Out: Developmental Strategies for Teaching Writing","review":"This book is for any teacher looking to spark student interest in creative writing. With sample writing ideas in categories like introspection, narration, point of view, etc., you're sure to find an idea to replace the old tiresome routine writing ideas in the back of most textbooks. Inside Out is a virtual artesian well of creative writing juices, and the short chapters are quick reads during the limited time teachers have to plan for next week's lessons. I read this book during my methods courses in college, and now, eight years later as I change jobs to finally become a writing teacher, I've come to Amazon.com to specifically find this exact book. It's all I'll need!"},{"Title":"Inside Out: Developmental Strategies for Teaching Writing","review":"For teachers who have a hard time getting their students to write, this book is just for them. It is a compliation of strategies that teachers may use in trying to teach writing to their students. What I liked about this book is that the authors are teachers and the strategies that they list in their book have actually been implemented in their classrooms. The ideas in this book will be of great use to novice teachers as well as seasoned teachers who have run out of ideas. I highly recommend this book to everyone, it is easy to read and understand."},{"Title":"Inside Out: Developmental Strategies for Teaching Writing","review":"It's amazing how an \\"old\\" book talking about the writing classroom has so much to offer new teachers like myself. I appreciate how Kirby and Liner include a range of thoughts, including personal successes and failures, writing pedagogy, and practical exercises and projects to get students writing. It has restored my faith in the ability to survive the school system. Like our students, we do not have to feel smothered by mediocrity and should do our best to find ways to put life back into our classrooms and especially the art of writing."},{"Title":"Berenstains Baby Book","review":"You'd have to live under a rock not to know of the Berenstain Bears books and TV shows. I've loved the Berenstain Bears ever since my teenagers were babies. I like the classic Bears (where Papa Bear is always a bumbling idiot) and the later Bears (where Brother and Sister always learn an important lesson). So when I recently learned that Stan and Jan Berenstain, creators of the Berenstain Bears, wrote some books for parents, I had to check one out! I read \\"The Berenstains' Baby Book: Advice for Parents from the Creators of the Berenstain Bears\\" (ISBN 0-671-49629-8), and it's hilarious! The Berenstains dispense advice on all kinds of subjects, including pregnancy, feeding, bedtime, first words, discipline, daycare, and much more. The version I read was published in 1983, so parts are dated, but it really doesn't matter. The humor in this book remains fresh! Here's some of the advice they offer:Pregnancy: While you've been working through the final stages of your blimp impersonation, solicitous friends and relatives have kept your phone ringing off the wall. Your mother-in-law is convinced that the whole process is taking much too long and that your delaying tactics are for the specific purpose of embarrassing her.Grandparents: The grandparent's first impulse upon seeing the grandchild is to pick him up. It matters not that the child is happy in the crib, coach, or playpen. Nor does it matter that it required a supreme effort of stamina, will and native cunning to get him to lie there quietly in the first place. Up he's snatched! Then, after a few minutes of knee dandling, Grandpa glances at his watch and discovers that he'd better hurry if he's going to pick up Grandma in time to make the first show. . . . So, putting Baby back where he found him, he bids you adieu, but you don't hear him over the mounting decibels from your infant.Potty-Training: Bladder Control consists of putting the tot on the pot every hour on the hour. It also entails sponging up a puddle every hour on the hour, roughly two minutes after you take the child off the pot. Stated in its simplest terms, your objective is to get the puddle in the pot. The solution is largely a matter of sticking rigidly to a schedule and constantly keeping a weather eye squinted for signs of precipitation.Undressing: At two and a half, your tot will probably try to remove socks by grabbing at the piggie end and pulling toward his face. He pulls and pulls. Nothing happens. Eventually his hand slips off and connects with his nose. After this, be sure to slip his socks off his heels for him when he's in the mood to undress himself. Then when he grabs a handful of sock and yanks, he'll get results: there will be a sock in his fist when it connects with his nose.There's even a brief fill-in-the-blank section at the end of the book with such humorous items as:Smashed first priceless heirloom at ___ months.First locked self in bathroom at ____ months.Brought home first dead animal at ____ months.First fist fight at ____ months. Who won? __________\\"The Berenstains' Baby Book\\" is also loaded with adorable classic Berenstain illustrations. This is my new favorite gift item for expectant parents. Parenting isn't easy, but it helps when we can laugh at the many challenges and difficult stages. This book will bring out the chuckles in every parent."},{"Title":"Berenstains Baby Book","review":"Long before we gave any consideration to becoming parents, my brother and I discovered the Berenstains' Baby Book by Stan & Jan Berenstain. The descriptions and illustrations of parenting perils are hilarious. Therein lies a good chunk of practical information, but it goes down easy with their wry sense of humor.For example, those who feel they are butting heads with their children should read the section on the baby game \\"Boom-boom-botz!\\"Also memorable is the advise to parents that they should not get too excited if their children develop a taste for classical music, as they might just as easily shriek for joy upon hearing \\"Stick out your can, here comes the garbage man.\\"A common thread throughout the chapters is that while parenting is a serious business, one should not take everything too seriously.Recommended for parents and offspring of all ages."},{"Title":"Sheila's Diary, Vol. 1","review":"The artistic quality of the book is very high.

While Sheila plays with her slave, we learn that Sheila wants to find a new slave girl, and innocent, because she is bored with the overly experienced Chacha. We also learn that Sheila and Chacha are aliens, and that Sheila has targeted Earth to find her newest slave (for those that dislike multi-tentacled alien's attacking earth women and the like, these aliens look life female humans).The second part involves the search for and discovery of Sheila's target, the Earth virgin Ayaka. Ayaka literally runs into Sheila, and is targeted for slavery. The three women end up in Ayaka's apartment. Sheila requests that Ayaka strip, Ayaka refuses and tries to run away, and ends up stripped anyway.The third part is titled \\"Enforced Masturbation.\\" Chacha demonstrates masturbation, and Ayaka is fondled and forced to masturbate. The book flows along, further humiliating, abusing, penetrating (with a chocolate bar), and enslaving Ayaka. The further stories include the first kiss, penetration, gym class without a bra and pierced nipples, and self-manipulation.Overall, the book has good artwork and some good interesting parts, but enjoyment is somewhat hindered by the black & white nature of the book, and the censoring. The book contains: slavery, bondage, rape, some mild censoring (odd, considering the other book by Yuuki that I've read wasn't censored, might be a different Yuuki), fisting, humiliation, piercing, and exhibitism.

This history is documented with numerous Allies and Axis interviews, research of government documents and recapping period media presentations.This 264-page text is replete with 15-pages of endnotes, an extensive \\"ships sunk\\" appendix, and a cumulative bibliography. Wiggins also provides one Gulf map (locating the sunken ships) and many period black and white photographs. The photos are especially interesting (and worth the price of this book).Photos range from various u-boats and their victim ships, to personal photos of u-boat captains, to various scenery shots. It is curious that only one unsunk Allied ship is portrayed (page 139). (There are no photos of Allied captains or notables.) Of particular interest are the photos of Ft. Crocket's disappearing seacoast gun (page 121), the Hitchcock, Texas, blimp hanger (page 184), Galveston's Todd shipyard (page 76), Ft. Crocket's nighttime searchlights (page 132), and building Ft. San Jacinto (page 133).Read this great little book. However, watch out for Wiggins' Nazi apologetical bias. Although she briefly touches on Nazi fanaticalism, the book emphasizes German u-boats captains' chivalry. The u-boat crews are identified as pondering gentlemen who want to sink the enemy without \\"hating\\" the enemy (page 208). Wiggins thinks the captured German POWs \\"unfortunate\\" (page 225). She even expresses concern for the u-boatmen's seasickness while crossing the stormy Atlantic (page 207). Her Nazi sympathy seems odd, almost revisionist.This book is recommended to all World War II aficionados, 20th century Gulf of Mexico and Caribbean students, and 1940s photos buffs."},{"Title":"Torpedoes in the Gulf: Galveston and the U-Boats, 1942-1943","review":"Using the Nurenburg excuse used by those Nazis convicted of attrocities against humanity, this author has the nerve to claim the U-boat sailors \\"were just doing their job.\\" She takes obvious delight in the sinking of each American ship.

It was rewarding and fun to see in my mind's eye, and take pleasure in, the huge banquet of tasty and very often humorous nuggets offered.

Lo and behold, I came to find that the sentence, as published in this edition, is NOT what was supposed to have been written. Doubtless it is a (large) typographical error, but it changed the entire ending of the novel. Shameful to have happened, particularly for a book that markets itself towards classrooms and reading groups.The only good thing that developed from this experience is that through my research I discovered an alternate ending that Dickens had originally intended to use. Reading about the controversy between the two endings was interesting. Aladdin's nonsensical third ending was not.

As Pip comes into a small fortune, and becomes a \\"gentleman\\" he learns the value and true meaning of friendships and life. But the journey is a long one, with many lessons to be learned along the way before he can find his true self. Dickens has given us a wonderful story, with rich details of the setting and characters that grow and are among the most interesting and magnetic to be found in literature.I don't need to go on and on about the book itself(although I could easily go over my allotted word count here), if you haven't read it yet ,just know you are in for one heck of a literary treat. It is a story that will transport you to another time and place, and you may not want to come back. I will however, talk about this marvelous audio book. Michael Page is the reader, and what a reading he gives. Just curl up and listen to this master storyteller. Every voice, every nuance is captured. There is no doubt who is speaking as he gives each character the personality and cultural characteristics as Dickens intended. He even does the women wonderfully, without going over the top. In my mind Miss Havisham has always sounded just the way Page portrayed her, Estella as uppity as ever,the humble Joe, along with all the rest.If you are a fan of this book, this audio edition will give you a fresh read and new appreciation of this fascinating book. If you are experiencing it for the first time, you can't help but to become enthralled. Great to take on long drives or for younger readers to be introduced to classic literature in a most entertaining way.Enjoy the read...for the 1st Time or the 50th time!....Laurie"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Read this book in high school many years ago and probably did not understand the story fully. Just reread it and I absolutely loved the story. The depth of the characters is amazing. You feel like you have know them all of your life.

Pip's parents die when he is young making him an orphan. Pip is \\"brought up by hand\\" by his sister, who treats him with scorn. His sister's lack of love, however, is tempered by her husband Joe, a blacksmith. Joe is a simple, uneducated man and Pip's only \\"friend\\" during childhood. Pip commiserates with Joe about his sister's verbal thrashings, trying to make the best of his unhappy upbringing.Early in the story, Pip has an encounter with a convict in the cemetery among the marshes near his home. Unbeknownst to him, this man would be the source for his \\"Great Expectations\\" later in life.One day Pip is invited to the home of Ms. Havisham. Ms. Havisham is a single, eccentric, old woman who stopped living in the real world many years earlier when she was spurned by her lover on her wedding day.Ms. Havisham has adopted the beautiful Estella, and from the moment Pip meets her, he is infatuated with her beauty. Estella represents wealth, education, success, and opportunity--things Pip values but thinks he will never have.Dissatisfaction within himself grows as he wants to be more in life than a partner with Joe in the forge. Pip becomes unhappy not only with himself, but also with Joe, who represents what he does not want to be--uneducated and simple. Failing to appreciate Joe's moral character, Pip's world view begins to change as he sees education as something to be attained--the sure way out of his wretched life and the means by which he could woo the object of his unmerited affections, Estella.Pip's life changes dramatically when he is visited by a well respected and fiercely admired lawyer, Mr. Jaggers, who brings him an unusual message. Mr. Jaggers tells Pip he is to receive \\"Great Expectations,\\" but the benefactor is to remain anonymous until and only if they choose to reveal their identity. Pip mistakenly assumes the benefactor is Ms. Havisham, and the manipulating, self serving woman does nothing to dissuade him from his incorrect assumptions.The story takes Pip to London where he lives a life of excess and discards many virtues from his childhood. He no longer wants anything to do with Joe and believes his future course has been immutably set--that he is to marry the beautiful Estella. He shares his indulgences with his new friend, Herbert, whose acquaintance he had made years earlier at Ms. Havisham's place. The two of them rack up excessive debt as Pip sees himself as \\"a man in waiting\\" for all his fortunes to come to pass.Things are not what they seem, however. It is eventually revealed that the benefactor is not Ms. Havisham but the convict, Mr. Magwitch, whom Pip had met in the cemetery many years earlier when he was a young, impressionable boy.Pip is confronted face to face with the despised convict, hounded by the remembrances of him torturing him in the cemetery, dreams that lingered, causing him much consternation. But now he has to accept the undeniable truth that his turn of fortune is not because of Ms. Havisham's provision, but the despicable convict's desire to make him a gentleman. The convict wants his life to be redeemed for something good and chooses Pip to be that vehicle.Through a series of events, Pip acknowledges the inexcusable way he has treated Joe and wants to make amends. Before he can accomplish this, however, other happenings complicate his life. The convict, now in England, needs Pip's protection. Pip must make a way for Magwitch to leave England without being discovered.While Pip hides him with a trusted friend, Pip comes to realize that the convict he had earlier despised has more redemptive qualities than Pip has within himself. As he makes provision for the convict's escape, Pip sees Magwitch change for the better, and in so doing, Pip also changes. Instead of hating the convict, Pip grows to love him. The self centeredness of Pip's indulgences is replaced with care, not only for the convict, but in growing degrees, for others.In the process of trying to escape, the convict is attacked by his long-time archrival and enemy. As a result, Magwitch is severely injured, discovered by the authorities, put on trial and convicted, but dies from his injuries before his death sentence can be carried out. Magwitch's estate is turned over to the authorities to make restitution for past wrongs. Pip is left penniless and obligingly accepts that his Great Expectations and source of income have dissipated into nothing. Meanwhile, Estella marries someone else--a man whom Pip despises.A few years earlier, Pip had secretly made arrangements for his friend Herbert to have a small expectation out of his \\"Great Expectations,\\" amounting to a sizable sum of money. When it becomes known to Pip that he will lose his \\"Great Expectations\\" to the authorities, his only thought is for his friend. Pip returns to visit Ms. Havisham and requests, in a show of repentance for the wrongs she had done to him, a sum of money that Pip could again secretly provide to Herbert.Herbert wisely uses this money to successfully buy into a business venture. He later marries and moves overseas in his business pursuits--none of which would have been possible without Pip's anonymous provision to Herbert.Pip credits this as the only redeeming thing he has accomplished, reflecting on all the other things he did or didn't do that could have been used for good.Pip falls ill following the death of his convict friend, Magwitch, and Joe comes to England to care for him until he is well. Joe surreptitiously leaves early one morning when Pip is sufficiently recovered, and when Pip wakes up, he discovers Joe has paid off all his creditors. Pip immediately returns home in penitence to confess to Joe all his past wrongs, realizing that Joe is a better man than he. He recognizes in his now humble state that his \\"Great Expectations\\" deceived him into using it as a source of pride against Joe.Upon arriving home, Pip's expectations are not what he envisioned. His sister who raised him by hand has long since died as a result of an attack on her by the evil Orlick. His childhood friend and confidant, Biddy, has just married Joe. In the end, redemption works its way for good. Joe and Biddy are happily married and the sore memories of Pip's sister are forgotten.Pip returns to London and within a month, leaves England and joins Herbert's firm, Clarriker and Company, overseas. Pip lives abroad with Herbert and his wife, and after successfully making partner, eleven years later, returns to his boyhood home in England. He discovers Joe and Biddy now have a son who reminds him of himself.Before bidding Joe and Biddy a final farewell, Pip makes one last trip to the Havisham place, the old woman having died many years earlier. Pip discovers Estella in the garden, a chance meeting since she no longer lives there. The old house and brewery have been torn down and sold off except for the garden enclosed by the ivy covered wall.Years of a stormy, failed marriage have softened Estella's vindictive, prideful nature, and she confesses that \\"suffering has been stronger than all other teaching and has taught me to understand what your heart used to be.\\"The reader is left to ponder whether Pip and Estella ever marry because Pip says, \\"I saw no parting from her.\\"In the end, Pip learns much about what matters--wisdom he would not have possessed if he had stayed working at Joe's forge. As a middle aged narrator looking back, there is sadness but sweetness about what he has lost because of what he has gained. Perhaps the reader is the real winner, having seen redemption on so many levels within each character. In the end, if we are honest, we can identify these shortcomings in ourselves. If Pip can work out his \\"Great Expectations\\" to bring redemption, perhaps we can, also--that is, again, if we are honest.

His use of language too causes one to undertake his novels fully prepared to spend time parsing his sentences and consulting a dictionary in order to satisfactorily comprehend his writing.In other words, Dickens can never be read lightly even though, strictly speaking, his work might be considered light reading.'Great Expectations' is particularly worthy of close reading for, whether intentionally or not, it harkens back to 'The Odyssey' by Homer. Yes, that's right, apart from being a truly ripping yarn, the gist of which you can doubtless cull from other amazon reviews, this is a book in which Dickens examines or, more accurately, lays bare the inner workings of the (male?) human psyche.Humans are raised upon a diet of myths of human perfection, a list of which is endless; superhuman athlete, heroic military personnel, idealistic politician, anointed prophet, perfect mother, exalted leader, etc. What Dickens does in this great book is discuss the contradictions that lie within us all that make us heroes one moment and cowards the next; paragons of virtue on the one hand, and unprincipled thieves on the other; selfless benefactors today and greedy self-servers tomorrow.Most of us believe ourselves to be endowed with above average amounts of courage, generosity, and charity, etc. In addition to pointing out such conceits, Dickens proceeds to demonstrate how we maintain these notions while acting in radically contradictory ways to them.This brings me back to Homer's 'Odyssey,' and also to the works of Wm. Shakespeare which are the West's most revered examinations of man's psyche. It strikes one that this book is Dickens' effort, successful and brilliant effort, to do as they have. Granted, the latter's work is sentimental and written to be broadly popular; however, this accessibility in no way can hide the fact that Mr. Dickens addresses fundamental human truths/traits in this book.Based on amazon reviews, this book is evidently assigned to many 9th grade English classes. What a shame, as it is doubtful that such a young person has yet had a broad enough experience of the personal contradictions that allow us to tick. Perhaps Freshman classes would be better served by 'The Great Gatsby,' 'Catcher in the Rye' and similarly glib works, leaving sublime works such as this for later years. (It could be argued that early exposure might arm one against future bad behavior...the point Dickens makes though is that we can't avoid ourselves.)"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I have loved this book since I first read it in high school.

I have also become a great admirer of the work of Frank Muller, who has recorded countless works, both popular novels and classics (including Moby Dick, the brave soul!)When Mr. Muller sank his teeth into Great Expectations, he created a performance with the perfect combination of innocence, humor, irony and adventure. He had me laughing out loud despite being stuck in terrible rush hour traffic.The actor manages to become the characters to the point where you forget only one man is reading all of the parts. He has created convicts you could easily picture, and almost smell. His portrayal of Joe Gargery makes you love the character for his heart of gold. His portrayal of Wemmick's \\"castle\\" and the \\"ancient\\" was so hilarious I was almost in tears.Of course, Dickens had quite a bit to do with it too.I realize there are countless recordings of this great work, and I'm sure this won't be the last I will ever hear.

It follows the interesting story of a boy named Pip throughout his many life experiences and different phases of his expectations. The plot is connected in a unique way throughout the book, and mysteries are solved and connected with it. Through his beautiful writing and interesting plot, this novel is arguably Dickens's greatest work. The language does require your full attention to understand it, and it is a very long book, but the writing is so great that you don't really notice to much.The tone of the novel is pretty dark and gloomy, but there is a constant sense of hope throughout. With themes of social class, guilt and innocence, and ambition we see Pip grow as a person and learn about the struggles and trials in life. There is also a bit of a love story that occurs that puts some fey real emotion into the story.I would reccomend this book to younng adults and adults who have the ability to understand the writing. I would reccomend that a person read it when they are looking for a good book, but have plenty of time to read and really take the story in. You need full attention to read it, but it is well worth the time it takes."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Of all the Dickens novels I've read, this one is certainly the most atmospheric and perhaps the most true to life. In terms of art, this is probably his supreme achievement. The plot isn't as convoluted as it is in Bleak House. The action is more dramatic. The female characters, particularly Estella, are more believable and (in the case of Miss Havisham, for instance) more intriguing. The sentimentality and the overall length are under tighter control. The humor still abounds. The language is easier to read but no less descriptive. No, it's not a perfect work -- there are still cloying and annoying characters and incidents, and far too many ridiculous coincidences -- but to me, at least, Great Expectations is Dickens' greatest achievement."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"The book \\"The Great Expectations\\" was probably originally intended for middle-class adults in London. Today however the book is read and understood by both children and adults. Some things about the book that made it worth reading was first and most obvious the story line. Also the book seemed to go really fast. The story started with action wich made the book more enjoyable to read. Also it didn't get bogged down very much throughout the entire story. Another good quality of the book is that it didn't contain much romance, which can also slow a good book down. The main point of the book that affection, loyalty, and consience are more important than social advancement, wealth, and class, could have a strong affect on certain communities. Since this sort of theme has been around for a while and will continue to be around for a while gives the book credit for being a classic. Also the fact that this book is fairly old and is still being read to this day makes it a classic. The book was written in great detail. All the characters were fully described and all served a purpose. That also made this book very interesting. I would recommend this book to middle school students, and to adults as well as anyone in between. This book and the main idea was not difficult to understand. Also it is enough of an action and \\"turn around\\" book that it keeps the readers attention even to the end."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Great Expectations by Charles Dickens was a very good novel in my eyes. The main character Pip believed, as a true Victorian, that a gentlemen is made solely of financial aspects and physicall possessions, and he is oblivious to moral aspects of the positions. Upon recieving his great expectations, he moves to London for a further education, and to become what he thinks is a gentlemen. Through Pips life he learns that his life as a gentlemen is not what he thought it would be, and his views of a true gentlemen start to change. With thanks to Dickens and Great Expectations, we realize that sometimes even a convict may be more genteel than a traditional gentlemen. He may start as a poor orphan boy, like Pip, or labour as a blacksmith, like Joe. truly, what matters is the heart and inner worth that make a genuine gentlemen, and social prestige has not a bit to do with it."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Although one of the first Dickens books that I've read, it is still one of my favourites. The scenes with Miss Haveisham's ghost wedding banquet are haunting and have stuck with me for years. We see how Pip saw this abandoned wedding banquet, and then we follow Pip and his subsequent relationship with Miss Havisham as he grows up. Miss Havisham, for some reason has resolved to take out her considerable vindictiveness on little Pip, and we see how this moulds little Pip's character. We also see the positive effect that a prisoner (Joe Gargery) has on Pip. The tone of this novel is quite gloomy throughout, but it does end on a positive note. Although gloomy, it does have Dickens' usual warmth and humour displayed throughout, and of course his wonderful characters. This is a book that will stay with you for a long time."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"great expectations is just that. i am not much of a classics fan, preferring contemporary writers. i decided to read this after reading john irving's \\"trying to save piggy sneed, in this book irving finishes with an essay on dickens where he says that great expectations was the book that made him want to write. being a big irving fan, i decided to read great expectations and i have to admit i was blown over by dickens' writing style. the humour, the characterisation, the verbal jugglery, the pompousness, the joy of writing were all apparent and absolute fun. the best thing about the book is that it hasnt aged one bit.dickens writes with rare moral courage and compassion for the failings of his characters, he creates a vividly colourful world populated by extraordinary characters too bizarre to be real, yet makes us trust in them, and slowly makes us sympathise with them and eventually grow to love them. the strength of this book is not in its plot but rather in the style of writing.a thoroughly enjoyable book if you love a colourful writing style."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I have to read this book for highschool, and even though I'm not through with it quite yet, I think it's a lot better than I expected. Charles Dickens threw in a few parts that I thought were kind of exciting. In the beginning, you really have to get used to different spellings of words, like &quot;skilful&quot;, for example, but after you get into the book more, you catch on.The main character, Pip, goes from being a boy raised by his sister, to becoming a gentleman. In his journey, he meets several different people, like Ms. Havisham and Estella, for example. There are many different things he must go through before he is told he has an opportunity to become a gentleman. Now I just have to see how it ends!I'd recommend it to people who are older than highschool, just because I think you'd enjoy and understand it a lot more!

We meet Pip as he describes his sister who &quot;raised him by hand.&quot; However, despite his misgivings about his sister he still feels very fondly towards his brother-in-law Joe Gargery. He meets many extraordinary characters along the way one of them being the classic literary figure Miss Havsiham. Miss Havisham had a broken heart and she raised her daughter Estealla to view men the same way she did. As Pip grows up and moves out on his own he becomes the only person to know the true identity of Estella. The other important character in &quot;Great Expectations&quot; is a criminal. He had threatened Pip in the marshes when he was a young boy and came back from New Zealand many years later to see Pip again. All though the criminal meets his untimely demise we still grow close to the character and miss him when he goes. This book gives an excellent view of not only a young boy's thoughts and emotions but outlook as well. It takes you on a journey that provides you with many lessons that can be carried throughout your life. Despote the magnificence and brilliance of the author's writing it is still a very difficult book. Dickens gives an amazing outlook on life and he deserves the recognition he has gotten, even since his death. &quot;Great Expectations&quot; is a true classic and deserves to go down in literary history."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Absolutely one of my favorite books ever written... superb, intense and emotional, this books is highly reccommended to anyone who likes literature. Follows the coming of age of Pip, who is realized so fully that the reader cant help but identify with him, and come to feel as if he knows him. Anything by Dickens is bound to be something special, but in my opinion this one takes the cake."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"This is a great story of Pip (Philip Pirrip)'s obsessive love for a woman who neither loves him nor seems in any way the typical heroine. As he strives to become a gentleman, aided by an anonymous benefactor's money, he succeeds only in alienating those who love him best and most honestly. Appearances, as in most Dickens novels, are deceiving, and those who are wealthy in a material sense are not those who are wealthy in the emotional sense and vice versa.The language and sentence structure are both complex; if you have any difficulty in understanding this sort of English you'd do well to wait awhile before reading GREAT EXPECTATIONS, because Dickens' brilliance is in the wording. This is less humorous than many of his other stories; however the humor is there if you look for it and listen for it in the phrasing.Dickens provided two endings for this book, and, frankly, I don't care much for either...but read the book, read both endings, and decide for yourself."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"This is a story that only Dickens could tell, and no Hollywood screenwriter can capture the same. Dickens created characters that can not be placed in another time. Pip is a blacksmith apprentince and meets up with a man in a graveyard named Magwitch. He helps Magwitch out and then Magwitch takes the blame and gets sent to Australia to pay for Pip's crime. Pip is then invited to play at Miss Havisham's manor with her ward Estella. And Miss Havisham uses Estella to despise any man. Since Miss Havisham was betrayed by her husband to at the altar by not showing up, she feels it's her life's duty to make all men suffer. So Estella makes Pip feel horrible for his hands and only allows him to get close enough to toil with him. You feel so sorry for Pip and how he is tormented by Estella. All the while he gets money from an unannounced bennefactor that turns his life around. And he moves to London to become a gentlemen. A great story about friendship.

It is considered to be his greatest work to many critics. I read the book and found that it was probably the most boring book I had ever read in my life. Overall the book had a pretty well thought out plot. To me though the book was a classic and masterpiece only when it was first became published. People now in the present are not very easily satisfied with a book with a good plot and are well written. People now are just more interested in books that have a lot of twists and turns in the story. They want be able not know what is going to happen next in the story. The book Great Expectations even though it was such a boring book it did have some very interesting parts. Also the book was overall well written by the author. One strength that the book had was the fact it had such interesting characters. The author had well character development throughout the book. All the characters in the book were described that you tell each character apart because of their personality or physical appearance. The main character Philip Pirrip also nicknamed Pip was very well described as a character. The author told everything possible about Pip so throughout the book you saw the main character grow into man and also grow as person in general. When Pip when through something you almost felt like it was you in the book. Also another strength in the book was the great setting descriptions. It was so good because when you were reading the book you could actually picture the setting in your head. The book had very little strengths because I was forcing myself to actually read it. If it had actually been actually interesting I would have finish the book in one day instead of a three weeks. The only reason that I actually read was the fact I knew had to do a report on it. The book had many faults for a classic book. The main weakness of the book was the chapters that were pointless and just there to take up space. The book seemed was written to just tell a story of boy without any really interesting parts. I was somewhat disappointed in the fact that the book was considered a classic book because a classic book to me is book that can interest anyone and any age. The book had great plot and well-written characters but I thought that the book could have been shorter. It could have been shorter and would still have the same impact on a reader. The reader will eventually find out that the book Great Expectations is just a book to read when you have nothing else to read. Think this book just wasted my time. I hated every minute that I spent reading this book. In scale of one through to ten I would give it a four. The book is fairly good but the book is simply too long to tell a simple and boring story of a boy named Pip. I wouldn't recommend this book because I think that the reader will be truly bored. Probably the main target audience of this book was of young adult. The book is good for that age range because of the somewhat difficult and confusing vocabulary. The book Great Expectations is just a book to be read when there are no more books to read."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"this book basically bored me to tears, it's one of those books that you really have to be into from the beginning to get the story at all, like harry potter or lord of the rings. main point = if you're not a charles dickens fan, the amazon description doesn't amaze you, and even you've read it before and reallllyyyyy disliked, then this book is not for you."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"In my opinions, the book is alright, but not the greatest book ever as other people like to say.

The clothing would be torn apart and you would smell horribly. The cake would've been gone, too. And the aged one in Mr. Wemmicks apartment who gets happier the more violently you nod at him?

Dickens' tedious descriptions and constant indecision on how the plot should turn makes the novel lose it's potential merit.Thousands of scholars and other readers have lauded Great Expectations as the finest Dickens' work of all time. The fact remains that it appears Dickens could not decide whether to make this a tragedy or an &quot;all's well that ends well&quot; happy-go-lucky type of story. This is proven by his change of the original ending. However, any reader could give testimony of feeling &quot;yanked, strung along, or thrown about&quot; from page one as they wonder just what Dickens wants them to think about Pip and his less-than remarkable life. Should we sympathize, feel disgust, be concerned? Does he deserve Estella's scorn or is he a victim of circumstance?The more you read of this cryptic novel the more you grow to understand that Dickens doesn't know what his novel is about, either. The entire book seems to vary by the chapter. And the fact that the plot has a potentially good story behind it that Dickens doesn't care to elaborate on makes the entire thing a bit more tedious for the take.The fact remains that Dickens is a fabulous story-teller. He has accurate, unjaded descriptions, refreshing, occassionally bitter, sometimes triumphant plots, and enough suspense to keep you reading throughout the night. It's just that none of that takes place in Great Expectations.Holly Burke, PhD.Clinical Psychologist, Abnormal Psych.

But there are other great stories that Dickens has done such as \\"A Christmas Carol\\" and \\"A Tale of Two Cities\\" and I am unsure why this one is always required reading.The story itself is mildly interesting and the characters and dialogue are unrealistic. There were many times that I felt like I was visiting an insane asylum.Dickens is labeled as a classic author, and often that gives reader's pre-conceived notions that his novels must be good.

Don't write me off as a slack-jawed Gen-Xer though, because I've read some pretty heavy stuff (Faulkner, Montaigne, Steinbeck, Salinger, Dumas, Hemingway, Vonnegut, Tolkien) and loved it. I eat up Mark Twain; &quot;A Connecticut Yankee&quot; was a page-turner for me, and &quot;Huck Finn&quot; is my all-time favorite book. I just don't like Dickens' writing style, which he shares with most other Victorian novelists: unnecessary verbosity, obvious pomposity about the self as a masterful writer. I agree that Dickens is one of the great storytellers of all time, and he may have had the greatest imagination for character development since Shakespeare. But his writing style turns me off."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I am currently being forced to read this book for my Honors English class in high school. I've already read it once before for a different class, so I know what I am talking about when I say this book is the ultimate cure for insomnia.I honestly try to appreciate what is *supposed* to be fine literature, but &quot;Great Expectations&quot; is about as entertaining as watching kale grow. First off, the fact that this book has two endings inspires a bit of skepticism in me. I've never heard of an author so indecisive that he would put two endings in a novel. It creates a generally unsatisfying conclusion, as you're at a loss for which ending to &quot;accept&quot;.Aside from which, this book has enough useless passages to fill a hundred pages or so. It seems that, basically, Dickens didn't quite know exactly what to write about, but felt the urge to *write* *something*. So he wrote &quot;Great Expectations&quot;, following the traditional poor-boy formula of his previous 15 or so books.I find it especially hilarious that none of my teachers have ever even read the bloody novel, but it's &quot;good&quot; according to the curriculum. In the words of someone from a certain other Charles Dickens book, &quot;Bah! Humbug!&quot;.Don't judge Dickens by this book, however. &quot;David Copperfield&quot;, for example, even though it follows the same &quot;poor-boy&quot; formula, is worlds better than this.As much as I'd love to say, &quot;Oh, it's a classic, everyone should read it!&quot;, I personally don't think so."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Great works of English literature from the 1700s and 1800s shared one thing in common; twists and turns in the plot lines that are never fully exposed until the last lines of the book. Chief among these twists are reversals of fortune both good and bad. So goes this work of literature. Though read by many as children, I would consider it more worthy of young adults, as the text can be quite boring for anyone below their teens. Basically, the plot revolves around Pip, a boy who grows up poor in the care of his sister and apprenticed to a blacksmith; a blue collar job by any standard. But he comes into an inheritance which he gladly accepts, leaving behind his previous life. A second theme of this story is his awe and obsession over Estella, a pretty girl who he meets first when young and poor when she does not even see him, and later one when he is rich when she cannot look past him. This is the probably the part of the book best remembered; a boy infatuated with what he cannot get, only to re-encounter it on later on in life as something he might not want anymore.As a book, it is shorter than most of Dickens' work, and much easier to read. But it has less historical meaning, and to me, less exploration of social ills than his other works such as Oliver Twist and Great Expectations. The book focuses more on personal travails, and how relationships between individuals all depend on the where the individuals came from. The book is interesting enough, but not that exciting, and I would not consider it as a mandatory work for all students to read."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I liked this book, I really did, I promise.

That doesn't mean that it will be better in all people's opinions."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Great Expectations, by Charles Dickens, was a very strong novel. I enjoyed it, but found parts of it confusing and difficult to read. It is a very &quot;deep&quot; novel which has twists and turns throughout. In the begining, Pip was an orphan who went to live with his sister (who was mean) and her husband (who was an OK guy.) Later, he goes to the home of Miss Hauisham. She is a lady who is kind of crazy because of a past situation. Her lover left her years ago. Here is where Pip meets her daughter, Estella, who is very beautiful ( and who was always moody and was spoiled.) Pip falls for Estella (I guess he can put her personality aside.) Later on, Pip becomes wealthy but he can't figure out who left him the money (He thinks it was Miss Hauisham.) It ends up that a man named Able left him the money. When Pip was young, Able asked him for food. Pip got it for him and Able was convicted and he was forced to move away. After he moved he became wealthy and because of Pips heart and help, Able left him a fortune. As for the end... you can read it for your self and find out the suprises. My only complaint is that there are some confusing parts (as I said above.) Overall, I really enjoyed this book and reccommend it for people who like Dicken's work. To be honest, when I first got this book I did not want to read it. I figured I would just rent the movie with Gweneth Paltrow, and base my report on that. It is SO DIFFERENT. The book and the movie are not alike. I decided to read it and so I did. I reccommend this book for people who like Dicken's work. He really did a great job with this one."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Great Expectations must have been what the readers of Dickens' serial publication must have had when they first read it, and I have to wonder if they were as disappointed as I was after slogging all the way through to the skewed, disjointed, and extremely contrived ending. This was written as a serial, not a novel, and I think Dickens (and his readers) would have benefited from a rewrite before publication in novel form.If ever there was a novel that set out to have no meaning, no core, no arc, and most of all, no satisfaction, it must be Great Expectations. The novel's title clearly states Dickens' perspective and intention; that great expectations in life will be met by great (and bitter) disappointment, and the greater the expectation, the greater your disappointment in life will be. The idea that a woman jilted at the altar will spend her life grooming a young girl to make other young men's lives miserable, is a contrived, almost paranoid idea from a male's perspective. Mrs. Havershim's great expectations for life were dashed, because instead of moving on to meet a better man, she chooses to become a shut-in and ruin a young man's expectations for life. However, if it seems that Dickens is building towards some kind of message about not having overblown expectations and then being bitter if they don't work out, the reader is to be disappointed. Dickens goes out of his way not to make this point or any point, but to make a grimly sad tale bereft of any kind of compass or solace for either the characters or the reader.Pip, the protagonist, survives his encounter with the damaged Estella, who had been deliberately damaged by Havershim to be \\"unable to love\\". The ending, in which he encounters her again briefly and is glad she is able to have the heart to \\"understand his heart as it was\\", is unbelievable, pompous and drowning in its own self-pity, all at the same time. It also feels as if Dickens took a perfunctory way to get out of a story that had meandered its way away from him.Great Expectations must be the most disappointing, overblown \\"classic\\" novel I have ever read, not because it doesn't have a happy ending, but because of the way that Dickens has created his characters and shapeless mess of a story, and presented it in the most abrasive fashion possible. I was relieved at the end to have finished it, not satisfied, not sad, and certainly not edified. There is nothing to learn or grow from in this novel; it has made me less of a Dickens fan. And that is the most disappointing result of reading it."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I'm surprised that this book is a requirement in highschool. I had to read it in my upper division English Lit class in college and I just couldn't get into it. There are way too many retarded characters on which Dickens spends too much time, Pip gets more annoying with every page, especially his love for Estella who is one of the most disgusting characters in the book. I've read Jane Eyre before this and it was a real page turner. This is plain boring."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Great Expectations has a few interesting characters. I'll give it that. Magwitch and Miss Havisham are definitely original and entertaining. But everyone else is pretty bland.Pip's love for Estella is rather pathetic. Why he would love such a despicable person is beyond me. This fact alone makes Pip difficult to relate to, and thus not a very good choice for the point-of-view character.But the one thing that absolutely ruins this book is the clutter of coincidences. One of the first rules of fiction writing is NO COINCIDENCES. And Dickens goes out of his way to break this rule. Over. And Over. And Over.Really, it is not a very good book. Please do not wasted your money on it (although there are a LOT of pages, so it could last you months as toilet paper"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Every high school kid who has written a review complaining about this book being boring should be boiled with their own pudding and buried with a stake of holly through their heart!Well, thats from A Christmas Carol but you get my point.This book is just great, you can't get any better than it except for maybe David Copperfield. Its one of Dickens best, I could read it over and over and over and over....you get the point. Anyway, Amazon shouldn't allow all these stupid kids to gripe about the books anyway, they can never say anything more intelligent than &quot;It was boring.&quot; Well, poor things.

I suggest finding a good summary. The movie was relaly good. Way better."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"As a student, I was expecting to read a literary masterpiece. I don't like long books like Great Expectations but this book went into extreme detail about the most meaningless things.The novel grabs you fast and has a story with many surprises and twists along the way.Theres all sorts of unknown parents, secret coniving, mysterious benefactors, and worst of all, many unrealistic characters. Miss Havisham, Pip, Magwitch, Mr. Jaggers, and Estella are the characters that you should think more about them understand them.If this is to be your first reading of the book, be patient with the book's middle third,because the real and important events starts very late;The story centers around a young boy--well, almost young man-- named Pip, and revolves around his growing into age. Much of Pip's worry and concern I could relate to--falling in love with a girl who only plays with your heart, growing up and leaving home for the first time, and discovering your true relationships with others and yourself.It is a darker work, but it has some exciting and entertaining parts to it, too. If a ex-convict came up to me, I would be so scared that I would run away. The fact that Pip trusted Magwitch with a lot of things really amazed me.Actually there are great descriptions with wonderful dialogues and I'd recommend this book to anyone who wants a good, but an illogical read."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Do not give this book as a gift. It will disappoint. I am still looking for a high quality illustrated version of Great Expectations. However, I can vouch for the vendor who offered a low price and shipped promptly."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I thought this book was a little hard to understand with the way they talked. Some of the words the use you don't normally hear everyday or the way they phrase some of their sentences makes it harder to know what is going on. I liked this novel though the story was great in how all the events that took place connected to something else in the end of the story.My favorite parts in this book were when Pip was finding more and more about Estella and her family because it kept you wanting to read more and more of the story so you could find out what happened. The major themes of the story were kind of hard to understand because some of them are hidden in the story and Dickens doesn't come right out and say what's happening and sometimes he drags out the seen and makes it really easy to lose interest or just get confused.Dickens didn't really bring the story alive for me because I didn't really understand some of the parts in the book, but I did like the story."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"HOW I JUDGE A CLASSIC: I don't give extra brownie points to classic books. I ask myself, \\"If this book were published today by some unknown author, what would I think of it?\\" Perhaps this isn't a fair way to judge a classic, but that's the method I use.PROS OF GREAT EXPECTATIONS:- It has outstanding character development.- It's a story about people and relationships.- Good, authentic dialog.- A nice moral story.CONS:- Painfully slow pacing.- Long-winded writing style, long paragraphs.- Few characters that are that agreeable.CONCLUSION: Have low expectations when you read \\"Great Expectations.\\" Modern books have much faster pacing and are more easy to read. For those who love the classics, they will love this book. I, however, preferred \\"A Tale of Two Cities.\\""},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Like many other reviewers, I have been dragged into reading this book by a literature class. The story line is mildly interesting, but most of the book contains fluff that is pointless and you just have to suffer through. The language is also very difficult to understand and not a \\"skimmable\\" book, by any means. If you really insist on reading this book, I would suggest getting the SparkNotes or the Cliff Notes. They tell you all you need to know: There's an orphan. His name is Pip. By a chain of events, Pip recieves a great deal of money. He moves to London and becomes extremely arrogent. And it goes on. Not the most enjoyable endeavor."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I didn't actually read the book, but I saw the South Park version of it.

I wrote ten pages about the story of Pip's journey through British life and how he changed as a person....It was not a happy journey for me, i just want that out in the open. I had to pore over endless details from a book that was confusing enough to read anyways. I do not recommend this book, especially if your looking for a cheap thrill...there is none.

Thank you, and good night."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I had to read this book over the summer.

I think its awful that I was forced to read what amounted to an 18th century serial out of a tabloid.The reason the book is filled with so much meaningless drivel is that Dickens was paid for each installment and the longer the series lasted the longer he had a steady job, At least thats my theory. I just wish I could ask the dead author some questions like Why didn't you let Pip grow the Hell up? That poor me, I'm a country peasant with no friends act got real tired real quick. Second question Where in his warped imagination did he get Ms. Havishom? News flash! Anyone who did so many terrible things because a man left her was mentally unstable before she met the jerk which explains why he left her. Oh and one more thing if your a feminists (like me) this book will get you upset enough. The only women in the book are either crazy old hags or out right bitches. It certainly says a lot about male Victorian sensibilities!!"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I looked forward to reading a classic of Dicken's. Like the title, Great Expectations were had, but not realized. None of the characters were likable, there was no character growth, and it rambled. I have taken great joy in reading Nathaniel Hawthorne, Mark Twain, and even Tolkien. At least Tolkien went on and on, it was with purpose and there was a point. Dickens' point was to say that life sucks and there is no point. In which case, what is the point of reading this book?"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"had to read this for school and found it very boring. unless you like things being dragged out then do not read this. good plot but overly explanitive."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"By far the worst literary blunder the world has ever excreted.

Avoid this book like the black plauge (another one of Europe's tragedies)."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I was force-fed this book in 2 weeks. I then failed the test over it, because in my fervent reading, I forgot to pay attention. The plot is too complex and the characters too numerous to enjoy just reading the book. The plot drags in places, then speeds in others. I remembered why I don't read Dickens."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Of all the negative reviews I read, the common theme is &quot;I didn't understand it.&quot; Or, &quot;I was forced to read...&quot; Truth is, it is a very solid novel; not the greatest, but very good and insightful. For those of you who claim not to understand this work, may I suggest a return to Winnie the Pooh? Give the book a chance, think a little about it, and you may be surprised."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I remember having to read this book when I was a sophomore in high school. At the time I hated the book with a blue passion. Basically becuz I didn't understand it. Just recently, I decided to give it another chance (fifteen or so years later) and could not put it down. Although Pip is the main character, I found my sympathies lying with Estella. So young, so beautiful... so hardened. Ms. Havisham, in her greedy bitterness, deprives Estella the chance of real emotion, real love. Although I believe Ms. Havisham realizes what she has done near the end of the story, it is much too late for Estella. The re-written ending, although it pulled at my heart-strings, didn't work for me. The original ending is the only logical, perhaps realistic, ending in light of the events that occur within the story. For you kids who are forced to read it, try it again in a few years. I know your perception will have changed."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I had to read Great Expectations for a class project. I looked at how many pages it was and froze; &quot;How am I ever going to finish this book?&quot; I thought. After about 30 pages I was hooked and read it in a week. The language is old, so if you're young read it with a dictionary, it helps a lot! Dickens did a great job of tieing everything together at the end, and you know he must of had some master plan on what was going to happen!"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Great expectations is not only a great story filled with mystery, drama and action. Great expectations is a book that points out the personality flaws in all of us. It examines relationships and how they function between individuals.

It boosted my vocabulary level up a great deal and contributed to my education. Thanks to Charles Dickens for writing this extrodinary book!"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"An extremely beautiful novel that displays human conflicts throughout its length. No wonder it is described as a timeless classic! I loved this book because it had such a greta plot, with all the relations surfacing at the end. The relationship between Pip and Estella is particularily interesting, especially the change at the end. This is a treasurable addition to any collection."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"A book that captivates the ideals of entertainment, Great Expectations is a novel that cannot be put down. Having previously read &quot; A Tale Of Two Cities &quot; for an English topic, I was dissatified with the quality of work that Dickens produced and did not understand the hype surrounding his works and the popularity of sales. Great Expectations has changed my view entirely, as Pip, the protagonist will always be a person that can be related to and felt for. The life of the protagonist experiences many facets of human education, and the outcome is satisfing to himself and to the reader. Dickens has created a true exploration of people and how and who we are. Each chapter ends on a twist and torments the reader into further readings. The life of Pip and the events and characters that involve him work fluently and emphasis this theme. Dickens commonly gives subtle hints of information for the reader to use in working out the complexities of the novel, sometimes leading in the right direction, and other times, in a misleading direction. This keeps the reader informed and eager to process all the facts to conclude their own opinions. The ending is truely &quot; warm-hearted &quot; and acts ideally to conclude the novel. A splendid book not to be neglected from any book collection."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"This may be Dickens' finest novel, for while it may lack some of the comic character that animates his other masterworks, it has a focus and coherence unseen elsewhere in his serial novels. Filled with memorable images and the pain of unrequited love and self-reproach, Dickens has invented a superb comment on wealth, on youth, and on life in general. (Youths forced to read it in high school may not understand the pain of looking back until later in life.)"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I, too, languished through this in High School. I, too, vowed never to pick up Dickens again. Then something happened. This is not bragging: it just happened. I grew up. Any intelligence I had mellowed into understanding, a very different faculty. Saddened, changed, I picked up Dickens again. And at last, I understood. Great Expectations isn't a classic for its language, plotting, style or wit. Like all Dickens' work, it is faulted in these areas. It's a classic because of Dicken's passion, which along with Bleak House pours onto the page and if you are at the right time of life, into your heart. So to all the reviewers here who find him problematic, wait a bit. Read a little about the nightmare world he lived in, the choked waterways slimey and poisonous with oil, feces and dye...the dangerous, airless shacks stacked up on each other, the rotten food...when it could be had at all. If you can, too, research a little into the social mores of the day, because what Dickens says about Victorian manners is quite true: virtue was often toggled to wealth in an absurd attempt to justify those unworthies clawing their way to the top of the &quot;Beehive&quot;. Try Dickens again later, when you have grown old. He's a ripping good yarn, but you must forgive him...he sees people as tiny valiant miracles amidst a roiling world of injustice, farcical posturing, physical danger, ignorance and want, and he needs to tell you about it. He often jokes about it, because the society he was writing for was very touchy and required its medicine to be sugar coated. It is only after you've put a Dickens book down that the images--minus the wit--pour over you and like the smoke curling through a Dickens novel it occurs to you you cannot breathe..."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Charles Dicken's novel, Great Expectations, teaches a lot to the reader. The best thing about the story is Dicken's development of plotting and characters. It is about a person who experiences grown and shattered expectations from childhood to teenagehood to adulthood. &quot;Great Expectations&quot; basically means what is &quot;expected&quot; in life: a job, a career, money, marriage, etc. Pip helps a convict, Magwitch, in the beginning, to escape by bringing him a file to file the convict's leg iron. In the second stage of Pip's expectations, Pip has always been thinking that his secret benefactor is a certain Miss Havisham (whom he met in childhood), because he thought that her daughter, Estella, was destined for him. At the end of this stage, the benefactor appears, and Pip finds that it is the convict whom he had helped so long ago!! He is filled with repugnance. And Estella also gets married to his most despised enemy. And he is deeply in debt. Pip's great expectations are shattered to pieces by all of this. Later, Pip has to deal with it in the third stage of his expectations, and the story ends with all the people around Pip married, but with Pip still single. But Estella's husband had done so much evil gambling, and he also died in a horse accident, leaving room for relief from Pip. So, the story isn't exactly a happy ending, but it's better than nothing. This is a GREAT book!!"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Almost every negative review about this book was made by a 15 year old 9th grader. I also had to read this book when I was in ninth grade and I had no clue what was going on. Those kids might not want to admit it, but it was above thier understanding, I am proof of that. I decided to read this again and even though I was indifferant to it the first time I read, and realized it to be the literary genuis that it truely is. It has an amusing story line of the events that surround a young boy's life and how he copes with his coming into fortunes and life in general. But Dicken's masterful writing makes more than just a story line, it is also a social critique of Industeralized Society. For existance, Joe represents how life was before the Industerial Revolution. He was kind, hard working, morally upstanding, and happy, amoung other desirable qualities. Whereas Estella, for example, represented how it was during the Industerial Revolution. She was greedy, self-centered, controlling, and unhappy. This is also evident in Pip. At first he had the traits of the former, but once he got his &quot;Expecations&quot;, he exhibited the traits of the latter. Another part of his critique was the differance between the rich and the poor. There are other important ways in which he portrays them, but for lack of time the poor people were happy, whereas the rich were unhappy. Dickens is also great at describing setting and characters, so as some might see that as boreing, I see that as giving more depth to the story. He makes it seem like the reader is actually in 19th century London and meeting such interresting characters as Jaggers, Mr. Pocket, and of course honorable Joe. Anyone concidering buying this that is in high school, I reccomend not buying this because you will not undersand it, hence dislike it. But anyone who is already out of high school, or someone who read it in high school I would reccomend this book. Dickens is well know in literary circles for his genuis, but for some reason I cannot explain, in popular culture he does not come close to the popularity of Shakesphere, even though he was writer and Social Critic."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"The way he describes everything from the eerie feeling he has in Ms. Havisham's room, to the smell of hay in the streets of London. Also the way everything connects together with the things you think are not important, an the way the book, sort of calms down at the end and explains everything that happens. This was a very hard book to read, so I would recomend Cliffs Notes with this, bot do NOT read the cliifs notes seperate! It ruins everything! Even if you hate classics, this is still one great book, I hate classics too, but still, it's very good. I had to read this for a freshman honor class exam, so not that I read this by choice, but i'm glad I did."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"It took me a little while to get into the story and get to know all the characters, but once I did I couldn't put the book down. Charles Dickens is a wonderful writer, and Great Expectations prooved it."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"A good read from start to finish, typically Dickens, one ofthe classics. A fine work."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"This is a novel of bitterly dashed hopes and people who still cling to their broken dreams, allowing them to rob the present of meaning. Pride and greed are shown to delude even the best of people, causing them to believe what they want, rather than the obvious facts. The characters are over-the-top, yet still drawn sympathetically, and are some of the most memorable figures in the whole of literature. This is Dickens' best work."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"One could not expect to get a decent review on this book from American youth who lack the culture, knowledge, and discipline to enjoy anything that is not a video game. Understanding Dickens, one must remember that he wrote his book in chapters which were printed as excerpts in popular magazines of the time. Compiling these excerpts together results in a lenghtier novel. Appreciate the author's ability to develop characters, to visually put the reader into 1800 Victorian England, and Dickens as a social justice advocate for the poor. If you're looking for extensive sex, violence, and meaningless dialogue and plot, watch American Television."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"This book was on my reading list for 9th grade, and it was my first Dickens novel ever. It took me about 3 days to read, and it was kind of a fluctuating thing. Some parts of it I couldn't put down, while other parts I dragged myself through. On the whole, I thought it was a good book, but not one I would read over again for a while. Dickens' use of figurative language is exquisite, but sometimes I found it hard to understand at first. The way almost every character described is tied some way into the tale is fantastic. You always have to pay attention, for you never know when that character might turn up again. This is such a tragic story already that I wish it would have ended a little better. I know it broke my heart. All in all, I would only recommend this book to someone who is in the mood for a complex tragedy."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Even though I'm only in High School, this book had a deep impact.

I couldn't put it down."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"My previous experience with Dickens is that I picked up A Tale of Two Cities, got about five pages, and then returned it to the library, yawning.Well, I finally decided that I would will myself through a Dickens novel. And I enjoyed it immensely. I can't say that the plot was especially thrilling -- nor the ending particularly satisfying. And yes, it is long, and if you just want to find out what happens, you won't find it to be of much interest. But what I like about the books is the attention to characters and details -- even ones that are almost irrelevant to the story -- but which kept kept me smiling and reading. In particular, his friend who is a clerk who has made his house TRULY to be his castle, complete with moat and drawbridge -- and who has an Aged Parent that had me laughing like crazy. The unexpected irony -- when Pip describes things to be such and so, but when it is clear to the reader to be much different -- I found to be wonderful. I felt that Dicken's had painted very strong visual elements -- by the end of the novel, I had very strong visual images of most of the characters and settings. I'm pleased to say that I have read a Dicken's novel and I truly enjoyed it."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"My daughter had to read this book for school and she said it was a great read. She is 14 and it was easy for her to understand and follow."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Like many other reviewers, I read this book because it is a requirement in many English classes. Although the plot becomes interesting at times, the majority of it is filler. The book is filled with pointless characters and chapters devoted to run-ons of Pip's thoughts.Because the book was written so long ago, it is also very difficult to connect with. The character relationships are annoying. The romance between Pip and Estella becomes very hard to believe, because Estella is not a likable person. And the dialect is very unbelievable. It is hard to picture someone using Joe's speech patterns, even in old English times.While there are probably many people who will enjoy this novel, I would not suggest this book to someone looking for a quick read (meaning high school students). It is very difficult to skim and requires alot of time to appreciate. If you have a lot of time on your hands and you enjoy long, character developing novels this book may be for you."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"This was an interesting book. It is the first book by Charles Dickens that I had ever read. The language was weird but that was because it was a British novel written in a different era. I enjoyed it though because it was a escape to a different era and time. I plan on reading several other works by this author. It was slow to start but only because I was not used to the writing style or language. I would recommend."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"The setting of this book is in the Elizabethian era. Class, titles, and wealth is veryimportant around this time period and Dickens shows the importance in this great novel.Another theme of this novel is that not everyhting is as it seems.The story starts with Pip(Philip Pirrip) at the graveyard. He went to visit his dead parentswhen all of a sudden he was snatched by an escaped convict. The convict threatened Pipsaying that he will slit his throat if Pip did not bring food, a drink and a file. Pip did whathe was told and felt guilty for helping the convict out for many years after.He is asked to play at Satis House where he meets Miss Havisham and the beautifulEstella. Pip hoped that Miss Havishams intentions were to make his fortune, make him agentleman and have Estella to wed. He was wrong, instead Miss Havisham's intentionswere for Pip to fall in love with Estella and then have his heart broken.After this dissapointment, Pip hears news that an anonymous benefactor wants to makePip a gentleman and give him a fortune. Pip believed that the anonymous benefactor wasMiss Havisham but instead it was the escaped convict that Pip helped when he was ayoung boy. It gets even more interesting when Pip finds out that Estella is the daughter ofthe escaped convict.This novel comes with interesting twists and great themes that can have a reader thinking,\\" whats going to happen next?\\" I recommend this novel to any reader who likes a greatstory."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"The reason I choose to write this review is quite simple: to tell of a great book that gets better every time you read it. The compelling twists of &quot;Great Expectations&quot; are very involved and makes for a book that not only comes off extremely in depth but also entertaining. I first read this book and high school and have since read it twice more. It seems the more knowledge I have gained the more I take out of each segment of this book as it is more closely tied into my real life.Simply put this is Dickens masterpiece and that should not be overlooked as many of his books were of extreme quality."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I liked the book Great Expectations, I thought it was very interesting to read. When I first found out that we ha to read it I didn't think i would like it at all but I did, once I got into the book.I thought it was hard to read. Sometimes I didn't get it but othere times I did and did think Charles Dickens made it easy to understand. I don't think he should have written so many characters becasue I lost track of who was who and where they were at. He should have written more to the ending, like what happend to Pip and Estella.I did like when Pip started realizing that just because you have money dosen't mean you can be mean to people like Joe and Biddy and everyone else that do't have as much as he does. I liked how toward the ending everything kind of came togeter; that's whenI really understood who was who. I really liked how all the characters were sonnected in some way like Magwitch, Estella, And Molly. Also Compeyson and Miss. Havisham."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"This is one of Dickens's better known classics, though not his best. The theme is worthy enough of study, though, and the reading is enjoyable. Recommended."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Great Expectations is one of Dickens less &quot;weighty&quot; novels. It is slow-moving and at sometimes tedious to read. While the setting and characters are developed well enough to draw you in to the story, the plot is quite unbelievable and the book sometimes tedious at times.The story is about Pip, a young working class boy who comes into great wealth because of a mysterious benefactor. He abandons his good old friends Joe and Biddy to follow his heart towards Ms. Havisham and her cruel daughter Estella. Also dragging along with him are Hubert, his friend and confidant, Magwitch, a filthy convict, Mr. Wopsle, a bad Shakespearean actor, Mr. Jaggers, a vindictive lawyer, Mr. Wemmick- Jagger's more amiable assistant, Molly, a servant with a mysterious past, and Old Orlick, whom you'll know all about at the end of the book.After my first go through, I gave this book a second chance to grow on me and read it again, but it didn't. Unless you are absolutely OBSESSED with Dickens,you are required to read it for a class, and/or you don't have anything to do over a weekend, then don't bother reading this book"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I found this book hard to read and hard to comprehend. The book is about a boy named Pip and his rise from lowly to gentlemanly status. Along the way, he manages to alienate his friends and he learns some valuable lessons about friendship in the end. The way the sentences are written and structured made it difficult for me to understand everything that was going on. Many of the sentences would be considered run-on today."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Dickens tells his story through the consequences of several secret, unsolicited acts of kindness.

As all of Dickens' tales do, this provides a look at life for the ordinary man in that time and place, England in the 19th century. It is also a parable about the worth of people as judged by their wealth, status and power vs. their character and more. It is filled with wonderful character studies that only Dickens could do: Miss Haversham, stunted and destroyed by her bitterness, in turn doing great damage to the beautiful, cold Estella. The star of the novel, the orphaned Pip, raised by his shrewish and abusive sister and her wonderful, loving and simple husband Joe, the friends Pip makes, etc. Mr. Prebble reads this great novel as no one else can. He brings the characters to life so I could feel their emotions. All of the characters had unique voices and suitable accents that matched them perfectly. I was particularly moved by his portrayal of Joe. By the way, Mr. Prebble's beautiful, very masculine voice does the female characters believably. One does not even think about it. Thank you, Mr. Prebble, for narrating this novel and providing me with the best Christmas I've had for a while."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I loved it! In fact I remember reading Great Expectations during a 7th grade English class and getting in trouble for not paying attention to what was being taught.

This was the first time I felt myself get lost in a book.

Yes, the English language has evolved since Dickens' day, so you'll be using the dictionary feature on your Kindle often. But Great Expectations transcends time to bring a very relatable story to modern readers. The mystery deepens at every turn, the characters develop more fully and, if you open your mind and relax, the book's a downright page-turner (or page-clicker, for Kindlers).I tried reading this classic when I was younger and less patient, but it took a 40+-year-old me to 'get' it. Perhaps young people need to experience life and the lessons we all learn to really appreciate Great Expectations. Perhaps they relate a little too much with the freshly made gentleman and don't really understand why he castigates himself for his behavior. Or perhaps they're just not patient enough to 'zen out' and enjoy the book for what it is. Whatever the reason, I sincerely hope the young people who hate this book today, will pick it up again when they're more 'seasoned' - then they might just understand why it's a classic.If this review gave you information that was helpful, please feel free to click the YES button below!"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Great & free down load to PC Kindle product; yes, Kindle has a free software download so that you can read their books on your PC too.

We would expect someone born into his social class to remain in this position forever, without much hope for improvements. However, Pip surprises us when he has a chance encounter with Miss Havisham, an old, grumpy, widow. She's obviously delirous, upset at men who have crossed her, and does take out some of her anger at poor Pip. But yet Pip is lucky behind his wildest dreams, for he is about to meet the beautiful Estella, and while this may appear normal, it is definitely not. And this is what makes &quot;Great Expectations&quot; a classic: the book is about Cinderella from reverse: it is the man, in this particular instance, who moves from working-class peasant to meeting an upper-class elegant lady who is beautiful beyong Pip's dreams.It is an aspiring tale in that it tells the reader that they, too, may be able to have widespread class mobility. They are not stuck in their present circumstances and may indeed exceed their own expectations.-- Michael GordonLos Angeles"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"First of all, I too am a student forced to read this book for a Freshman Honors English class, and I fail to see how many people can call this book a waste of time. Sure, I know the language is a bit of a challenge, but that's what a dictionary is for!Anyway, I haven't yet finished the book (I still have a long way to go,) for I'm only on chapter 13, but I had to chime in and counterattack what all of the rest of the whiney students have said. So far, the way Dickens portrays his characters (by means of language, description, and dialogue) seems ultimately realistic (it should be, considering it was written in the 1830's) and there are many things throughout the book one has to come to love: Pip's almighty guilty conscience, the friendship bond between Pip and Joe, etc.I can't sum up everything, for as I've said, I'm not finished yet, but for those of you who are being forced to read it, read it with an open mind.

Nicholas Nickleby is next for me..."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Certainly one of the most famous of Dickens's novels (right up there withOliver Twist (Penguin Classics)andDavid Copperfield (Penguin Classics)), Great Expectations follows a familiar coming-of-age narrative as young Phillip Pirrip - better known as \\"Pip\\" - negotiates the rocky road to adulthood in early 19th century London. One of only two of Dickens's novels that are written in first person narrative (the other being David Copperfield), Great Expectations is a fascinating tale of ambition, love, regret, missed chances and redemption, topped off with an adequately ambiguous ending (more on that later).Raised by his tyrannical sister and her kind, doting husband Joe, Pip is contented enough to become a blacksmith and live out his life by the misty Kent marshlands. That is until he is unexpectedly thrown into the path of two extraordinary people. The first is a convict, escaped from the prison barges offshore, a terrifying man who coerces the young Pip into stealing him some supplies from his sister's larder. Stricken by guilt and terror, Pip complies. The second is the mysterious Miss Havisham, a spinster woman who employs Pip as a playmate for her young ward, the beautiful Estella. Estella is regal, snobbish and cold - naturally, Pip falls head over heels in love with her, despite the realization that she's far beyond his status. Wretchedly aware of his own shortcomings, Pip yearns for a chance to make a gentleman of himself, and win the hand of fair Estella.And then, just as unexpectedly, fortune is thrown his way. He is informed by Miss Havisham's lawyer that a secret benefactor has endowed him with great expectations, and that he is to travel to London in order to prepare for his future. The only catch is that Pip is forbidden from investigating the origins of his newfound fortune, although logic dictates that it must be Miss Havisham, who surely has designs for both Pip and Estella. Locked up in a house full of bitter memories after she was jilted by her lover, Miss Havisham is certainly one of Dickens's most famous creations, with her own disturbing brand of revenge against mankind: to unleash her prot&eacute;g&eacute;e Estella out upon the world, to break hearts wherever she goes.Dickens has created a twisty and labyrinthine plot, with plenty of intrigue and adventure throughout, as familial bonds, secret alliances and loyalty among friends and work colleges are tried and tested. In typical Dickensian style, there are several extraordinary coincidences concerning shrouded parentage and wayward meetings, but everything hangs so well together that it's instantly forgivable. \\"Great Expectations\\" is Dickens at his best in terms of plotting and characterization; though there is a melancholy twinge throughout that no doubt stems from Dickens's personal trouble (he had recently divorced his wife, and has carrying on a stress-filled love affair with a young actress). As such, romanticized domestic bliss that so often concludes a Dickens's novel (reflective of Dickens's own longing for such a state) is completely absent here. The domestic angel-woman that is given so many names and forms throughout the canon of Dickens novels (here called Biddy, though she is virtually identical to dozens of other Dickens heroines) comes to a surprising end in \\"Great Expectations\\", as does Pip himself.Pip himself is certainly an interesting character; in that he is woefully aware of his own shortcomings, yet unable drop certain attitudes that make him miserable. After becoming accustomed to the life at Miss Havisham's manor house, he is frustrated to find that he now holds his beloved brother-in-law Joe in contempt, embarrassed at his low breeding and lack of gentlemanly manners (despite the fact that Joe was always his staunch ally against Pip's terrible sister, and the epitome of the virtuous commoner). Likewise is Pip's self acknowledgment that his love for Estella never brings him any happiness, only pain and longing. The fact that Pip is narrating his own story from a point in time *beyond* the proceedings mean that we are never overly critical of Pip, considering he is his own harshest critic when relating his behaviour - and it certainly makes you consider your own shortcomings.This is not to say that the whole story is woe and misery, as there are plenty of comedic characters that help lighten the mood, such as Pip's best friend Herbert Pocket, who (at their first meeting) challenges him to a fight, and Mr Wemmick, who survives his job by assuming two personalities: a grim and dour one during working hours, and a cheerful one when he returns home. There are several moments of humour in Pip himself, (though they are usually tempered by a sense of disappointment or miscommunication) such as his misreading of his parent's gravestone, or his excitement in reaching London gradually dissipating when he realizes that...well, that it's a bit of a hole.Last of all, there has already been several mentions in other reviewers about the fact that there are two endings to this novel; the first was considered too melancholy by Dickens's publishers, and so was revised (although to be fair, Dickens's himself didn't seem to put up too much of a fight, suggesting that he himself was divided on the issue). The published ending is still ambiguous, yet with room for hope (at least in the mind of Pip) as to the future with Estella. Now, most agree that the original ending is more powerful, and I have to agree. However, I do issue a warning *not* to read both endings in the same sitting. In my edition the original ending was added in an appendix directly after the conclusion to the book, and because it is so drastically different to the published ending, it disrupted my appreciation of the novel. I was left in two minds as to what truly happened. So if you're a serious reader, do yourself a favour and decide what ending you want to go with *before* you finish the book. It may be a tricky business, but it'll enhance your enjoyment of one of Dickens's best novels."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Dickens' ability to turn a beautiful phrase is done complete justice by Michael Page. He delivers all that Dickens intends for you to find in Great Expectations, as though he was Pip's shadow for those many years described in the story. This CD set is worth listening to; I looked for chances to get in the car and continue the story."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"When his magazine, All the Year Round, began failing due to an unpopular serial, Dickens was forced to begin publishing installments of a story of his own. The resulting work, Great Expectations, was published weekly from December 1, 1860 to August 3, 1861. This was his second semi-autobiographical work, but where David Copperfield was a confident expression of faith in middle class values, Great Expectations offers a bleaker view of whether those values will lead to happiness. In fact, Dickens own marriage had just come to an end after many unhappy years. Indeed he had recently changed the name of the magazine from the more bucolic Household Words. Despite, or because, of this ambivalence, Great Expectations became one of his greatest achievements.Pip, a boy of the marshes, is being &quot;raised by hand&quot; by his shrieking harridan of an older sister and her seemingly doltish husband, the blacksmith Joe Gargery. One day, while visiting his parents' gravesite, Pip is accosted by an escaped convict who demands that he bring him a file and some &quot;wittles&quot;. When the convict, Abel Magwitch, is later captured, he accepts the blame for stealing the file and food before being carted back to prison.Shortly thereafter, Pip is invited up to Miss Havisham's manor house to play with her beautiful ward Estella. Miss Havisham's life came to a halt when she was jilted at the altar, all clocks are stopped at the hour of her betrayal, the feast lies rotting on tables &amp; she wanders about in the decaying wedding gown. Estella is to be the instrument of her revenge upon men.Eventually, &quot;Great Expectations&quot; are settled upon Pip when a secret benefactor sets up a trust in his name and sends him to London to be educated and become a gentleman. Pip assumes, and Havisham allows him to believe, that she is his benefactress and that he is being elevated to a position that will make him worthy of Estella.As Pip rises in society, he leaves Joe behind, despite the many kindnesses Joe had shown him growing up. He becomes a shallow arrogant middle class climber. So he is stunned when he discovers that he is actually benefiting from the secret wealth of Magwitch, who made a fortune in Australia after being transported. Moreover, Magwitch's unlawful return to England puts him and Pip in danger. Meanwhile, Estella has married another, a horrible man who Pip despises. Eventually, with Magwitch's recapture and death in prison and with his fortune gone, Pip ends up in debtors prison, but Joe redeems his debts and brings him home. Pip realizes that Magwitch was a more devoted friend to him than he ever was to Joe and with this realization Pip becomes, finally, a whole and decent human being.Originally, Dickens wrote a conclusion that made it clear that Pip and Estella will never be together, that Estella is finally too devoid of heart to love. But at the urging of others, he changed the ending and left it more open ended, with the possibility that Estella too has learned and grown from her experiences and her wretched marriages.This is the work of a mature novelist at the height of his powers. It has everything you could ask for in a novel: central characters who actually change and grow over the course of the story, becoming better people in the end; a plot laden with mystery and irony; amusing secondary characters; you name it, it's in here. I would rank it with A Tale of Two Cities, Oliver Twist and David Copperfield among the very best novels of the worlds greatest novelist.GRADE: A+"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I listened to the unabridged audio tape version of this book narrated by Michael Page. It's one of those deals where you listen to each tape entirely on the left channel, then play the whole tape again on the right channel to get the next part of the story. Which is kind of awkward, since you forget which channel you were on if you also use your stereo for music; but these editions are probably the least expensive (by the hour) audio tapes you can buy.I think Dickens' tendency toward exhaustive descriptions works a lot better when you're listening to it in the car than when you're reading it in print. I might never have had the patience to read the actual book while sitting in a chair, but listening to it in the car was pretty entertaining. Colorful characters, humor, suspense, unexpected plot twists; I can picture a lot of it in my mind even now.

This edition has the 1986 introduction by John Irving. It contains the Dickens classic in its intact form, with the original ending following it separately. It is 528 pages.When Dickens first wrote Great Expectations, it had a different ending. There are some who feel that the original ending is more in line with modern tastes, and that Dickens \\"caved in\\" by changing the unhappy ending to one that was \\"more acceptable.\\" Some feel that Dickens went too far in order to cater to his audience rather than stick to a literary standard. In the introduction, Irving discusses this issue among many others and suggests that Dickens was not so much driven by the audience as he was in touch with their lives when it came to inspiration. Ideas in literature may seem fantastic and improbable, but Irving points to events in Dickens's life that would seem equally improbable had they appeared in fiction. He also mentions modern real life events that, if put in a novel a decade earlier, would have seemed impossibly unrealistic.Yes, Dickens was an optimist. But the new ending is not a \\"happily ever after\\" one so much as one that leaves the door open.

The narrator, who is also the main character, addresses you directly and colours the whole story with his own amiable personality. Indeed, one can imagine that the novel, published in instalments in that long bygone era before radio, television and other non-printed media, was conceived to be read out loud in the family parlour.The characters are straightforward, captivating and likeable. Totally removed from any realistic complexity, they are all the more memorable: nave, honest Pip; distant, cold, condescending Estella; devoted, loyal, simple-minded Joe; mysterious, ethereal Miss Havisham; etc.The plot, convoluted, wholly implausible and a tad predictable, evokes harsher but so much simpler times. Though by no means a cliff-hanger, the work is suspenseful and the reader's interest is expertly sustained throughout.Extremely well written, peppered with tongue in cheek humour, this archetypal novel is strongly recommended to any audience, particularly in audio form."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I needed to purchase 3 books at one time for my daughters high school assignment, I was given a \\"short\\" notice.

It is an exceptional book that well demonstrates the genius of Charles Dickens. Not only does it have suspense and charm of romance and adventure, but it delivers thematically a look at the hypocracy of wealth in Elizabethan England, and a philosophical perspective on the meaning of happiness. In the end of course there is the climax with every bizarre plot twist imaginable. It is true, this is not necessarily a happy one: Pip gains happiness at the end only by learning by immense misfortune to himself and others, and by having his &quot;expectations&quot; crash down upon him, nearly destroying his future. Yet, this novel is an essential read for anyone, no matter how old or young because it still retains its meaning as freshly today as it did when it was written. It's only unfortunate that it's wasted on all of these people who don't bother to take the time to actually to try and comprehend what they're reading and who have consequently made such poor reviews."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I'm here referring to the Oxford World's Classics edition, published in 1999. Firstly, I love the book itself. It's compact, the pages have a soft, easy feel to them, and the print is a welcome size: smaller but very readable. A+ here.The characters are particular and animate. Through the use of his famously detailed characterization and description, Dickens creates an elaborate colorful neighborhood of which you feel part. A+ for this escapism and for the sheer pleasure it brings. I especially admire his keen sense of the droll. However, while the tale runs well through the first half or so, as it progresses -- did you find so also? -- it loses the intact sympathies of the reader by trying to connect all the dots that its intricate plot has spun out into. It's forever tying its own shoes. I was similarly disappointment in the final denouement of Estella and Pip, as a let down and overly cerebral. (B-) But I highly recommend this book as a good Dickens novel, and on its own terms, a great one.A very fun read!"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Great Expectations, a book that Dickens ironically considered as one of his \\"little pieces.\\" Though it is small compared to other works by Dickens, what this novel lacks in size it makes up for in quality. Great Expectations succeeds beyond almost all novels of its time in exploring the roots of character and moral behaviour. Charles Dickens makes the case for there being the potential for good and evil within everyone. Evil and sin follow from a combination of being self-absorbed and selfish. What is remarkable about the way these themes are handled is that they are clearly based on an assessment of human psychology, long before that field was established. The book is also remarkable for its many indelibly memorable and complex characters. Miss Havisham, Pip, Magwitch, Mr. Jaggers, and Estella are certainly some of the most complex characters ever created by Dickens.Though a novel founded on philosophic concepts, the story is full of action to keep the plot moving. An escaped convict, an attempted murder, and a mysterious benefactor all add to the sense of mystery that exists throughout most of the novel and forces the reader to continue. Murder, deceit, jealously, and revenge also help to hold the attention of the reader while Dickens explores the depths of human nature.As you read Great Expectations, raise your expectations (sorry, I couldn't help myself) to assume that you will receive answers to any dangling thread. Every detail is important, if not to solve the mysteries of the characters then only to enhance the \\"sense of place.\\" Although the England described here is long gone, it becomes as immediate as a nightmare or a dream that you have just awakened from.This story by Dickens is a must-read and deserves five-stars."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"The great English master is at his best in &quot;Great Expectations.&quot; This is a story about loyalty, trust, and, this being Dickens, dark overtones of the human nature. One should not expect something for nothing, that is what this novel makes perfectly clear. Pip, who is the central figure of the novel, a good-natured boy growing up into adulthood, expects to be continously favored by fotrune and his mysterious benefactor who, he thinks, is acting out of the goodness of her heart. Along the way he meets a cast of character who represent the entire range of human nature: devotion, strength, treachery, level-headedness, and brutality.&quot;Great Expectation&quot; is a classic because of its relentless exposure of truth about the human condition--the condition in which decency and sanity are maintained at a high price, and innocence not at all."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I imagine many of the negative ratings are from high school students forced to read the classics, and this book is one of those undisputed classics. Why else would every student I've talked to have had to read this book? Me included.I must confess I didn't like it in high school. Dickens does have a way of writing elegant sentences conjoined by semicolons. A great editor would have told him frequent use of periods is acceptable.However, eight years later, while frustrated at my illiteracy in Japan, I was starved for great literature in English. I had gone through a couple of contemporary literature that always left me vaguely dissatisfied. I started reading my favorite author Jane Austen again, and picked up Great Expectations on a whim. What a difference those eight years made!!No one can touch Dickens ability to evoke an atmosphere. I felt I was right there with Pip in the foggy marshes, shivering before a menacing Magwitch. Or sitting around the fire of a small but cozy house while Joe was smoking his pipe and passing along nuggets of his own brand of wisdom. Or creeped out in Mrs. Havisham's mausoleum of a mansion.In addition, the dialogue is so authentic you feel as if you're eavesdropping on people's conversations. Joe's working class speech, Mrs. Havisham's upper class diction, the lawyer's dry speech all ring so true.Ultimately, the story itself is so carefully constructed, even after countless rereadings, the clues in this mystery of who Pip's benefactor is are barely perceptible. And Dickens' themes of human pride, ultimate humility, willfulness of character that only later realizes the consequences, and the six degrees of separation are priceless. Dickens' championing of the working class pervades all his books, but in this one his affection for the working man is more personal. You really can't help but love Joe and his bungling dignity.Yes, Dickens can border on the excessively dramatic. But most of the time this drama works to pull you into a touching tale."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Having seen the many reviews written by students, I must say that I would agree. In fact, they sounded like they could have almost been my students from the past. Overall, GE is well liked, but the major complaint most have is that the story line is too slow-developing. I think this is a fair assessment. Of course, this was the style chosen by Dickens since this book was compiled from serial form. How many people would claim that we ought to take a week's worth of a soap opera program and turn it into a movie? I doubt such a production would attract much attention. In the same way, a serial writer's objective was to build mini-climaxes throughout the book, twisting and turning to get the audience to scream with anticipation, so that the next segment would sell. From what I understand, Americans could hardly wait for the shipments to get off the ships. They would purchase the newest segment and immediately dig in!If you are a teacher, I highly recommend showing the 4-hour movie starring Anthony Hopkins (produced in the late 1980s, I believe). It is the best and most accurate of all the GE movies. This works really well in conjunction with the book, and it truly helps in the interest level for those students who are not as motivated as &quot;the readers.&quot; So go ahead and find out about the adventures of squeezable Pip, lovable Joe, the mysterious Miss Havisham, sweet Biddy, snooty Estella, and of course the mysterious Magwitch. I think you will be as surprised as I was when I first read it.

Pip was a highly interesting character. out of all the books i was ever forced to read in my life this one is hands down the BEST BOOK EVER."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Great Expectations by Charles Dickens is a superb book! I must admit that it is a tad wordy and the details are overwhelming, but that just adds character to the book. My favorite characters were Estella, Biddy, and of course, Pip. Many poeple my age (I am 15) have said that this book was a long and boring ramble. I thought it to be exciting and very funny. I especially enjoy the part where Joe visits Pip in London and he has no place to put his hat, so he puts it on the mantle. During their meal, Joe's hat keeps falling, and Joe keeps picking it up. Finally, Pip gets so annoyed, he throws the hat across the room!

Little does he know how his whole existence is to complete the life of another--a stooping savior.Though of little social significance, Pip lives a content life full of innocent happiness and simple joys. As his horizon suddenly expands with an unexpected fortune, Pip finds his own path crossed with the paths of a misanthropic Miss Havisham and her young, beautiful, yet seductive ward Estella. Extravagance feeds Pip's vanity to burgeon, desire flourishes his motives of becoming some one he can never become. Pip strives desperately to extricate from the deepest root of his whole being. And the obsession grows for Estella as he wanders of further away from his true path.Followed by the death of Magwitch, love once again awakes within Pip as he embraces the man hidden in the darkest corner of his soul.

Along the storyline, Dickens inserts several points that man has several sides.

Charles Dickens, develops a plot that portrays true life in the 19th century. Pip undergoes several events that reveal the true motives of life, the happiness in true love and the curse of wealth.The audience can easily relate to the overall theme of Great Expectations, the familiarity of the sycophant, ambitous characters enable the reader to apply the concepts to their own life. This novel, in all its intensity is filled with details that make reading enjoyable and very realistic. Personally, I enjoyed this novel very much, its is a great book to read becasue it reminds a person of the immense value of the simple, loving things in life."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Thirteenth of Dicken's four major novels, Great Expectations has the most dramatic and gripping start that unfolds a story that drives eagerly forward, full of emotion and humor and many unforgettable characters. As a kid, we had this book on our Literature List and every time we had to write down the answers of Literature tales, it was rather strenuous and boring as this meant to be a part of education. However, when it came to conduct a teaching class in literature, Great Expectation turned out to be an adventure. Unlike Oliver Twist and David Copperfield, Pip is not really a hero and also it does not end a Happy ending but Pip is being stripped of his wealth and his position in society. Pip is sent to London to be educated as a gentleman, he is impressed by the wrong people for the wrong reasons. He neglects and abandons the honest, hardworking folk who care for him and his pride is hurt when he learns who his mysterious benefactor is. Pip express guilt for his behavior who have a violent nature and crude ways but altogether he is courageous too. Pip, his father surname being Pirrip and his Christian name Philip, that's how he is called \`Pip' , has a fascination for Estella but is brought up by Miss Havisham to wreck revenge on all male sex and break hearts. Herbert Pocket is a character who has frankness was amiable and cheerful who became a friend of Pip. Dicken's novels have a central theme \`rags-to-riches' tale of a poor, underprivileged boy who is finally accepted into society. Strangely, this one has a different end. A nice read and great pick for Classroom Literature workshop."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"When i first red the book in the highschool i've looked through like Pip. But after some years, when i'm reading it again, now i can see it like Dickens do... It's a novel that anybody can selfexplain on any time of his life. If not, he's very lucky..."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"It's a shame that most people resign this book to their \\"having already been read\\" list as a result of this novel being assigned coursework in junior high or high school. Dickens was a master of depicting subtleties of human relationships and personalities. Great Expectations illustrates this gloriously. Whatever can be said of Pip, is that he is abashedly a hopelessly human character. I sincerely can't imagine a young reader to identify with the maturity of these character's substantive familiarities with one another. Please don't write this book off, because you feel as if you already know the plot line and story because you read it young, I guarantee, read as an adult, this celebrated novel will take on a whole new light when you have been out in the world and experienced the complexities of the human condition."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I respect the point of view of the reader who said that he/she can't add much to the opinion of countless generations who read this classic for the past 150 years. Classics last this long because they're masterpieces, and hence this work deserves five stars.The only thing to add in my point of view, is that I won't be surprised to learn that Dickens wrote this story especially for school boys who are really struggling to identify themselves and determine what is really important in life. No wonder this is one of the most required readings in middle school. In other words, adults won't find in it a mature story like the one in Steinbeck's East of Eden, or the taboo-sex theme of Nabokov's Lolita. This is about a young boy who goes on a long journey and ends up finding himself and realizing what really gives him happiness in life.As for the ending, there are two endings; published and unpublished, and I like the published more. Don't read further for I will give the ending away, unless you've read it already, but in the last paragraph Pip says that the mist of the evening when he held hands with Estella reminds him with the morning mist when he left the forge. The way I see it is that Estella will go through the same journey that Pip went through when he left the forge and went to London, the journey that was initiated by Estella's father and that helped Pip to be a better man. Now Estella will go through a journey initiated and guided by Pip in order to make Estella a better woman. Magwitch hurt Pip in the beginning but Pip helped him so Magwitch gave him all his money. The money was gone but was left was more important than money: The journey and experience that made Pip a better man. Estella was mean to Pip, but Pip loved her, and destiny put them both on a crossroads at the end of the novel, but because Pip loves Estella and because she is Magwitch's daughter, Pip decided to walk with her in a journey that will make her a better woman.Magwitch and Estella, father and daughter, never met. But there was a link between them; Pip, who became a better man because of the father, and who will now pay him back by making his daughter a better woman. Great Expectations is about the magical and ironic links between people, and how the person who you think hurt you the most may end up to be the person who helped you the most. The fact that an evil man is not as evil as he seems, and a pure man is not as pure as he seems.And these are just few of the many other themes in this classic. So the bottom line is, this novel may be more meaningful to the middle school son than to the forty something father. Read it early before you get older!"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Victorian society got a good spanking when Great Expectations was published, at the time Dickens's anger and frustration was at one of its highest points. Pip, the novel's protagonist - I hesitate to call him the hero - is at once likeable and recognizable as a powerful symbolic tool, though the former quality intentionally decreases as the novel progresses.Pip is joined by a cast of the most memorable characters in literature - the cold, ethereal Estella, the crazy, wounded Miss Havisham, loveable dullard Joe, whip-smart lawyer Jaggers - the list could, and possibly might, go on for pages. If there were literary awards for Best Ensemble, the characters in Great Expectations would clinch them all. The characters function as both political/social symbols and, though they exist in a time period far removed from us, identifiable and memorable figureheads that will - and should - be a literary hallmark forever."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I first read this about 12 years ago as a teenager in High School of course at the time I could not possibly comprehend everything that is going on. On a whim I decided to reread this novel and am very happy that I did, Pip, Joe, Estella, Mrs Havisham all these charecters are so colorful and well written it amazes me. This novel covers a diverse collection of human emotions such as love, friendship, loyalty, shame, and forgiveness. If the only time you read this it was mandatory reading for freshman english do yourself a favor and pick it up again and reread it I found it very worthwhile."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Many reviewers have called this Dickens' greatest novel. One reviewer says it was the first time a character's feeling had been explored in such detail. These things I cannot comment on - this is the first Dickens novel I ever read, and I am not familiar with other works of this period. I can say that it was a damn fine read though.I must admit, maybe it was a convention of the time, but there were a great many impossible coincidences in this story. The term &quot;soap opera&quot; even crossed my mind at one point. In the end I forgave these improbable coincidences because the story was so compelling, and the novel so old, and the author of legendary repute.I loved the saint-like character Joe. I think he was my favorite character. And Dickens does a masterful job of showing the friendship between Pip - the protaganist - and Joe and especially Herbert. Miss Havisham is the picture of the bizarre rich recluse. And Estella the epitome of the cold-hearted shrew. All of the characters are rich.And it is true, as many other reviewers have commented, that so many issues are explored in this work. The meaning of true love, genuine friendship, the implications of &quot;moving up&quot; and it's effects on family and friends, good fortune, redemption, etc. It's all there - life is there.The book was slow at certain parts, but most of the time I found myself eagerly turning the pages. Dickens is a master at compelling his reader to turn the pages. What will happen next? At some of the titanic coincidences and plot turns I found myself thinking, &quot;what?! You've got to be kidding me...&quot; and then begging for more. I think you will too.There are some deeply heartfelt moments. Deeply heartfelt, touching, that inspired warm feelings in me. It was a pleasant change of pace from the darker, more cynical literature of today (though there are evil people and violent actions in Great Expectations as well). The final lesson of redemption is truly heartwarming."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"This is my favorite book. I've read it at least 6 times, and it is still a wonderful story. Dickens makes you feel what little Pip feels on the unexpectedly interesting journey of his life. From his childhood encounter with an escaped convict to a mysterious rise to riches and fame later in life, I am completely immersed in his story. The tale of his love for a girl named Estella who, not only will never love him, but emotionally tortures him every day of his life is heartbreaking yet somehow familiar. There are subtle lessons to be learned from this book. If you haven't already read it, you should."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I got a few classics for the kindle app, can't go wrong with ant classics in my opinion!

Great Expectations is about the unexplicable evil youth encounters and how one should rise above the hate and vindictiveness of stupid, petty people. It is a book that explains that there is great suffering in the world and there are those that will hate you for no other reason than that you look the way you do, or simply for the fact you exist in the form you are, or have the ancestors you have. And this hate may never be fully exposed, but be there none-the-less, lingering in mysterious shadow and never seen. An honest read of this book by my ninth graders allowed some, who felt anger and self-pity in the form of vengful hate, to rise a little out of their cycle of dispare. The greatest revenge, some say, against your oppressor is to live happily. The book shows how a vengeful heart is so self mutilating and unfulfilling. Great Expectations runs the coarse of someone who managed to forgive. It is a moving book and one that gives inner strength and respectful grace and recognition to the divine in all of us. It is better to not get bogged down in a discussion of Dicken's personal life, which is a mixed bag, but just read the book. Why would ultra feminists hate this book? Because they hate. Hateful people will hate a book that so poignantly exposes these wreched people for what they are. The book also shows, most significantly, and contrary to much of the belief of the time, that bad people can reform and become good. The significance of this, and its effect that Dicken's made upon this notion, is as haunting and deep a goodness as the evil Mrs. Havisham placed in Stela's soul."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Great expectations is a very good book. It has action and a meaning. The book starts off by pip, which is a young orphan boy, going to a graveyard to look at his parent's tombstone. Then a escape convict grabs pip and tells him to bring him food and a file for his chains. The next day pip brings the man what he wants and then police capture the man but he protects pip and says he stole the food because he is touched by pips kindness. Then one-day pip is taken to the satis house, the home of miss Havisham, pip meets a beautiful young girl named Estella and falls in love with her. One-day Jaggers who is a lawyer tells pip that he has received a great fortune from a secret benefactor. The man tells pip he must go to London immediately to start his education as a gentleman. Pip thinks miss Havisham has given him the fortune. When pip is in London he finds new friends and begins to treat his old friends coldly, especially Joe. Several years later a familiar face comes in to pips room it is the convict, Magwitch. He then tells pip that he is pips benefactor. Pip then agrees to help him escape London. Compeyson is pursuing Magwitch and pip later finds out that Compeyson is the one who left miss Havisham on the alter and that Estella is Magwitch's daughter. Pip begins to care for the convict but later Pip hears that Estella has married another man. When Pip goes to visit miss Havisham she catches on fire and is burned badly. During the escape attempt Pip and Magwitch are capture by police. Magwitch is sentenced to death and Pip loses his fortune. He gets back together with Joe and later ends up marrying Estella and living happily ever after. I think that the author of this book could have made this book in 3rd person instead of 1st and it could have made it better. I think that this book was well writen had had a good message of dont let money go to your head and know who your true friends are. I recommed this book to anybody."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"It may be difficult to rehabilitate Dickens from the reputation assigned to him by his critics, such as his being labelled as a spinner of popular yarns; a prime representative of Victorian strait-laced morality; a notoriously verbose prosaist whose writing teems with rhetorical redundancies and digressions; a careless plotter and over-plotter with a propensity for hyperbolic and grotesque comedy, depicting grim and depressing situations peopled by caricatures and abnormally exaggerated personages. The criticism that he commits a number of unforgivable Freudian flaws cannot so easily be obviated as well. Unlike the more firmly established exponents of the realist novel, such as Stendhal, Balzac and Dostoevsky, with their searching psychological assessments of character and motive, Dickens seems concerned mainly with evoking the idea of a certain character and not the character itself in its concrete, three-dimensional actuality. This explains his penchant for caricature. Nevertheless, his ability to present concrete characters is illustrated in &quot;Great Expectations&quot;, one of his later and finer works, particularly the characters of Pip and the convict Magwitch, who are psychologically profound and sympathetic portrayals in comparison to the host of other characters. His ability as a profound satirist and social critic is conclusively demonstrated by his interweaving his analysis of class, injustice and crime with the narrative. Pip, who finds himself elevated from his humble origins to one of the highest strata of society, by being made into a gentleman by a mysterious benefactor, is shocked to discover that this same benefactor, the agent of his social progress, is a despicable criminal who offends him by his sight. The message is obvious: society is a complex network of interrelations that interpenetrate class divisions; Miss Havisham is jilted by Compeyson, who is Magwitch's accomplice; Magwitch is the benefactor of Pip, who is in love with Estella, Magwitch's daughter. All, Dickens seems to say, are equal, regardless of their class or origin, before the judgement of God, which transcends human judgement. This is memorably brought out in the courtroom scene, during Magwitch's trial, in the description of the shaft of light that illuminated the room, \\"between the two-and-thirty [prisoners] and the Judge, linking them both together and perhaps reminding some among the audience, how both were passing on with absolute equality, to the greater Judgement that knoweth all things and cannot err.\\" Dickens's moral is the necessity of human fellowship, which we see lacking in the dehumanised Jaggers and Wemmick and in Estella and Miss Havisham, who both come to tragic or regrettable ends, through their coldheartedness and pitilessness. This quality, Dickens's use of plot coincidences to deliver profound human statements, partially redeems him from the charges of being a mere popular storyteller or a romanticist. In this respect, and also with regard to his verisimilitude in rendering authentic detail, he invites comparison with the great realists, such as Flaubert and Joyce, the masters of radical and even amoral realism, though Dickens, with his undisguised moralising, his chaste heroes and puritanical heroines, does not sit comfortably amongst these two; both of whom had works banned, one for his apparent frankness, the other for his obscenity and scatology. &quot;Great Expectations&quot; remains, however, as one of the great representatives of the realist, or social, novel, the product of an age that abolished serfdom and slavery, that witnessed the Industrial Revolution, the growth of large towns and the expansion of business enterprise. as such, it is an invaluable document of its time."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"A classic British novel written by Charles Dickens, Great Expectations, is a great novel with a very good moral at the end.

Also, the cover does not press an image of the characters or setting onto you, and allows you to picture your own Pip or Estella. Other editions of this book might not give you so many resources and be so reader-friendly. I am glad that I was forced to read this book, because I would have never read it on my own, or I would have quit after the first book---- which is a little boring, but reveals some very important facts to develop the intricate and complex plot. Isn't it great how everything ties up so nicely in Dickens? Read this book, but make sure never to question the genius of Dickens... putting you halfway to sleep before dropping a bomb and putting a huge plot into action.

The book starts out when he is 8 years old and he is in a grave yard when an escaped convict comes up to him and demands that he get him some food and a file, so he can get out of his ankle cuffs. Pip does as he is asked and doesn't tell a sole like he had sworn too. The story then continues to follow Pips life as he gets older.This book is an English novel written by Charles Dickens. Charles Dickens wrote many books, of which a couple are required reading by English classes. Great Expectations is a well written book in which the surroundings, characters and noises are well described. Although Great Expectations is well written I feel that the story is a little slow to pick up and, it is hard to become engrossed into the book because it seems a little monotone. In later chapters you can also guess at what might be coming next.Great Expectations though slow to pick up, does have a good, solid story line and can be entertaining to read once you pass the first chapter. This would not be a good book for people who like action books or books with a lot of twists and turns that keep you reading to see what comes next. But if you like a slower paced book with maybe a hint of love in it with a less gripping more predictable out come then Great Expectations would be a good pick."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Well, unlike the multitudes in America, I was NOT forced to read \\"Great Expectations\\" in high school or at any other time. However, lately it seemed like it was time to pick up this old classic and to dig into its treasures.The story starts out with an unlikely scene in a graveyard in a small English village. There we meet a little boy named Pip, who is visiting the gravesites of both of his parents. There we also meet a desperate convict who is cowardly enough to scare the little boy half to death in order to get some food and other items. Pip - an earnest, battered little orphan being raised by his sister and brother-in-law - anxiously sets out to please this convict. And so starts the tale of Pip's life.After the convict scene, Dickens takes his time in setting up exactly what Pip's life was like as he was groomed to take his brother-in-laws place as the blacksmith in the town. Dickens' genius for wit, along with some very likeable characters, help pull the reader through the endless pages of details and slow action.Soon, however, Pip's fortunes change...and then they change again...and then yet again. Yet, while the storyline somewhat resembles a roller coaster, the pacing is so slow that one is never overwhelmed by the action. In fact, I was rather underwhelmed by the amount of action there was for the number of words I was reading.Even so, I would say that this book is worth the effort. Dickens explores human nature of an average man when beset by a number of unusual situations, each one building on the last. Pip is likeable in these scenarios because he is never obnoxiously perfect or unaffected by his changing fortunes. In some ways, he \\"learns his lesson\\" by the end. In others, he does not.While Dickens tackles some rather weighty issues in this book, he does so in his distinctive, chipper, witty manner. Thus, one never really understands the emotional depths that the characters experience due to either their oppressive or their opulent fortunes.

That convict has escaped with another, his enemy convict. They are captured in the end but the convict whom Pip aided gives Pip 2pounds and a shilling by his fellow convict later on.Then, Pip is taken to a rich lady, Miss Havisham&iexcl;s and meets proud and heartless Estella whom he falls in love with. Born in a quite a poor family in the country, he tries to be clever so that Estella does not call him common, and quite succeeds. And plus, fortune lays itself in his way by an unknown rich person. A lawyer, Mr. Jaggers knows the provider of the fortune but does not tell Pip who it is because the provider&iexcl;s wish is to let him/herself known when he/she is ready for it. And Pip goes off to London.In London, Pip is introduced to Mr. Matthew Pocket, a relation of Miss Havisham for Mr. Pocket is to be Pip&iexcl;s tutor. Pip lives with Mr. Pocket&iexcl;s son Mr. Herbert Pocket whom he had met before at Miss Havisham&iexcl;s when a child, and becomes very acquainted with him. His other acquaintance is Mr. Wemmick, who works for Mr. Jaggers. He has a different life at work and at home, that makes him peculiar. All this time Pip thinks that the &iexcl;unknown provider&iexcl; of his fortune is doubtlessly Miss Havisham and thinks that she wants Estella and him to be married. However, he finds out that in fact it is not Miss Havisham who gave him his fortune but the old convict he had helped! That convict had escaped again and fled to Australia where he had worked for Pip and had become an owner of quite some money which was given to Pip. And now he comes to Pip and tells him. So that convict is known to Herbert as well and they live together.Now, when Pip was young, his parents had died so he lived with his sister&iexcl;s family. Joe, his brother-in-law is a good friend of his, a blacksmith, but his own sister is not very nice to him. A man called Orlick, who was Joe&iexcl;s helper, thinks very ill of Pip&iexcl;s sister and one day, hits her on the head and makes her a simpleton and she dies after some years. That man Orlick, tries to murder Pip for false reasons but fails for Pip&iexcl;s friends save him.The convict, if captured, would be hanged, therefore, Pip decides that the convict should be out of England as soon as possible and that Pip should accompany him. They plan it, and it proceeds. Meanwhile, Estella is married to a quite rich man and Miss Havisham is dead. The other convict who had escaped with Pip&iexcl;s that long time ago, Pip&iexcl;s convict&iexcl;s foe, follows Pip and the convict on their way out of England and tries to capture them. There is a fight underwater, Pip&iexcl;s convict is alive but is soon captured by the police and his foe is dead underwater. Pip&iexcl;s convict, named Magwitch or Provis is deeply wounded, and dies in prison. Before he dies, Pip finds out that Estella was adopted by Miss Havisham and that her father is Provis, so tells Provis that and that Pip loves his daughter. After that, Provis dies.Pip has an old acquaintance in the country, his hometown, a lady named Biddy. He decides to propose to her, now that Estella is gone, and leaves to the country only to find that Biddy is already married to Joe! He congratulates them and thinks about another little Pip to be in that house, just like he was when he was young. He then departs abroad to where Herbert works, for when Pip was a possessor of a fortune, he had secretly found Herbert that job, and Herbert, not knowing the provider of such a job had invited Pip to be a clerk. Pip lives abroad for eleven years, meanwhile Herbert marries and Pip becomes their &iexcl;partner in the House&iexcl;.After those 11years, he returns to Joe and Biddy&iexcl;s abode where he finds himself there! Named Pip after Pip was a little boy! Pip is warmly greeted, and after dinner, Biddy, who knows all about Estella for Pip had told her when he was young, asks if he surely does not fret for her? Pip replies that he thinks not, but anyway, revisits Miss Havisham&iexcl;s old house. The buildings are taken down, but among the ruins, stands Estella! Her husband had died most unfortunately because of a horse but even before his death, her marriage was not led to be a happy one. For all Pip knew, she was married again, but she was not. Pip and Estella converse about their interests, and Pip says, &iexcl;We are friends.&iexcl; To which Estella continues, &iexcl;And will continue friends apart.&iexcl; Then there is a nice little paragraph, which, if I am not quite mistaken proves that they are married.When I was reading this fantastic novel, I saw a lot of things. On my reading of pre-20th century novels, I only encountered those which were in third person, or first person, but &iexcl;I&iexcl; as a girl, not a boy. Great Expectations was something new, for I had thought that a boy liking a girl is to be quite different from a girl liking a boy and a boy&iexcl;s thoughts about poverty and being ignorant is to be quite different from a girl but I found out that it&iexcl;s quite the same. I mean, it depends on one&iexcl;s character and personality of course, but I found out that some boys do not like telling lies or stealing as much as girls and adults do not. It is a fantastic novel, an excellent read, and although the ending is not originally Charles Dicken&iexcl;s idea, I think Dickens made a great decision to follow what his friend suggested. For the original ending was a sad one, which would have made the reader very unhappy for Pip, whereas the new ending gives some hope and happiness to the reader. I read from a book on Great Expectations that the title, Great Expectations, meant not only Pip&iexcl;s expectations but the reader&iexcl;s of Dickens&iexcl; novels&iexcl; expectations. I surely think that those expectations were rewarded to perfection."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I was forced to read Great Expectations in the ninth grade, and i am still in the ninth grade, so yeah.

I did not read it without my dictionary; which is the reason I read it to expand my vocabulary. After reading this book television became very boring to me. My favorite is Joe Gargery and John Wemmick. Joe because of his stick-to-itiveness. He is the same no matter what. The latter because of his ability to separate work with Jaggers from home. He enjoys life to the max and loves his father so. Pip is also to be appreciated for he does see what is most important in life and the value of love is what is important. After reading this book I have embarked on two others: Much Ado About Nothing (which I have thorougly enjoy) and Silas Marner which is great also. I hope everyone can find the enjoyment of reading for pleasure and learning as I have. Happy reading"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"A great book in concept. However, Dickens was apparently paid by the word. Especially the silly ones, like &quot;prithee&quot; and &quot;vittles&quot;. It is time that we stopped attacking freshmen honors students with this pretentious book, which serves only to drive them away from English forever. Nowhere near the best of Dicken's work, the book reads like a 19th century soap opera, without bathroom breaks and Snuggle-bear commercials. By the time the first interesting character returns to the novel, the reader is lucky if he or she hasn't choked to death on tears of frustration. Why is Estelle such a b****? Why is Ms. Havisham such an old hag? Why is Pip so utterly slackjawed that he permits 20 years of idiocy to be perpetrated upon his stale English carcass? Why, after all, doesn't his benefactor take care of business, murder the lot, and turn this into something vaguely enjoyable? Never mind the fact that Dickens couldn't choose an end, he apparently couldn't even choose a plot, wavering wildly between romance and mystery and the sort of English politics that Michael Palin would love to throw his pasty-white Anglo-Saxon hands about and throttle. Especially the politics. Do we really care about how an English attorney carries himself when we're 15 years old? Not bleeding likely. Powdered wigs and leg stockings sum up the bizarre nature of the staying power of this novel. It's about time that High School English teachers stopped telling one another how *good* this book is, and read it themselves, without the Norton Critical Teacher's Edition beside them. Especially when they have the advantage of alcoholic beverages."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I'm an eighth grade student forced to read this book for English class. Most people would probably assume that the book sucks. Guess what? It does. I'm sorry, but Charles Dickens does not happen to be my cup of tea. He may be a master, but it's impossible to deny that his writing is dry and the story drags in many places. I counted numerous parts of the novel that could have easily been eliminated without affecting the rest of the book. And what the h*** is Pip thinking at the end when he decides to marry (person who I will not name)? Seems to me his only reason for doing this is that he's completely desperate and tired of chasing after Estella all that time. It totally came out of nowhere and wasn't very realistic. The book's really not that bad, but apart from the interesting episodes with Miss Havisham, it's pretty boring."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Some may call me a classic book snob, but here it goes.Great expectations may be at times tedious and I won't deny that, but it is worth it.Charles Dickens goes into great depth of detail and at times a bit overly detailed and I'm sure that is where many people get lost. But if you get the main plot, then you can get the jiff of it.The characters in this book transcend time.Pip, the poor boy who finds himself wondering if he can love old Joe know that he is rich.Estella who cannot love truly but yet brought up to love and destroy.Miss Havisham, the old rich woman who had her heartbroken and know is trying her best to seek revenge.Joe, Biddy and others also play a pivotal role.The story itself plays on the role of moral and also mercy.

However, I find that while its messages are eternal, Dickens's style is very off-putting. Don't get me wrong, his prose is very, very beautiful, and his characters are layered in a way that many modern novelists seem to forget. Yet his descriptions are extraordinarily, unnecessarily lengthy. It's a novel, not a travel magazine. Considering that Dickens wrote this novel as chapters to be published weekly in a newspaper, it's unsurprising how drawn-out the descriptions are (higher word count = higher profit). Also, by compiling all of his entries into one novel, you find repetition creeping in as you realize he redoes all of the unpleasantly elaborate descriptions from the previous few chapters over again. It's disappointing to read a book that takes you for either a dunce, or someone with short-term memory loss."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Ordered Great Expectations because it has been many years since I originally read it as a requirement for a literature class.

The only problem is I don't want to get out of my car.The reader does a fabulous job of bringing Dickens many wonderful characters to life. I heartily recommend."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"\\"Great Expectations\\" was Charles Dickens' third attempt at writing semi-autobiography, and his most successful. Poor Oliver Twist barely registers in his own book, while David Copperfield becomes a pasteboard figure after reaching adulthood. Pip only grows richer and more complex, and it's no wonder critics thus see \\"Great Expectations\\" as the best of the lot.We open with the finest sequence in the novel, along a swampy coastline in southern England where a small boy at his parent's grave is threatened by a desperate convict. The convict wants food and a file to help cut him free. The boy, Pip, must wrestle with some serious guilt, not to mention the threat of his sister and guardian's overzealous discipline. Social expectations cut one way, but a rogue feeling of sympathy for the convict guides him another. Which will win out?Pip's a bit of a prat, but he's meant to be. After coming into some mysterious money, the former blacksmith's apprentice abandons those who love him in a doomed attempt to win over Estella, the high-class, heart-challenged ward of balmy Miss Havisham. Estella bothers some people. How could Pip love her? Man, I've been there, and I reckon a lot of others have been, too. Estella is one of the great fictional representations of unrequited love, and in Dickens' hands, becomes something even more potent, a symbol of class division and status-scrambling folly.Dickens' handling of Pip is subtle and worth careful re-reading. By using the device of an older, unseen Pip as narrator, we sense where he fell astray without it being pointed out overmuch. Clashing with a snooty rival for Estella's affections, he sweats the possibility of being discovered as the friend of a guileless village blacksmith, Joe: \\"So throughout life our worst weaknesses and meannesses are usually committed for the sake of the people whom we most despise.\\"Whenever the focus is on Pip, particularly when dealing with Estella, Miss Havisham, or the mysterious, vaguely creepy lawyer Mr. Jaggers, \\"Great Expectations\\" is both high art and a great read. Dickens' descriptive powers remained in high beam in this, his penultimate novel (completed in 1861). The storyline takes its time, but in such a way that it often feels like a prototype for the stream-of-consciousness narrative authors would employ a century later.If only \\"Great Expectations\\" didn't suffer from one of Dickens' chief bte noires, compounding coincidences. Whether it's the identity of Estella's long-lost father or Miss Havisham's unworthy suitor, too many of the plot strands wind up twisted together to unwholesome effect.Other plot strings, like the tale of a blackguard named Orlick or the romances of Pip's pals Herbert Pocket and Wemmick, do little to merit the lengthy attention they receive. Most annoying is the story of Compeyson, built up as Pip's main adversary. Yet we hardly meet the guy before he vanishes in the black waters of Dickens' top-heavy plot machinations.Except for Jaggers, Estella, and Miss Havisham, \\"Great Expectations\\" suffers from an uninteresting cast of supporting characters. But when you have three such meaty characters, not to mention the noble yet shifting Pip at the center, you have one eminently worthy novel. Add to that Dickens' descriptive abilities, and that harrowing opening, and \\"Great Expectations\\" delivers most of the way on its title's promise."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"i enjoy these barnes and noble editions. pocket books make a nice addition to the library."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I do pretty much all my \\"reading\\" on audio books these days and Michael Page is probably my favorite narrator so far. He changes his voice for each character in a way that sounds so natural and undistracting, and his female voices are not annoying (I think the mark of a really great narrator is how undistracting their \\"opposite gender\\" voices are.)The story of Great Expectations deserves to be told by someone of Page's talent. I first read it by accident when I was a kid, not realizing it was a classic (always avoided books I was supposed to read.) I liked it well enough then, but I love it now. The characters are interesting, the morality of the book is not preachy and it's such a substantial book that you can listen to it several times and still pick up some new insight or pleasure. If you're an impatient reader, the book is probably not for you. If you need action on every page, you might get bored. But if you are a people person and you like getting to know the characters of a book, if you like to look for truth in fiction, it's a great story, very well told."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Well, I was looking through some of the reviews posted here on amazon just to get an idea of what to write because this is my first review, and saw that a few people said that you need to be an adult to read this book. I kind of understand what they mean because this is a pretty dense novel, as most of Dicken's writing is. However, I don't feel that an individual's determines his maturity as a reader, and so, I dont feel that people should be discouraging teenagers from reading this classic book.Having said that, let me discuss a few key points that are important to keep in mind when considering whether or not to buy the book. Firstly, this is a very difficult read, so unless you are accustomed to reading classical fiction, be prepared to devote more time to reading the book than you generally would to a novel of similar length (450ish pages). Furthermore, the book is a drag at times, especially in during the first part. Often times, I would get lost while reading the book because I couldn't focus on the descriptions which seemed to get in the way of the plot. However, I have to give Dickens credit on doing a remarkable job of writing the dialogue between characters which allows the reader to immerse into the story. Whenever I wasn't lost, I would often feel as if I was right in the center of the scene and could vividly visualize what was going on around the protagonist.As for the theme of the book, I felt that it tried to impart a good, however slightly shallow, message on the reader. By the end of the book, it is very clear what the message is as all of the characters get what they deserve. However, having read a lot of philosophical literature, I feel compelled on extracting deeper meaning from everything around me, which is kind of hard to do from this book.My recommendation of this book would depend on the reader, I feel that if you have read another book of a similar genre or time period, then you would really enjoy this book otherwise it might be very boring. If this is your first time reading a book by a classical writer, might I recommend visiting sparknotes after every couple of chapters to get a clearer understanding of the plot. Also, I would recommend to every single person to only buy this book if they can dedicate significant time to reading it. Don't think this is one of those books that you can just read anytime you have a few minutes here or there because you will be lost and won't understand it at all. I feel it would be best to sit down and just read for an hour or two (depending on your attention span) and delve deep into the world of the characters. Not only does this process make identifying character development easier, it also makes the book more enjoyable.Also, for anyone who finds Dicken's writing style interesting, I recommend looking at David Copperfeild (just read the first paragraph, and you will be hooked)."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Great Expectations is one of the most absorbing novels I have ever read. It is also the best. The plot is complex and exciting, sometimes very funny and sometimes almost unbearably sad, with so many plot twists it is impossible to lose interest. The writing and descriptions are...well they're Dickens': always brilliant and powerful. And the characters in Great Expecations, Pip, Uncle Pumblechook, Miss Havisham, Mr. Jaggers, etc., are colorful and original, and complex and lively. Great Expectations has the suspense of any of today's thrillers (during the last fifty pages I could not put it down) and a wonderful message: that your social standing does not determine what kind of a person you are; aristocracy isn't all it's cracked up to be; what you really need in life are good friends and people that care about you. Great Expectations is a masterpiece of the first order. I cannot stress enough how much I enjoyed it. It is most assuredly a book I will keep reading again and again throughout my life."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"When reading this book in high school, I considered myself very fortunate that the copies we had contained the original ending.

Sadly, often it is not.The kindle edition does not contain the original ending. I did not see any reviews of this edition that mentioned it, so I thought I would post one for anyone else who finds that important, as I do."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"GREAT EXPECTATIONS is often the novel used in high schools to introduce students to Dickens. Due to it's length and fairly long and uneventful middle phase, I'm not sure it's the best text to introduce people to Dickens. Still, it is a pretty good story and contains some of the most memorable characters in Dickens' fiction.GREAT EXPECTATIONS is the story of Phillip Pirrip, otherwise known as Pip. Pip's parents die not long after he is born and he is raised &quot;by hand&quot; by his sister. His brother-in-law, Joe Gargery, is the town blacksmith and loves Pip. The two are best-of-friends. One night while looking at his parents' graves, Pip meets a convict and his life is forever changed by that meeting. As the novel progresses, Pip meets Miss Havisham (the wealthiest woman in town) and her beautiful ward, Estella. Pip immediately falls in love with Estella and is haunted by her all the days of his life. Eventually Pip is bond to Joe as his apprentice and sets to work in the blacksmith forge. Several years later, Pip's luck changes when he is informed by a lawyer from London, Mr. Jaggers, that he has become the recipient of &quot;great expectations&quot;. The book then follows Pip's life as he enters this new stage in life and as he develops and becomes a &quot;gentleman&quot;. Everything is brought full circle and just about everyone gets what they deserve by the time the novel ends.GREAT EXPECTATIONS isn't the easiest of books to read. What many writers can do in a sentence often takes Dickens two pages to tell. Also, the book is divided into three phases and the second phase is rather boring (except at the end) and really does nothing more than to fill in a few plot gaps and illustrate to us how much of a prig Pip becomes. Nevertheless, GREAT EXPECTATIONS is still a good story containing some very vivid characters: Pip, Estella, Joe, Miss Havisham, Magwitch, Jaggers, and Wemmick. The characters in GREAT EXPECTATIONS are as memorable as anyone in DAVID COPPERFIELD, OLIVER TWIST, or A CHRISTMAS CAROL. The first phase of the book is quite interesting and sets up everything that later occurs in the novel. The third part of the novel is full of excitement and contains Pip's repentance and reformation. Overall, it's a great book and even though it was written over a hundred years ago, it has a lot to say about the society in which we live today."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I first read this book when I was in eighth grade. Ever since then, I have been going back to it because even though I know how the events will eventually turn out, this book always retains the magic touch to entertain and keep one hoping that the main character Pip will live a happy life.Upon reading the first page, the reader is drawn into a world of mystery and suspense. The reader is whisked into an English cemetry from olden times and what draws the reader further is the presence of a little boy crying, afraid of the eerie atmosphere. To make matters worse, a very strange looking man appears to frighten the little boy even further. The suspense just begins.As if this wasn't enough for the little boy crying in the cemetry, Pip goes on to face even more difficulties in life. Pip meets with the strange Miss Havisham who forever wears her white wedding gownn. Pip feels forever alienated by the proud Estella, whom he has fallen in love with. The problem is --- Estella doesn't seem to care at all. To her, Pip is a poor, common boy.Excitement builds up as Pip is granted the chance to become a gentleman with prosperity. Will Estella care about him now? Will Pip remain the same kind-hearted young man he was when he was poor or will he change?Even though I have long found the &quot;answers&quot; (there are two different endings in the orginal) I am still amazed at how Dickens creates fascinating characters and fills his novels with mystery, suspense and romance."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"As an English teacher, I purchased the collection to use in my classroom. We had already started the novel when the cd's came in. Because the cd's were not marked according to chapter, it was difficult to find the starting point each time we used the cd's. I would have liked to have chapters to correspond with the tracks for easy listening. On the up side, it was easier for the kids to follow along once we did find the spot, and the animated voices brought the story to life."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I read this book in high school years ago and just recently read it for the second time. Dickens never disappoints."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"This is yet another great story by Dickens. Throughout the book I kept thinking, I know what will happen. How obvious. What was obvious was how wrong I was each time. Follow young Pip from boyhood to manhood. See how he goes to become a gentleman (make his fortune in our terms) and what comes of it. This is a story about growing up and learning what is important in life. It is full of Dickens' excellent descriptions and characters and their relationships.If you like any Dickens story you will like this one as well. If you have never read Dickens, you should.For Kindle owners. I only saw two errors. Both words probably had accents on characters as missing characters appeared as question marks (?), so I am not positive what the words actually were (one was French) and to be honest, I never bothered to look them up. But those were the only two. The book contains a table of contents that works fine. I did not see page numbers on this version. Overall, no reason to pay for a copy, this was excellent."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Excellent copy. Clean. New. thank you. Suggestion to reader: look for a copy with BOTH endings! If you read this book in high school, give it another go. Dickens is brilliant and each read brings new insight."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"This isnt merely a classic, it is a book that is dear to my heart and inspired me as both a writer and a person. Many of the free classic ebooks have poor formating or other problems but there are none here that I notice. I highly recommend this wonderful book andfor free you cant beat that price."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"This is a book worth reading, and it's a shame my first experience with it was having it force-fed to me 22 years ago as a high school sophomore or junior. I only wish I could find the crappy, soulless joke of a book report I regurgitated from Cliff's Notes to please my teacher and get that all-important \\"A.\\" Suffice to say that if I found it I would not post it here.Having re-read the book, I now can say with certainty that Dickens is a brilliant writer and storyteller. His use of language is phenomenal, and his characters tell a deep emotional tale. I suspect it is the tale of Dickens' own childhood dilemma: an emotionally abandoned boy seeking greatness and knowing at some level that he was born for it---and that fate somehow picked him out for it.Pip is a multidimensional character, with hopes and charm and honesty and flaws. He is utterly sympathetic, as I'm sure little Charles Dickens once was himself.Pip, an abused and undefended boy, is picked out rather randomly by a near stranger (seemingly the idealized parent for whom every child secretly hopes) to become a gentleman---to rise above the meagre expectations for which his limited birth has chosen him. Even his closest childhood ally, Joe the blacksmith, does nothing (read that: nothing) to defend him against Joe's abusive wife, Pip's older sister. To Dickens' discredit, I felt that he over-defended Joe's weakness as a non-defender. But, by the same token, Dickens' rendering of Joe's all-too-realistic weakness is quite honest and common: after all, so few adults really do stick their necks out to defend the child. I am only left to suspect that in Dickens' own childhood none did either. I would guess that like Pip, Dickens was surrounded entirely by adults who were weak, sadistic, self-centered, or manipulative. My guess is that only his talent, hard word, and patience allowed him to rise above.My only real criticism of the book (and it's not a big one) comes near the end, when Pip tries to help Magwitch escape England and thus find safety. Granted, Dickens' treatment of this situation does assist the flow of the novel, and does allow him to show just how much Pip has grown to care for his benefactor, but it still left me shaking my head. (And I'm not spoiling the plot, because in the version I read the editor's footnotes spoil the plot anyway early on in the reading, as clearly the editor assumes that the reader knows the story beforehand. Then again, maybe the editor is spoiling the plot to give himself some power. I felt some of his footnotes, which are otherwise quite helpful for background, suggest that he was in an annoying sort of competition with Dickens to show his own greatness.)So although the plot device works for Dickens' purpose, it just didn't strike me as sufficiently realistic to keep my disbelief suspended. My reason: Magwitch is a hardy, intelligent, cunning world traveler, who suddenly, for no good enough reason, puts all his trust for escape from England (and thus his life) into the hands of a complete novice, Pip, who creates a foolhardy plan for escape that ends up getting Magwitch captured and sentenced to death.In reality, given what Dickens' shows us about Magwitch's character, here's what I think would have really happened had Magwitch heard Pip's plan:Magwitch: \\"Pip, thank you for creating a plan to rescue me, but I think I'll pass. I'll go off into the night on my own, and leave England the same way I came to it: on my own.\\"Magwitch would have traveled onward with less hurrah, more stealth, and far more privacy. And as the result he would have likely left England safe and sound, and continued to keep up his benefactor relationship with Pip.But that wouldn't have suited Dickens' purposes for the plot, so the more realistic ending was avoided.That said, the book was still great. I couldn't put it down. Kudos to Dickens! And to hell with my high school teacher for nearly ruining my regard for this great writer."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"During the course of the year I try to read a few, &quot;Important Novels&quot; in order to get a fuller understanding of literature. Dicken's &quot;Great Expectations&quot; has been on my list for nearly a year. I completely dreaded reading what I thought would be a long and drawn out story about something I could careless about. Well, I was wrong.&quot;Great Expectations&quot; is now #1 on my all-time favorites list. While, admittedly, it took me roughly 150 pages to get any enjoyment out of the novel- once I was in- I was hooked. Pip's journey through life is a very refreshing look at how distorted we let our lives become by focusing on the unimportant. Dicken's ability to slowly alter Pip's views on life, without changing his essential character/morales (Ex. How Pip looks to help his friend in his business pursuits). Some have called &quot;Great Expecations&quot; his masterpiece... but in my opinion, it may be the &quot;Masterpiece&quot; of English Literature.I also wonder why this is required High School reading. While I loved this book at age 28, I think most 16 year-olds would find it unbearable. It seems like such a waist to ruin both the book and Dicken's name on minds that are not ready for such a reading task."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I am definately a fan of Great Expectations (although don't go see the movie made about it with Gweneth Paltrow). I've had to read this book about three times in high school but I enjoyed it every time. My recommendation will probably mean little because if your still in school you will probably have to read it anyways...but I still recommend it."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Great Expectations was ok, but there were a few things that the author could have done better. First, in my opinion he shouldn't have changed certain characters names around, which can be confusing for some people. There is also illegal activities on the part of some of the characters. Also, even the abridged version of the book is a bit long. Perhaps Dickens could have wound things up in a tighter package for the reader. Dickens plot can be a bit confusing at times, and the reader sometimes is left to piece together the novel for himself.However, this is not a necessesarily a totally boring read. There are several good things about it. Lying is at least partially looked at in a negative light, and steadfast faithfulness among friends is evident among some of the book's main characters. Justice is done to an man for his wrongdoing.Overall, the book is readable but too long. Also, when considering this book, keep in mind that author's back then, are different from authors today. If you like Dicken's works, you might like this book."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I was disappointed from the fact that I did not finish the whole book when I was in high school. The plot and the theme of this novel are amazing. I prefer Dickens to stick to his original ending versus the happy and romantic one."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I may be only a 6th grader, but you wouldn't believe how much I enjoyed this book. Charles Dickens having a poor childhood because of the little money his family earned, has written a miraculous book having to do with money. Charles Dickens makes his case for there being a potential for good and evil in everyone. I really enjoyed reading this book and if you are looking for a fabulous book to enjoy, I strongly reccomend you read this."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Charles Dickens has written extrodinary books such as Olivet Twist, David Cooperfield, A Christmas Carol, and of course Great Expectations. You have not read a novel until you have read Great Expectations. It is truly one of Charles Dickens best. In a dramatic story about adventures and drama, Pip faces his greatest adventure. He is trying to reach his goal in life - great expectation. This story has its ups and downs, but otherwise it is dazaling and spectatuliuar. That is why I give Great Expectations two thumbs up."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I haven't finished the entire book yet, but have wanted to read it for years. The modern movie adaption with Ethan Hawke is one of my favorite movies and I always thought it was a beautiful love story with a real human quality. The book is much different then the movie, but however I believe the modern adaption was incredibley well done considering the difference in time. The book is aslow start but once you are adjusted to the language its actually fast paced reading... especially when Estella returns. My first Dickens and won't be my last. I believe everyone should read the classics"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I got this book assigned to me near the first day of high school this year, and just got finished reading it about a week ago. Let me tell you something, if you know about Dicken's life, this story is kinda based on it. Let me also say this book is extremely boring in the beginning, because you are learning the peices of the puzzle, but the second half is excellent, and all the peices of the puzzle came together, which is why this is an excellent book. My favorite character was definetely Miss Havisham. Don't give up on this book!!! This is the kind of book I think needs a small sequel."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I think that the character development alone makes this novel stand out as one of the best novels of Charles Dickens. The plot summary is also well-crafted, with so many characters intertwining in the books final chapters. We see a personality change in not only Pip, but other major characters such as Estella and Miss Havisham, as we find out that they are all connected in some way.This book might be seen as a rather long and detailed book. Some of the details are probably overdone and unnecessary. This is definitely a book that takes some getting used to. However, I think that one of the morals of the book-- understanding your roots and accepting them-- make this a great book to read.The many characters contrast each other in so many ways, and there are so many good and bad characters, that it becomes a fun book to read. However, you must have patience to read a book this long and detailed.I think this book is well-written (some of the language is a little tough), and Dickens exposes his great writing ability and his abilty to deal with a complex plot and make it all come together in Great Expectations."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Charles Dickens was one of the most popular writers of all time, creating some of the best-known characters in English literature. In the book \\"Great Expectations\\", the protagonist and narrator, Pip begins the story as a young orphan boy being grown up by his sister. I like this book, because Charles Dickens takes you right inside the Pip's mind and you live through the events and discoveries of his life with him. Pip is passionate, romantic and somewhat unrealistic at heart. That makes the novel interesting. Of course, you cannot forget the great love story (Pip and Estella). The other characters Magwitch, Miss Havisham, Joe Gargery, Miss Joe, Estella, Mr Jaggers and Mr Wemmick are all unique and special in their way and they add to the novel's richness. Another thing I really liked was how all of the characters are interrelated to each other in ways that you may not discover until you get to the end of the novel. This novel will make you sometimes laugh and sometimes make you feel sad, but it is always entertaining. Latif Dose simplifies the texts. The language is very clear. There are not old English words and this gives the reader much pleasure while reading the novel. I think most young people would like this novel because it's not as hard to read as an other classic books. I recommend Great Expectations to anyone who wants to read a good, classic book because Great Expectations has a little bit of everything in it, mystery, romance and suspense. You cannot easily find all of these properties in other novels, which makes &quot;Great Expectations&quot; a special and a classic one.. That makes this novel very different. It is probably one of the top ten English novels of the 19th century. Some of the passages are beautiful. I cannot forget Pip's response to Estella when she says \\"You will get me out of thoughts in a week.\\""},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I appreciate this edition for its introduction (which is interesting for literature buffs and beneficial for serious students/readers), for the end notes (which are definitely helpful in explaining Victorian allusions and other references for readers who have little or no background or experience with such), for the inclusion of the original ending (which provokes a variety of options for discussion and examination), for the discussion questions, and for the presentation (easy to read pages). My students find this edition less intimidating than some others; overall, this edition seems user-friendly rather than overwhelming (which is often the case with such a long story)."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Great Expectations is one of Charles Dickens most famous books. Even with Dickens' extremely long r&eacute;sum&eacute; of books Great Expectations maybe the only one read by younger readers because the other are usually mature plots or have extreme length. But, Great Expectations is a \\"great\\" exception.Charles Dickens used a very eloquent vocabulary. His absolute mastery of English makes his book interesting yet difficult to read. Terminology has changed since he wrote the novel, and, in addition to the evolution the language, Dickens was British. This fact changed his wording from typical American English and helped the book be more in character. Dickens also exercises his talent for manipulating words and creating vivid word pictures like these sentences, \\"Mrs. Joe was a very clean housekeeper, but had an exquisite art of making her cleanliness more uncomfortable and unacceptable than dirt itself,\\" and \\"It was one of those March days when the sun shines hot and the wind blows cold: when it is summer in the light, and winter in the shade.\\" These brilliant word pictures make the book a bear to read when quickly read but also makes it brilliantly fascinating when soaked in and read slowly. In short Dickens has the entire language in his hands and works it masterfully into a brilliant weaving of plot.Dickens also knew how to capture his audience. He used a fantastic plot that wove in and out. Even though his plot was almost cheesy, he managed to pull it off without to much \\"cheese\\" suspected. Though I thought this book had too many climaxes, if you think about its original form - serial - then you understand that he had to keep his readers interested. Dickens keeps the plot \\"writhing\\" until the very end where he had a most expected and cheesy ending. The ending seemed rushed and scrambled together. Out of the whole book spanning thirty some years the last eleven are on the last five pages. The plot as a whole was very good. The plot moved the characters along and changed them to be what they are at the end. The characters grew as you read it not only in age but in emotion and focus.Dickens characters are amazing. He captures a lot of emotions and kinds of people in one book. He grasps a boy's changing thoughts until he grows to be a man. The innocent, childish fears of Pip are so easily grasped, and Pip's relations with Miss Havisham completely change him into a self-centered man trying to woo and unlovable woman. He also shows the starkness of humanity when exploited by its own race. Even some of the lesser characters still show the variety of human expression like Joe's nobleness and Wemmick's eccentricism. In all the characters were amazing.As a whole the book is a masterpiece and classic for all generations. Great Expectations will always be close to my heart."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"First of all, in reference to the reviewer who seemed to think the title was inapropos, all I can say is that I hope that they didn't read the book, for such a lack of understanding would be pathetic. I digress. I am here to dispel some myths. Since this book is often assigned in school, and perceived as \\"important,\\" as another reviewer noted, I think a lot of people shy away from it and assume it will be boring or difficult to understand. Dickens' novels, however, work on multiple level. There certainly is important social criticism and a web of subtly laced motifs within this novel, but on the surface, it's just a good read. I read it on a whim and ended up staying up all night to finish it. So, don't dispel this novel and turn to the many vapid works available to you. One piece of advice, read the real ending before the changed ending (though the changed one will appear first). I felt that the original one was far better, more relevant, and sadly invalidated by the changed ending thrust upon me first. Happy reading!"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Great expectation was a wonderful classic written by the author Charles dickens. The main character, Pip, grow up in the home of a blacksmith.

That also made this book very interesting follow"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Probably one of the most memorable Dickens characters, Philip Pirrup is known to most readers as Pip, the 7-year-old boy whom his short-tempered sister raised by hand. Little Pip infers that he has sustained, from as early as his babyhood, a perpetual conflict with injustice. He has known, from the time when he can speak and discern his surrounding that his sister, in her fits of caprice and violent coercion, is unjust to him. It seems to poor Pip that all the endearments in life brushes by him or bypasses him altogether. Fate has ineluctably deprived him of the lightsome hours that make our childhood a time to be remembered like a happy dream through all our after life. The bright side of growing up with his sister's fits of spleen is Pip's friendship with his brother-in-law Joe, who not only has taken him into apprenticeship but sanctified the house Pip calls home that is otherwise sullied by his sister's temper.A chance but terrifying encounter with an escaped convict for whom he brings provisions pilfered from the kitchen cupboard changes the entire course Pip's life. But it is not until he meets the beautiful, cold-hearted and haughty Estella during a summon to a decaying Miss Havisham that he sets his mind to whittle away his coarseness and to become a gentleman, one on Estella's account. The sudden but timely generosity of a mysterious benefactor comes to assist his making of a gentleman and promises a handsome property. The prospect of great expectations not only immediately relieves him from his ordinary sphere of life and frees him from apprenticeship with Joe, but also concurs with his eagerness to abandon his humble origins.GREAT EXPECTATIONS thus follows Pip's new life under his fortune and depicts his education, new relationships, and development through adversity as he slowly dawns on the true nature of his great expectations. The new life does not come without a catch as he finds himself living in a state of chronic uneasiness respecting his perfidious behavior to Joe, whose interference in his life he now regards as disturbance. The more Pip basks in the favor, privilege, and conviviality that is concomitant of his fortune, the more his is convinced of a happier life derived from simplicity and fidelity that only Joe can offer. As he sidles closer to the truth about his benefactor's identity, a revelation for which he is not prepared struck him.GREAT EXPECTATIONS is a story of moral redemption with a prodigal son-like protagonist in the orphaned Pip. The tale is extremely straightforward but is woven with substantial issues he has to deal with. Eager to shred his humble roots, he promptly disavows family and friends at the prospect of a fortune. As the fortune loses its luster and eventually dissipates altogether, he confronts his own ingratitude and learns to love the man who both creates and destroys him, figuratively speaking. Dickens deftly validates Pip's redemption by showing that it produces good deeds as well as good works. This is especially worthy of merit because the novel is told in Pip's first person narrative. Mishandling of the narrative might render the whole tale unconvincing.The proof of Pip's redemption comes laden with good deeds rather than airy words: his clandestine acts of kindness in securing Herbert a partnership in business, and in securing Miss Havisham's respectable opinion of the long-suffering Matthew Pocket, and in his refusing to accept money from Miss Havisham, and most significantly in his love for the man whom has bequeathed him with the fortune."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"This book was reccomended to me by my mom for me to expand my reading tastes. I was maybe a little hesitant, but I began reading it, and was immediately pulled in by the compelling, quirky characters and the mind boggling plot. Each new character is equally amusing, and their names seem to depict their nature. When I first saw Uncle Pumblechook's name, I was immediately able to guess what sort of a person he was, same with Mr. Wopsle, Mr. Wemmick, Mrs. Joe Gargery, and more. The humor is subtle, but once you get the joke you'll be howling.However, Dickens is certainly not an author who says little when there is an opportunity to say more; in a nutshell, his writing is quite flourid. Ten pages can be a whole lot to get through, not because it is boring, but because it is full of complex words, sentences, and paragraphs, that you'll need a little bit of rest. I felt sometimes like reading it was like an excercise seminar for my mind. But don't let these few words discourage you, it's a great read."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"...endless is the error of intimacy.Such is the story of &quot;Great Expectations.&quot; I have to say that Dickens totally floored me with this magical tale of love and pedestals. I don't even know what made me read it. I think I just found it in my mother's house amid throwaways in the attic. Oh no...this is NOT to be thrown away, this treasure of English literature. This is the reason why we read.Pip is an orphan with no prospects in sight. But one day, under the strangest of circumstances, he becomes the veritable ward of an unknown benefactor and hurtles toward the gentlemanly future of high living and culture. Along the way, he is placed in the almost daily charge of the bitter and rich shut-in Miss Havisham, guardian of the irresistable, yet bitchy Estella. Poor Pip spends a great deal of his days partaking in the education of a gentleman, doing the bidding of the witchy Havisham woman and pining after the girl who uses and abuses him. It sometimes seems like this high society training is a big freakin' mistake.Things heat up when he comes across the criminal Magwitch and doesn't turn him in to the authorities. From there on in the piece continues to fill the mind with limitless imagery. The writing style is a beaut and the characters continue to intrigue with every passing page, from the disgustingly prunish Miss Havisham to Pip's dim-witted, but thoroughly likeable father - a man he sadly comes to see as shameful as his education and training strengthens.This is a story of yearning and loss, guilt and foolish pride as one person after another gets a wish granted and regrets it or waits for a train that never comes in. Yet somehow the ending leaves behind a great feeling. This is among my favorite books ever."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I may be only a 6th grader, but you wouldn't believe how much I enjoyed this book.

The painting seems almost perfect for Dickens novel.But on to the novel itself. \\"Great Expectations\\" was the first of Dickens' novels that I read and I had to read several more before I found another I liked anywhere near as much. It is a small work compared to \\"David Copperfield\\" and his other massive English comic novels. It is a much darker work, too with less of the comedic touch.Dickens published and/or edited several magazines and some of his novels were first written as serials to bolster flagging circulation, \\"Great Expectations\\" is one and it shows. The novel grabs you fast and has a story with many surprises and twists along the way. The one drawback to the earlier serializaztion is that the book probably has too many small climaxes and cliffhangersLike many of the other great novels of the 18th and 19th century a modern reader may well find it a little too full of long descriptive passages. I personally feel that it travels along fast enough that you won't notice.I feel a word or two may be necessary about coincidence in the novel, certainly some other reviewers here at Amazon have felt there was too much. The first thing that should be said is that Dickens readers would not have criticised the coincidence, at the time they had a much firmer belief in \\"fate\\" and would have felt that the coincidence showed how much of Pip's tale was fated to be. The other thing worth mentioning is that the coincidence is no less than one can find in quite a lot of modern television if you just explain the plot. We need to ask if the number of coincidences seems unnatural within the book and if the book works. My answer would be that this tale runs along at a fine pace, well written and well worth the read. The coincidence does not detract from the novel.I'd recommend this book to anyone who wants a good, classic read. As one of Dickens shorter works it is also a fine place to start."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"As a student, I had to read this book as a requirement for my junior year summer reading. Being the largest book of them all, I reluctantly started on this one. However, after giving it the twenty-five page test, I found the book terribly addictive. Had I had a more generous time budget, I would have finished the book in two to three days. As it was, it took me over a month. The storyline, with Pip intertwined in a weird emotional triangle with one Miss Havisham and Estella, has the reader wondering &quot;Who is on Pip's side?&quot; and &quot;What the heck is going on with this Estella babe?&quot; The emotions Pip felt, the things he went through, and just the thought of actually having to go through what he did brings tears to the eyes (even mine, which had been dry for years). By reading this book, I even became more in-tune to my emotions. This novel is an excellent piece of literature for any language buff (Dickens is a sheer master of the English language), and for anyone who loves a good tearjerker. Happy reading!!"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Another reviewer claims that you have to be at least 21 years old to read this book. Although I don't think it should be \\"forced\\" on schoolchildren (they will only hate it) I read this novel when I was a child and I loved it. I have just re-read it now and I enjoy it all the more. This is my favorite novel by Dickens. It is from his later period and is criticized for being too dark - which, however, makes it more perfect for today's sensibilities. Stephen King cites this work as one of his favorites: he believes that it is this book that brought the gothic novel mainstream.Was there ever a novelist who created more memorable characters than Dickens? Here, we meet perhaps his most intriguing - Miss Havisham. For anyone unfamiliar with the story, I will not spoil it by describing her. The story is similar to parable about the prodigal son - good Pip inexplicably comes into some money and goes off to the corrupting city.AN IMPORTANT THING TO NOTE: Dickens wrote two ending for this book. His friends thought that the original ending was too downbeat and they asked him to come up with a different one. It is the upbeat ending that is the official ending of the novel. However, most critics agree that the original unpublished ending is better. Most modern editions feature the unpublished ending in an appendix. MAKE SURE YOU BUY A COPY THAT CONTAINS THE ORIGINAL ENDING!"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Great Expectations is one of Dickens's later novels, a work of his artistic maturity. The narrative is symbolic rather than realistic. Although, as in most of Dickens and in Victorian literature in general, the plot relies heavily on coincidence, it is acceptable here because the events are true to the internal, psychological, logic of the story.After writing A Tale of Two Cities, which was unique among his novels in that it had none of his trademark humor, Dickens set out to make Great Expectations rich in comic elements. This despite, or perhaps because of, being in a depressed state of mind himself at the time. The conventional critical view is that he largely failed in this attempt, but I strongly disagree. The book is hilariously funny in parts and the main character, Pip, exhibits a characteristically British humour-in-adversity throughout his adventures. There is also the host of minor comic characters that we expect from Dickens. And he for once manages pathos without spilling over into bathos, so there are tears as well as laughter here, sometimes both at once.If you have not yet read any Dickens, this is not a bad book with which to start, although for younger readers (teens) I would recommend Hard Times or A Tale of Two Cities as their first. Great Expectations demands a mature sensibility to appreciate its symbolism and psychological depth. Perhaps because it chiefly concerns the childhood and youth of the protagonist, it is often given to young people to read and is a set text in some High School classes. This is a pity because, in its dark complexity, it is more likely to turn youngsters off, rather than onto, Dickens."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I've never read any Dickens of my own free will. I was forced to read &quot;A Tale of Two Cities&quot; in high school and I thought that was enough for me. However, one day, on a whim, I bought a copy of Great Expectations. I'm not sure what I expected, but I certainly didn't expect to love it as much as I did.Dickens is not a writer to read at a swift pace. Indeed, this novel was written in weekly episodes from December 1860 to August 1861 and, as it was created to be a serial, each installment is full of varied characters, great descriptions and a lot of action which moves the plot along and leaves the reader yearning for more. Therefore, unlike some books which are easily forgotten if I put them down for a few days, Great Expectations seemed to stick around, absorbing my thoughts in a way that I looked forward to picking it up again. It took me more than a month to read and I savored every morsel.Basically the story is of the self-development of Pip, an orphan boy being raised by his sister and her blacksmith husband in the marshlands of England in 1820.Every one of the characters were so deeply developed that I felt I was personally acquainted with each one of them. There was Pip's roommate, Herbert Pocket, the lawyer, Mr. Jaggers, and his clerk, Mr. Wemmick. And then there was the wicked Orlick. The dialogues were wonderful. The characters often didn't actually say what they meant but spoke in a way that even though the words might be obtuse, there was no mistaking their meaning. I found myself smiling at all these verbal contortions.Dickens' work is richly detailed and he explores the nuances of human behavior. I enjoyed wallowing in the long sentences and letting myself travel backwards in time to a different world. However, even with the footnotes, I found myself sometimes confused by the British slang of 150 years ago, and there were several passages I had to read over several times in order to get the true meaning. Of course I was not in a particular rush. I didn't have to make a report to a class or take a exam about the book. This is certainly a pleasure.I heartily recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a good read.ting from the secret wealth of Magwitch, who made a fortune in Australia after being transported. Moreover, Magwitch's unlawful return to England puts him and Pip in danger. Meanwhile, Estella has married another, a horrible man who Pip despises. Eventually, with Magwitch's recapture and death in prison and with his fortune gone, Pip ends up in debtors prison, but Joe redeems his debts and brings him home. Pip realizes that Magwitch was a more devoted friend to him than he ever was to Joe and with this realization Pip becomes, finally, a whole and decent human being.Originally, Dickens wrote a conclusion that made it clear that Pip and Estella will never be together, that Estella is finally too devoid of heart to love. But at the urging of others, he changed the ending and left it more open ended, with the possibility that Estella too has learned and grown from her experiences and her wretched marriages.This is the work of a mature novelist at the height of his powers. It has everything you could ask for in a novel: central characters who actually change and grow over the course of the story, becoming better people in the end; a plot laden with mystery and irony; amusing secondary characters; you name it, it's in here. I would rank it with A Tale of Two Cities, Oliver Twist and David Copperfield among the very best novels of the worlds greatest novelist.GRADE: A+"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"This review refers to the audio(CD - Brilliance Audio) edition of \\"Great Expectations\\" by Charles Dickens, read by Michael PageThis unabridged audio edition of Dickens' classic superb chronology of \\"Pip's' journey through life going from a poor boy to becoming a man with \\"expectations\\" is simply marvelous. As Pip comes into a small fortune, and becomes a \\"gentleman\\" he learns the value and true meaning of friendships and life. But the journey is a long one, with many lessons to be learned along the way before he can find his true self. Dickens has given us a wonderful story, with rich details of the setting and characters that grow and are among the most interesting and magnetic to be found in literature.I don't need to go on and on about the book itself(although I could easily go over my allotted word count here), if you haven't read it yet ,just know you are in for one heck of a literary treat. It is a story that will transport you to another time and place, and you may not want to come back. I will however, talk about this marvelous audio edition. Michael Page is the reader, and what a reading he gives. Just curl up and listen to this master storyteller. Every voice, every nuance is captured. There is no doubt who is speaking as he gives each character the personality and cultural characteristics as Dickens intended. He even does the women wonderfully, without going over the top. In my mind Miss Havisham has always sounded just the way Page portrayed her, Estella as uppity as ever,the humble Joe, along with all the rest.The book is an unabridged reading on 16 discs. each discs has 90 very short tracks(about 45 seconds each), I had no trouble starting up where I left off(when I absolutely had to leave off). I just made a mental note(or you could even write it down) of the track number and disc where I stopped it. The sound quality is excellent, and total running time is about 20 hours. Each disc is in it's own paper CD holder with a clear front so you can see the disc number you are looking for.If you are a fan of this book, this audio edition will give you a fresh read and new appreciation of this fascinating book. If you are experiencing it for the first time, you can't help but to become enthralled. Great to take on long drives or for younger readers to be introduced to classic literature in a most entertaining way.Enjoy the read...for the 1st Time or the 50th time!....Lauriemore great audio reads:A Christmas Carolread by Geoffrey Palmer-Carrie(read by Sissy Spacek)Back When We Were Grownups(read by Blair Brown)The Shipping News(read by Paul Hecht)"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I love this book! This is one of my all-time favorite books ever. I had to read it eons ago when I was in ninth grade, and now (14 years later) I am still enjoying it. Every few years I take this one down from my bookshelf to revisit. This is the story of Pip, a small orphaned boy living in poverty in the English countryside with his much older sister and her husband. Pip meets a convict in a graveyard one damp morning and helps him out in the form of some vittles and an iron file. Later in the story, Pip moves from poverty to being a &quot;gentleman&quot; due to the influence of a mysterious, anonymous benefactor. This book tells of his adventures and how Pip's expectations guide him through life. Towards the end of the story, Pip finds out that reality is sometimes very different from what we expect it to be. The characters are what really make this book stand out. Charles Dickens is a master of character development, and his descriptions of Miss Havisham, Wemmick, Joe, and the others is brilliant! The dialogue is great, with the words written the way a commoner would have spoken in England in the 1800's. Another thing I really liked was how all of the characters are inter-related to each other in ways that you may not discover until you get to the end of the novel.This novel will make you laugh and it might make you sad, but it is always entertaining. If you are in high school and reading this book for the first time for English class, keep at it! It may seem difficult at first if you are not used to Dickens, but this book is well worth it! It is truly a gem."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"This book is not the full version, despite the length. There's no indication of this until you get inside the book."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Charles Dickens's acknowledged masterpiece, Great Expectations, is rightly considered one of the greatest novels of all-time. It depth and breadth are staggering, as it follows its protagonist, Pip, from his early childhood through his later life. During the course of his life, we encounter a vast catalog of raw human emotions: love, hate, jealousy, hope, sadness, despair, anger, pity, empathy, sympathy -- and on and on. The story is treasured and revered for many reasons. One of its main strengths is its plot: after a somewhat slow introductory section, Dickens puts his story in fifth gear and delivers a fast-paced and exciting story that gallops along without ever losing interest or clarity. The incredibly complex plotline, full of separate stories and incidents that seem totally unrelated to each other, but are then all harnessed together as the book heads straight toward its denouement, is also full of constant plot twists, which continue up until, literally, the last paragraph. But, of course, as with all of Dickens's major works, it is the characters that make the book. Like Shakespeare, Dickens preferred to have the story develop through the characters, rather than having the characters be mere set pieces inside of an overriding story. And what great characters they are: the perennially paradoxical but essentially human Pip; the bitter and mysterious Miss Havisham; the beautiful and haughty Estella; the simple and saint-like Joe; the kind and benevolent Herbert; the very human convict, Magwitch -- and all of the other wonderful characters. Dickens excelled in creating well-rounded, very human characters who harbored very real and very complex emotions -- that is, human emotions. We identify with Pip as he winds through his life, because we have been there, too -- the disappointments, the surprises, the loves, the anger, the sadness. In whatever way his story may differ from our own, it is still essentially human, as is ours. For all of his complex and paradoxical emotions and sentiments, Pip is a recognizably human character -- and that is why we love him and this book. A masterpiece for the ages, which will endure for years yet to come, Great Expectations is a great book that can be loved by one and all, for, at its heart, is that grain of simple truth that says so much about what is human in all of us -- whether we have great expectations or not."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"The description of Miss Havisham & her home alone is worth two to three stars. This is unlike any other book in the English language, with the possible exception of Emily Bronte's \\"Wuthering Heights?\\" Dickens tells us many things in the begining of the novel that appear out of place or irrelevant, but later those pieces fall into place so that the big picture is revealed.This story runs the gamut of emotions for the reader. Shock, empathy, joy, disappointment, & disdain are all there for the various characters at different times. Multiple plots, detailed descriptions, & ever mutable characters made this a long & entertaining read. This is the story of Phillip Pirrup or Pip. He is a true hardluck case that you root for. His family except for a brother & sister have all passed away. He lives with his sister{a husband beater} & brother in law Joe Gargery in a tiny English village. Oddly for this era, this is one of the few books where fear from a man's perspective is explored. That in itself was refreshing. Along the roller coaster life that Pip finds himself on he meets enigmatic people & gets an anonymous benefactor who helps him reach London to start a better life? Once there life & the nature of Pip himself is radically altered. This is when the title of my review becomes clear. Dickens asks & answers very poignant psychological questions long before Freud was ever heard of."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I chose to write a review of Great Expectations because I wanted to be able to rate a novel &quot;five-stars&quot; without an ounce of hesitation.Context: I'm not by any means some sort of an intellect. Like many people who have read Great Expectations, I was assigned this book in high school. I remember looking to the end of the book, first, to see how many pages there were. I cringed. Then I began to read that first chapter about a boy named Pip who meets the convict looking for vittles.I won't give anything away about the plot. I only want to say that this was the first book that I ever read that I had me truly absorbed. I remember a kid in my class who read ahead a few chapters and had us all in wonder as to what twists transpired. He just smiled and said, &quot;you won't believe how this thing turns out.&quot;After reading other Dickens books I realized that his greatest strengths was populating his books with amazing, odd, likeable, and despicable characters who found there way in and out of his stories.If you haven't read this book, do so."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I got the &quot;cover-to-cover&quot; book on tape for a long road trip, never having heard the story before. I loved every minute of it. The things that Dickens does with the English language is endlessly entertaining, the story he tells fascinating and fast-paced. The highly talented Martin Jarvis reads wonderfully, giving great characterization to the many people appearing in the story, allowing me to see them all as completely distinct.It's a shame that people feel such resentment when forced to read something. Most of the bad reviews this book gets are from young people who were forced to read it for a class. When taken at one's own leisure, and in one's own time, it is quite entertaining. I'm not sure that the teachers who assign the book are pointing out all the things that make the book great, such as Dickens's flair with the language, the point he's making about a society that places birth above worth, and his ability to make abstract arguments that enhance the story. I'd be interested in hearing from literature teachers to find out how they use the book in their classes.One of the best books ever written, this reading is one of the best investments of my time I've ever made."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"the course of the year I try to read a few, \\"Important Novels\\" in order to get a fuller understanding of literature. Dicken's \\"Great Expectations\\" has been on my list for nearly a year. I completely dreaded reading what I thought would be a long and drawn out story about something I could careless about. Well, I was wrong.\\"Great Expectations\\" is now #1 on my all-time favorites list. While, admittedly, it took me roughly 150 pages to get any enjoyment out of the novel- once I was in- I was hooked. Pip's journey through life is a very refreshing look at how distorted we let our lives become by focusing on the unimportant. Dicken's ability to slowly alter Pip's views on life, without changing his essential character/morales (Ex. How Pip looks to help his friend in his business pursuits). Some have called \\"Great Expecations\\" his masterpiece... but in my opinion, it may be the \\"Masterpiece\\" of English Literature.I also wonder why this is required High School reading. While I loved this book at age 28, I think most 16 year-olds would find it unbearable. It seems like such a waist to ruin both the book and Dicken's name on minds that are not ready for such a reading task."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Great Expectations is an exciting story dramatically done in this audio presentation."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Many people may find Charles Dicken's \\"Great Expectations,\\" dated, due to it's time period and its flowery 19th century language. True, the book is extremely wordy, and there are many words you'll be getting out a dictionary for reference, and yes it's very slow moving, but it's wonderful.The book focuses on a young boy, who becomes a young man, named Pip, raised by his over dominating sister, and a kind blacksmith, Joe Gargory. For awhile Pip has gratitude for living in the town, but, when he is spurned by the rich Estella and Miss Havisham, he wants to be something greater, someone richer. Being rich falls into his lap, but not without consequences. The book is about the follies of false vanities, of turning ones back on those who loved you, on trying to chase an uncatchable dream from those who don't reciprocate feelings, (in this case Pip's devotion to the haughty Estella) and for neglecting the good values of life for the ostentatious ones. Too often in todays society people (I'm guilty of this too) forget about what's truly important, family and good friends, and associate with only the proud and the, what they deem to be, the important. In the process they get too wrapped up by material wealth rather than the simple beauties around them.Aside from the basic story, the characterization in this novel is wonderful. Dicken's has really created some memorable characters, full of depth and complexity. The dull headed, but kind, Joe Gargory, and the haughty, but lonely, Estella, along with the mournful and bitter Miss Havisham will stay with the reader long after he/she finishes the book.Reading this book is a treat. Peruse it's pages and enjoy."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"This novel by Charles Dickens is very well written, although very verbose. The novel has a good plot, but the writting is sometimes hard to follow. It took me one whole month to read the book and fully understand it. I recommend it to anyone who is interested in the classics, because it has a great story. Readers beware though, they must be ready to analyze everything in order to understand the novel"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I'm not a huge fan of Charles Dickens, but I have read a number of his books for reports and for reading. I've read Great Expectations for class and for personal reading. First of all the book is much easier to read then David Copperfield and others. The beginning is really riveting, and from there it keeps going. This book made me look to my personal life to see if I was finding happiness in the right things. I would read it at least once."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I loved this book. I have to admit in the beginning it was a bit of a chore to get &quot;into&quot; it but once I did I was just swept away. I especially loved the characters in it. I found myself putting the book down to tell my husband how mad I was at Pip. Joe, Estella, Abel Magwitch, Mr.Jaggers and of course Miss Haversham are unforgettable! A great book once you give it a fair chance. I am so glad that I stuck to it!"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Before you reads this book, examine the title, and what great expectations do, so the events seem less shocking.This story is quite bittersweet and ironic, with a lot of interweaven and connected plots-not just of Pip's life. These plots make understanding this book, along with the rich dialect, quite difficult (where it lost the star) but amazing. ADVICE: read the Coles Notes (or other notes) chapter summaries.As I said, it's an extrodinary coming of age (rite of passage) which will not be as distant and farfetched as you might think. Comparable to your own rite of passage if you care to draw parallels with not only Pip, but all other characters too.I found that when you are forced to read this book and too much emphasis it placed on it, it loses it's 'interest', 'luster', and 'magic', (*wink* *wink* high school teachers!).Overall, I liked this book, but the language overwhelmed at times."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Dickens has a very vivid imagination. He express himself in a bizzare way in all of his works. In this novel, however, he out does himself. This book has a strange air about it.

It's very emotional and it's a trip. A trip that lasted two weeks for me, and that I will not soon forget, if ever. I wholeheartedly recommend this book for those of you who love literature, and even for those of you who are not literature-buffs, because the novel is very readable so don't be afraid of its length if you're not used to reading classics and such.Dickens, I realised, can be surprisingly funny at times, and this without ever losing his capacity to create strongly emotional moments and images.

This was the best advice I'd ever taken. Reading this not only made me love Charles Dickens, but gave me a late start on loving reading in general.Granted, it's a difficult book to read. Dickens packs his book with descriptions and long sentences (yet every word is important and helps with understanding) and he's not easy to get through. Yet Dickens still, with all his flaws, remains a masterful storyteller. His characters aren't deep, but they're relatable and memorable. I love Pip, Estella, Miss Havisham, Joe, Herbert Pocket, Magwitch, and Aged P, and even though I've read this book a long time ago, I love them just as much now as I did then.It's a shame that people have to read this for school (I did so for my second time). It's a wonderful story that should be enjoyed by itself. If you haven't been made to read it, do so now. Push yourself through it and take your time (it took me a month to finish the book myself). You'll be glad you did. Assignments make you rush and over-analyze stories, and Dickens should never be read that way."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Great Expectations was a remarkable book. I really enjoyed it. I didn't really have great expectations before I read it. It was about a little English boy named Pip. Pip is a poor kid who suddenly inherits a bunch of money and becomes rich. When he was poor he hated the way rich people treated poor people, but he finds himself doing treating poor people horribly when rich. He finally learns that everyone deserves to be treated with the same respect, even those less fortunate. This was an interesting book, but a tough book to understand, I would probably recommend it only for adults."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"When I was assigned to present a novel for my English class at Mercy High School, I thought of Great Expectations because I had read it five years ago and remembered that I had liked it. I thought that it was rather straight forward and didn't remember having difficulty reading it. When I read it for a second time, however, I realized that it was alot more complex. The reading was simple and getting through the book was easy, but Dickens made his story one worth contemplating by expressing the many sides life with his characters. What made the people he wrote about so wonderful was his ability to make them unique and entertaining, yet so believable as human beings coping with ordinary problems that the reader had no problem sympathizing with them."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Charles Dickens develops the characters, the plot, and the conflicts in Great Expectations spectacularly. The characters Dickens develops throughout the story are human and easy to connect with. Pip is the most real to life character, because he exhibits the most human-like qualities. Pip is a very personable character that makes the reader feel sorrow and happiness along with him. As Pip looks to better himself and become a gentleman, he comes to realize a very important life lesson; money cannot buy happiness. As Pip goes through the story, he allows the reader to see and feel exactly what he feels and sees.Estella is described as a beautiful young woman that captures Pip's heart. Estella has a very insensitive personality, and enjoys making Pip cry; something everyone has encountered in a person some time in his/her life.Herbert is a young man with many dreams and aspirations. Herbert becomes Pip's best friend, and Pip realizes that this young man works very hard for what he believes in. This is the kind of friend that will push a person where they would not normally go by themselves.Abel Magwitch is the convict that Pip encounters at the beginning of the story. Magwitch gives Pip a large amount of money to start his life as a gentleman. Magwitch is the kind of person that would give the clothes off of his back to anyone in need. Magwitch is also a very personable character because he is not all good or all evil. He exhibits both of these; he is a convict and he devotes his life's earnings to Pip.Charles Dickens develops an outstanding plot as the novel unfolds. There are many life lessons throughout the novel. Pip realizes that all of the money in the world cannot buy happiness. Pip also finds out that true love is not just the woman he cannot obtain, because love has to be much more. The plot has many twists and turns throughout. There is always something new happening to Pip. It is almost like a soap opera, because there are so many people and events interacting with each other during the novel. When the plot becomes a little thin, Dickens begins to create suspense for the next big event about to occur. Dickens chooses to develop the plot through the character's actions. Not once did Dickens explain what was happening in the story, he let the characters take over, and within a few pages all questions were answered.The novel has many conflicts that develop throughout the plot. Pip and Estella have a love-hate relationship going on. Pip loves Estella, but she could care less about him. Pip and Joe have a conflict, too. Pip wants to see much less of Joe now that he is a gentleman, but Joe just wants to see Pip, period. Pip thinks he is too good for Joe, even though he is still just the same human as he was before. Money changes people's outlook on life. Pip was once a benevolent, caring, young man, but once he fell into money, he changed dramatically in the way he acted towards others. These conflicts provide for some pretty interesting facets in the story. Charles Dickens develops the characters, the plot, and the conflicts excellently throughout the novel."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Truly one of the best books I've read.

The illustrations in the book plus the alternate ending were also bonuses. I could not be more complimentary of this book and plan to read many more Dickens works starting with David Copperfield. Great Expectations is now one of my favorite books of all time."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"This book is classic Dickens. It's a winner. It lives up to my expectations. Anyone who loves Dickens will enjoy this book. Again we see a young person growing up on the \\"wrong side of the tracks\\" become a hero in his own right. Pip learns many things in his journey and comes to terms with the folks who shaped his understanding, even though they are simple folk."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Dicken's is clearly in a class of his own. Few authors have exhibited and illustrated the breadth and depth of story telling inherent and extant in a Dicken's novel. Dicken's ability to switch tenses and create tension through use of speech and idiom is unparalleled. This is a mature read that requires patience, intellect, and a formidable vocabulary to be fully realized and properly appreciated. Thank you Charles for your formidable and fine effort; well done good and faithful master."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I am amazed that it took me 61 years to get around to reading this book. I wish I had read it a long time ago. The Kindle version is great, though. Even though I am a trainer of English teachers, I found many vocabulary words that were unfamiliar. A right click gives an instant dictionary, and I had to use that feature more than I liked, along with a big font.The characters are amazingly well described, even as they develop chronologically, and although some aspects of the story are predictable (i.e Joseph the blacksmith and Biddy's romance) some are completly unanticipated and surprising.I like the ending in this version- it leaves hopeful possibilities!For free, this is the best bargain I ever purchased- hours of joy- so thank you Amazon..."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I read this book as a freelance. I really enjoyed this book, especially because it isn't cliche. The events that were portrayed in this book were events that a reader would not typically expect. The old english styled language at first was a bit difficult to comprehend the first few chapters, so it took me a while to read them. However, after a couple chapters, I became adapted to the use of language and sentence structure that it became easier to read and comprehend."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Of course, this is a wonderful book, but it is brought to life by the BBC audiobook. I don't know the reader/actor's name, but he is a master at providing individual, dynamic voices for every character - voices with personalities that match the character, as well. It added so much to the enjoyment when compared to other audiobooks read by lesser actors.

Enjoyed it just as much as then - some of Dickens books are very hard to get through but this one, along with several others such as a Tale of Two Cities, are easy to read and not outdated as a lot of older books are.

I remember having to read and write book reports on musty old classic books in school, dull and boring. Now I am ready to enjoy these books. Great Expectations shows how much of our lives are lived on incomplete information. The hero assumes that he knows who is guiding and helping him to live and grow beyound his simple beginnings, only to discover at the end that nothing he assumed was true. The hero does live up to the expectations of his benefactor, and beyond the expectations of many others. He also finds out what it is to be given a better future and how much you owe to those that believe in you.

Not me. Granted, part of the reason I enjoyed this book so much was because I had expected it not to be (A Tale of Two Cities is still collecting dust on my bookshelf). The writing is flawless; characters, wonderfully varied; and plot, save an occasional feeling of contrivance at the almost uncanny character interconnections, spectacular.Pip, an orphan, lives with his 20 plus years older sister Georgiana \\"Mrs. Joe\\" Gargery, an unhappy woman who \\"rampages\\" on him and her blacksmith husband Joe, a simple, kind man. During an unexpected encounter with a shackled escaped convict, he is coerced into helping the man to prevent bodily injury to himself. It's not the last the boy will see of him. Pip is later asked to visit an eccentric woman (having been left at the altar by a scheming fianc&eacute;), where he encounters the beautiful but cold Estella, a future love interest, and several other central characters. Eventually an anonymous donor provides monetary help to Pip hoping that it will facilitate his becoming a gentleman and a scholar. But as his financial situation changes from meager but adequate to one of relative wealth, his personality transforms from kindhearted and unpretentious to inconsiderate and snobbish. Only through the adversity that follows his attempt to fulfill the expectations of his benefactor does Pip learn some important life lessons.Also good, Mr. Pip by Lloyd Jones (wish I hadn't read it before GE), An American Tragedy by Theodore Dreiser, and The Woman in White by Wilkie Collins."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"When I was a teenager, I loved Dickens. In later years, however, I abandoned Dickens for more overtly \\"intellectual\\" authors. The wonderful thing about great books is that they do not suffer from multiple readings. Returning to Great Expectations after maybe 20 years was a delight. It is simple, accessible, gently humorous and heartbreaking. Dickens' love of language is simply a joy to experience. The novel is beautiful, effusive and yet tinged with Pip's own discomfort of class and self. Dickens holds his own as the Master Storyteller of the 19th Century."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"All the standard Dickensian motifs are present in this book: deus ex machinae, factitious coincidences, longueurs, inventive names, an empathy towards children in a world of pompous adults, and sheer expository brilliance.Dickens paints a picture in your mind...you see the country, smell the air, and hear the voices of the characters as if they are actually speaking. This being Dickens, you must allow for some patness in the plot...grant that, and then you can enjoy the genius of his phrases, metaphors, characterizations, and recounting of the absurd.(Wopsle's go at Hamlet in London should have you laughing out loud.)This is an excellent book...a classic."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"A dark night. A pair of escaped convicts; a young boy named Pip who is seven years old. Pip helps the convict Magwitch with food and drink. Magwitch is sent in chains to banishment in distant Australia. Pip living at the forge of Joe Gargery and Pip's sister (Joe's wife) becomes an apprentice blacksmith. Pip also meets the enigmatic Miss Havisham who dresses in a yellow wedding dress lamenting her lost love. At Satis her estate he encounter Estella (star) who becomes the love of his life. Estella is as cold as an Eskimo and her heart as icy as Mt. Everest. He also meets Herbert Pocket who becomes his best friend.In part two we see Pip moving to London as he and Herbert become dissolute, fall into debt and live shallow lives.In part three secrets are revealed which make Pip a good man. We learn that it was the convict Magwitch who provided the funds needed to allow Pip to go to London and work for Mr. Jaggers the lawyer. We discover who is the father and who the mother of Estella. We learn what happened to Magwitch and all other mysteries are revealed. To give these secrets away in this review would ruin the pleasure of reading this classic novel.Great Expectations is a bildungsroman which is darker and more inttrospective that Dickens earlier David Copperfield of 1850. In it we see Pip grow from a selfish callow boy to a man who has suffered, helped others and been reunited with his lost love.Along the way we meet such immortal characters as Joe Gargery and his loving wife Biddy; the tragic Miss Haversham; the evil Orlick and Compeyson and the complex convict Magwith.The novel is cinematic in its ending as Magwitch returns to England to see how Pip is doing as a young man who has lived on the convicts benevolent financial bequest.Some critics believe that Estella is a representative of Dickens mistress Ellen Ternan. The novel is well plotted and moves quicker than many Dickens novels. This 1861 novel is narrated in the first person by Pip and was the last completed novel in the prolific Boz's illustrious career.Great Expectations should be read by everyone who loves English literature and Charles Dickens."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"This is a wonderful story that Everyman's Library has place in great binding."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"If you have a student who either hates to read or struggles to read I would highly recommend this audio book. This unabridged version brings the Dicken's story to life. There are 16 CD's to listen to, but it is an enjoyable experience."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Dickens's Great Expectations is a novel of exceeding quality with, perhaps, only a few minor flaws that fail to significantly detract from the overall greatness of the work. Were I able to, I would give the book four and a half stars, rather than the four I've assigned it. As other reviewers have already amply commented on the book's numerous merits, I should like only to point out , what I thought to be, its foremost shortcoming. Although intentional by Dickens, I found my extreme dislike of Pip for much of the book to be a nuisance, chiefly because, as narrator, Pip set the tone of the narrative. It can be difficult not to equate the loathing of the narrator with the book itself. Luckily enough this was not a particularly prominent failing, and did not heavily tax me. Besides this, I found the book to be splendid, particularly during the bits concerning Joe and Mr. Wemmick, who were, at times, heartwarming and emotionally evocative to an extreme degree. In short, Great Expectations is one of Dickens's greats, with only minor, easily overlooked flaws."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"It is impossible to exaggerate the satisfaction this book gives to its reader and the power of its deep human sympathy. If you were to read only ten books in your lifetime, Charles Dickens' GREAT EXPECTATIONS should be one of them.If you were to listen to just one audiobook in your life, Frank Muller's narration of Great Expectations should be it. One of the most complimentary things that can be said of such a performance is that it leaves you feeling that the work can be read only in that way. Muller accomplishes this, with the curious and endearing twist that Pip's own narration comes with an American accent, while all others speak in the unforgettable idiom of their place among the English classes and subclasses. Muller on Dickens is a triumph that even Dickens would have applauded.Now, for the book. The personae will stay with you forever. Pip himself. The deeply generous Joe Gargery. The immortally beautiful Estella, her heart in the end made soft through suffering. Miss Havisham, too terrible to believed but in the end redeemed from her lake of bitterness, if her cry, 'What have I done?!' is to be taken innocently. Wemmick and the Aged P, then - belatedly, Miss Skiffens the gloved. Herbert, then Herbert and Clara.Jaggers, about whom one is left to ponder, 'Who *is* this man?'Dickens and Muller are at their best with scoundrels. Expectations provides them no shortage of villains upon whom to practice. Pumblechook. Bentley Drummle. Old Orlick. Compeyson, about whom the best thing said is that he has drowned.Dickens' keen eye for the glory and the pathetic depths of humanity is almost unparalleled in English literature, with apologies to his critics. He knows that there are Gargeries and Biddies and Herberts. He understands this without for a moment denying the hell in human hearts that is comprised by the likes of Pumblechook with his false respectability and Orlick with his violent, drooling hatreds.He has comprehended that heaven - if he believed there is such a place - is likely populated by people surnamed Havisham, Jaggers, and Magwitch, who perhaps dance the more vigorously for having been much forgiven.Yet writing *about* Dickens and his worlds takes time that could be spend on reading Dickens and of his worlds.For that you'll need to pick up Great Expectations."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Michael Page gives a wonderful performance that brings \\"Great Expectations\\" to life. I have a minor complaint regarding the editing of the CD -- several of the chapters had the last word or two of narration cut off.Note that this is a MP3 CD which cannot be used in standard audio CD players."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I didn't enjoy this book in high school back in 2000. I am re-reading this book again after 12 years.What an amazing gift we have inherited from Charles Dickens. I am enjoying revisiting the Victorian society again."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I was compelled to read Dickens (\\"A Tale of Two Cities,\\" in my case) in eighth grade and decided that I didn't like his writing. I managed to avoid Dickens and the Victorian novelists for several years, even as an English major. It wasn't until I was in my mid-20s that I read \\"Great Expectations,\\" and I'm glad that was so, because I was finally ready to appreciate Dickens. If you've ever picked up a Dickens novel and put it back down with relief, you might try again in a few years. If you do, \\"Great Expectations\\" is an excellent choice for meeting, or for encountering again, this amazing author.Like \\"David Copperfield,\\" this novel is written throughout in the first person, and follows the title character from childhood to adulthood. The first-person point of view gives the story vividness and impact, as we see everything that unfolds through Pip's eyes. The difference between the perspective of Pip the boy and Pip the adult, looking back and writing, colors the plot and creates suspense.There are many possible reasons to read this book (other than having it assigned to you, of course).You could read it for its astonishing characters -- Miss Havisham, defiantly moldering away and shut up in her never-used wedding finery; Magwitch, the escaped convict with a backstory you'd never expect; Joe Gargery, the blacksmith whose external roughness is matched only by his inner tenderness; Estella, as self-divided and self-destructive as she is beautiful. You could read it for its settings -- the spooky marshes, the busy streets of London, the gothic horrors of Satis House. You could read it for the plot -- the hidden connections, unexpected reversals, and ambiguous endings. You could read it for its social criticism -- the comprehensive view of working-class, middle-class, and upwardly-aspriring characters; the insight into what people will do to themselves and others for money; the unsparing look at ideas of gentility versus actual nobility of character. You could read it for its language -- the idiosyncratic dialects, the indelible scenes, the variety of prose rhythms Dickens employs.In the end, there are two main reasons to read this novel: pleasure and wisdom. \\"Great Expectations\\" is of its time without being dated, and can be enjoyed as a satisfying story. The themes Dickens addresses are timeless, and speak to the 21st century as forcefully as they spoke to the 19th.This isn't my all time favorite Dickens novel -- that would be \\"Bleak House,\\" followed by \\"David Copperfield\\" -- but it's one of his best. If you've never tried it, or if it's been a while since you did, give it a try. You may well become a Dickens addict."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"The DK series of classics are great!

I loved the book then, and I love the book now. It is easily one of the best books that Dickens' has written and well worth the read for everyone. It is a very long book at 50+ chapters but this is due to it following the life of the main character from a young child through to adulthood and his experiences with fear, hardship, love, and more."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I read this book in high school and loved it! Charles Dickens is one of my favorite authors of all time next to Sparks, Crichton, Irving, Brewer, and Bradbury. The story follows the inheritance into wealth of a fourteen year-old in 18th century England. Told with detail, finesse and a mystery that will keep you hooked, don't miss out on this first rate literary experience.The young orphaned Pip, the sensual Estella: the boy's love interest, the enigmatic and vengeful Miss Havisham in her bridal wear. These are images you will never forget. Pick up a copy (unabridged if you can) and loose yourself in this carefully and masterfully wroght world.I also recommend John Irving's works, mainstream fiction, and Dandilion Wine by Ray Bradbury. Also look for the edition with the forward by Irving and the original ending.Check them out and buy while prices are cheap!"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Great Expectations read by Michael Page, unabridged on 16 audio CDs, was a great listening experience. I've had my copy of the book on the shelf for years, but never got around to reading it. Unfortunately, I spend more time driving than reading. Michael Page did a fine job reading all the roles with distinctive voices for each character, male and female. The total listening time was about 20 hours. There were many tracks on each CD. So if your CD player only remembers which track was playing when you stopped it, then probably the most you will have to repeat when you re-start the disk would be about 40 seconds. The recording quality was good, but the duplication process less than perfect. There was 1 disk out of the 16 that had some \\"popping\\" sounds. I do not know if every copy of the audio book will have 1 disk with some static, but my copy did. It was a little annoying, but was not too bad. The audio book was produced by Brilliance Audio of Grand Haven, Michigan. The bio on the box says that Michael Page is a Professor of Theater at Calvin College. I was impressed and entertained by his reading. He did sound British!"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"\`Great Expectations' is one of my favourite Charles Dickens', second only to A Tale of Two Cities. Those who are not habituated to his style of writing may find it a bit difficult, but eventually that hurdle too would be overcome and the reader can enjoy the work of one of the finest authors of all time to its fullest.Phillip Pirrip was an orphan living with his dominating elder sister with no great ambition for the future, other than to become a blacksmith like his brother-in-law, Joe Gargery. But that was before he inherited a large amount of money from a mysterious benefactor. Now, leaving behind his shallow ambitions and old acquaintances, Pip follows his dream of becoming a \`gentleman'. Then maybe the beautiful but cold-hearted, Estella, the ward of the eccentric Miss Havisham, would accept his love for her. But will the unsolved mysteries of his past hinder him from fulfilling his \`Great Expectations'?Though Great Expectations first appeared in Dickens' weekly magazine, All the Year Round, more than a century back the story and the characters of the book still live on. Like all other books by Charles Dickens \`Great Expectations' too, does not just tell a story but also gives a message to its readers. Pip after coming into his inheritance starts ignoring his old friends because he feels that they are inferior to him, little realizing that they were the ones who loved and cared for him when he had no money. This situation is not something unique or something that can be related to only by the people of that time. This happens with almost every one of us. Once we achieve our goals we conveniently forget about those who helped us reach that goal. The way Dickens' has woven this message in his unforgettable story makes the book all the more beautiful. One thing I liked about this book is how all the seemingly unconnected characters seemed to fit together like the missing piece of a jigsaw puzzle by the end. What makes this book truly unforgettable is its characters. Every character of the book has an eccentric side to them. The only character that I think is \\"normal\\" is Pip and I did not find him interesting at all (I like eccentric characters. Am I weird?). Maybe that's how the author wanted it to be. Though the book has only a few female leads, they are the ones who steal the limelight. The eccentric Miss Havisham who sits in a room with a rotting wedding cake, wearing her wedding dress seemed more alluring to me than any of the other characters. It was her eccentricity that truly attracted me to her. If she had been some old, moody spinster, I would not have liked her half as much.Though I have repeated the point more than once, but \`Great Expectations' is truly an unforgettable book. Combined with prolific writing and memorable characters, this book is something which should be read at least once by all.Favourite Quotes:\\"Suffering has been stronger than all other teaching, and has taught me to understand what your heart used to be.

Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"To say Great Expectation is \\"Classic\\" novel is an understatement! We were forced to read portions of this novel in the ninth grade. I can honestly say I hated it! I found it weird and difficult. I am now 55 and decided it was time to check out Charles Dickens and find out what all the fuss was about. Having completed two of his greatest novels, Great Expectations and David Copperfield, I am a Dicken's fan for life! As an author, I realize how much I have missed. I love the old-english style of writing, the great history of Britain, and the downhome stories of boys, which seems to be Mr. Dicken's love. I am sadly impressed of the mistreatment of children of that era and am surprised that any were able to rise to achievement. What was true then, is true now - if we are to achieve anything in life - no matter our past, we must pull ourselves up by the boostraps and become... Excellent read. I enjoyed watching Pip come full circle from a poor boy to wealth to realizing a simple, honest life is to be desired.

This is the worst, yet! I don't understand why students have to read classics that people rarely understand! I thought the book was pointless with nothing to look forward to while you're reading. Many books have a strong structure and basis where you want to know what will happen next, which keeps you reading on. This story has no meaning and Charles Dickens is going no where with this. Not to mention the characters are just plaing weird. Where in the world did Dickens get a bizarre lady like Miss Havisham, who is practically ill in the head? I would never recommend this book because it was boring, time consuming, and I can rarely consentrate on what I was reading. I'm glad I got over reading this. I'm sure the only people who read this book is the ones who are forced to, like myself. If I can give this book's rating as a no star, I would.

This ranks with Catch-22 and Huckleberry Fin as one of the worst novels yet published in the English language. Was there a plot? No. Don't kid yourself. The fool author made it up as he went along not caring if it made sense or if the characters had any meaning. I hate this novel with a passion so great it scares even me. I'd like to see all copies burned. Okay, not really. That's a little extreme. But, at least take this garbage out of school curriculums. Its' making us stupid, making us believe Pip's world is what the world really is. Pip if a fool that got dumped too many times and where's the sex. Was Dickens scared of it. I believe that all great novels should have sex in them. It brings some humanity to them .

I had to read this book for my 9th grade honors English class. It was too long and boring. I see were Dickens was trying to go with the suspense, but it just made the book monotonous and boring. The uncanny coincidences just did not seem real. It's ok to use a coincidence as a tool of suspense, but this was just overkill. Every chapter was boring. I got tired pretty quickly of pip wishing he were with Estella for the whole book. Also, the book seemed to stray away from the main point for chapters at a time. Who cares about Wemmick's stupid plays? This could all be summed up in a couple of page short story. In conclusion, this is another swing and a miss for Dickens. STAY FAR AWAY FROM THIS BOOK! If you want to read a good Dickens story, read \\"A Christmas Carol\\" and nothing else written by Charles Dickens."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I read this book for my Honors English class and it was terrible!

We had &quot;Great Expectations&quot; before the matinee last week. The matinee was &quot;Smoky the Cowhorse.&quot; It was Martian Thanksgiving, so &quot;Awful (great (yeah right!)) Expectations&quot; was a good choice, because it is so freakin' long, and low in cholesterol. I am on a strictly bad classics diet. The Martian Major Leagues starts today, so I grilled a warthog.One of the reasons that I found this book (in terms of literature, not food) so disturbing is because the Martian term for a hemmohroid is a pip. In terms of food, it could have used a bit more seasoning, like a trip to Denmark. Of course, they didn't actually go to Denmark. If instead of being named &quot;Magwitch&quot; the convict had been called Bozo the Clown, and gave Pip balloon animals instead of money, I would have enjoyed the book much more.But, the thing that ticked me off the most (and Auntie, too!) was the way that Dickens never ended his sentences: instead, he just ran them on and on and on and on and punctuated them only with commas and semicolons, as if to say, &quot;this is my book, feel free to fall asleep; or, you could eat it&quot;: that reminds me of a very funny story about a man named &quot;Kitty&quot;...WHACK!(Auntie just hit me over my other head with a frying pan).

The story moves so slowly that at times you'd swear it wasn't moving at all, and, to be sure, at times, it isn't! It's just sitting there in its stupid rocking chair knitting and petting its cat by the fire, which isn't even burning! OMG!You want to read something fast paced and interesting?Try Daniel White's Hellstone, available right here at amazon.com (plug). Now that's a good book. White's influences span the ages, and don't skip Victorian, if that's what you're into, which you obviously are, or why would you be here?Don't get me wrong. I like Victorian literature. A Christmas Carol is a very good story, as is Dracula, and Frankenstein, and most of Poe's works. It's just this particular book that I don't like...and anything by Jane Austen.In conclusion, buy Hellstone. You'll be happy you did."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I have been a great reader my entire life, having read and enjoyed many classics as well as the modern books of today, but never in my life have I had such a difficult time getting through a book. I usually fly through novels within a few days, but getting through this one is likened to going through a maze in the dark. I give it two stars because I do think the plot was interesting, but the execution was abominably horrible. I actually had to have a dictionary next to me in order to understand all the weird words Dickens used, words such as 'peppercorny' and 'farinaceous.' Now, I usually pride myself on having quite an excellent English vocabulary, but I felt utterly lost when trying to read this book. Some of the dialogue was completely unfathomable and pointless, and about a quarter of the time I did not have a clue as to what he were talking about. Many of the characters were annoying, Mr. Pumblechook for example. I cringed during the chapter when he saw Pip, after Pip had become a gentleman, and the stupid man kept saying \\"May I? May I?\\" Ugh. There was so much this book could have done with out; the endless pointless descriptions, the useless minor characters, and the stupidity of some of them was unbearable. What I mean by that is Miss Havisham's voluntary reclusive existence; I mean, how can somebody live like that without going completely insane, just sitting in the dark day after day, wearing the same clothes, and throwing her life away for a man who was only after her money? Stupid and lame that was, if mildly noble (her behavior). I cannot understand why Dickens is so praised as a writer. His plot may be good in this book, but it is terribly written. I have made two attempts in my life to read this book. The first time, I got about halfway through and had to stop because it was about as enjoyable as plucking my eyebrows. A few years later, the second attempt got me to about the 42nd chapter, but again, my interest fizzled out. I do not think I will ever finish this book, and would only advise reading it if you have trouble sleeping, because it will knock you out fast. As a final note, I could not get through Oliver Twist either. Again, a great plot, but poorly written."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Reading GREAT EXPECTATIONS as a 14 year old high school student in 1967 helped me acquire a clearer understanding of the concept of infinity.

He takes the whole chapter. I don't recomend this for anyone. Only read it if forced to.

The characters are somewhat colorful and eccentric, but Pip, the main character appears to be a weak individual. It seems to fit the ideal English novel, not a fast moving plot, but revalations still happen none the less."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I was forced to read this book in school.

This story will make you smile, cry, dream, feel betrayed, and laugh very hard. Charles Dickens make the reader see his character for who they really are through there eccentric action and responses. Read it. These is a classic and my favorite Dicken's novel. Fall in love with and his often misguided heart."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"It's ridiculous to review Dickens, who is as secure in the Western canon as Shakespeare. Nonetheless, I'll make two points about \\"Great Expectations\\", which is the first Dickens novel I've read since my adolescence. (Kennedy was President, alas.)First, I'll say that the characters in this book are affecting exaggerations and not quite real. For example, Joe Gargery, the blacksmith, is touching in his decency and saintly in his generosity. But Dickens gives him no rough emotional edges, and so he never rises beyond rustic sentimentality. Likewise, Hebert Pocket, Pip's friend, is a lovely young man but exists in friendship with out making any demands. And, there is the resolute and controlling Mrs. Havisham and her pathetic martyrdom. Yes, she was hurt by a man. But, it's hard to imagine a person living in the filth and disorder of her mansion, unless she is crazed, like a modern street person. To sum this up, I'd say that his characters are not really persuasive, even though they resonate emotionally.Second, I was surprised by the near total lack of visual effects in the writing. Early on, there's a moment of visual writing when young Pip is in the cemetery. But thereafter, this element is all but lacking in the book. Even after several re-readings, for example, I could never quite see Magwitch tumble into the river.Regardless, I enjoyed the read and did not find it discursive or too long. Go for it!"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I liked this book even though sometimes I couldn't understand it. Charles Dickens used a lot of words he didn't need to, and he used a lot of big words that needed to be looked up. There was a lot of parts that I did not understand. Otherwise it was a pretty good story when I knew what was going on. I would recommend this book to other people because you learn about the lifestyles back then."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"This novel was pretty good. I liked how everyone's lives in it were somehow connected. I also liked how Pip matures and learns the big lessons of life.One thing I didn't really like about it was that it was hard to understand. The English dialect was hard to follow, all the different names were hard to sort out, and there were manyold-time-ish and confusing words. But other than the confusion, the story line was great and Dickens wrote it really well and brought everything and everyone in the book together nicely. All of the characters were fun to read about and Dickens made them seem interesting and some very weird. I would recommend this book to anyone because it seems like anyone could connect with the characters in this book."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"This book seems interesting as you would expect from Dickens, but I must admit that i found it boring. I only got past the first chapter, and found my self asleep. I think that the plot is a good structure that could be updated very well. If you can get past the boring language you will definitely enjoy it. If you went in with 'great expectations',then i doubt that you will come out with great pleasure. if you are put off by this review, hten check out the 1930's version starring the late Alec Guiness- it's absolutely brilliant!"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I was assigned to read this book for my English class and I have never read a more stupendously boring book.It's almost 500 pages long and has a story that could be told in half that.A poor, young orphan has aspirations to one day be a respectable gentleman.Big deal. GE is a revered book but it lacks everything that makes a book truly great.There is very little theme or characterisation and the plot is virtually non existant.THe chapters are so long and meandering you have to force yourself to read them.You keep reading waiting for something,anything to happen. The characters are unlikable.Pip comes across as a snob who thinks he's he's better then those around simply because he has higher aspirations then they do.Ms.Havisham,a recluse who wears her old wedding dress and keeps her decayed,untouched wedding cake,is a weird,unappealing freak.And Estella is the dictionary definition of bitchy.

At the end of the first phase he goes to London to become a &quot;gentleman&quot; because that is what his benefactor wants (Pip doesn't know his benefactor). At the end of the 2nd phase, he finds out who his benefactor is. Those two phases in the book are really boring, but I think it gets better in the end. If you read this book I suggest that you just start in the third phase because the rest is boring."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I liked this book because of all the suspence because you have to wait to find out about Pip's benefactor, and why Miss.havisham is so mean, and if Estella likes Pip, and who the convict is.I didn't lie it because, I didn't understand that Pip was getting any older, and there were to many names, ex: Magwitch, Provis, I had no clue that they were the same person, untill my teacher explained that Charles Dickens did that with many other characters names."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Boring, pointless story of a pathetic imbecile whose life seems to be not much more than a bizarre journey through an insane asylum.

We had &quot;Great Expectations&quot; before the matinee last week. The matinee was &quot;Smoky the Cowhorse.&quot; It was Martian Thanksgiving, so &quot;Awful (great (yeah right!)) Expectations&quot; was a good choice, because it is so freakin' long, and low in cholesterol. I am on a strictly bad classics diet. The Martian Major Leagues starts today, so I grilled a warthog.One of the reasons that I found this book (in terms of literature, not food) so disturbing is because the Martian term for a hemmohroid is a pip. In terms of food, it could have used a bit more seasoning, like a trip to Denmark. Of course, they didn't actually go to Denmark. If instead of being named &quot;Magwitch&quot; the convict had been called Bozo the Clown, and gave Pip balloon animals instead of money, I would have enjoyed the book much more.But, the thing that ticked me off the most (and Auntie, too!) was the way that Dickens never ended his sentences: instead, he just ran them on and on and on and on and punctuated them only with commas and semicolons, as if to say, &quot;this is my book, feel free to fall asleep; or, you could eat it&quot;: that reminds me of a very funny story about a man named &quot;Kitty&quot;...WHACK!(Auntie just hit me over my other head with a frying pan).

I realized Pip's selfishness once the wealth settled on him, and realized his turn-a-bout after losing everything to his name.

While not as emotionally satisfying as the earlier &quot;David Coppefield,&quot; it is nevertheless tighter, more compact, and displays a greater maturity and discipline of writing style on Dickens' part. Those who feel 'Copperfield' has all the characters, take note of the ensemble here-- Pip, Joe Gargery, Biddy, Mr. Jaggers, Uncle Pumblechook, Abel Magwitch, Estella, and the novel's haunting, living spectral figure, Miss Havisham. The intertwining of these lives, the playing out of these destinies, combined with its memorably Gothic beginning and unsettling ambiguous ending make &quot;Great Expectations&quot; a pleasure to read for both its narrative power and literary craftsmanship. Considered by many to be Dickens' &quot;best rounded&quot; story, I concur by offering this example. Having finished the novel, I craved a viewing of David Lean's brilliant 1947 film. I ended up by mistake with the Ethan Hawke Gwyneth Paltrow 1998 remake. I decided to give it a try, and was so enraptured by the look of the film and its grasp of the material I stayed with it. Not as satisfying as Lean's film, to be sure, but it works.

In classical Dickens style, Chuck makes a good social commentary or stirs some good emotions, yet does it way too slowly. The plot speeds and dies down, goes somewhere sometimes and goes nowhere even faster more often, and brings up characters who have no real purpose. Dickens is accused of being &quot;wordy,&quot; and I see why: British authors were often paid by the word and length of their novels and short stories. No wonder so-called classics like &quot;Tale of Two Cities&quot; and &quot;Great Expectations&quot; is heaped in a drudgery of fluff."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I had to do a report on Great Expectations, and this audio cassette helped me out so much.

Both are wonderful."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Great Expectations is a magnificent metaphor of humanity vs. life. It is the story of what each of us would probably do if placed in the situations Pip deals with. There are love, friendship, and warmth, which are nearly destroyed by obsession, discontent, and the desire to keep up appearances during the course of this powerful novel. These seemingly necessary emotions and acts of something near betrayal are finally exposed as cheap and worthless when the hero's true benefactor is known in the end. Pip, the main character, is something like all of us, and the people he encounters are very likely to be similar to those we encouter in our own lives."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I found that this novel was quite wonderful, really.

Of all the novels I've ever taught my students these 12 years I've been in Education, this novel, Great Expectations, by Charles Dickens, is by far the best! It is easy to read and understand, and it holds students' attention until the very end. The plot is like a roller coaster and all the characters seem to be connected in some way. The end of each chapter leaves the reader in suspense and anxious to continue reading. Although the setting of the novel takes place in 19th century England, the novel's themes and the characters' experiences seem to relate to all social classes, races, and both genders. Even my students at an inner-city high school in Atlanta rush home to read ahead to find out what will happen to Pip next!"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Yet another success by Charles Dickens, this book is sure to warm hearts of both children and adults everywhere.

I greatly enjoyed this book, with Charles Dickens' enticing use of imagery, it is sure to keep anyone reading. This book could make one cry, and smile. And to me, for it to cause any sort of such emotion, it has to be a truly lovely book to read. If you want a cozy, enticing book to read by the fire on a snow day, go ahead, and read the powerful story: \\"Great Expectations.\\""},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"\\"Great Expectations\\" by Charles Dickens is a very haunting novel. While the book portrays England as dreary, in a strange way it makes England seem like a nice place to live in. 1800s England as depicted in the novel has a lot of poor people. But the people seem nicer and more innocent minded then people are these days. Even the bad guys in the story seem more innocent minded then people these days.The book begins with a young child called Pip visiting his parents grave only to be stopped by an escaped convict who asks him for food and a file. Pip goes and gets these things secretly to avoid getting in trouble with his sister. Later on the convict is captured and before he is led away, he lies that he stole food from Pip's aunt's cupboard to Pip's uncle Joe and this saves Pip from getting in trouble for taking the food. After that, Pip gets a strange opportunity at a house called Satis House owned by a Miss Havisham. She pays his aunt to have Pip play with a beautiful girl called Estella. Later on, Pip is told by an aquaintance called Mr. Jagger that he has great expectations. He tells him that a secret benefactor has provided for Pip to be educated. Pip, jumps at this opportunity. He goes to live in a rented room and is educated all the time not knowing who is providing him with the sums to be educated. He continues to think about the beautiful girl Estella who shuns his advances.\\"Great Expectations is a very haunting novel. With the book, I got a full view of what life was like in England in the 1800s. The character Miss Havisham is really scary. Her house with its room where there is a decaying wedding cake is almost like a haunted house. The book contains no supernatural elements though and that's what is so amazing, that Charles Dickens manages to make it scary without putting ghosts or monsters in it. Miss Havisham was clearly a woman with a lot of potential who ruined her life because she couldn't get over a romance that went sour. I felt bad for her and hope people learn from her example.The character that really caught my attention was Estella. I have had experiences in my own life where I had a crush on a girl who didn't have a crush on me and so I knew what Pip was going through and related to his character in this respect. Its when they're young that men are haunted most by those feelings for a girl or a woman, it is clear though that Pip needs to move on and find another girl to get in a relationship with.All in all, Great Expectations is a good fast read even though it is not an adventure novel, which makes the novel even more amazing."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Just a wonderful enthralling read! I enjoyed this so much! I read this in high school but decided to read it again. I just did not appreciate the story line or the characters back as a teenager. I am so glad I decided to re-read this again! I am now going to work my way through more of Dickens novels. His character development is wonderful! The story line has twists and turns to keep the pages turning! You just don't know what you are missing by not reading this novel! Yes, I recommend!"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"There are few if any authors who could create such a variety of wonderful characters as Dickens has done in his many novels and short stories. They touch you and remain with you - even becoming icons. This is true in all Dickens novels, and it is no less true in this work. How bizarrely wonderful is Miss Havisham with her tattered and yellowed bridal gown and half century old wedding cake? Who else could come up with such a marvelous character?"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I'm not going to say much about the story, because you probably already know it. I first discovered the book over 40 years ago in high school.But I really appreciated this edition. As a forward, there is an overview of the book, pointing out things to help you understand them when you read them. It also clarifies some of the points made. It doesn't say anything about Pip suffering from depression, but I think he does, which contributes to his low self-esteem.Then at the back of the book, there is a section of notes, including the original ending. There are also notes on some of the words used or articles mentioned in the book.All in all, this was a wonderful read and look forward to reading it again."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Great Expectations is hailed as a one of the great masterpieces in literature and for good reason. However, it does drag in the beginning and current audiences may not be able to fight through to reap the rewards this book gives out. Also, the language used in the book is not used currently in use and may throw off some readers. Midway threw the book I was enjoying Great Expectations, but disappointed in the pace and flow and ready for it to quicken. But it did and I was enthralled with the final 200 pages."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"This is one of my favorite Dickens books, detailing a lifelong love story between Pip and Estella. So sometimes the circumstances aren't realistic - so what? TV shows these days aren't either. Pip is a likeable character, and the various other characters represent real forces in our society. This is a great novel."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Each time that I read Great Expectations I'm left wondering whether or not Pip would have been happier if he had never been made the gift of \\"great expectations.\\" More importantly, would he have been a better man if he had remained apprenticed to his blacksmith brother-in-law Joe rather than having been sent to London to be trained in the ways of a gentleman?Great Expectations is a Dickens cautionary tale in which the author warns his readers of what can so easily happen to a person when given the opportunity to \\"better himself\\" by leaving his home, family and friends behind for education and fortune-seeking in the big city. As soon as word reached the local townspeople around whom Pip had spent his early years that a fortune was soon to be his, Pip found himself treated with respect and awe by the very people who had had little time for him in the past other than to chastise his behavior and relationship with the sister who was raising him \\"by hand.\\" Their \\"boy\\" became \\"sir\\" overnight it seemed.But sadly, after arriving in London and seeking to impress his new friends and colleagues, Pip decided that those who loved him most were an embarrassment to his future prospects and he only occasionally felt any guilt about his lack of contact with them. It is only when Pip's future prospects shockingly take a turn for the worse that he seeks the comfort of the family that he left behind.Along the way, Dickens fills Great Expectations with some of the most memorable characters in British literature history. There are Miss Havisham, the spinster who never recovered from being jilted at the altar; Joe, the blacksmith and Pip's brother-in-law who never stopped loving Pip as a son no matter how much Pip neglected him over the years; Estella, the beautiful young woman whom Pip has loved since they were small children but who has been raised by Miss Havisham to give her heart to no man; Herbert, Pip's best London friend, a truly good man who both benefits from Pip's help and who eventually offers Pip a new future of his own; and, of course, Magwitch, the colorful escaped criminal whom Pip meets in the first pages of the book.This is one of those books that I read every few years because re-reading it is like visiting an old friend after too long an absence. As the old memories come back, it's like I've never been away."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"First of all (as I like to say!) I'm no smarter than you and I thought this book was great, that said, this book is not THE easiest to read in that it does take a while for things to get really interesting. I rated it 5 stars because it is excellent but you need to have some patience with this book, in the end it is much worth the effort....and keep me updated!"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I don't know what you guys are talking about. If you're a serious reader - and I expect you are if you willingly attempt this book - then there shouldn't be a problem getting into it. Dickens is far easier to read then Dostoevsky or Tolstoy or even Hawthorne or James.You have to understand that you can't skim the classics. If you do, then you miss out on subtle prompts and hints. In fact, any good book should have some buried clues, clues that if you don't pick up, the plot will be confusing or pointless. That's what makes these kinds of books great, the challenge and the reward, plus the wonders they do for your vocabulary.If you want books you can skim over before bedtime and still pick up the plot and characters, that's fine, not everyone needs to be a serious reader. However, don't go around bashing great books that you shouldn't be reading, because you might turn off somebody who will really enjoy it.If you have a real problem with the book, mention the plot, or accurately describe why you don't like the writing style."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Great Expectations is truly one of Dickens' best works. It is long but there is so much to offer - rich, memorable characters, universal themes, exciting adventure, unrequited love, murder, mystery, and revenge. The plot touches heavily upon social class distinctions, education, economics and crime and punishment. Issues that still resonate with the modern reader today.Great Expectations, famously, begins in a cemetery where the orphaned Pip is visiting the graves of his parents. There he encounters an escaped convict from a nearby prison ship who is to change his life though Pip will not understand fully how until many years later. As the book continues he meets many surreal characters with perhaps the most memorable being Miss Havisham, the crazed jilted bride, whose manipulations in regard to Pip and her adopted daughter,Estella, break Pip's heart and leave Estella a shallow, empty woman. Another one of Dickens more famous characters appearing in Great Expectations is Pip's guardian, Jaggers, the successful and possibly compulsive obsessive, attorney. Less well known but equally memorable appearances are made by Pip's loyal friend Herbert Pocket whose unusual family provide comic relief and social satire, Pip's brother-in-law the kind but uneducated Joe Gargory, Mrs. Joe, Pip's shrewish sister who is raising Pip \\"by hand\\", Jagger's assistant Wemmick who neatly divides his home life and his work life plus a host of others. Life in 19th century England - both London and it's small towns - are masterfully kept alive by Dickens' sure contemporary descriptions."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"My first complete Dickens book was \\"A Tale of Two Cities.\\" Since that was an idealistic romance novel, this book rather surprised me with its portrayals of the darker side of human nature. Instead of heart-wrending sacrifices, I found painful ingratitude. Instead of perfect heroines, I found scheming, insensitive women. This book was not anything I expected with regards to characterization and theme. However, I would have to say this book exemplifies human nature much, much better. It was not a very entertaining read at all, but the craftsmanship and word employment simply could not be better. This book may not turn one's daydreams on paper, but it is a solid, landmark work of literature."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"My daughter had to read \\"Great Expectations\\" for 9th grade English,she was short of time and a slow reader. This unabridged version really filled the bill. She could listen while being otherwise engaged or read along with the book. The Actor/reader is the same one who read all of the Harry Potter books. Well read and helped keep her interest."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I wanted to revisit this \\"classic\\", having read it in high school and remembering it fondly. I was not disappointed, for I found the story more applicable to my life now, ten years later, than at the time of my first reading. Back then, it seemed a good yarn - lots of fun characters, intriguing plot twists - a grand adventure. Upon rereading, I was able to absorb the story while thinking about my own \\"coming of age\\", and weigh the morality of Pip's universe. At the same time, my original impressions were not misguided - the moral/societal questions Dickens explores are layered into the fun characters and strong plot development.In addition, there are some interesting \\"reading group\\" questions at the back, as well as some interesting commentary by various authors since the time of the original publication. For that reason, I would recommend this edition."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Above all what I loved about this book was how all the characters came together and were somehow related in some surprising way. The book was very well written. I had to read this book for school and I'm glad that I was forced to or I might never have chosen to read this book. The language was very understandable unlike some other books I've read from that time period. I really recommend it."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"One of the great novels in the English language. It would be presumptuous of me to add more. Most readers would benefit from reading this book. My first time was forty years ago.

A wonderful novel of Pip who comes into his \\"great expectations\\" via an unknown benefactor -- who he believes to be Miss Havisham. We see how the influence of money and position affect Pip's relations with his family and former neighbors, and not necessarily for the better. There are lots of surprise twists and turns in the plot, especially about Miss Havisham and her adopted \\"daughter\\" Estella and her true parentage.As always, a Dickens novel is peopled with wonderful and unusual characters that eventually all play a part in telling the story. I noticed another reviewer said there were two endings. The version I read had only one ending and I don't know which one it was. I will have to search out another version to see which I liked best."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"First of all (as I like to say!)

Popular modern fiction is so often shallow, and as such seems a waste of time. Which is why I read Great Expectations, it has stood the test of time. I never read it in the past because I assumed that the prose would be somewhat archaic and difficult, but I was wrong, I found it very readable and surprisingly funny, which I also didn't expect. The funniest bits in my opinion are Pips first meeting with Miss Havisham and later his discription of his proceedure for doing his personal accounting, which I certainly identified with."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I did not want this to end!

And you absolutely forget that it is all one person reading. The wonderful descriptors Dickens so artfully paints in complete portraits and scenery with words, flow effortlessly, almost musically so that the it unfolds in the listeners mind as sure as one were reading Dickens' words. I found myself taking the long routes home as I listened in the car on commutes. I would be pleased to purchase any other set read by Michael Page, particularly from this period. Now if we could just get Page to record any of Wilkie Collins' work..."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"\\"Great Expectations\\" is a thoroughly engaging novel. We find a set of interweaving story lines that rival today's best movies ('Crash' comes to mind. Sorry! I digress, already.) Anyway, as usual, the protagonist and narrator, Pip, bears all the innocense of Dickens' best characters. He is able to observe all the qualities and idiosyncracies of the good, the bad, and the ugly in Victorian England. As another orphan character, he is \\"brought up by hand\\" by his strict and nasty sister with the help of his brother-in-law, Joe Gargery, a benevolent blacksmith. The plot moves quickly as he comes upon an escaped convict who coerces him to get him food and a file. He finds the experience all too much, for he is in a no-win situation. He manages to escape this escapade with grace, but not the situation his sister places him into. She forces him upon the company of Miss Havisham, an old, bitter woman who has never recovered from being jilted early in life. Through her he meets a young woman, named Estella, and falls hopelessly in love. Through Havisham's patronage, he becomes an apprenticed gentleman as well as Joe's apprenticed blacksmith; then he obtains wealth from a mysterious benefactor. From these experiences, he acquires a gentleman's demeanor as well as a gentleman's appetite for money.\\"Great Expectations\\" is a worthy classic book experience. The characters are drawn well, especially Miss Havisham. (The images Dickens uses for her and her surroundings are among the most memorable of the novel.) It defines what true wealth is, and juxtaposes well the pompous and the hypocritical characters with the genuine and good. 'Great Expectations' demonstrates, more than it preaches, about the virtues presented. Also, the plot lines run together in a way that is so skillful, it hardly seems contrived. There is also some good irony and suspense thrown in for good measure. \\"Great Expectations\\" is a decent and enjoyable reading voyage."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Great Expectations by Charles Dickens is a timeless 19th century novel that addresses issues in life that remain relevant today. In particular, it explores the modern individual's personal development through experiences that span from youth to adulthood.In Great Expectations, Dickens employs several techniques to effectively portray the personal development of the main character Pip. The title, Great Expectations, is significant because it reveals that the plot focuses on Pip's aspirations in life. The novel is a first person narrative, with an older Pip retelling and commenting on past events that had an influence on his social development. This element allows the reader to observe how a young Pip reacted to events in his life and how an older and more mature Pip interprets these events years later. A recurring theme throughout Great Expectations is the class system of Victorian England and the significance of social status. Pip struggles with the issue of social status throughout the novel and must come to the realization that social status is not connected to one's real character.In his novel Great Expectations, Charles Dickens combined aspects of his own life, with his knowledge of human behavior, to create a realistic portrayal of an individual's personal development. The novel's portrayal is so clear and its content so relevant that it continues to be read and analyzed over a century after it was first written."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"As young men and women, at some we must make the choice to stay in the community and be a humble fish in a little pond or strike out on our own in the big city.There are many ways to do this and Pip, the main character, does it scornfully although he does not know it at the time. Like so many people, he is lured by the bright lights, \\"sophisticated\\" culture and big money of the big city. He has no problem leaving behind a simple world where he is cared for via an unknown benefactor for an unknown reason. He guesses at whom the benefactor might be and what their intent is, but he gets it all wrong. He falls from the path of moral righteousness and has no idea what his life really means. Dickens masterfully crafts together this story. I think that Joe represented good Pip and Orlick was the alter ego. Additionally, I was kicking myself for not seeing a couple of plot twists, but I was so engrossed that I didn't see them coming. I hope the same thing happens to you.I wonder if F.S. Fitzgerald was influenced by Dickens because there is a fantasy like worship of the rich, followed by a downward spiraling degradation. Although F.S.F writes about the rich with outright contempt, Dickens neutrally accepts them more as a vehicle for the story.Anyway, I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Charles Dickens' novel Great Expectations explores the side of human nature that many do not like to read in novels. In the United States, in the 21st Century, people would rather read about romantic-style plots where all turns out well for the protagonists. Dickens, however, chooses to illuminate what man can really be capable of: betrayal, duplicity, unfaithfulness, and a handful of other negative characteristics.Definitely an interesting novel, Great Expectations will undoubtedly have its audience intrigued and constantly pondering.I would highly recommend this masterpiece."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Unlike many of the reviewers who wrote so passionately about this work it is not a book that has played a significant part in my reading life. The great narrative drive, the tremendous skill in creating vital characters, the richly descriptive and often ironic language are aspects of Dickens genius.But somehow the world of Dickens dark and gloomy and Victorian and so British reality never really appealed to me. This says nothing however about the quality of the work and its great gifts to the reader. The book is the portrayal of a society, and of a moral education. This is a book about the formation of a character through experience, about learning from life's difficulties and disappointments to become a better person. It is about ' recognition' not only of one's own true and better self, but about what is important in life. This book as Dickens himself has had enormous influence on Western literature. I think of two very different writers, Kafka and Salinger both of whom clearly had Dickens in mind in certain points of their writing. Pip, Magwitch , Joe Gargary,Miss Havisham, Estella are living characters in the heart of Western literature. The book then I believe is far greater, far more than my own reading has given me of it. Not always apparently does the reader do justice to the work."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"i was a assigned this book to read over the summer between 8th and 9th grade for my honors english (it seems as though many students are assigned this book going into 9th grade honors english. is it some sort of nation-wide standard?)... at parts the language can be thick and a little harder to decipher than most the language of most authors people my age are used to reading... this is only a slight hindrance, though, because about half way trhough the book (assuming this is your first dickens book, as it was for me) you get used to it and you seem to be talking like pip in real life!!!!!!! (well, a little bit for me because i read the book wuite quickly, seeing as how i loved it) i kept saying betwixt instead of between, which i enjoy saying now because it makes me feel smarter than evryone else (jk).... anyway, i was the single person in my class that absolutely LOVED this book... the only thing that i didn't like was taking EXTENSIVE nots throughout the book, which ruins many of the other books we read (such as the amazing lord of the flies).... aside from that, the book is quite good... not only is dickens able to hold my attention through most of the book (when i say most, i;m excyuding the part where they are planning that escape with provis, which i thought was boring), which is a huge feet for someone such as charles dickens, who i expected to bore the living daylights out of me... overall, the plot is very good, but the messages that it carries are even better... pip is driven by greed all throughout the book, until he becomes mentally ill... when he realizes what he's done, he becomes a new person, and is at peace with himself... the realationship between him and estella is very complex, too.. until very late in the book, he is captured by her beauty, he partakes in a blind love for her. by the end of the novel, after all he has been through with her, he gains a true love for her based on her qualities, not because she is rich and beautiful.. this love was always there, he just did not uncover the exactness of it until he grew as a person through his sever low. so many vivid characters, i can't even explain how good the characterization is int he book... IF YOU HAVEN'T READ THIS BOOK, READ IT NOW OR YOU WILL BE DISSAPOINTED LATER ON!!!!!! if you can, read it twice, as i plan to (probably next summer, so it isn't so fresh in my mind)... group discussion on the book really accentuate the meaning of the book... the meaning is really deep, and most people don't catch all of it. the lake is much deeper than the top of the seaweed, don't be afraid to plunge to the bottom...though this book did not completely enlighten me and totally change my life, i did learn from it, which is something that rarely comes in spades. in this case it comes in spades, hearts, diamons AND clubs...enough rambling for me, im sure your not even going to read that whole review, it was quite long...review in a nutshell: good book with good messages (plural) and an engrossing plot... READ IT!!!!!other good books: bleak house by dickens (my man), heart of darkness by joseph conrad, farhenheit 451 by ray bradbury, lord of the flies by william golding, siddartha by herman hesse (not many people have read this, WHY?!?!!?!?!??!), don quixote by cervantes, old man and the sea by earnest hemmingway... can't think of any more off the top of my head... oh yeah, dracula by bram stoker...thank you, good bye"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"this book was good and had many irony. its just didn't like it much because was boring for the early part.only the suspence kick up it was really nice to read..but the ending i didn't like cause it left me knowing that estela won't get with pip"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Reading for me is boring, but I was not bored for one second while reading this book.

I admire Pip because he is very young and the fact that he has to travel,work, and take care of his sick sister, he is a very good rolemodel. I also admire him because if a ex-convict came up to me, I would be so scared that I would run away. The fact that he trusted Magwitch with a lot of things really amazed me. Pip has gone through a lot of things with his family and his own personal life in a considerable amount of time and I admire him for that.

The resulting work, Great Expectations, was published weekly from December 1, 1860 to August 3, 1861. This was his second semi-autobiographical work, but where David Copperfield was a confident expression of faith in middle class values, Great Expectations offers a bleaker view of whether those values will lead to happiness. In fact, Dickens own marriage had just come to an end after many unhappy years. Indeed he had recently changed the name of the magazine from the more bucolic Household Words. Despite, or because, of this ambivalence, Great Expectations became one of his greatest achievements.Pip, a boy of the marshes, is being &quot;raised by hand&quot; by his shrieking harridan of an older sister and her seemingly doltish husband, the blacksmith Joe Gargery. One day, while visiting his parents' gravesite, Pip is accosted by an escaped convict who demands that he bring him a file and some &quot;wittles&quot;. When the convict, Abel Magwitch, is later captured, he accepts the blame for stealing the file and food before being carted back to prison.Shortly thereafter, Pip is invited up to Miss Havisham's manor house to play with her beautiful ward Estella. Miss Havisham's life came to a halt when she was jilted at the altar, all clocks are stopped at the hour of her betrayal, the feast lies rotting on tables &amp; she wanders about in the decaying wedding gown. Estella is to be the instrument of her revenge upon men.Eventually, &quot;Great Expectations&quot; are settled upon Pip when a secret benefactor sets up a trust in his name and sends him to London to be educated and become a gentleman. Pip assumes, and Havisham allows him to believe, that she is his benefactress and that he is being elevated to a position that will make him worthy of Estella.As Pip rises in society, he leaves Joe behind, despite the many kindnesses Joe had shown him growing up. He becomes a shallow arrogant middle class climber. So he is stunned when he discovers that he is actually benefiting from the secret wealth of Magwitch, who made a fortune in Australia after being transported. Moreover, Magwitch's unlawful return to England puts him and Pip in danger. Meanwhile, Estella has married another, a horrible man who Pip despises. Eventually, with Magwitch's recapture and death in prison and with his fortune gone, Pip ends up in debtors prison, but Joe redeems his debts and brings him home. Pip realizes that Magwitch was a more devoted friend to him than he ever was to Joe and with this realization Pip becomes, finally, a whole and decent human being.Originally, Dickens wrote a conclusion that made it clear that Pip and Estella will never be together, that Estella is finally too devoid of heart to love. But at the urging of others, he changed the ending and left it more open ended, with the possibility that Estella too has learned and grown from her experiences and her wretched marriages.This is the work of a mature novelist at the height of his powers. It has everything you could ask for in a novel: central characters who actually change and grow over the course of the story, becoming better people in the end; a plot laden with mystery and irony; amusing secondary characters; you name it, it's in here. I would rank it with A Tale of Two Cities, Oliver Twist and David Copperfield among the very best novels of the worlds greatest novelist.GRADE: A+"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Now I'll admit that when all is said and done I am a newborn to the world of so called classic literature. So when I was assigned to read Great Expectations for English class, I'll admit to being a little more than skeptical. However once I began to read the novel I discovered something. The novel wasn't that hard to understand. While it did take a while to get fully immersed in the novel, once you were in you really wanted to see the novel to its resolution. The prose was easy to understand, and the plot crossed generations easily. Maybe classics just have a bad reputation with the younger generation, but Great Expectations went a long way to helping to shorten that gap. I think the driving force that leads me to recommend this book is the fact that we all have great expectations of life, and that we all dream of improving our status in the world. People will always share a common bond, and in this novel Dicken's truly shows us that."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Like many other high schoolers who wrote reviews on this page, I was forced to read this in my freshman english class. I thought it was an extremely good story. The characters (my favorites being Orlick and Trabb's Boy) are brilliant and subtley funny. The story is creative and unpredictible, and overall, it was absolutely supberb. The only reason this book doesn't get 5 stars is because it tends to drag a lot of the time, and Dickens overlong descriptions are a bit grating on the nerves, but I DO understand why people would have liked it like that in the 1800's. They liked their books long and juicy. It's a bit dated but Great Expectations is well worth a read if you have the patience. Even if you are impatient, you can not miss this great story and its wonderful characters, so at least see one of the many great movie adaptions. My personal favorite movie version of Great Expectations is the 1999 Masterpiece theatre version."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Having not read this since high school (and not being able to finish it due to boredom), and now having the ability to rediscover it since it was a free download, i decided to give this book another whirl.I was pleasantly surprised....I loved it. I found the book to be moving, interesting, and an all around great read. It has all the classic Dickens-style plot twists, with some great surprises, as well as some pretty contrived coincidences (also classic Dickens).I only took off a star because the ending was changed from how i remembered it. When I googled it, I found that Dickens often changed the endings of his books in to go with the times..... not a big fan of that!!"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I just graduated with a Literature degree and, amazingly, had never read anything by Dickens. I had gained a sort of superiority to the man and his works. I would dismiss it as all sentimental unbelievabilities. But I decided to not be so proud and read one of his books. On a recommendation from one of my professors, I started with Great Expecations. What I found was a deeply engrossing, funny and humane book that captivated me for the week and a half that it took to read it. Much of it was very realistic (barring, of course, the unrealistic coincidences, that are actually, in their own way, quite comforting) and believable. Dickens went a long way to get into the mind of his narrator, and it works beautifully, as we struggle with Pip in every decision and look back with him at the bad decisions that he made. The themes of the novel (pride, isolation, friendship, hopeless love, etc.) can easily be translated into our own society, putting ourselves in the shoes of the characters as we deal with our mistakes and try to do the right thing. A very amazing book."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"There is no doubt that Charles Dickens' \\"Great Expectations\\" is a masterpiece. The intricacy of its plot has rarely been matched. Its characters are unforgettable. It speaks powerfully to what it means to be human.Pip is the perfect picture of flawed humanity. He is essentially well meaning, but his vision always seems to get cloudy at just the wrong time. Throughout the book, Pip falls prey to his dreams and infatuations. In the process he ignores those who truly love him. Only in the end does he learn, in catastrophic terms, the importance of love. Only then is able to accept it.\\"Great Expectations\\" is the story of Pip's learning process. Along the way we encounter some of Dickens greatest secondary characters: the fierce Mr. Jaggers, the self-centered and mentally unstable Mrs. Havisham and her heartless prodigy Estella, and Pip's great friend Joe.I give a special recommendation to this Bantam Classic edition of the work. Its introduction by John Irving is one of the greatest pieces of criticism ever written.Though not my favorite Dickens novel, I give \\"Great Expectations\\" a heartfelt recommendation."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Great Expectations succeeds beyond almost all novels of its time in exploring the roots of character and moral behavior. Charles Dickens makes the case for there being the potential for good in everyone. Evil and sin follow from a combination of being self-absorbed and selfish. What is remarkable about the way these themes are handled is that they are clearly based on an assessment of human psychology, long before that field was established.The book is also remarkable for its many indelibly memorable and complex characters. Miss Havisham, Pip, Magwitch, Mr. Jaggers, and Estella are characters you will think about again and again in years to come.The book also surrounds you with a powerful sense of place. Although the England described here is long gone, it becomes as immediate as a nightmare or a dream that you have just awakened from.For a book about moral questions, Great Expectations also abounds in action. The scenes involving Pip and Magwitch are especially notable for way action expresses character and thought.Great Expectations also reeks of irony, something that is seldom noticed in more modern novels. Overstatements are created to draw the irony out into the open, where it is unmistakable. Yet the overstatements attract, rather than repel. The overstatements are like the theatrical make up which makes actors and actresses look strange in the dressing room, but more real on the stage when seen from the audience.At the same time, the plot is deliciously complex in establishing and solving mysteries before that genre had been born. As you read Great Expectations, raise your expectations to assume that you will receive answers to any dangling details. By reading the book this way, you will appreciate the craft that Mr. Dickens employed much more.This is the third time that I have read Great Expectations over the last 40 years. I found the third reading to be by far the most rewarding. If you like the book, I encourage you to read it again in the future as well. You will find that the passage of time will change your perspective so that more nooks and crannies of the story will reveal themselves to you.If this is to be your first reading of the book, do be patient with the book's middle third. It may seem to you that the book is drifting off into a sleep-inducing torpor. Yet, important foundations are being lain for your eventual delight.Mr. Dickens wrote two endings for Great Expectations. Be sure to read both of them. Which one do you prefer? I find myself changing my mind.Give love with an open heart, without expectations!"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"All right. I admit it. The book starts out slow. Dickens, though I love the man, writes in such flowery and long winded language at times. What takes many authors a line or two, Dickens will devote whole pages.And I almost put the book down for that exact reason. I'm very happy I did not.With so many detailed threads in the story, the depth to the characters--when they all start to blend together a few chapters in, the result is page-turning.The story centers around a young boy--well, almost young man-- named Pip, and revolves around his growing into age. You cannot help but love the boy. Much of Pip's worry and concern I could relate to--falling in love with a girl who refuses to return your sentiments and only plays with your heart, growing up and leaving home for the first time, and discovering your true relationships with others and yourself, as shocking as they may turn out to be.I felt as if I was side by side with Pip through it all, and that made the novel a wonderful experience for me. I recommend the novel for the young because so much relates to them, and also for the older readers--because you can experience it all again.A wonderful and heart warming tale. Just get through those first chapters.The book is timeless, with the basic story line being one that has affected almost everyone sometime in their life; falling in love with somebody who does not return the feelings. Pip, the main character, falls in love with an exotic and beautiful girl, Estella, but of course she does not have any feelings for him. So Pip does everything he can to win her approval, and most importantly her heart. It is hard to skip around in the book. While some passages might seem as if they have nothing to do with the story, they do. Everything in the story is tied together somehow. Skimming the book is not going to help. Certain events and people the reader thinks are insignificant or forgot completley, will appear over and over throughout the book. I am glad that i decided to read Great Expectations, despite the negative remarks from peers. I found out that most of them never made it past the first few chapters, so they missed out on the good parts. The only reason I did not give the book a higher score is that parts of it are slow and dry, but stick with it, you will not be upset. --This text refers to the Mass Market Paperback edition."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Dickens, for whatever reason, never crossed my path in high school, and in the years since I have found myself intimidated to pick up one of his books. This year I resolved to get over that and selected 'Great Expectations' to be my first venture into Dickens' famous fictional worlds. And what joy! As it turns out I had no reason to be intimidated because Dickens is imminently readable and highly enjoyable.This novel is told from the point of view of Philip Pirrip, nicknamed Pip, who begins his tale as a young boy visiting the graves of his parents when an escaped convict happens upon him and threatens him into helping him get food. This experience will have a huge impact on Pip's life, although just how huge is left to be discovered until much later in the novel. Pip soon finds himself in the service of an eccentrically, manically wounded old woman and her beautiful but cold-hearted charge Estella, whom Pip is doomed to fall for and spend the rest of his days pining for. He begins to feel oppressed by his poor life, anguished that his miserable situation will never be good enough to win Estella's heart. And so it seems to be a blessing when a mysterious benefactor takes Pip away from his home to make a gentleman of him in London. Certainly Pip is pleased to have been \\"rescued\\", but over the course of his teaching a curious thing happens to him: he begins to lose the humanity that had made him such an upstanding young man in the first place. He forsakes relations with his loving family, judges his best friend as a great guy doomed to failure, and slowly allows his finances to spin out of control as he begins to spend more and more of his unnamed benefactor's money.'Great Expectations' is, ultimately, a journey of self discovery. Pip rises in society and leaves his life behind him without realizing just how much it had been worth to him. When he reflects on all that has happened to him and wonders if the inaptitude he had sensed in his friend \\"had never been in him at all, but had been in me,\\" it is a thoughtful discovery that really makes you think about what is truly important in your own life. What makes someone a success? Is it the amount of money in their bank account? Or is it the friendships they forge? Does someone need to be educated to be happy, or can they just be satisfied with what they have? Dickens pulls you along through Pip's story with a great deal of wit and a dash of cynicism that, refreshingly, serves to enlighten the reader rather than depress them. It is an intelligent and heartfelt novel that has become a classic for all of the right reasons, and is one that remains relevant to modern readers -- the true test of a classic, in my opinion. As for myself, I have been thoroughly enchanted by my first experience with Dickens, and look forward to reading many more of his books in the coming year."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Great Expectations was my first book by Charles Dickens, and I still believe it to be my favorite. It is a very powerful book that connects with people's lives all over. The main character,Pip, grows up in the home of a blacksmith. With both of his parents dead, he lives with his overreactive sister and her husband, Joe Gargery. Pip soon meets Miss Havisham and the beautiful Estella that lives with her. He longs to be a gentleman, but the social class division leaves Pip a blacksmith apprentice, and Estella a lady. However, one night, Mr. Jaggers (a lawyer)comes to Pip and informs him that he is a man of great expectations. Pip has no idea of who his benefactor is, but heads to London to start his eventful life as a gentleman.Great Expectations is a amazing book in many ways. Three of these ways are: the themes, the characters, and the writing. Themes in this book are very important. They can easily relate to us today, and these main ideas are crucial lessons through literature. Next, the characters. Dickens creates such perfect characters that they will stay in your mind and you will begin to link people you know to people in the book. Such characters include Miss Havisham, Joe Gargery, Mr. Jaggers, Magwitch, Herbert Pocket, and many others. These people in Great Expectations make the book enjoyable to read. Lastly, the writing is awesome. Sentences are easily read, and the suspense keeps you reading from cover to cover.Great Expectations will always be one of my favorite books, and I strongly recommend it to anyone who is looking for a challenge, and a excellent read."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"An outstanding book that I read this year was Great Expectations. This was a wonderful classic written by the magnificent author Charles Dickens. Charles Dickens wrote a book that truly captivated the power of human love. He showed us that life can be very difficult, and you have to work very hard in order for you to succeed.In the beginning of the book, a character named Pip lived on a forge near some marshes in England. His family was generally poor. He lived with his older sister and her husband named Joe. Joe was a fairly poor blacksmith. One day, Pip was walking on the marshes. Suddenly, a strange man came up to Pip and threatened him. The strange man was a convict who was put to die on the marshes. He was handcuffed and chained. He told Pip that he would kill him if he didn't bring him a steel file and something to eat. Pip then ran back to the forge and brought the convict a steel file and some food. This vivid occurrence haunted Pip for the rest of his life.After the incident on the marshes, Pip met a lady named Miss Havesham. Miss Havesham was a very weird lady. She always wore her wedding dress in her house. She never left her house. Miss Havesham had a very beautiful adopted daughter named Estella. She was an arrogant woman. While looking at her, Pip fell in love with Estella.One day, a mysterious man came to Joe's forge. This man was sent by a secret benefactor who was residing in London. The man didn't give his name. He told Pip and Joe that someone in London was requesting him. The secret benefactor wanted Pip to come to London so that he could become a gentleman. Pip was very excited when he heard that he could work in London. Pip and Joe agreed upon the proposal. Later in that same week, Pip left Joe's forge to travel to London. There he could be a gentleman with a bright and bold future.While in London, Pip encountered many strange mysteries. Pip finally met his secret benefactor. Read the book to find out who the secret benefactor was...Overall, Great Expectations was an outstanding book. It really captivated the vast stretches of life. Great Expectations really made me feel quite sad. I felt very sorry for Pip. He had a very difficult life. He had change his personality forever once he became a gentleman. I would recommend this book to anybody who enjoys reading classics. I have read other excellent books by the wonderful author Charles Dickens. I have read Oliver Twist and The Christmas Carol. They were also excellent books."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I am 15 and reading is my least favorite thing to do. If I ever read, it's only for a few minutes. Not with this book, I read it all day, and so far have read it several times. I don't know about this edition however, b/c it is for younger readers. I am also sure that whatever edition you get will be great. This book shows tons of emotions, and is guided by the narrator, Pip. It is a superb book, that once you pick up you will never put down.Pip is raised by his sister and brother-in-law, both named Joe, b/c of his parents being dead. Pip has many scary and shocking experiences throughout this novel. It really shows how much Pip changes throughout the novel, from being poor to being a gentlemen, and at last realizing what really matters.Pip is an interesting and exciting character, who really makes the best of this book!"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I wish that the book was shorter :( Especially because it's 387 pages and I have to write a report on it (10 paragraphs on 10 quotes from the story that I believe show the importance of the story in the next 10 days :( YUCK! However, it still hasa very interesting storyline that is very very detailed :D"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Great Expectations is one of Dickens's later novels, a work of his artistic maturity. The narrative is symbolic rather than realistic. Although, as in most of Dickens and in Victorian literature in general, the plot relies heavily on coincidence, it is acceptable here because the events are true to the internal, psychological, logic of the story.Great Expectations tells the story of Pip, a boy who starts as an orphan who moves on to apprenticeship in the business world of nineteenth-century England. Along the way, he falls in love with a girl from a wealthy family, and gains a mysterious patron.The book is heavy on character development and descriptive detail, but relatively light on action and suspense. The orphan Pip, the convict Magwitch, the beautiful Estella and her guardian, the embittered and vengeful Miss Havisham, the master lawyer Mr. Jaggers and Wemmick his secretive assistant - all play their part in this story which is a memoir, a mystery, and a romance.Great Expectations never loses sight of the social mishaps of the time and is often on the teacher's list in literature classics. Most people who read it will like it and will be able to identify with the characters, but impatient readers will drown in the details, extended descriptions and explanations, and deep characterizations."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Dickens is to me the most obvious of writers. Most of his novels are to various extents semi autobiographical. Most are populated by people with amusing names who, aside from the main characters, seem to be caricatures more than humans who think and feel with any semblance of subtlety or complexity. Most are deeply concerned with social injustice and class struggle. Most are filled with plot twists, and almost all are very enjoyable reads. Dickens is nothing if not a master storyteller who loves to manipulate the emotions of his reading public. His stories are theatrical more than novelistic. It is no wonder he is the most popular author of the Victorian age, and maybe second only to Shakespeare in the history of English literature.GREAT EXPECTATIONS and DAVID COPPERFIELD are my 2 favorite Dickens novels, probably because they both have more overtly autobiographical elements than his other works. I also love BLEAK HOUSE. GREAT EXPECTATIONS is the story of Pip.. of his rise and fall, and ultimate redemption. This novel gives us a clear window into the heart and mind of Dickens himself. The story itself held my interest from beginning to end, had important themes to explore, and despite it's lack of introspection in examining personality issues, made you care about the main characters. Dickens was one of the great writers but he is not my favorite novelist of that period. I prefer George Eliot's style as a novelist. To me, Dickens power was in connecting emotionally with his audience and it must have been some experience hearing him tell his marvelous tales in person."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"This is an excellent coming-of-age book with which many people will be able to relate. I will admit, the beginning was rather grueling, but looking back, I am glad I finished the book. Dickens has a fabulous vocabulary and an excellent sense of people. The characters are dynamic and quite various. I would recommend this book to other scholars."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"This book is a masterpiece of fiction. Until you read the book you don't realize just how influential this story is in western literature."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Great Expectations didn't meet my expectations. I was a little bored throughout the begining and middle of the story. I think what kept me reading on was the desire to read a \\"classic\\" (I usually read biography or history).I continued reading because I wanted to find out if Magwitch would meet his daughter. In addition, I was interested in Pip's strong desire to be a gentleman. Other than help his friend in business and dawdle about thinking about an emotionally deadweight chic, Pip didn't seem interested in obtaining a job or taking real advantage of his opportunities. I'll give Pip credit for helping his friend attain stature in business, and eventually going on to operate with his friend after losing his unearned wealth. But the lazy part is 19th century gentleman, huh?Maybe Dicken's purpose was to show the benefits of wealth and the slothfullness of one who didn't have to work himself to attain it. Maybe it hit me at the wrong time, as my fiancee just took a hike and left me after I just sold my house (and now have no place to go). Trust you me, I won't be wasting my life away like Ms. Havisham though. I haven't reached gentlemanly status and need to continue working . . . .I've only read Charles Dicken's Nicholas Nickleby and Oliver Twist in addition to \\"Great Expectations\\". Of these, I thoroughly enjoyed Nicholas Nickleby. In the future, I'll look for Kates and Madellines and not Estellas. Great Expectations was a tougher read for me as these characters just simply didn't entice my interest too much. Of course, maybe I needed a brighter read . . ."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I first read this novel for a class. Years later, I picked it up again and reread it. It's excellent. The characters are very interesting. Pip who loves the cold-hearted Estella. It is good to see how their characters interact and how desire is lasting. You got to feel bad for poor Pip. Miss Havisham is the most interesting of all, still in her wedding gown after all these decades. A must read. It's a fairly long novel, but well worth the time it takes to read it."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I thought the book Great Expectations was a pretty good book. At parts of the book it was good but then there were those parts where I didn't like it in all books there are usually those parts. I though it was easy to understand.For the major themes I didn't always understand it all. Some parts I never really caught on to were at the beginning when he was a little kid then he had grown up I never caught on to that right away. But when I finally did it was good and interesting to find out.I do think Charles Dickens did bring the story alive. I think also he should have had so many characters because then it was hard to understand who was who and where did they come from. At some points I wish he would have had explained himself more then what he did. I got mixed up so much with all the characters it was hard to keep track of them because they were in the story and then they were gone then all of a sudden they came back. But out of it all it was a good book."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Astonishingly this book joins passion and soul with dreams, i bought this book since i saw the movie and i just tought i needed to go deep inside, as a personal review, i've always enterteined the vogus idea to get an analogous life experience so this story might be great for those who dream with going ahead, this story is also helpful to find out for certain that you can see your dreams comming true from where you're least expecting."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Although I rated this book four stars, I wish there was a three and one-half star rating- that's what I'd really like to give it. Dickens is one of my favorite novelists, and normally I am passionately enthusiastic about his books, but I could only manage to get slightly warmer than lukewarm about this middling novel. Overall, it wasn't bad- it is, in fact, one I wouldn't mind rereading in future. However, I didn't think it was quite as good as many of Dickens' other works. The plot, while not bad or boring, was not as suspenseful and intriguing as that of &quot;Oliver Twist&quot;, as slowly but enjoyably developing as that of &quot;David Copperfield&quot;, or as wonderfully tantalizing and gripping as that of &quot;Bleak House.&quot; The characters, while not hopelessly mediocre or bland, were not nearly as likeable and were much more forgettable than those of other Dickens novels. Although Pip was not a bad protagonist, I did not enjoy or like him as much as I did, say, Oliver Twist or Esther Summerson. Likewise, his character development, while interesting, was not, to my mind, as good or as interesting as that which is undergone by David Copperfield, a hero who I liked better than, and with whom I could sympathize more than with Pip. Estella and Miss Havisham, while interesting, did not add much to the plot, and when it comes to criminals those of &quot;Oliver Twist&quot;, are, in my opinion, more memorable, and in many ways, more sympathetic than Magwitch. While not a thoroughly forgettable or bad book, I wouldn't reccommend it to first time Dickens readers- it may discourage them from reading more. Wait until you've read one or two of his better novels, such as &quot;Oliver Twist&quot; or &quot;Bleak House.&quot; Then come to this one- only don't come with expectations that are TOO terribly great."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"A classic! This was the full story, unlike the money I wasted at Wally World on an abridged copy"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I love classic literature and this was a great find. The reader of this great work does a stellar job creating the character's voices which adds so much to the story.I have enjoyed this very much and will share it with my family."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Pip is an orphan. His nagging sister and weakling of a brother-in-law are raising him. He doesn't have much, yet is compelled to help an escaped convict with food and drink. (More out of fear than compassion, mind.) He knows no other way of life, so he doesn't expect anything... until he meets Miss Havisham. Miss Havisham is an old recluse who still mourns after the man who broken her heart on her wedding day. One day, she invites Pip over to \\"play,\\" and that is where he meets young and beautiful Estella. The pretty girl intrigues and irritates him in equal parts. Proud and cruel, she makes him feel like a nobody. And that is how his desires to become a gentleman emerge. So imagine his surprise when a secret benefactor grants his biggest wish, a stranger with \\"Great Expectations.\\" Pip soon moves to London, abandons his old acquaintances for new ones, and reunites with mean girl Estella, now older and more beautiful. Will he be good enough for her now?Great Expectations is my favorite Dickens novel. Granted, I have only read this one and Bleak House (I've also read A Christmas Carol and another novella of his), but it is my favorite one of the two. This novel contains beautiful storytelling, lots of irony and Dickens's signature eccentric characters and hilarious dialogue. This is my second time reading this after over a decade, and I enjoyed it more the second time around. (I enjoyed this as much as the other novel I read at the same time as this one, which, to my surprise, brought up Dickens and Great Expectations.) Pip is a wonderful character. He does, however, get on my nerves when he wants to be around people that to me aren't worth it. Estella is such a snob, a total beyotch, but I can see why Pip would want her to think well of him. One thing I've always found interesting is that Dickens always depicts lawyers as greedy and callous. Bleak House illustrates this even more. Perhaps Dickens disliked lawyers. Could his father's stay at a debtors' prison have to do with this? Well, one thing is clear: Great Expectations is a beautiful novel, one of the best out there, even with its altered ending. I've read both endings and like them both (though I prefer his original ending). Two endings are great because they give you a choice. Anyway, a great summer reread. I have A Tale of Two Cities and look forward to reading it soon."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I love listening to audiobooks while I work out and have a special fondness for the classics, so I was very excited by the excellent reviews this audio version received. I had read that each disk contained 90+ brief tracks, which is fine with me as I have never had a problem importing audiobooks into iTunes. Well, there is always a first time. I don't know what iTunes uses to find CD info or track names, but not a single disk came up identified as Great Expectations, nor did the tracks have any type of logical naming system. I had to type in a name for 93-94 tracks on every single disk (eg. disk01track01, etc).The audiobook itself is quite good of course, thankfully. I just need to warn those who plan to import for their iPod that it will not be a simple process. Better have a couple of hours to type. Had I known this would be a problem, I would not have purchased this version."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"As usual with Dickens, improbable coincidences abound. They are artfully presented however and Dickens does offer one or two surprises.For one thing, the novel is quite violent. Dickens graphically describes one character dying from burns. He presents a ruffian or two. Even one of the better gentlemen manhandles his maid.Also as usual with Dickens, we find a full cast of memorable well-defined characters. Mr Jaggers, the lawyer to beat all lawyers, and his assistant Mr. Wemmick who never mixes business and home matters, except under exceptional circumstances. We find Miss Havesham a wealthy but bitter spinster left at the altar years before. We meet Joe Gargery, a wise well-meaning blacksmith who lovingly raises Pip, the novel's main character, taking him on as his apprentice. Pip leaves him when fortune mysteriously smiles on him. An unknown benefactor gives our hero a substantial income so that he may fulfill his Great Expectations and become a gentleman of means and of leasure.And there you have Pip in a nutshell: he leaves a loving home, a kind man and a good position to become a man of the world, a man about town, in short a bit of a parasite.But then to become a man of means is for Dickens to have attained heaven on earth and he only lets the truly good enjoy their fortune. Jaggers is rich and cannot be called good, at worst he is amoral, but he is a man of action. On the other hand the thoughtless and ungrateful Pip doesn't deserve heaven. Not just yet.Vincent Poirier, Tokyo"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"My only real complain about this bookis that Orlick seems to be an annoying intrusion. Both of the \\"Great Expectations\\" movies I saw deleted the role of Orlick, and I can't say I missed him. Along with \\"Oliver Twist,\\" \\"Great Expectations\\" was one of my father's favorites.Onto the text. Pip (who is still a child and a literary reincarnation of Oliver Twist)) has a frightening experience in a graveyard when the escaped convict Magwitch (kind of a literary reincarnation of Fagin) threatens him and demands a file and some food. When Pip goes to get these things, we meet his sister who is not so nice to him. Though her husband Joe is. (Undoubtedly, this tense marriage reflects Dickens's divorce.) Moving on, Pip delivers the file and food to Magwitch who is of course grateful. sadly, Magwitch is captured, but he remains grateful to Pip.Later, Pip meets the tragic Miss Havisham. Havisham was left at the altar, and she never quite forgave the male sex for this. Interestingly, she has no concept of time. She has friends who visit her on her birthday, they do not mention it. Havisham trains her adopted daughter Estella to hate all men. Pip continues to visit Havisham and Estella for sometime. Soon, some good news comes from lawyer Mr. Jaggers. Pip learns that he is to be trained as a gentleman. Pip knows that Jaggers is Havisham's lawyer, so he assumes this gift is from her. (Why not?)Pip is accompanied by Herbert Pocket who is the son of Miss Havisham's cousin. Herbert tells Pip of Havisham's tragic past. We are permitted some sympathy for her. Pip (who is falling love with Estella) knows that Estella resembles someone, but he can't quite place who.There is a sad, but true to life scene when Joe comes to visit Pip, and because this kind man is not so educated, he turns out to be an embarrassment to Pip. In a scene of self sacrifice, Joe decides to let Pip go his own way.Later there is a disturbing scene between Havisham and Estella. While we may feel sorry for Havisham, she tried to plant her hatred in Estella, and naturally, Estella could only take living for hate so long. The real drama is still to come. Pip finds out that his benefactor was indeed Magwitch. (The man from the graveyard!) While we may share Pip's horror to some extent, we later learn that Magwitch is a sympathetic character. Basically, Compeyson was a kind of Uriah Heep who manipulated Magwitch. To make matters worse, it is punishable by death for Magwitch to be in England.I don't want to give away the ending, but this is easily one of Dickens's greatest books."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"After reading a bunch of these reviews, I've come to the conclusion that this book should not be pushed on high school students or younger. It's almost sad to read a review from someone who just read the cliff notes. Come on now, do we really need to hear from you? This is my favorite Dickens novel so far, and though I haven't read them all, I loved everything about it. Though the ending is happy, it is by no means a Hollywood ending.

The character of Miss Havisham is genius, and a character like none I have ever met before in literature. The images of her sitting corpse like in her decaying house will stick with me for all time. Everyone should read this book for this fascinating character.While the first part of the book delighted me with wicked satire, and dark humor, the last quarter of the book was too morally right for me. Every character saw the error of his ways, and strove to be a better person, and here the book lost much of the original feel it had going for it. I suppose maybe in Dickens' time, he couldn't get away with a book that did not have a morally uplifting ending.However, I say this is a must-read for the characters of Miss Havisham and the beautiful Estella alone. Also the lawyer Jaggers is a great character."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Great Expectations is filled with ambition, greed, cruelty, and love.

I'll speak to the edition itself, because formatting of Kindle books (especially free ones) can be very hit and miss. The illustrated Kindle edition by Top Five Books is easy to navigate, formatted well, free of errors, and contains a variety of illustrations. It is free, and there is nothing about this version that recommends choosing an alternative."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Great Expectations is widely regarded as one of Charles Dickens' finest works and I have to agree; it is one of my favorites, second to A Tale of Two Cities. The story of a young boy's growth to manhood, and his rise to unexpected prosperity and subsequent fall, is strongly written and captivating. Great Expectations captures the attention from the first page and, unlike some of Dickens' other works, it never has a dull moment. Like all of Dickens' works, it is peopled with a large cast of unique and quirky characters whose relationships to each other, as the story unfolds, end up being as intertwined as a plate of spaghetti. Some of the scenes and characters in Great Expectations are downright bizarre; the scenes involving Miss Havisham and the Pocket family felt distinctly Alice in Wonderland-ish in their weirdness.What makes Great Expectations so strong is the main character, Pip. He is that rarity among Dickens' characters, one that has depth and more than one dimension and mood. He tells his own story and, as an adult reflecting back on his own childhood and adolescence, he reveals his own youthful selfishness with a poignancy that surely every listener can connect with. Haven't we all been Pip, selfish and unappreciative of the goodness of others and unworthy of their admiration?I did not listen to this particular audio edition, although I know that Brilliance Audio produces top-notch audio books and Michael Page is an excellent narrator. I highly recommend the edition I listened to, produced by BBC Audio. It is a no-frills production, but the narrator (Martin Jarvis) is outstanding.

But overall, it was interesting and much like a soap opera with some dull moments."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Great Expectations is the most amazing book I have ever read. Charles Dickens' eloquent language enthrawls you and keeps you reading on. I have seen how some people find this hard to get through; I was 12 when I read it and I understood it perfectly and loved it. Others think it is too long - this just gives you more to enjoy. I also had to read it because I was told to (for school) and I just read with enjoyment without focusing on every little detail like others have (which in my view is the reason for their disliking.) This book is a classic which must be read. Words cannot describe the quality of the book. Take my advice - purchase a copy and READ IT!"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"This book at the beginning seemed to me a little boring but as i read on it got really interesting. So much irony and so many twists is what really kept me on the edge of my seat. This is one of those books that you look forward to the end but when it comes you sit back and wish there was more. It really makes you think about yourself, society, and the world. I HIGHLY recommend this book."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"There really aren't words for this book.

I am only 12, but I found this book to be one of the best I have ever read."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Great Expectations is one of the best books I have ever read. Dickens provides the reader with a great story and a wonderful mistery. His presentation of the identity stuggle within Pip is, at the lack of a better word, marvelous.Everytime I thought I had the story figured out, I was presented with a jaw droping event that got me even more interested.I would recommend this book to anyone! It's worth taking on your next trip to the beach. Cheers!"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Being a fan of Charles Dickens novels I can honestly say Great Expectations is his greatest work. The characters are unforgettable and the story which starts out slow in the beginning grows very quickly. The book is about life, living and the disappointments that come with it. The novel seems to have a very sad and uneasy tone throughout it. And if you have right version of the novel you will be able to read Charles Dickens original ending for this novel. Its very sad and disappointing to the reader but you cant help saying to yourself that the ending fits."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"O.K. lets face it. im in fourth grAde. this is a very good book,but its hard.im akmost half way tttthrough it. its been a challenge."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"After several futile attempts, I was literally forced to read this novel for school. I found that the reason I had such difficulties beginning it, was due to its monotonous and dull beginning. Once past that section, Great Expectations dramatically lifts. I found the whole idea of a women stopping her clocks and living in darkness due to unrequited love a little morbid, yet also slightly romantic, and I found myself disliking the main character with a vengence. Not his best, certainly, but still okay."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"A word I hear spoken often today is: boring. I hear that word coming out of the mouth of many teenagers. We live in a society that is so bombarded with continual stimulation, that we expect to be entertained at every turn and get bored too easily if &quot;forced&quot; to read a classic book like Great Expectations. Many high school students would rather be doing something else than reading so it doesn't surprise me when I see all the reviews by teenagers who said they hated the book. I recommend that they read it again in 20 years after seeing the world."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Although Great Expectations is better-written than most contemporary novels (Miss Havisham alone makes the book worth reading and demonstrates Dickens' wonderful skill with characters), I fear that GE is most people's only contact with Dickens because it's short enough to assign for school. (So is A Tale of Two Cities, a great story, but not much like other Dickens works.) If you can stick with them, I recommend even more highly Dickens' Bleak House, Our Mutual Friend, David Copperfield, and Little Dorrit--they're long but they are great, well-written stories with fully developed characters and (sometimes mysteriously long) plot and description that turns out to be crucial (you get a hint of that in GE). Don't give up on Dickens; his works are classics for good reason."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"In my opinion, Charles Dickens remains the writer who defined the art of characterization in the 19th century. This novel contains a bevy of characters that the readers will find unforgettable. The haunting figure of Miss Havisham has stayed with me since my 10th grade literature class (almost 30 years ago) and my recent rereading of the novel brought her horrid existence into full view again. The plot has twists and turns and although I found myself having to stop reading and letting certain episodes sink into my understanding, the beauty and scope of the writing is truly remarkable. As a young student of Dickens, I resisted the long descriptions and difficult dialogue and I don't remember loving the book when I read it the first time. As an adult, however, my admiration for the novel is undeniable."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I read Charles Dickens's book Great Expectations. This book is about a young boy named Pip. Pip lives with his older sister Mrs. Gargery who is married to a black smith named Joe. Early in the book Pip meets an escaped convict that was on the run. He may not know it yet but the convict will have a lasting affect on him. When Joe finds out about the convict he asks Pip to help the police catch him. After a quick battle the convict and his partner are caught. Later in the book Pip meets Miss Haversham whose cold ward Estella Pip adores. An unknown person pays for Pip to go to London and become a gentleman.Charles Dickens is a wonderful writer. The Great Expectations is a great example of Dickens writing power. Moby Dick and other books are just as well done. I enjoyed reading the Great Expectations it was a long and detailed story of adventure and affection. I hope you enjoyed reading it too."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I can only agree, a great book that is very nicely done and is easy to read. I like it, it is simply a classic everyone should have read!"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"This seems to be a very nice copy of the book, it is easy to read in its big font and looks nice aswell. :)"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Yes, Dickens was paid by the word when writing this.Yes, this is a big bookYes, if you were forced to read it in school, you probably hatedYes, if you read it on your own at or after age 25... you probably loved it.I for one, thought this book was great, sure it was wordy, but it was not wordy in that \\"what the heck is he trying to say\\" way that gets many other wordy books (Crime and Punishment - though I blame the translators for that one).Short Summary: This is the story of Pip, starting from a young age after his parents and many younger siblings are deceased and he is being raised by his militant sister and her lovable but slightly dense husband, Joe. Pip has very little hope of a future other than an apprenticeship with Joe as a Blacksmith. Suddenly... doors start opening for Pip, and opportunities present themselves to him. He accepts but never knows who or why strings are being pulled in the background to open these doors for him. We follow Pip through his life as he accepts these opportunities, and they lead him down a strange but wonderful path of self discovery, maturity, and opening his eyes to the real world.The reason this book is so effective is because Pip is so real. We follow him through his blunders and successes, we dread his putting his foot in his mouth, saying the wrong things to Biddy, or Ms. Haversham, and we rejoice when he commits selfless acts and hate him when he commits selfish ones. It is my personal opinion that this book will have more of an affect on the late twenty year olds and up because by then you have suffered a bit, and made some of the same mistakes as Pip, you have wandered through finding your way in the world, and the confusion of who you are, wishing you were something else, loving what or who you cannot have, and figuring out what path to put your life on.The rest of the cast of characters is quite a collection of multifaceted, entertaining, and interesting people. Ms. Haversham is a favorite of many, so strange, so tortured, so heartless, and so intriguing... then we have Dear old Joe, so Simple, and mild, and encouraging. Joe's love is unconditional and unwavering. Biddy, is so loyal, so kind, and so honest, then you have her polar opposite, Estella. There are so many other characters that are interesting, fun to read about and that you will have strong feelings for one way or another.I highly recommend this book, even though it is over a century old, the language is not difficult to read (very little work required) and the plot and characters are stellar. True there are no explosions, but a book can be engaging with out them. Give it a try."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I agonized through this book in HS and have recently breezed through it. About 30 years have passed in between.What I was most struck by in my second reading was how relevant the story was to our own times. Child abuse and emotionally damaging relationships, celebrity lawyers, prison reform, the dangers of easy credit, how easily a person can dispose of their past identity. Dickens wrote about this 140+ years ago but he could have been writing about the present day. Yes, a reader has to warm up to the 19th century language, but once that happens, the characters and their emotions are so authentic and fully developed. I found myself so annoyed at Pip in the middle of the novel, I almost put it down. How could I possibly care about such an obnoxious young man. But I did care and cared more and more deeply as the book wound down. Pip's transformation was convincing because the reader sees how it occurs in small increments. In the end I took a deep breath and thought to myself, well, Pip, you finally grew up. It may not be the best book to force teenagers to read, but I hope mature readers will take it up and find the treasures inside."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"This is an incredible masterpiece of storytelling. Charles Dickens is witty and intelligent. He creates characters that you are able to warm to and he is able to sculpt a brilliant plot. Without putting in any spoilers i will let you know that the main character PiP, definitely got what he expected ! and he learnt something in the process - that character is far more valuable than status - even the status of being a gentleman !!\\""},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I was brought kicking and screaming to this story thanks to high school English Lit requirements but it ended up being my favorite of the term. I loved and hated various major characters strongly which is why I just couldn't put it down until I was finished.I've seen film versions since reading this book and I've never seen anything live up to the experience of the text. This is a classic to add to your home library."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I can't give this book enough praise. I read David Copperfield after, which was supposedly Dickens' most belove character, but I enjoyed GE much more. You won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"This is Charles Dickens' version of the poor kid fantasy. This is almost a fable, I would say. This is the kind of story that you hear over and over growing up in poverty. It is almost in the category of Robin Hood, but this is the real thing in the flesh and blood. The old man in the cemetery scene still plays over and over in my mind. I should have read everything written by Charles Dickens by now, but yet I haven't. I started A Tale of Two Cities a little while ago and I have it on my night stand. I think that I'll get back to it tonight. I don't know who beats Dickens in superb phrasing and style. He is the Master.Richard Edward Noble - The Hobo Philosopher - Author of:\\"Honor Thy Father and Thy Mother\\""},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"If you're like me, you were forced to read some Dickens in High School and found him to be pedantic and to sound archaic. What a pleasure it is to read him now. GE gives you a terrific story, wonderful use of language and insight into the lifestyle and prejudices of Victorian England. Unlike Jane Austen, this one works for the mature male reader. At this low price, it's a must read. Go for it."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"A pleasure to read. I am really enjoying it To be cliched, it is a classic and I would reccomend it to anyone. Great characters, some mystery, humour and emotion."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"This is the first Dickens book I've read and I enjoyed it very much - have just bought more of his novels. The few illustrations in this version are lovely and do really add to the pleasure of reading this book.This version has both endings (the one 'official' that Dickens added after the fact once a friend pointed out that the original ending was to dismal and the 'original' ending). I tend to prefer the original ending, but you would have to read the book to see for yourself...Would really recommend reading this book!"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Well written and the drawings are wonderful. The story itself is well written and put in a time period which was a difficult time for children who didn't have much finances or many options to obtain employment they would enjoy. the thoughts through the boys eyes are amazing after all the situations he gets into. even a little trouble could be a really big deal back then."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Can't believe I had never read this, not even seen a movie based onthis book! How shocking. I had no good excuse not to get it, as it was freefor Kindle at the time. Oprah also has this on her book list.I really found it very interesting and was caught up in the storyline very quickly. I love historical romances anyway. This is not really a romance, though there isa complicated love in the main character's life. This book reminds me of the broodingclassics like Heathcliff. That seemed to be the thing back then.It will not hurt anyone to read it, and you might even enjoy it!"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Charles Dickens is absolutely classic. I read this book in high school myself, now my son is reading it. I'm sure he'll enjoy. It's a brand new paper back book at a great price. You can't go wrong buying this."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Charles Dickens was a great and talented writer. It takes some getting use to the style and manner of expression. I enjoyed getting the feel of what it was like in the old days of Britain."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I am making my way through Charles Dickens...not in any particular order...the first few I've picked are mostly familiar through TV or film adaptations that I've enjoyed and/or on the recommendations of friends.\\"Bleak House\\" was my first read, finished last month. \\"Great Expectations\\" is my second read.What can I say? I am just so enamored with Dickens's story-telling and character development that I have a fear that when I am done reading his canon I'll have to declare a 13-way tie for first place. We'll see.Between Bleak House and Great Expectations I *almost have a two-way tie for first place, in no small part because they are such different types of books...Bleak House was a universe of characters and subplots; Great Expectations fewer characters and not as much intrigue, although the last 1/4 to 1/3 of the book is riveting. And some good comedy also.But I am going to put GE at #1 and BH at #2...while I loved Bleak House as I read it, and have a few favorite characters, \\"Great Expectations\\" will *stay with me* much much longer I think...Bleak House is brilliant (really brilliant) for its commentary on the period and for its settings and for its intricacies; Great Expectations is brilliant because it is simple and timeless.I'm not nearly vain or clever enough to think I'm the first to recognize this, but three neat things about Great Expectations are: 1) it's a novel which illustrates the old warning \\"Be Careful What You Wish For...\\", 2) it is the complete opposite of \\"Catcher in the Rye\\" - an earnest, non-cynical first-person narrator who meets so much kindness along the way, and fewer \\"phonies\\" (although there are a few), and 3) it's such a personal novel that anyone who dares wonder what they could possibly learn about human nature by reading such an \\"old\\" book NEEDS to read it for that very reason.The characters are just so memorable...if I had to pick a favorite, I think it would be Wemmick...you probably work with him and don't even know it: he's the man (or woman) who is competent at work, works for an insufferable boss, and has a completely different home life than work life. His care of \\"The Aged\\" is a remarkable example for any of us in caring for our parents.The love stories are also very touching - especially the ones that turn out for the best...but no spoilers in this review.And the story of Pip's unrequited love is so true to life...and although I think it would have been worse for Pip to lose Estella had she been more than just beautiful outside but also beautiful inside, Dickens wrote beautifully and agonizingly of the highs and lows associated with unrequited love as only one who has experienced it can truly identify. One of the worst and most painful aspects is not the fact that you aren;t chosen but that they chose *that* person. And all you can think is: anybody...anybody but *them*.A memorable book and must reading.Now on to another Dickens novel! :-)"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"It is one of the magnificent books in history that everyone should have. Thats why I decided to have this one. It is Dickens at its best. :)"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"It is one the novels I love most. I love it very much! Wish Amzaon provide frequently this kind of excellent novels by free."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Contentment in life is a struggle; in \\"Great Expectations,\\" by Charles Dickens, a young boy is faced with disappointed expectations of ambition and desire for social self-improvement. Set in the mid-nineteenth century in Kent and London, England, social class is portrayed as utmost importance. For young orphaned Philip Pirrip-Pipp- life is a struggle of realization of the real world and place in life as well as culture. Through traumatic events, mishaps and altered expectations to the truth, Pipp learns that social improvement is irrelevant to one's real worth.The reoccurring motif in, \\"Great Expectations,\\" is in direct relation to the major them of self-improvement through social class. Through characters, places, and infatuations, this motif is prominent. Miss. Havisham, Estella, the Satis House, and Bently Drummle all introduce different levels and perceptions of social class of the 1800's. Bentley Drummle represents the grotesque side of high class, Miss. Havisham and Estella are the quintessence of the highly educated, lavish and greatly respected side of the upper class, and the Satis House is merely the embodiment of the riches young Pipp adores and idolizes. Each character not only adds to Pipp's life long obsession of social well being, but life lessons learned in his battle for fulfillment."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Charles Dickens was one of the most popular writers of all time, creating some of the best-known characters in English literature. In the book \\"Great Expectations\\", the protagonist and narrator, Pip begins the story as a young orphan boy being grown up by his sister. I like this book, because Charles Dickens takes you right inside the Pip's mind and you live through the events and discoveries of his life with him. Pip is passionate, romantic and somewhat unrealistic at heart. That makes the novel interesting. Of course, you cannot forget the great love story (Pip and Estella). The other characters Magwitch, Miss Havisham, Joe Gargery, Miss Joe, Estella, Mr Jaggers and Mr Wemmick are all unique and special in their way and they add to the novel's richness. Another thing I really liked was how all of the characters are interrelated to each other in ways that you may not discover until you get to the end of the novel. This novel will make you sometimes laugh and sometimes make you feel sad, but it is always entertaining. Latif Dose simplifies the texts. The language is very clear. There are not old English words and this gives the reader much pleasure while reading the novel. I think most young people would like this novel because it's not as hard to read as an other classic books. I recommend Great Expectations to anyone who wants to read a good, classic book because Great Expectations has a little bit of everything in it, mystery, romance and suspense. You cannot easily find all of these properties in other novels, which makes &quot;Great Expectations&quot; a special and a classic one.. That makes this novel very different. It is probably one of the top ten English novels of the 19th century. Some of the passages are beautiful. I cannot forget Pip's response to Estella when she says \\"You will get me out of thoughts in a week.\\""},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"There is really no need to recount the plot of this classic - I think most people who are thinking about reading it already know it is a story of poor boy done good and has wrong assumptions about how he comes about it. But despite the storyline being well-worn, there is till so much to get from this story. What comes across most clearly is the theme that nothing comes without strings-attached - Pip's great fortune, that at first looked like manna from on high, turns out to cause more trouble than it is worth.Dickens is a joy to read - his description is masterful, and his ability to paint pictures of his eccentric characters is unsurpassed - the contrasts between the charming Mr Wemmick and the slimy Mr Jaggers; the amazing Miss Havisham; the self important Pumblechook (who I could not stand! Is there any character in literature so annoyingly self-deluded?). My absolute favourite is Joe - his convoluted ways of attempting to pass information onto Pip, his attempts to spare Pip from his evil sister and his localised venacular. The only disappointing characters are the two main ones - Pip comes across as insipid, uninspiring, and frankly undeserving of the fortune that he falls into. Estella is so sketchily drawn that you never get any feel for her, and I think that given how much complexity Dickens manages for some of the minor characters, he could have afforded more to Estella.However, this is a great read. Don't read it just because you fell you \`have to read a classic' - read it because it is a well written story with the right balance of humour and pathos."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I don't think I'd be giving away much of the plot if I were to say that the story revolves around Pip, a young, middle class orphan who has dreams to be a wealthy, respected gentleman, but has no hope of this as he is a rural blacksmith apprentice. His prospecs change, however, when a mysterious, anonymous benefactor offers to make Pip's dream a reality. I won't give away the ending, but the novel supports Dickens' belief that the middle class is the class to which people should aspire.The plot of this story wasn't to my liking. Dickens' attempts towards the end to wrap all the subplots into one neat little package annoyed me...similar to plot twists in modern Hollywood movies--things so outrageously convienent that it makes one want to roll his eyes. The manner in which things are written, however is fantastic. While the main characters are rather boring, the minor characters, (especially Biddy, Herbert Pocket, and John Wemmick) were much more interesting. Thankfully, Dickens focused on them enough to flesh them out and make them memorable. I would recommend this book, not because I enjoy the plot, but because the writing style is superior and because I, being lower middle class, enjoyed the positive viewpoint Dickens extended concerning my class."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"What have I missed all these years? I'm ashamed to admit that this is the first Charles Dickens' I've read and I'm 40! Heavens forbid! Don't make the same mistake.......read this book now!I've spent the past week being thoroughly entertained by Pip! No wonder Dickens' is considered such a great writer....this book will have you laughing out loud, and being inspired by the incredible depth of understanding Dickens has for the human condition at all levels of society.....and he manages to do so while weaving a story about one young boy's transformation and maturation...and the tradeoffs for every choice in life.Once you pick this book up, you won't want to put it down until you finish. It's that good!"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Dickens, along with Dostoevsky, stands atop my list of novelists who could most accurately portray the subtleties of human emotion and passion. &quot;Great Expectations&quot; is simply a masterpiece of 19th-century fiction, and is pure Dickens. In this semi-autobiographical work (a trademark of Dickens' writings), the life of a poor young boy, Pip, is followed from his humble beginnings to his rise into the middle-class, due to the mysterious aid of an unknown benefactor. His pursuit of Estella, a beautiful young girl raised to break the hearts of men by her jilted caretaker, Ms. Havisham, is a classic of literature that has been repeated countless times since. The tragic, gradual break between Pip and his family (particularly the humble but caring Joe) is heartwrenching. Pip's eventual realization of the insincerity of the middle class, and his love for Joe, brought tears to my eyes.&quot;Great Expectations&quot; is a wonderful, moving book that has been copied and satired again and again, from Mishima's &quot;Forbidden Colors&quot; to South Park. An important and unforgettable novel!"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"A great story about a young man who has lost his mother and father and is being raised by only his older sister, Charles Dickens' &quot;Great Expectations&quot; is a story of diversity, poverty, and growing up.

As Pip grows up, he must strive to understand what is going on, and why it is going on.The book is very long and almost covers Pip's entire life. The book is enriched with humor that we can all relate to. Short episodes make up the majority of the book.

And even I have to appreciate this classic. Charles Dickens knew what he was doing, okay? Great Expectations is a classic, and there's a reason it's a classic. For the plain and simple fact it was well written, with an interesting plot and a good twist. Just because something doesn't contain profanity, sex and violence doesn't mean it should be presumed boring. A basic summary - it tells the story of life, obsessions and social status. As far as I'm concerned, it isn't boring. Just wake up to yourselves, teenage world. Virginia Andrews isn't the extent of reading pleasure."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I find myself surprised at the comments provided by earlier reviewers. One critic gave &quot;Great Expectations&quot; one star because he/she failed a test. Why should Dickens be blamed for that? Another said there was no structure (in a Dickens novel???). Another, that there was &quot;little direction and less power.&quot; That there was no theme and no plot. Perhaps I am seeing things that aren't there but, whatever the shortcomings are, it is not in plot, themes, or characterization. It is the story of the orphan Philip Pirrip, known to everyone as Pip, from the age of about seven to the age of twenty-three, with a brief section at the end that takes place about eleven years later. Pip is being brought up \\"by hand\\" by his loud and quarrelsome sister and her kind and quiet husband, the blacksmith Joe Gargery. Young Pip is soon asked to serve in the home of Miss Havisham, who appears to be half mad since the day, years earlier, when she had been left at the alter by her old lover. Miss Havisham is raising a young girl named Estella to be heartless in her treatment of men when she grows up as a form of revenge against all men. And, Pip naturally falls in love with her. After a few years, Pip finds himself wealthy due to some unknown benefactor (who he mistakenly thinks is Miss Havisham and who he also believes has planned to have Estella marry him when they are older) and he now has \\"great expectations\\" made of him. He plans to become a gentleman and he leaves the kind and devoted Joe to live in London, Pip hoping to leave behind his humble past of which he now feels ashamed. After a few more years, he discovers that his unknown benefactor was Abel Magwitch whom he had helped when he was seven. Magwitch had been convicted and deported to Australia where he became a wealthy sheepman. Even though Magwitch was forbidden to return to England, he does so just to see the young man he had been helping to become a gentleman. Through problems with the law trying to arrest Magwitch, problems with Magwitch's past, the loss of the fortune and of Pip's great expectations, and through illness, Pip discovers the basic goodness in Joe, the devotion of Magwitch and of Pip's close friend Herbert Pocket, and what really is important. He discovers the value of family and of close friends and confidants. Estelle, who had married a cruel oaf, also learns her lessons and finds that she may have a heart as well (in the more common of the two endings of the novel). This is a great novel."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"This is one of my favorite books, so when I got my kindle I was delighted to see it for free.

Brought back so many childhood memories and thrills !! Worth reading over and over !"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I enjoyed reading this novel mostly because of the rich text and language Dickens used to display the imagery. Dickens wrote this piece in such detail that allows the audience to fully engage in the text, relate to Pip and his struggles, and bring a deeper thought to the way we treat our individual social statuses. As citizens of the United States, we are obligated to work our way to \\"the top of the food chain\\". The majority of the time, we are not given a high status, by blood or other means, to build a superior reputation for ourselves. Therefore we must have the will and determination to make our personal goals become reality. In Great Expectations, Pip's struggles and adventures are great examples of how the audience can relate to the story line and setting throughout the novel to our own personal lives.I thought that Dickens' creatively demonstrated that an individual's social status is not what determines the rights of respect and standards on a person's character. The ability to prove our greater meaning in this world is not something that the government can label us on. As humans, we have the right to make mistakes and errors in life, but out of the morals and standards in which we uphold allow us to make those mistakes result in a learning experiences. Pip strives to become a better man throughout the novel for various reasons. However, Great Expectations allows us to see the connection between the book and real life. In both situations there are/ will be countless obstacles getting in the way of ambitions we set. When Pip decides to leave Joe behind and pursuit his ambitions of becoming a true gentleman he made a decision, much like Dickens himself, to benefit his own life. With any decision there must be great responciblity and will.Personally, I strongly believe that anyone can improve their well-being within a reasonable manner. Only with dedication and support from relatives or friends can one truly achieve their goal. Sometimes our goals don't have the exact result we wished for, but we should be grateful for what we have and work hard for what we want to improve. What I have learned from this book is that no matter what your status is in school, work, at home, or in society as a whole, we all have the ability to make something greater of ourselves. Each individual has the capability to achieve all of ambitions in life we wish to imagine."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"A blacksmith's apprentice, Pip, is chosen by an unknown benefactor to become a gentleman because he has \\"great expectations.\\" Pip's outlook on life changes as he develops into a gentleman, falls in love, and realizes how important family and friends are. The characterization in this book is fantastic (as is usual for Dickens), and the story has some deeply moving parts. However, it's not my favorite Dickens novel. I'm not sure why this seems to be one of his most popular. But it was certainly enjoyable!"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I recently reread this wonderful classic and was mesmerized by it all over again - a must read for anyone who has not read this book."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Great Expectations is the 19th novel by Charles Dickens. The story is narrated by Pip, brought up by hand by his sister, Mrs Joe Gargery, commanded to attend Miss Havisham, jilted bride now in decay, where he falls in love with the beautiful Estella and decides he wants to be a gentleman. Eventually, apprenticed to Joe Gargery, blacksmith, he comes into a fortune, and is convinced his benefactor is Miss Havisham, intending him to become a gentleman so he can marry Estella. Miss Havisham's intentions for Estella, of course, differ markedly from this. Dickens includes a rich cast of characters: the guilty and regretful Pip; the cold and cruel Estella; the warm Herbert and Clara; the kind-hearted and faithful Joe and Biddy; the capable Jaggers; the split-personality Wemmick; the nasty Orlick; the single-minded Magwitch. Great Expectations is a much easier and funnier read than the only other Dickens book I can remember reading, and this books immediate predecessor, A Tale of Two Cities, and I noted the echo of the knitting women at the gallows in Estella's actions. The notes are a useful addition, as is the introduction by Angus Calder. A brilliant read."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"What a wonderful masterpiece. Touched every part of me.

One Christmas, Pip accidentally crosses paths with a criminal on the run and he provides the criminal with supplies---under duress, but he does it and doesn't give the guy up. Years pass, and Pip begins spending time with the lonely Miss Havershim on her derelict estate with her daughter, Estella. Pip falls in love with Estella, but like her mother, Estella claims she cannot return anyone's love.When Pip enters young adulthood, he discovers that any anonymous benefactor has given him a large sum of money and moves him from the colorful and calm fields of the country to the dreary dampness of London, and a life of sophistication.Through this adventure, Pip explores his sense of integrity, his values, and the depth of his faith in the goodness of others."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"***This review may contain spoilers***Like practically every other American student, I encountered Dickens's \\"Great Expectations\\" (hereafter GE) in an abridged version in junior high, then the complete text when I was much older. In my opinion, GE is a glorious (not glorified) soap opera chronicling the wildly fluctuating vicissitudes of Philip Pirrip's (Pip's) eventful life, from an orphaned, tormented child apprenticed to genial blacksmith Joe to, by a turn of ironic fate, a wealthy \\"gentleman\\" of leisure. As been often noted, Dickens created worlds, if not universes, in his novels, and GE is certainly no exception. In this review, I will try to avoid detailing the plot, which is already well-known. Instead, I will comment upon Dickens's use of backstory and flashback to flesh out most of the major characters in the novel.Even the most colorful, flamboyant characters in GE are not one-dimensional or stereotypically good or evil. We learn how Miss Havisham's marital jilting by Arthur compelled her to become a spectral recluse in her gloomy estate. We learn how Miss Havisham's misanthropic upbringing caused her frosty ward Estella (whose name suggests a blazing but distant star) to become an inaccessible man-hater. We learn how Magwitch, Pip's surprising benefactor, became a convict through cynical ad hominem prosecution in the barbaric English court system, was transported to the penal colony that was Australia, and how he acquired the money through hardship just to help the orphan Pip, who showed him mercy at the graveyard, and why he risked arrest in London to see his gentleman. We learn that Estella's mother, servant to Mr. Jaggers the lawyer, was convicted of murder but saved, after a fashion, by the lawyer and how she had to sacrifice her daughter so that she could become a lady. We even learn about the somewhat schizophrenic Wemmick, Jagger's clerk, who is sullen and joyless at work but positively animated and exuberant when he is at home (The Castle) with his elderly invalid father The Aged. Through these backstories, we find out that no Dickensian character is ultimately utterly despicable, or demonic, or flawless, or saintly. They are all achingly human, trying to live life the best they can.Since GE is primarily about the growth and development of Pip, we witness his human complexity most of all. In a paraphrase of a comment made by his friend Herbert, Pip is intelligent and naive, curious and hesitant, loyal and perfidious, snobbish but introspective, a false gentleman (through wealth) and a true gentleman (through re-discovered contrition, feeling, and love). Dickens's revelation of the humanity that still lurks in the most wretched of us is encapsulated nicely by Pip's caretaker and brother-in-law, the brawny but forgiving Joe, who says about his abusive father, \\"Whatsumever the failings on his part, dear reader, remember that he was that good in his heart\\". This noble, some may say Christian, sentiment, elevates GE beyond its busy, coincidental melodramatic soap opera plottings and trains its sharp focus on the multifaceted levels of the human condition."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Compared to other Dickens' books I have read, this one is the most bizarre and strange story, and it took a little bit of adjustment to get into it. But it didn't take long to lose myself in the magical, grand drama by this literary wizard. As usual, this book has rich background materials, the marshes, deprivation, violence, mysterious and dark past, turns and twists, surprises and over the top coincidences, vengence and forgiveness...The first person perspective by the protagonist is candid and often humorous as well as insightful about the conflict and frustration of an underprevileged person with aspirations in the society where status of a person is not very mobile. The title is fantastic, Great Expectations! How great, and how ominous! Indeed!"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Great Expectationsby Charles Dickens; I know that had I been required to read this book for 9th grade English, I'm pretty sure that I would have hated it. As it was it took me better than a month to get through the first half of the story... and then I raced through the second half in a couple of days on my Christmas Kindle. A classic story of poor boy makes good, loses his good fortune, finds it again through sacrifice and character and hard work. Lots of interesting examinations of British class separation and discrimination, expectations, and dry humor. Looking forward to more by Dickens."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"This book failed to capture my attention in school, but having read the first chapter more recently I was immediately hooked and couldn't recommend a greater classical read with a style that is still relevant to today's reader."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"From start to finish, awesome. From the moment I opened it, until I finished, I was entranced. Read it in one sitting. Without a doubt, my favorite book of all time."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"&quot;Great Expectations&quot; as well as other Dickens novels like &quot;Oliver Twist&quot; were written with a purpose. Dickens was so against some of the evils of his time that he had to do something to speak out against them. And he did. He represents in the lives of his characters the thousands of children forced into inhumane working conditions. And that is just one of wrongs he set out to correct. Carefully read, Dickens provides countless details of English life with its evils and triumphs. I have read several of his novels and always find them inspiring as well as educational."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I am not going to bore you with excerpts from the text. But I'll say this, Great Expectations is one of the most compassionate novels a person can read. The complexity of the plot adds a certain greatness which undoubtedly entices the attention of the reader. The story itself teaches us to never give up hope and that our destiny does not depend on our social status; but rather, the quality of our character."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I had to read this book twice: once in the ninth grade and once in college. While I think it is better suited for the college level, I can't say that I found it much more enjoyable the second time. The story revolves around the coming-of-age of Pip, the main character. Raised an orphan, Pip acquires a mysterious benefactor who funds his attempt to become a gentleman. There are some interestingly eccentric characters, and the book relies more on the characters themselves than the plot. However, this is an example of Dickens' wordiness becoming too cumbersome; it simply couldn't maintain my interest throughout the book."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Great Expectations is a very interesting book to read, from the beginiing scene with Pip at the graveyard to the touching ending of Pip with Estella, Charles Dickens has described wonderfully the plot and all the characters involved and how they all finally fit into place. A very good book to read ...."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Blantantly predictable, (I mean, you knew old Havisham was going to burn, didn't you?) Clunky plot, inevitable morality tale, and still the most bloody wonderful story ever! I would watch Great Expectations on the big screen, I'd watch the mini-series, I'd pay to see it live on Broadway - and none of that would compare with reading it again."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"My English teacher from my freshman year in high school didn't like this book, but I loved it! I thought Pip was pretty cute when he was a little boy, and I really didn't see any change in him when he became rich like my teacher said. This is a great book, and it's the only book I liked that I ever read in English class along with 'Anthem' and 'Of Mice and Men'. Like most books it goes slow at first, but you get into it more and more. Although I really, really do like this book, I refuse to see the movie which stars Ethan Hawke and Gwenyth Paltrow, because just by looking at the commericals and the pictures from the movie, I could tell that it's not like the book at all and for that, I know that I would hate it. As a matter of fact, my friend told me that it wasn't. So, I refuse to see the movie, but I was able to see an older movie of the book and I liked it, because it was like the book and that's what I like. This is a wonderful book and I wouldn't mind reading it again! A must have for any literature fans who like to sit back, relax, and well...read. : )"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I had to read this book this year for my English class. At first I was interested, when Pip was a child, but I quickly became sick and tired of it's boring nature. I am in the honors program in my school, and we only had about 2 and a half weeks to read it, but it seemed like 2 and a half years. I was disappointed most because this massive plot builds up, and I was waiting for something to happen, but nothing really did. Furthermore, it was a bit hard to understand, especially since my mind was drifting, becuase it is hard to pay attention to this book."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"This is definitely one book that I'll read again and again throughout my life. If I had to pick a favorite character, it would probably be Estelle because even though she was cold and distant and VERY conceited, she still had a heart of gold. It was lonely Miss Havisham who made Estelle the cold-hearted person that she was. I would recommend this book to anyone who is interested in reading about interesting characters that continue to develop throughout the story."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I've been out of college for awhile. Being away from literature and into the &quot;Real World,&quot; I had almost forgotten what reading a good book is like. I picked this up and literally couldn't do anything else until I finished reading it! Highly recommended for anyone who loves good fiction."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Read the review from the high school student who thinks he's a martian, and I think you'll agree that most of the bozos who give this novel less than five stars are full of snot."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"You said no one who is still is high school will understand this book. That is not entirely true. I am in seventh grade. I not only loved the book, I understood it too. I have done character analyses (for instance: Bentley Drummle had a troubled childhood) and critisized Pip's character. My mom insists that he's a &quot;loser&quot; - but, then again, she never did have that much insight into character. The poor guy is in love so he can hardly see straight! Anyway, I don't pretend that I'm average, because I'm not. But I enjoyed it and understood it."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"It's just too, too bad that no one reads this anymore. It is a timeless story of a young man (love-stricken from young childhood) growing to adulthood by means of a mysterious benefactor. Mr. Jaggers, John Wemmick, Biddy, Matthew and Belinda Pocket, Bentley Drummle, the Aged Parent, and Miss Skiffins are just a few of the absolutely marvelous characters that Dickens created for his story. And how could I forget Estella Havisham, the object of Pip's (christened Phillip) affection? Mr. and Mrs. Joe get a fair part of the story, and they are both delightful - one, because she is so horrible, and the other, because he is so good. A few of the more minor characters (the aformentioned Miss Skiffins is one) such as Trabbe's boy and The Avenger are superb even though they may only speak a few words. If I could give it ten stars, I would!"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"This is Dickens' 3rd last novel, and nothing indicates that he was running out of steam. While this lacks (in my opinion) the energy of &quot;Dombey and Son&quot; (1848), &quot;David Copperfield&quot; (1850), &quot;Bleak House&quot; (1853), or &quot;Hard Times&quot; (1854), it is still a phenomenal piece of literature. Pip is an interesting creation. First we see him as a small child who is victimized by his sister. His brother in law Jo (while not too bright) never approves of Pip's abuse. It is interesting that Dickens wrote this troubled marriage scene soon after his own divorce! It is also painfully tragic when Pip starts to make his way into the world and he has to realize that the kind hearted but simple Jo has to take a back seat to his success. Jaggers offers some welcome comical touches. It is interesting that Pip becomes victimized by a legitimate colleague Orlick and as it turns out, the old thief was his benefactor. (In my opinion the old thief was a literary reincarnation of Fagin.) To this day, I have never forgotten the chills when I discovered that the old thief in the early part of the novel was his benefactor. So we have domestic quarrles, true to life tragic events, strong images, comical touches, and surprise events!"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I reallly liked this book, though it made me tired to read it and I could not have any distractions while I read, I am really glad I did. This book was a good challenge if you stick to it. The book all comes together at the end if you keep reading. The characters are really deep. My teacher says the best thing about Great Expectations is it has a twisted plot line and the worst thing about Great Expectations is that it has a twisted plot line. Overall, I enjoyed the book, except the last two chapters. I believe Dickens got tired of writing the book and desided to end the book."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"This book is superb. Everything about it is very real to life (unlike much of Dickens' other novels). Though it may be hard to comprehend, it doesn't take a genius to understand the themes of this book. I'm not going to spoil it for anybody, but believe me, the themes plays into everybody's life, including love, money, and heritage. I also recommend Catcher in the Rye if you're into the types of books that make you stop and ponder."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I had to read Great Expectetions for school, at first it seemed like the worst book ever written, it was boring, confusing, and seemingly pointless. But, of course that was before I finished it and fully understood what Dickens was tying to convey. the whole book is a mystery, only in the very end do you finally find everything out. Note: if you are going to read the Cliffs Note version of the book (which i highly recommend you do) do not read the character summaries, because that will kill the whole book for you. Believe it or not, this is probabaly the only classial book with enough suspense to compete with the modern thrillers. Oh, and by the way, if you don't have to read it for school, I highly recommend you listen to the audio tape."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Those who have known the whole constitution of true art will assign to its realm Great Expectations.

However, it is far too good to heap words like &quot;boring&quot; upon simply because it is long and involved. The autobiographical narration lends it a personal quality far more appealing than that of A Tale of Two Cities, and above all Dicken's empathy for his characters is apparent. The branching subplots weave together seamlessly as the novel progresses (Unlike some people I'm not going to spoil the ending for everyone). Even if you've been turned off by Dicken's before, give it a chance."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I did not have \\"great\\" expectations after reading some of Mr. Dickens other work (see my review of \\"Tale of The Two Cities\\").

I could order books for my Kindle with one account and anything else with the other account. I have tried to straighten this out twice.

Thanks to a great teacher, we were able to get through this book without too many difficulties; however, I would not recommend this book to anyone who does not want to invest a while in reading it! I took us the whole second semester to finsh this book, doing most of the reading at home. While most everyone was engrossed in the storyline, it was like pulling teeth to actually read! I really enjoyed the story, but I would raher just remember the story than refresh my memory by rereading it because, face it, the story is just too long!P.S.Since I feel this is such a great story, instead of reading the book, might I recommend watching the movie?"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"In the first twenty or thirty pages, I was pleasantly surprised by Dickens's humor and had great expectations for his storytelling and prose-writing talent.I mean he is hailed as one of the greatest literary giants of English literature, as well as one of the most popular novelists of his time.But alas, my great expectations were dashed mercilessly, and I found myself - not unlike how Pip finds himself in the last portion of the novel - banging my head against the hard, boundless boredom that permeated the first 300 pages of non-drama, non-action, and non-story whose only saving grace was that it was not endless.In the beginning, Dickens sustains the story with action, and there's nothing wrong with that as it makes the story more engaging. But aside from that in the first interminable and insufferable two stages of \\"Pip's Great Expectations\\" that span exactly 300 pages, I was thoroughly disappointed in Dickens. Other than Pip getting rich all of a sudden, NOTHING happens: no desire, no real conflict, no gaps, no turning points.As far as the story is concerned, the 300 pages is crap.I said it. Don't gasp.The story finally, finally, finally picks up when Pip finds out the identity of his benefactor, goes through rather inexplicable mental ordeals about accepting the truth along with free money and sentimental outbursts with his \\"dear friend\\" Herbert about pretty much everything, followed by an incredibly maudlin confrontation with the guilt-stricken Ms. Havisham and a final showdown with the villainous Orlick into whose clutches Pip idiotically falls with a stupid letter that gives him little reason to risk the whole grand escape plan he and Herbert hatch for the next day.My conclusion: this book is overrated.Why is it that academics pick these boring books that can't tell stories as part of the western canon? I love reading classics, thanks, but THIS?The book displays a glaring lack of storytelling talent, psychological insight, and restraint. His prose is dense, sprawling, and unseemly as sentences are connected by ugly semicolons and don't flow beautifully at all. The scenes are more told than shown to the detriment of the flow of the story, and characters burst out into mawkish sentiments left and right.Yuck.People are irresistibly drawn to anything related to themselves. I have a sneaking suspicion that the academics who bill this book as \\"most fascinating\\" and \\"greatest and most sophisticated work\\" see THEIR prominent characteristic in it.Cloying, verbose, mediocre at best in the story composition, and irresistibly boring for the first 300 pages, it's \\"most fascinating\\" in the perplexing literary status it garnered over the years, \\"greatest\\" in its unnecessary length,and \\"most sophisticated\\" in the exquisite boredom it creates at that threshold pitch that is above sleep-inducing but below engaging.I won't be reading another Dickens in a long time.Read something else and save your time."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I'm a senior in high school and was asked to read this book for my AP English 12 class.

If he would have kept the book simpler, it might have been a little bit easier to read and understand. It also would have helped if the author would have only given some of the characters one name instead of giving some people two names making it look like they were a completely different person, that was very confusing.It was good at the end when things finally started coming together and making a little more sense. One of my favorite parts was when Pip finally realizes that he is not meant to be a gentleman, and that he was meant to be a blacksmith. The major themes were the only thing that really helped me understand the book. I really didn&#65533;t like this book very much because I couldn&#65533;t really relate to it, therefore, I couldn&#65533;t understand it.

If you want to get the interesting part of the book, read the cliff's notes. I've also heard it's a little less mind-numbing on tape.

At times i dont have a clue wats goin on but i get the basic gist of the story and plot. I only recommend this for reader lovers, highly advanced people in litereture and who can understand something not written in english."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"This book was very dull and boring. I was made to read it in English and I soon realized not far in that it was very boring. It's not a good book for highschool readers. It is written in very dull and boring text. I mean the theme is great and all but the language and storyline stinks. I would not ever read this book again and if I had a choice to get this book or nothing i wouldn't get anything. It isn't a book to buy but for some odd reason is still have the one left from school. This book is quite possibly the worst book i ever read. If you are really interested in this book then go see the stupid movie or rent i from the library."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Do not read this book. It is a form of painful torture! If you have to read it for school buy the Cliff Note. Or if your instructor is on to that kind of thing, at least listen to the audio book. At all costs do not read this book! Take it from someone who knows."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"You won't be needing a bookmark with this novel- more like a pillow! I read this my freshman year of high school, maybe I was just too young to understand it and appreciate it, but I could not read the whole thing without falling asleep. After reading half the book, I read the cliff notes and actually found them more interesting than the novel itself. Unless you are suffering from insomnia, I wouldn't buy it."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I had to read GE for my freshmen honors English class, and I thought Lord of the Flies was bad! Dickens takes 1 paragraph to convey an idea that could have been said in 1 sentence! Many of the vocabulary is just out of our time, and take the fun out of the story. Unless you have heaps of time and patience, I recommend that you stay away from this &quot;book&quot;."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I am a very hard reader to impress, but i have read this book twice! How this book was written was superb! I find the charactors to be so well develoed and I felt like I was in the stort. Loved it!!!!!"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"This is a priceless piece of history that reads excellently on my Droid device. This book has a tale that never gets old."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Great Expectations has always been my favorite by Dickens. The characters are timeless and the plot twists keep the reader engaged throughout."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Worth re-reading as an adult. This was mandatory reading in middle school. Nobody of that age could get the full story with all its nuances at that age. It's like reading a new book. What a wordsmith Charles Dickens was."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I've seen several movie versions of Great Expectations but had never read the entire book until now. I'm happy to report the book is even better than the movies. Love all the wonderful, witty dialogue and especially the sweet relationship between Pip and Joe. This ebook was free but well formatted and edited."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"This is a wonderful opportunity to read the classics, this book by Dickens gives us an insight in the life of the under privileged in older times. the way Kindle works is great because it has a built in dictionary which becomes very helpful."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Everywhere I went while reading this book, I heard, \\"You're reading Great Expectations? I love that book! It's one of my favorites!\\" Which led me to have great expectations about it.Of course, now, after finishing the book, I see where having great expectations can lead...how one could and should find happiness in one's own backyard or enormous TBR stack...I've given away the plot here, but this book is so much a part of American high school life that I can't be giving away much. How did I get through high school without reading it? My hs English teachers chose the heartbreaker, David Copperfield, so it's not my first Dickens. I can see that Dickens can tell a story. Who wouldn't love this book? It's the Harry Potter of its time."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"This is such a good book in so many ways. It's funny, I couldn't get through it as a kid, but now I've really enjoyed it. Charles Dickens writes these characters that seem so alive. He describes them so well, their little mannerisms, that that part alone fascinated me. Pip's perception of them felt really spot on for a kid. He was definitely put upon to some degree, but much of what he felt was horrible behavior toward him by the adults was really stuff that's common to every kid. It reminded me of how I felt sometimes toward relatives and friends of my parents, all of whom I like now, and I both laughed and felt horrified to realize it. Anyway, very very enjoyable read."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"This was a Book Group choice, but I really enjoyed reading it. I had seen TV productions before, so it was great to read the original and see how it compared. Many people love or hate, but I loved it."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I was forced to read this book in high school and hated it.But I find going back to some the old classics and re-reading them very enjoyable.And best of all they are free."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"How nice to reread an old classic as an adult, instead of in the classroom. A wonderful novel of Pip who comes into his \\"great expectations\\" via an unknown benefactor -- who he believes to be Miss Havisham. We see how the influence of money and position affect Pip's relations with his family and former neighbors, and not necessarily for the better. There are lots of surprise twists and turns in the plot, especially about Miss Havisham and her adopted \\"daughter\\" Estella and her true parentage.As always, a Dickens novel is peopled with wonderful and unusual characters that eventually all play a part in telling the story. I understand that there were two endings of this book published. The version I read had only one ending and I don't know which one it was. I will have to search out another version of this book to see which I liked best."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"My grandad recommended I read this. I will admit to being very skeptical on the first few pages. I had to read and re-read some of the passages quite a few times to undesrtand what was being said through the old english slang. However, once I passsed that, I found it to be a touching and very interesting story.It is filled with some of the greatest characters ever created in literature.Along the way you will find many truths applicable even in today's society and Dickens expresses it in way unique to him.Dickens has created one of the most beautiful novels ever written: Great Expectations. It's a must read for any book lover and it is by no means overated.This is one you would want keep as part of your collection. It is simply a treasure."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I loved this book. When my teacher first told us we had to read it I thought I would be bored. Boy, was I wrong. It was a little hard to get past the dialect, but what a great story. Dickens did a wonderful job with the characters and how all their lives are somehow connected."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"From the moment I discovered that \\"Great Expectations\\" was a mandatory book to read in many high schools I thought that I belonged to those happy people on whom, by good luck, it hadn't been forced in their teenage years. I do not think that even if it had, the novel wouldn't have brought me pleasure later, when I grew up, but my past experience with it would have certainly impeded taking the book in my hands again. There is little doubt that in many cases high school stifles the willingness to read literature (not \\"bestsellers\\", however) when young people are confronted with such serious and complex works as \\"Great Expectations\\".The situation with \\"Great Expectations\\" is similar to that when a high school student is forced to read a fairly technical textbook on contemporary physics: there are chances that he or she will like or even be enthralled by some ideas in the book, but inability to follow and understand details (although symbols might be recognised) will almost certainly produce a negative opinion of it in the end.\\"Great Expectations\\" is one of the greatest novels I have ever read. Often humorous, with a carefully planned structure and set of heroes, wonderful narration and an unmatched appeal to senses, it reveals a story of unrequited love, an affair which now stands out as one of the most painful in classical literature. The complex relationship of the principal heroes - Pip, a touchingly honest and faithful young gentleman, and Estella, his beautiful and highbrow tormentor, are at the heart of the plot. But such original figures as Miss Havisham, Mr Jaggers, Mr Pumblechook, Joe Gargery and Biddy supply a rich background - each of them being a perfect example of a character in literature. For, as Alphonse Daudet noted, \\"It is the business of the novelist to create characters, not to write fine prose\\". Though Dickens' fine prose is also above all praises.But \\"Great Expectations\\" is much more than a simple romance - it is a great life lesson. Why do people \\"destined for each other\\" often end up being apart? What makes us break other people's hearts? How long will true love last? What obstacles surmount?"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"What can I say that hasn't been said already? &quot;Great Expectations&quot; is a tremendous novel from the introductory paragraph to the final sentences. The plot is deep and intricate, and there's even a surprising plot revelation occuring late in the book about the origin of Pip's wealth and opportunity in life. The characters are all well-defined and inherently interesting, and such major characters as Pip, Estella, Joe, Miss Havisham, and others vividly live in the mind. Even minor characters such as Mrs. Joe and the Aged Person are memorable and amusing. The novel's storyline, beginning with Pip's early childhood and ending in his late middle age, is epic in breadth. &quot;Great Expectations&quot; treats the reader to a delightful plot and scene for all of its five hundred pages.Even better, however, is the brilliant prose Dickens gives us in the novel. It is humorous, moving, touching, witty, clever, and always perfectly phrased. Never for a single second does the reader feel bored. Like many great works of literature, there are plenty of moments where the writing is almost awe-inspiring in its beauty and language. With a talent as great as Dickens, one could write about almost anything and it would be tremendous reading. When paired with the brilliant plot of &quot;Great Expectations,&quot; it feels almost heaven-sent.Many readers see the term &quot;classic&quot; on a novel and feel that it becomes a type of chore, and add it to a laundry list of literature that somebody felt would be good for them. &quot;Great Expectations&quot; is a classic, but it's not at all the literary equivalent of medicine. It's a delightful treat, and a quick read despite its length. I can't imagine reading this and not treasuring it. It is, quite simply, fantastic."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I studied this book for 2 years in high school and never really read the book itself until a month before my super majorly imprtant exam. Up till then, i was surviving on cliff notes and whatever my tutor said. I had tried to read the book at least a hundred times but fell asleep after the first page.I give this book 4 stars for the fact that dickens is such an AMAZING writer. i'm not saying this coz its a classic. after studying this book for 2 years, you get to know the structure, the language, the relationships between the different plots and sub-plots. and i was BLOWN AWAY by the BRILLIANT way dickens tied everything together. SIMPLY AMAZINGI admit, it IS a tiring read. but like what another review said, Great Expectations was meant to be read chapter by chapter, one per week or soemthing like that. the book i read came with a timeline which shows the publication of each chapter.I do recommend this book. just make sure that you're really really awake when you're reading it. pay attention to the details e.g. how the atmosphere reflects the different characters stuff like that. Read it once. and read it AGAIN. i swear the 2nd time you read it, everything will become clearer. Read it a third time and you'll notice how Dickens pulls the novel off. pretty intriguing."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I know lots of people will flay me for saying this, but this book has a lot of repeat value. I could read it every year, for five years at least without getting bored doing it. I had read the abridged version in school, and a year ago i had seen the movie (featuring gweneth paltrow and ethan hawke). I liked these so much that inspite of knowing the story i bought the unabidged version and was plesantly surprised how much i enjoyed it. Both the movie and the abridged version concentrate only with Pip's relation with estella. The book is infact much wider in its scope. For example Pip's relation with Mr.Pocket fills more pages than that with estella.Charles dickens surely spins a superb yarn of pip, his ambitions, desires, weaknesses, and pureness of character which is so entirely credible and believeable that it seems like an autobiographical account told in the third person. This inspite of the novel containing eccentric characters like miss havisham difficult to find in actuality. Another important contribution of this novel is to portray the relation between pip and estella. Its extremely difficult to say what exactly it is. Infatuation? No. It was the very soul of his existance without which he could not exist. It lasted from childhood till the end. Love? Unlikely. He was torturing himself in her company and this can hardly be called love. Hatred? No. Vengence? No. On miss havisham's part maybe but not on that of pip or estella. There's no answer forthcoming. Just when we thought we were intelligent and mature enough to understand relationships Mr. Dickens comes along to tell us to start from kindergarten once again.I found Mr. Dickens style of writing quite modern. Of course there's an influence of the times he lived in but the novel has a very modern tang. In fact if the means of transport were cars instead of horses, there was electricity instead of candle light and so on, making only such cosmetic changes the novel would definitely seem to be written very recently. I just realised - the movie proves this."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I must admit, this review is slightly prejudiced. I am a high school student, and I read this book for fun. I had tried to read Dickens before, but found myself having a hard time ploughing through the complex vocabulary and intricate parlor dialogue of Hard Times. But I decided to take another stab at Dickens, perhaps with something a little more palatable. All of Dickens' novels, I realized at the end of Book I!!, are VERY, VERY SLOW -- AT FIRST. Then Dickens decides to play on his own soporific introductions!!!!! There is a crucial turn in events for Pip, and the book takes off. Every few paragraphs, there's another handhold so to speak, to keep the reader's suspense and to keep the plot building. Both the language and the many interwoven plots are delectable and unavoidably magnetic -- your hands just can't seem to put down the book, no matter what you do. This book has it all. It also helped me understand why I hated reading the Odyssey for English. (Translations always lose some of the vivacity and fullness that the author has pumped his or her very original work full of, and it is this fullness that made the work so great in the first place.) It is a long read, and you have to be willing to be patient with the beginning. But it's definitely worth it. And the more you read, the easier it gets. After reading this book, I feel inspired to read all of Dickens' works!"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"When I found out I had to read Great Expectations, by Charles Dickens for school, I was extremely dissapointed. I had already read A Tale of Two Cities, and absolutely hated it. Students in other classes had read Great Expectations and not liked it either, so I figured I would not enjoy it either. But I decided I would read it anyway, because it is considered to be one of the best books of all time. The books starts out fairly slow, and it takes the reader a few chapters to get used to Dickens's writing style, for he uses an abudance of description. He was paid by the word so he had incentive to do so. For those who are able to survive the first few chapters, they will enjoy an extremely lovable book and not be dissapointed. The book is timeless, with the basic story line being one that has affected almost everyone sometime in their life; falling in love with somebody who does not return the feelings. Pip, the main character, falls in love with an exotic and beautiful girl, Estella, but of course she does not have any feelings for him. So Pip does everything he can to win her approval, and most importantly her heart. It is hard to skip around in the book. While some passages might seem as if they have nothing to do with the story, they do. Everything in the story is tied together somehow. Skimming the book is not going to help. Certain events and people the reader thinks are insignificant or forgot completley, will appear over and over throughout the book. I am glad that i decided to read Great Expectations, despite the negative remarks from peers. I found out that most of them never made it past the first few chapters, so they missed out on the good parts. The only reason I did not give the book a higher score is that parts of it are slow and dry, but stick with it, you will not be upset."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Dickens takes you on a ride that will keep the reader enthralled throughout. Prepare to be sucked into the story and become very attached to the wonderful (yet dreadful) characters of this novel."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Beautifully binded book.

I guess my expectations (no pun intended) on the book were high seeing that it was a Dickens' novel."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I have enjoyed the work of Charles Dickens since I was a girl.

I was going to get it for my Ipad but it is for my daughter for High School and so she would need to take it each day to school so I got it at the end of school and it was a great price."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"My first Dickens and not my last. I love the way he writes, I love his wit and imagination. The twists and turns in the last third/quarter of the book are fantastic, keeps the page turning.

For a younger reader the language can be difficult, so I helped him as much as I could. I thoroughly enjoyed the story though! I like Dickens' since of humor as well as the way he kept you hanging on wondering just how this was going to end. As we get farther and farther away from the lifestyle of the 1800's I think it is important to look back and see what life was like before technology. I also enjoy the British take on things. I don't always &#34;get it&#34; until I re-read it a time or two, but the humor is there. (SPOILER ALERT!) I actually thought the ending was sad until my son pointed out that in class they considered the fact that when Pip &#34;saw no shadow of another parting from her,&#34; could mean that they were never seperated again. Duh! Like I said, old language and another time!!"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I loved this book. However unlike others, this one keeps things somber. It is not some frilly romance novel but a little more realistic with many twists and turns."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I am thirteen and chose to read this book from a list for school. The story is good- but the writing is in really old english style and it takes forever to read. I barely got it done in time to get my report finished by the due date (finished sunday and the report is due tuesday. I had three weeks!) However, the story line is really good and it comes together in an interesting way at the end.

Great tie in of all the characters and relationships of each to the main character. I preferred the author's original ending."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"This book was surprisingly funny, but I went into not really knowing what to expect beyond that it's a \\"classic\\". The plot revolves around the rise of a young man, Pip, in society due to a mysterious benefactor. The subplot of Miss Havisham in her lonely house is creepy and introduces us to Estella, the love interest of Pip. At times the writing felt antiquated and I had to reread some passages to get the gist of the meaning, but it was fun to feel sort of challenged as a reader."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"This is a classic story of unrequited love and growth. It teaches something to everyone who reads it. There is so much beauty and depth in this novel, it cannot be put into words. My advice for anyone and everyone who will read this in the future is to treasure every moment you spend reading this book. Take every detail in and you will never regret the time you spent because it is entertaining and absolutely thrilling. There are a lot of twists and turns in the plot as well as the emotions in the characters and it literally brought tears to my eyes."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I read this book in 5th grade and I loved it! I still do. It is the best book. I think it is not boring at all and is very very very funny!!!! I think that everyone will like it once they get into it!"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I think that two clarificifactions need be made to edify those who thought this book &quot;sucked&quot;, and that the characters were &quot;insane&quot;. Dickens is exaggerating! For example, there are hardly any people in real life like Jaggers, who do everything in such a business-like way. And yet he is very interesting and highly entertaining. And for everyone who thinks there were too many details: try to imagine just a bleak straightforward account of Pip's life. A good novel shouldn't just be a summary. And if you think it's wordy and too descriptive, try IVANHOE (another great book). Regarding the alternate ending: YOU NEED TO UNDERSTAND THAT THE FOCUS OF THIS BOOK IS NOT PIP&quot;S LOVE FOR ESTELLA. Who gives a damn whether he marries her or not? The focus of the story is on Pip's aspiring to such expectaions, and being drawn away from his family and humble origins, until he discovers the true treasures of life. I loved this book, and if you do not think it ranks as a classic, then what does?"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Great Expectations is the story of a young boy, Pip, and how he struggles to reach the experiences of Estella, the girl he loves, as he grows up and matures. This novel, written by Charles Dickens, explains the disappointment of loving someone without response, and being unsatisfied with one's life, because of having such high expectations that one cannot meet. I liked the way that the author portrays the characters and the setting to give a resemblance of the theme. I was interested throughout the story, for it is gripping and unpredictable. I sincerely recommend this book to anyone who enjoys novels that one can relate to with a deep meaning. Also, to anyone that likes a challenge Great Expectations is an ideal book."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"When a game of leap-frog goes awry, young Pip Maplethorp's father is killed.With the family crumb-winner out of the picture, Pip is forced to travel to London where he finds employment as a Governess to the Lingus family (whose daughter, Constance, taunts him with cries of \\"you're lost - lost in a Fog of Lag !\\"). On day, while gathering pond scum, Pip meets and befriends Dr. Wetherbee. This chance meeting provides the book with one of it's few moments of comic relief, as Dr. Wetherbee repeatedly strikes Pip about the face and head with a cricket bat that he affectionately calls \\"Trevor\\". I won't ruin the book for you by telling you what Pip sees behind the potting shed that makes him no longer desire to be a Pediatrist, but I will tell you that, after reading that chapter, I never looked at pudding the same way again. I predict that this book will have resurgence in popularity and soon everybody will be saying, \\" Is that your Dickens in your hand?\\""},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"This is Dickens' greatest novel, and one of the best of all time. Full of some of his most memorable characters, such as Magwitch (convict with a heart -- or liver), Miss Havisham, Pumblechook, Jaggers, Wemmick and more. From the opening graveyard scene to the final confrontation between Pip and Estella, you're hooked, laughing and crying. Pip is the Dickens character with the most psychologically realistic growth, and is therefore the author's most sympathetic hero. Wonderful plot, wonderful description, an absolute must. I highly recommend the Bantam paperback because the introduction by John Irving, &quot;The King of the Novel&quot;, is just as extraordinary in its own way. It's a superb, personal, passionate defense of Dickens that has affected me as much as any of Irving's best novels."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"While reading the reviews that others had written, I was amazed at how many people did not like this book. Maybe if you weren't so rushed into reading this book, you might actually enjoy it. Some of the reviews may stop you from reading this book, but I am telling you to read it. It is very descriptive, has a wonderful plot, and a great author. Ignore the other reviews because this book is clearly a classic and will ALWAYS be a classic."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Yes, it's hard to believe. Not a page is wasted. There are no digressions and few apparent digressions; the story - admittedly a long story - is swiftly and cleanly told, and it contains all the character growth, suspense, and frippery that one could reasonably ask of any story. This is DESPITE the fact that the book has all the virtues of any Dickens novel. The languge is, as usual, witty and a delight to read - in fact, more so than usual: it turns out that first person narration suits Dickens. All of the charcters are memorable - in fact, more so than usual: it comes as a great surprise to hear that this is the Dickens novel with the fewest characters, if you actually number them. The usual quota of gorgeous incident is there: in fact, more. And so on. It's hard to imagine a more nearly perfect book. -And there's one other thing I should mention. \\"Great Expectations\\" probably has a special personal appeal to many different sorts of people, but I would like to especially, from personal experience, commend the novel to graduate students. I hope they'll see what I mean."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"An undeniably solid book. I can certainly identify with Pip, but it was, at times, drab. Maybe if I hadn't been forced to read it I would have enjoyed it more."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I coulda thought there would have been a better ending, but it doesn't really matter. Mrs. Dooley gave us a really easy test over it, so I don't really care, because we spent a whole 3 weeks reading this book."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Dickens is a rare genius who succeeded in capturing vividly the manifold pains - physical, emotional, and moral - of childhood and the effect of these scars in the adulthood. As a result, his stories still resonates powerfully after so many years. On the weak points, Dickens tends to rely on remarkable coincidences to tie the plots together, and the psychological studies of his characters are not as sharp and profound as those of Dostoyevsky or Henry James. I also found the contrived happy ending very unsatisfying."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"This book is an incredible read. The main character really absorbs the attention of the reader. The plot is amazingly well done, you won't want to put the book down!"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Everyone must read this book. It is quite a story, but not for the weak of heart. It will make impostors change their ways (or at least know the extent of wrongdoings) and those who are earnest count their blessings that they are."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"This book shows alot of character and keeps you wondering what this little boy is going to go through next. charles dickens is a wonderful writer. This book should be made mandantory for all students to read while they are still in high school."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"More high school students should read this book.

Even though it is written in older times and with &quot;big words&quot; doesn't mean one should not read it and say it is boring and stupid. Many high schoolers can relate to Pip when he was bored with being a blacksmith because he got tired of doing it, because alot of times high school students sign up to do stuff that it turns out they don't like or that they are tired of because they thought they would like it or their parents made them do it. Many high schoolers can also relate to when Estella makes fun of Pip, because they argue with siblings or that guy/girl who sits next to you in biology class that you don't like but they still talk to you. Then when Pip gets his chance to finally become a gentleman, many high schoolers finally get their chance to do something they want. Once you read the first few chapters of Pip's childhood and up to when he gets to become a gentleman, you are hooked. I personally loved this book. It was one of the only books I read in my freshman year of high school, and now I am glad that I read it. It was wonderful."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"This was a great book because of the way that he made it seem that you were there.Also because of the way he kept you on the edge of your seat, and the way that all the characters are all familiarized to each other makes the book good but hard to understand,except the way that he wrote it in Old English made it hard to read."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I first read this book when I was 12 or 13 - ten years later I decided to read it again because I remember loving it so much. It was just as good the second time round.While not his best book (of the ones I've read David Copperfield takes that prize) it is a thoroughly enjoyable read with larger than life charcters and, in places, Dickens' trademark subtle, sarcastic humour. Add a great storyline and you've got a great book.I cannot believe that so many younger people are panning this book. Not being full of adrenalin-packed scenes does not make it boring! Get an attention span!One more comment - while the recent film with Hawke and Paltrow was a good film in its own right, it lacks so much when compared to the book."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I am 16 years old and this was my summer reading book. I thought it was pretty good. Just because you have to read it for school, don't just discount it as a worthwhile book. Yes, it is long, but it DOES have a point. You have to keep in mind that Dickens publiched this in monthly installments in his magazine - so yes, it is long. But take your time and enjoy the story."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"This review comes from a 15 year old male. I found this to be a rather good novel. If you are willing to read a big novel, do so and you should find some enjoyment in this book. If you can't stand reading some pages with just too much detail to get to the actual plot, avoid. Email me your comments, peace."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Great Expectations has been one of the first of many novels I happen to touch upon fashioned by Charles Dickens. I set forth to reading it with a mind not interested but curious. Zeal may be the one motive that takes me through the first part of the novel. Fleeting moments of ambivalence of good and evil throughout the novel can always be found in one's life. As have been articulated, I find myself in Pip's reaction to what his fate and destiny has brought him. Pip's oscillation between compunction and remoselessness, egotism and selflessness is the cardinal element upon whcih the story is built .On the other hand, the plotting of the novel is superbly constructed, with the lives of countlss characters interwined with one and other. Miss Havisham, I reckon, is one of the best of them. This is one great novel that you should not miss. Miss it and you shall lose what is more valuable than Pip's expectations."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Pip craves the approval of Miss Havisham and the love of Estella, who basically treat him like dirt. Even when he's with them he's miserable and knows it. Pip also knows that he's being an ungrateful snob towards Joe and Biddy, who've done nothing in his life but love, respect, and protect him. This because he cannot help but view them through the eyes of the rich and vindictive Miss Havisham and the beautiful but really darn mean Estella. Despite all this, Pip is a likeable character with whom it is easy to identify and sympathize. Eventually he confronts the superficiality of his expectations and embraces his true nature. In the process he transforms both Miss Havisham and Estella into feeling human beings, understanding and remorseful of the pain caused by their previous conduct."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"...this book and I are! I had to keep reminding myself that this story was fiction, otherwise I probably would have gotten much more emotional about it than I did. Many of the emotions Pip went through, I have also at some point. What doesn't kill you, makes you stronger (or at least very sick... poor Pip!)."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"This book is in one of my Top 5 Favorite all time books. I have read it again and again. The only problem I have with it is that I am never able to get through part three. How could I call it my favorite then? Read the book and discover the magic."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"My first experience with this book was as a freshman in high school. Being so young, it was nearly impossible to grasp the depth and breadth of this genius piece of work. This story is amazingly broad in character development. Through the novel, one is able to follow the life journey of Pip, and his ties to those closest to him in life. He &quot;changes, and changes again,&quot; and can never fully recover from what he learns. There's no going back. This book will forever remain one of my favorite. It's one that leaves you wondering how a person could have the talent to create such a touching, masterful work."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"People have enjoyed the adventures of Pip and friends (or enemies, as the case may be) for decades! Though quite confusing at times, Great Expectations was a well thought out novel. This book required more concentration than most, with a cast of characters that would fill the world many times over. I had trouble reading it in the normal haphazard fashion I usually take; a chapter here, a few pages on the way to school, because of all the details put into it. I know this classic was written with money being paid per word, but I found much of the long, rambling, descriptions to be the one major fault of the novel. I think that the one reason people accept and cherish these lengthy descriptions is because Great Expectations is one of the &quot;classic classics&quot;, so to speak. People expect it to become tedious in places, filled with descriptions of anything from a desk drawer to toenail clippings. But overall, I found this to be a touching book, about mangled love, childhood, and life in general. A great read for anyone with patience!!-LJ"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I think that this book was superb, not just because it's a classic but because of it's morals and it's story of young Pip and how he goes through many many adventures and many wonderful happenings in his life. That's why of course it's called Great Expectations - the title tells all"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"This book helped me realize I do not need to read books in a conventional manner to fully enjoy them. I read the book with the aid of books on tape while in the back of my parent's Toyota riding through Holland. The atmosphere of the many hours spent enjoying the book while I would have been sleeping or staring vacantly at the fields still calls me to thank my eighth grade teacher for assigning it to me. Even though I remember groaning at the first sight of the thick novel, I am happy to have known the eccentric nature of the rich old lady, the adventuresome curiousity of young Pip, and most of all the intriguing presence of the girl Pip would be affected by for his whole life"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"This novel, written by Charles Dickens, shows us that we cannot achieve happiness from money. It also teaches us that if we succumb to our desires we will end up losing in life. I recommend this beautifully written masterpiece to anyone who enjoys reading"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"After doing numerous analysing on the novel, I find Estella the least developed of all the main characters in the book. The chapters in which she apperas in are short; her actions are small and her speeches are simplistic. I find it a pity that Charles Dickens did not actually further develope Estella and based the entire story on Pip"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"This book is one of the most depressing novels I haveever read. Just about anything and everything goes wrongfor Pip and just about everyone in the story dies. It wasa good book, don't get me wrong, just a bit of a downer."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Great Expectations was a mediocre book. I was not impressed. I had to read this book for my 9th grade honors English class. It was too long and boring. I see were Dickens was trying to go with the suspense, but it just made the book monotonous and boring. The uncanny coincidences just did not seem real. It's ok to use a coincidence as a tool of suspense, but this was just overkill. Every chapter was boring. I got tired pretty quickly of pip wishing he were with Estella for the whole book. Also, the book seemed to stray away from the main point for chapters at a time. Who cares about Wopsle's stupid plays? This could all be summed up in a couple of page short story. In conclusion, this is another swing and a miss for Dickens. STAY FAR AWAY FROM THIS BOOK! If you want to read a good Dickens story, read \\"A Christmas Carol\\" and nothing else written by Charles Dickens."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I had to do this for school. I could hardly get through it. All they did was talk. It was long and boring. I HATED IT!"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"The most boring book i've read in ages.

Details in a book make it interesting but the extended details in this book made it nausiating. This book had a very interesting plot and many good ideas but the way it was writen didnt appeal to most of the students in my school that read it. A poll was taken and about 73% of the students in the school liked this book. What does that show about the book?"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"This book was literally the worst thing thats happened in my whole entire life.I was forced to read this long. boring book for english class and either fell asleep, or sat there and sared off into spce.THIS BOOK WAS HORRIBLE!!!!!!!!!The only GOOD thing about this book is that I hav found a new way to doze off without sum sleeping pills (just read the first two pages and WALLA ure fast asleep!!!!!!!)"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"after reading this book i think dickens would benifit from very low expectations. and by that i mean a lot of people will be returning this book and giving bad reviews. all the classics always in my opinion, are very bad"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Let me see.I hate this book. It is a required reading for English, mostly to show the difference between Flat and Round characters. Well it worked! Most of the characters in this book are flat! Ugh.I can't get over how the plotine doesn't even move normally. Its like when you want to drive somewhere and you hit a million and one detours. Eventually you'd say, \\"Screw it! Who needs food?\\" But nooo... Dickens just kept on driving around. I think only ONE subplot was actually straightforward, and that would be Miss Havisham and her ex lover.Basically, I got halfway through this book, then fled to Sparknotes. I wasn't going to read it. I was just going to make sure I knew enough to pass the test I had to take on the garbage.Ironically enough, those of us who used Sparknotes got better test grades than those who actually read the book. That say something about how much sense it made..."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"This book by far is the worst piece of shi--garbage I have ever laid my eyes on. The story has a skeleton, and a little bit of meat (and I like meat), but mostly, it's just fat. Especially the second stage of Pip's expectations, which finds Pip devoid of any characterizations beyond \\"I'm rich and you're not,\\" and \\"Oh, how I do love the lady Estella.\\" It's enough to make you vomit. Mr. Dickens should have made this a much shorter novel, or maybe even a short story. It still would have been boring, but maybe not as boring."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"A guy I work with read this book and it seemed like he was reading it for three years! Every day he sat there with his legs crossed sipping his tea and reading Great Expectations, spending about an hour on every page! What an aristocrat. It was brutal!Than I tried to read the book.I couldn't get past the first stage or the first part or whatever because it was so f*cking boring i thought my f*cking head was going to explode! NOTHING HAPPENED!That freak I work with didn't like it either.I'm just surprised he could read the whole thing without completely losing his mind."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"AAH! This book bored me to tears... literally. Thanks to Charles Dickens and his array of b****y women and the rest of the babbling morons, I never want to see that book again. It was thrown across the room many times in the course of my reading. Being forced to read that garbage didn't help much either. I don't understand why honor english students have to be tortured with his 500 pages of nothingness. I had to get the monarch notes to be able to understand it all! It made me feel like an idiot and maaaaaaybe if it was understandable and shorter.... it would actually be good. MAAAAAAAYBE!"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I think Great Expectations was a very long, boring book that didn't have a plot. Dickens seemed to drag the story on and on. If the book wasn't as long, it might have been better. I heard somewhere that Dickens got paid by the word and that is was there's a lot of extra, stupid words in it. I also think that it was twisted because everyone was realted to each other."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"the book was boring, poopy, i didn't like it at all, had to read it for school, not a good time"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Dickens was actually a good writer, but he never could come up with a decent ending. His stories were well written, and the characters were interesting, especially in this book. This story follows the life of a young boy as he grows up and tries to make a place for himself in the world. He meets some interesting characters that, at times, get the better of him. He also falls in love with an unattainable woman. The story carries on without a climax, without a point, without resolution, and, ultimately, without an ending. It just abruptly stops. I think this was the best book I read by Dickens, which isn't saying much."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I thought that this was a pretty good book. In the beginning I wasn't sure if I would like it becuase it was kind of different but I continued reading it and I ended up enjoying it. Some of the parts in the story were kind of hard to read. There were so many characters to remember and to keep track of. One of the characters went by two different names so that got confusing. Another thing that got difficult while reading was the dialect that Dickens used while writing the book. I like the way Dickens wrote this book. He doesn't tell you about everything that is going on, so you have many questions about things and at the end everything is answered for you. It doesn't turn out how you would expect."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I found most of the book a good read. I was suprised by who Pip's benefactor was but that's what a good book is suppose to do. Intregue you, suprise you.... I didn't enjoy the ending though I thought with all that went on in the book that there would be a different approach to the ending."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I thought this book was a really good book. I liked it because it was very exciting and interesting. I thought it was difficult to read though because of all the characters in the story. I thought that there was way to many characters and there didn't need to be that many. Dickens also used a lot of long and hard words which I didn't understand that well. That made the story even harder to read. It was also very long and I think that Dickens could have taken some parts out. It got kind of boring during the middle of the book but at the end it was all worth reading. I think Dickens is a very good writer and I would like to read some more of his novels. He thinks of neat stories that no other author would think of. Overall, this was a very good book."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I must confess that this was the first book I've read from Charles Dickens and did'nt liked it.I believed that he would describe more profoundly the rigid class difference in the british society of the end of XIX century."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"This book got to me fast and in great condition, and at a great price!"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"The Great Expectation was a great book. I thought that it was a little hard to read. But I just read the part over that I didn't understand and I eventually understand it. Another thing that confused me is that Charles Dickens uses a lot of names for his characters. He should of just stuck to one name per character so that the readers wouldn't get confused. He also had some unrealistic plot in the story. Otherwise this was a great story how a boy becomes a gentleman and learns how to act. I would recommend you to read this book if you want to keep guessing."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Hi! my name is Roy Chan and I am reading this when I'm in 7th grade. I decided to read Great Expectations because I thought it has a lot of excitement. When I read it, it turn out okey but when I'm in Chapter 6 it is boring and hard to understand. So I give it up. Maybe I don't understand this book because I am too young. Maybe I will read this book again in 9th grade."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I was forced to read Great Expectations because my Accelerated English teacher made us. I do not think the novel was very well thought out and was much too indecisive in many parts. Dickens did not seem to know really what he wanted to do with the plot. He even made two endings!!! He was much too descriptive and that made the story even more boring than its story line made it in the first place. I have heard that many people think this was his greatest book and that makes me wonder if they have read anything else by him because I do not think anyone could get much more boring!"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Well I read this book with some great expectations and I shouldn't have. I figured that it was going to be a wonderful book because of the author (wrong) Ihad to strugle just to read 2 pages without getting sleepy.

I can not with in any honesty recomend this book to anybody but I would eagerly recoment Dickens."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I had to read this for a high school summer reading list. It was the worst reading experience I ever had, and I love reading books. I cried several times trying to plug through the long-winded (obviously Dickens paid by the word) presentation.

This book might be great as an adult (which I'll gladly never know), but definitely not as a 16 year old. Sucks sucks sucks.Note to Teachers and Principals, please don't assign this to your high school students. There are so many better and more captivating books.

The reviews also are of the paperback version, NOT this product. Please provide adequate product information. Who is the reader? Is there just one reader, or a cast?

The pages came incredibly badly cut and the cover was thorn and damaged, as if it had been used for over a decade!Besides, the introductory study gives a lot of details and hints about how the story is going to end and I hate that!"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Put simply, Great Expectations is a wordy, convuluted, and overrated peice of trash. Written originally in different volumes and distributed to an excited Victorian republic, Dickens was able to make his audience care and feel for his odd, moving characters. He was the Stephen King of his day; a clever businessman who distributed mediocre books to the public. That Dicken's fever passed on from one generation to the next is fine, that this made Dicken's books classics in schools is a shame. But let me get to the actual book at hand! Yes, many characters in Great Expectations are original and interseting. Overall, however, Great Expectations is wordy (!), and painfully convoluted. It is often difficult to get through, and geared towards a certain audience only. This is not to say that everyone will dislike Great Expectations, but we live in an age (good or bad) of gritty realism. Authors like James Joyce and F. Scott Fitzgerald wrote with and still show a heavenly pen, Dicken's stories are what turns so many young people against reading. Anyone who wants to live in a former era, Great Expectations is a must; for anyone who wants a powerful, sophisticated read PLEASE put Great Expectations in the incinerator."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"This book was a large disappointment for me. I had seen the movie, and hoped that the book would be good. However, I was wrong. In fact, this book turned out to be one of the worst I have ever read. The book has too much description, not even important to the story. Dickens lost my interest in the book from the very first chapter, just a plain description of main character Pip's history of his family and town. This chapter drags on for too long, as does the rest of the book. As an example, the character Estella's rudeness towards Pip is repeated so often that it becomes annoying. I got the point of Estella's bringing up and lifestyle early on in the novel, and this did not have to be repeated so often. This book could very well have been interesting, but Dickens did not do a good job writing it. His continuous decscrptions of such landscapes as rivers and trees are irrelevant to the story, and caused me to drift away from it. I do not reccommend this book to anybody, and advise you to avoid it. I, as well as many other people I know, could not even finish this book. It brought no interest to me, and it is too long, considering that it contained nothing attention-grabbing and no excitement. However, if you do insist on reading this book, please just get the cliffnotes. It is not a book worth buying."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"when I read this book. Honestly, after I liked &quot;A Tale of Two Cities&quot; I was expecting more from Dickens. Maybe Dickens wrote in the style of his time, which was to be very detailed, but it really doesn't translate well to today. I don't mind long books (I'm reading War and Peace now) but this book went into extreme detail about the most meaningless things.This story was essentially a Victorian soap opera. Theres all sorts of unknown parents, secret coniving, mysterious benefactors, and worst of all, many unrealistic characters. This book was so contrived and unnatural that I really don't see how it's attained &quot;classic&quot; status.If you don't mind meticulous attention being payed to the minutia, which is Dickens's style, then I'd recommend &quot;A Tale of Two Cities.&quot; If not, there are many other authors much better than Dickens that you can read."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"i had to read this book for school and ill admit i wasn't exactly enthusiastic about it. But as soon as i started reading it i fell head over heals into Pips world. Great expectations is about a boy named Pip who lives with his sister and his brother in law Joe. He begins to visit the rich lady of the town who has a beautiful but crual adopted daughter named Estella whom Pip falls desperatly in love with. Pip finds out that he has a bennifactor so he moves to london to become a gentleman. He meets many people like the stiff lawer Mr. jaggers,the happy go lucky Herbert and Mr. whemmik who is a stiff as Mr. jaggers in the office but once at home in his casatle he laughs and has a great love life. this is one of those books that you can't stop reading. And the twisting plot and all the sub plots are just like todays soap operas. Happy reading"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"With a top notch cast and a wonderful, well planned adaption, this easily ranks as one of BBC's best radio drama presentations. The horror, romance, and tongue-in-cheek silliness of youth are all thoroughly portrayed here. Pip is as he should be... a sympathetic but misguided character whose life is spent in the pursuit of hollow happiness.The BBC drama does well on many levels... Sound is excellent, superb acting, all the major plot twists seem to be intact... Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I bought a few of these beautifully bounded Penguin Classic books. Great Expectations, Pride and Prejudice, and Jane Eyre. They are beautiful on my book shelf but I wish that the quality was better. Gosh in this day and age with Kindle and computers I miss the art of book binding and printing. Don't get me wrong I love my computer and I love modern technology but I will never, ever give up having books. I love the smell and feel of paper. I think that the Everymans Library cloth bound hardcover books are better quality but these get points for the printing on the books. By the way Amazon has the best prince on these. I saw them at Anthropologie for almost $10 more."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"It is an insult to any reader who wants to enjoy Dickens's books. It has been severely abridged (with a very inconspicuous mention of the fact) for no obvious reason. It also has an asinine foreword by some dubious character. Do not touch it if you like literature!"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"In honor of Charles Dickens' 200th birthday, I re-read one of the first of his novels that I experienced originally over 30 years ago. After having read some eight or nine other Dickens novels, revisiting Great Expectations was a somewhat different experience this time around.Like David Copperfield, this is a first person narrative. Being inside the mind of the central intelligence and narrator, the reader can only know what he knows. Therefore, there are fewer narrative threads and multitudes of characters to weave into a complex tapestry than there are in other great multi-layered novels such as Bleak House and Little Dorrit. The jovial wit and exuberance of Pickwick becomes saturated with a world weariness and verges on cynicism in most of the novels of the second half of Dickens' career. As one of his last completed novels, Great Expectations fits within this pattern.Pip is not quite the bland, colorless character that Oliver Twist or David Copperfield are. True, the structure of the plot almost demands that he be a passive recipient of much of the action. His fate is mapped out for him by the anonymous benefactor from his youth and it is not until well into the second half of the novel that he actively seeks to steer the course of his life with each subsequent piece of knowledge he acquires. Pip is not quite an innocent. From an early age, he is consumed by guilt over unknown sins he feels he has committed. He does fall prey to vanity and he descends easily into spendthrift habits and enjoys his unearned prosperity with shameless hedonism. His greatest sins seem to be pride and vanity, leading to the snobbery that fuels the snubbing of his faithful and saintly brother-in-law Joe. To his credit, he is self-analytical and examines these shortcomings as soon as he realizes he possesses them.The sentimentality that often mars even the greatest of Dickens' novels is muted in this one. Pip is fully aware that he is no angel and there are few \`catch phrases' as often appear in his other novels to signal the reader to be moved. On the other hand, the coincidences are piled a little too high for my taste and the evil Orlick subplot seems to be one adversity too many for this plot which can sustain its own weight on the saga of Pip, Estella, Miss Havisham and Magwich.As much as any novel, in Great Expectations Dickens captures the torture of a male's infatuation with an \`unattainable' female beauty, especially one so willing to inflict heartache. This novel still reaches across the centuries with an emotional power that is timeless and universal. Regarding the so called happy ending that Dickens revised as a concession to public sentiment, the ending for this novel is not quite so clear cut as one might expect in a Dickens novel. The last sentence, in particular, includes a double negative that in no obvious way equals an unequivocal positive. By doing this, Dickens is able to sustain the tone of the novel leading up to it and not betray the thematic thread he has followed for almost 500 pages. Despite its shortcomings, Great Expectations possesses a power never surpassed in his novels."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Anyone who loves the english langauge language will enjoy this book. Dickens is a master of description bringing to life the colorful characters. So, if you haven't read Dickens for years, pay him a visit ."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I had great expectations, because I had listened to a very good Charles Dickens recording by Martin Jarvis earlier (Hard Times), and Great Expectations was also good, even if it did not make me laugh quite as much as the Hard Times audiobook."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Read this when I was about 10yrs old, then saw the movie at an old theatre. I've probably reread at least a few times later. Never gets old, its like replaying an old classic.I remember reading the other books in print and it didn't have any guides or history or word translations. Used a dictionary and encyclopedia to figure certain things out.I purchased the BN classic and it provides a bit more history that one would have known, unless you've done a research paper on it. Other helpful insight & information one may not know during that time period or era. BN does a pretty good job."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Great Expectations by Charles Dickens is one of the greatest novels I have read. First, I admit, I have difficult transitioning to Dicken's novels. They are written in English, but not in the version of the langauge I speak. However, after reading for a while, I am able to adjust to his style.This novel is great for many reasons. First, it helps me to understand the poverty and hardships faced by the poor in England during his time. Whenever I read one of Dicken's novels, I am always left with an attitude of gratitude. Additionally, in this novel, nothing works out the way I expect or want it to. I wish that Pip would not have acted as he did once he came into his great expectations. I wish that things could have worked out differently with Miss Havisham and Estella. But, the ending is well done. The twists are what I enjoy most from Dicken's novels. I highly recommend this novel."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"As background information, I am in the process of reading most of Dickens 22 novels. I bought the Penguin Popular Classics version of the novel. It is very basic and comes in a simple green cover. It contains no introduction or analysis, just the text plus a very brief historical sketch of Dickens. It seems to be an excellent value for the money and I bought three Dickens novels in the series. I was a bit disappointed in that one book seemed to fall apart as I read it: the binding seemed very weak and cheaply made. It was marginally okay for the present book which is just 400 pages, and the book did not fall apart, but did seem damaged after one read. Another Dickens novel, which was 700 pages long, fell apart with at least 50 pages coming loose. After this bad experience, I bought other versions of Dickens's works - Wordsworth Classic versions and the regular Penguin Classic versions, the ones with the photo on the covers.Charles Dickens, who lived from 1812 to 1870, is the best know male English writer of the 19th century. He authored 22 novels plus numerous short pieces. Most of his writing was first written in serialized form, later published as single novels.A young Dickens at the age of 12 had the unenviable job of attaching labels 10 hours a day at the Warren's boot blacking factory. That experience shaped much of his writing career. Still in his teens he became a law clerk, then later in his twenties a journalist. The last job as a reporter led to the serialized writing of his novels. His works were social commentaries with larger than life characters, or colorful caricatures, living in the slums of London. He was a critic of poverty, social injustice, and the slow moving court system. Those themes permeate most of his novels and it is present her in Great Expectations. This is a novel set in London and the countryside close to London. It is a story of a young boy who wants to grow up and become wealthy and to be a gentleman. Those are his \\"great expectations.\\"Without giving away critical plot elements, it is the story of a young boy called Pip, whose parents are dead, and who lives with his sister and her husband Jo who is a blacksmith. They want Pip to learn the trade and be a blacksmith as well. They live in a small town near marshlands near London. His ambitions are grander and he wants to escape to London and become a gentleman. Will Pip find happiness? Will he succeed? Action shifts back and forth between the small town where Pip first lived and the city of London. It involves Pip, lawyers, accountants, Pip's new friends, his love interest, etc.The novel is not used by Dickens for any pressing social issues, although one might argue that it shows how Pip's ambition blinds him to his true friends. But mostly it is pure entertainment. The book is a classic but has a choppy feel that one can attribute to the way it was written. It was written as a series of dramatic stories for popular serialization which were then combined to make a single novel. I enjoyed the read and would highly recommend the book.Having read 10 of Dickens's novels I still rate David Copperfield as best, and ahead of the present book, both as a work of literature and for entertainment value. In many ways the two novels are similar, but the plot is far more interesting and realistic in David Copperfield, and Dickens has many more interesting characters in that book, and as a bonus it is almost twice as long."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I was quite disappointed reading this book after having read David Copperfield. Although both books bear some resemblances, the plot in Great Expectations is much more condensed and simpler. The story is again the orphan-boy-who-gets-away-from-home-in-search-of-a-happier-life. The plot, however, is much less intricated than it is in David Copperfied. There are fewer characters (and fewer pages!) in this book. That caused me an impression that the story is not as feasible as it is in David Copperfield. Some things seem to be rather unreal or fantastical. There are some qualities, however, that remain the same as they are in David Copperfield. The narrative, the characters descriptions and their surprising behaviour keep the reader up to the last page. So this is my advice: if you are one of those who tried to read David Copperfield but gave up because thought it was too boring or long, Great Expectations is an excellent book for you. And maybe, after you have finished it, you'll be willing to read a much better one: David Copperfield."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"i have read the book twice once last year for my teachers book report and this year for the 9th grade merit english classes.

I admit it. The book starts out slow. Dickens, though I love the man, writes in such flowery and long winded language at times. What takes many authors a line or two, Dickens will devote whole pages.And I almost put the book down for that exact reason. I'm very happy I did not.With so many detailed threads in the story, the depth to the characters--when they all start to blend together a few chapters in, the result is page-turning.The story centers around a young boy--well, almost young man-- named Pip, and revolves around his growing into age. You cannot help but love the boy. Much of Pip's worry and concern I could relate to--falling in love with a girl who refuses to return your sentiments and only plays with your heart, growing up and leaving home for the first time, and discovering your true relationships with others and yourself, as shocking as they may turn out to be.I felt as if I was side by side with Pip through it all, and that made the novel a wonderful experience for me. I recommend the novel for the young because so much relates to them, and also for the older readers--because you can experience it all again.A wonderful and heart warming tale. Just get through those first chapters."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"From the many rave reviews of this book, I was expecting to read a literary masterpiece.Howver,my expectations were negated, just like Pip's.

He's a master of all the things that make for great writing and storytelling. Dickens has an ear for dialogue most authors would kill their own mothers to possess. He also is a master of creating vivid scenery, another sign of excellence essential to great writing and one which many authors lack. Finally, but not least in importance, Dickens knows character development. He REALLY knows how to develop intriguing characters, to the point where many of his books spawned figures that have become literary archetypes. Not bad for a guy who grew up in extremely adverse circumstances. He even spent some time in a factory sticking labels on bottles after his father's imprisonment for debt. Most people wouldn't recover from such poverty, but Dickens did. He went on to a successful career in journalism before settling down as an author of serial novels. This format, which allowed Dickens to write and release his stories piecemeal, made him a great success with the public. The anticipation for the latest chapter or two of his stories often led to near riots. Not many writers can elicit such a response today.Many consider \\"Great Expectations\\" a seminal work by a master. Millions have read it, most unwillingly, but most consider it one of Dickens's most accessible stories. It's a tale about a youngster named Phillip Pirrip, known throughout the story as Pip, and his rise from relative obscurity to the heights of wealth and privilege. As the story opens, we see Pip lamenting the passing of his parents in the local cemetery. Their deaths resulted in Pip living with an older sister and her blacksmith husband Joe. Life is tough in Pip's village. His sister wields a heavy hand against her younger brother, relatives like Uncle Pumblechook berate him, and they live in a place where convicts often escape from barges floating on the river nearby. In fact, Pip has a frightening encounter with one of these prisoners at the beginning of the book. His actions, undertaken at the command of this felon, result in a series of incidents that lead Pip to the home of the local recluse, a dour old woman by the name of Havisham. This woman, as rich as a lord but as unhappy as one could ever be, takes a liking to Pip and keeps him around for entertainment.It is during his tenure as Havisham's court jester that Pip comes into contact with several important figures that feature prominently in the story's later episodes. He meets the cold yet beautiful Estella, Havisham's adopted daughter, and falls in love with her. He also makes an initial contact with the old lady's lawyer, the highly successful Mr. Jaggers, and an odd young man named Herbert. All play an integral part in what is to follow, namely the announcement (through Jaggers) that Pip has suddenly come into fortune, or great expectations, that require him to move to London in order to train as a gentlemen. In London Pip spends time with Jaggers, his assistant Wemmick, Herbert, and even Estella. He spends his money, helps his best friend in covert ways, and wonders who in the world set him up with this money and property. Jaggers makes it clear that he isn't supposed to dig too deep concerning the origins of the fortune. Instead, he is to wait until the day when the individual responsible steps forward. When that happens Pip's world as he knows it nearly collapses. He must move heaven and earth to avert disaster while at the same time coming to terms with who he is and what his future holds.\\"Great Expectations\\" is, in a word, great. It contains all of the hallmarks one associates with Dickens. The characters, everyone from Wemmick to Jaggers to Havisham to Joe, sparkle brightly as fully formed individuals living and laboring under very real problems. Atmosphere is divine: Pip's village and London come to life under the writer's pen. Even the author's penchant for examining social ills moves to the fore in a chapter that looks at the horrific conditions in London's main prison. Another real plus is the humor. If you haven't read Dickens, you don't know what your missing in the humor department. This author has an amazing sense of what is funny, and it is nowhere more apparent than in the scene in which Pip and Herbert take in a play starring one of our hero's relatives. This short chapter along with the ones describing Wemmick's abode are absolute masterpieces of hilarity, and they're actually bright spots in what is otherwise an occasionally dark piece of writing. And last, but not least, there is the downbeat conclusion. There are actually two conclusions to \\"Great Expectations\\". Make sure you pick up a copy that has both of them.About the only thing \\"Great Expectations\\" lacks is length; it's one of Dickens's shortest novels, which is probably the reason millions of teachers assign this book to their students. That's unfortunate because most kids want nothing to do with this book once it's forced upon them when in fact they could actually benefit from reading it. Why? Because \\"Great Expectations\\" teaches us a lot about love and identity, two things that matter quite a bit (or should matter) to young people. The teachers ought to assign something like \\"Hard Times\\" and let those who want more seek out \\"Great Expectations\\". The prevailing opinion on this book is that it is semi-autobiographical. It doesn't really matter whether the story is about the author's life or not. What is important, I think, is that this story attains a perfection that few books ever reach. That's why it's a classic, I guess. If you haven't read Dickens before, you should start right here."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Great Expectations, 1860-'61, Dickens's second to last completed novel is the first tome I have ever read and is one of the best books I've ever read.The story centers upon Pip who is orphaned and lives with his mean sister and her kind husband Joe. The book's classic opening is when Pip meets an escaped convict and he forces Pip to give him food and then later is caught. Little did Pip know that this occasion will live on and he will be reminded of it in a very unexpected fashion later in the bookYoung Pip is then sent to Satis House to meet the very mysterious and eccentric Miss Havisham who, jilted at the altar spends the rest of her cursed recluse life in her rotting, yellow wedding dress in Satis House. Pip also meets Estella, a beautiful, yet very cold and proud girl brought up by Miss Havisham to hate men as revenge for her fiance's betrayal.Great Expectations is the story of Pip's life and of all the surprises (there's a lot of 'em folks) hopes: some lived some smashed, and of course, Dickensesque eccentrics who populate the book.Great Expectations is the first tome I have ever finished and I must say that it was worth it. Since I didn't have the book for a while, it took me about three months to read it but have no fear, for this is a pretty quick read with many twists and turns along the way.This book is often considered Dickens's masterpiece. Well, I don't really know about that but it has to be close to that. It certainly was a great read and I think you will agree."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I've taught this book in 9th grade for years because it is a curriculum requirement. During that time, I have raved about the incredible abilities of Dickens to create memorable characters, plot fascinating fiction, make the lives of ordinary people in England memorable, write incredibly descriptive passages . . . .The time has come to tell the truth. While it may be a great *work of literature*, Great Expectations is a tough book to like.There is much to appreciate - in the intellectual sense of the word - about GE, from carefully drawn characters to an infinitely detailed plot. Without exception, students love to play *connect the characters* as the novel progresses. They discuss the unrequited love between Pip and Estella, Biddy and Pip - they love the relationship between Joe and Pip. They are fascinated and repulsed by Miss Havisham and her house. They are shocked by Magwitch, and enthralled by his sacrifice. Truly, this has all the makings of a 9th grade *hit*! So what's the problem? Language,length, and format.The language is off-putting. So much is colloquial to the time and difficult to bring current. Joe's dialect (along with the convict's) is VERY difficult for my deep south students to imitate when reading aloud, and sometimes even difficult for them to decipher at all. Sentences can go on (and on and on and on and on) so that the end hardly seems connected to the beginning. While common when Dickens was writing, these patterns are a bit difficult for a modern audience.Length and format are a problem that go together. Originally published as a serial, this novel was presented a chapter or two at a time, with a wait between installments. That allowed a reader to digest the events in a chapter, contemplate the relationships, discuss them with friends and build up anticipation for the next installment. By virtue of that style, many side-stories are included that have little bearing on the overall plot. Likewise, there is much detail included that seems almost irrelevant when one is reading the novel in full. Those are the very things that fostered interest in the serial, and yet in a novel, they seem extraneous and confusing. At the end, the novel seems (just a bit) overwritten (and perhaps that is because it wasn't originally a novel).In summary, my feelings about this novel are mixed. The story itself is fascinating, but I find myself eternally dreading that time of year when I will yet again introduce it to another crop of unsuspecting students . . ."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"In this delightful edited version of Dickens immortal tale, Hugh Laurie reads. Now you may or may not know Mr. Laurie spent years in London as a kind of character actor. Today he;s playing House on TV. But, he reads GE as each of the characters. As he is so talented each voice is hardly like the other. Some may remember him from Black Adder and the silly prince. But here you see just how versatile he is.As for the story...Dickens' twists are remarkable. GE may have the funnest of the who did what whens.

DonovanCalifornia Bookwatch"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I was just 10 years old, when I first read an abridged version of this Dickens Classic. I must have read it many times since, and everytime I read it, I am filled with array of emotions, and a deep respect for the author. Pip, the hero, is a character that embodies hopes, disappointments and dreams of every boy. As he narrates his life, we grow with him, see many people come in and go out of his life, and we feel with him his emotions and predicaments. Life is full of surprises, unexpected twists and turns, and this novel is a great chronicle of the possibilities of fate. But most importantly, this is a story of pining... and a novel worth pining for.Miss Havisham, the old lady, epitomizes eccentricity, while Estella in her cold abandon represents every heartbreaker. This story is about pining, about love, about friendship (especially Pip and Joe, and later Pip and Herbert), about relationships, and most importantly about what one feels and lives by. Like all Dickens novels, this is a very well written story, and is much more engrossing than any of its on screen versions. This is a story that must be read at leisure and it must be failing of the reader to try and compare it with some cheap paperback that one can scram through while watching a movie and munching chips and cola. Classics deserve respect, attention and concentration: dedicate yourself to one, and trust me you will discover a lot more. A lot more about the novel and a lot more about your own self.We all have Great Expectations, and this one by Dickens beats them all!!"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Written as a serial publication, Great Expectations is very fast paced and the character development is superb.

Having served in the house of Miss Havisham, a woman jilted on her wedding day and filled with hate and revenge for the male species, Pip receives notice of &quot;great expecations&quot; - the term for the potential inheritance of a large fortune. From his humble origins as the son of a blacksmith, he is destined to become a gentleman. But the identity of his mysterious benefactor continues to haunt him.

After all, we're talking about blacksmiths, pirates, and so on. Hardly things the average teenager of the 2000s can relate to.But if you're in your twenties, thirties, or forties, this book is as compelling a novel as you'll ever read. It's an opportunity to look back at Pip and ourselves, the great expectations we all have, and the major surprises, disappointments, and regrets of life.The adult reader can understand the vindictiveness of Miss Havisham, the pride of Magwitch, the true and rare friendship of Herbert Pocket, and, of course, Estella. Each man has in his life an Estella.Beyond the true-to-life tale of hope and defeat, is the wry humor throughout the book that a more mature reader can appreciate.Surprise yourself.

If you're getting started on Dickens, I would totally recommend \\"Great Expectations.\\" Dickens considered it a short novel (probably true for him, considering the length of some of his other books like \\"David Copperfield\\") but there is so much depth in \\"Great Expectations\\", so many layers to it that it doesn't fall short in content.

This book is outside of the genre I usually read and I am greatful for having taken that leap into the unknown. The satisfaction came from a story that was not only told well but one that ended well. There, in my humble opinion, is nothing worse than experiencing a story only to find that the ending is not truely a completion. Each character and plot line is seen through to its end! The enrichment came from an insightful journey through the trials and tribulations as well as the successes and failures of these well developed characters. This adventure turns from a tale of successes and achievents to one of self realization and personal fulfillment through Mr. Dickens' skilled hand.Nothing is perfect. The story starts slowly. The reader must stick with the book to understand the fact that the beginning of the story was not simply necessary, but a foundation that supports and grows the story like no other introduction could. Some of the descriptions of places or things I found to be exporbitant. This leads to great character development but also to some tiresome chapters. As with any work of literature written durring the time period this book was written, the language is trivially dated or old.I would, and do recommend this book to my friends as one that will not simply pass the time but provide enjoyment!"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I read this book when I was a kid and I still remember Pip and Estella.

It is simply a good story well-told. I was surprised to read so much to get so little, in the sense of reading many pages to find out so few or minor details. I continued to read as much and as often as I could to get through this book. It is a great story even if I think it could have been written in half the pages.It is classic for a reason, do yourself a favor and read it if you had not.

I was surprised by how involved I became with the characters and the book when I was reading it. I couldn't put it down. I thought a book by Charles Dickens was going to be dry and boring. How wrong I was. I actually found myself grieving with the characters. I would be happy with them and angry with them when they did something that was, in my opinion, wrong or ill-advised At one point I actually found myself having a down day but couldn't put my finger on it until I realized I was at a point in the book where Pip was depressed.

This may not appeal to people who do not like 'old-fashioned writing', and yes, this book is different than many of the 'easy' novels you will find today, it is still a solid and die-hard classic with a cast of good characters and a story with enough twists and turns to keep it good.

Unfortunately I only hold this view of the book containing the original ending, which was not the originally published ending. (spoiler) The original ending at first seems sad and frustrating, but one can't help but to feel satisfied in knowing that through suffering Estella had gained a heart, which is much more than she would have gained through a cold and heartless relationship with Pip. The happy ending which was published is almost a fairtale ending and it perverts the themes which make the novel so relevant to reality. I must admit, like Dickens' friends and publisher, the original ending was hard for me to swallow, but as I dwelt on it and how it related to the novel, no other ending seemed appropriate, especially not a happy one."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Well, i have read all of the previous reviews, and it is apparant that people either love this book or hate this book. I was 15 when i first read this book, and have since read it again and it is probably my favorite book of all time. Yes, it is rather boring at times, and yes, it has a long, involved, and confusing plot, and yes, Charles Dickens gives very tedious descriptions of everything. But the morals and meanings portrayed in this book far outshine the faults. If you cannot find them, then it will most likely be boring and dull. If you can, it will probably become one of your alltime favorites."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"There are two main sorts of novel - those that end quite happily and satisfactorily, with everything essentially \\"working out\\" for the better and most great problems resolved. The second kind is quite the opposite, an about-face, and of course \\"Great Expectations\\" would fall into the latter category. It's only main tender-bellied spot for me to prod with critique would be the fairly obvious plot unfolding, even to someone unfamiliar with the story as I was.As so often happens with \\"classics\\", in the end the main characters end up being one another's long lost aunts or cousins, fathers, daughters, stepmothers, caretakers, lovers, or perhaps the cause of misery to one or many, of course all unbeknownst and hidden until you happen to stumble in on their story. That's not really giving anything away, for those that are worried. And it is not to say that Dickens was unoriginal with this one, because it's a fantastic read, but that he's had better - even in the form of \\"Oliver Twist\\".Those that like the happy ending shouldn't really be too interested. Those who like ..., intrigue - um, stay away too. The heart of this pup is dialogue and the torture of internal thoughts and personal dissatisfaction. The protagonist is poor, so desperately wants to be a gent and have \\"expectations\\", ... The guy doesn't get the girl. No real living happily ever after. But I don't see why that's necessary."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Great Expectations\\" by Charles Dickins is a really good book. I personally do not like to read but i truely enjoyed this book. Although the beginning is very slow and Dickins takes forever to get to the point many times, i found myself unable to put the book down at times. Great Expectations is a good book about loyalty, trust and fate. It also teaches you to remember your true friends and do not let wealth go to your head. The story is centered around an orphan boy named \\"Pip\\". Miss Havisham is the woman who looks after and takes care of Pip. One day Pip is at the gravesite of his parents and the convict, Magwitch, asks him to help him out. Pip does help the convict out not knowing what Magwitch will do for him in the future.One day at Miss Havisham's house Pip meets Estella. He falls in love with her but she does not return the feelings. In fact she is cruel and plays with Pip's emotions. Despite the way he is treated by Estella, Pip never gives up on on trying to win her over.Later on, Pip is told that he has come into a great fortune from an anynomous benefactor. After he comes into all of this money he goes to London, England to study and become a gentleman. While he is in England he becomes somewhat \\"stuck up\\". He treats his old friends like they are not as important as his new friends.While in England he finds out that Estella has married a man who he cannot stand. He also meets up with the convict, Magwitch. Magwitch tells Pip how he is Estella's father and how he is the secret benefactor to his new found wealth. In gratitude, Pip tries to help Magwitch escape from England, but while escaping the police catch them and arrest Magwitch and put him to death, while Pip's money is taken away from him.Pip goes back to Miss havisham's house and becomes friends with his old friends again. He also meets up with Estella there and after awhile the two marry.This book is well written in the way that everyone can relate to the subjects in some way.I really enjoyed reading this piece."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I still wonder why this book is a perennial reading requirement in junior high schools across the country. I had to read it way back when, and it almost turned me off from books in general. This is not to say it's a bad book, because, on the contrary, it's great, but don't have great expectations of an exciting contemporary read. To enjoy this book and appreciate the beauty of fully-fleshed characters, come-alive scenes, and intricately woven plot, you absolutely must keep in mind that this book was written in a different time, before the Hemingway revolution of sparse prose. As you read it, expect long verbose passages and miles between exciting scenes. But stick it out, and in the end expect a great read that stays with you a lifetime.

It is a well done Dickens-style (obviously) story of a young boy raised in a poor environment by his sister--his only living relative--and her husband, a blacksmith named Joe. After visiting a very rich and eccentric woman by the name of Miss Havisham, the young boy named Pip is approached by a lawyer and is told he has &quot;great expectations.&quot; And that he is to move to London to be bread as a gentleman, when after a certain period he is to inherit a large sum of money. The story goes on to London where he is brought up, and leads to some very interesting twists. The tale is well told, and enjoyable if you are fond of Dickens (while I appriciate Dickens.. I admittedly do not like &quot;A Christmas Carol,&quot; so keep in mind that if that is the only Dickens you have been exposed to, give him a try through one of his major novels.) The character of Pip is a very sympathetic one, and his faults are all to scarily human. This novel covers great, surprise, assumption, and other noteworthy themes. A good classic read."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I liked this book because it kept me wondering what was going to happen.

The book never had me. I don't think it ever actually tried to have me. It's premise centers around a boy named Pip and his life in 19th century England. It's only too bad that Dickens spends far too much time showcasing his prolific skills of writing in the English language and less time on any sort of a solid base for this specific novel. The reader feels absolutely no connection to any of the characters, most notably Pip or Joe. The one bright part of the book is Miss Havisham, who Dickens spends enough time with for us to empathize with her for her lonely life.The biggest problem of course, is it's lack of commitment to any sort of theme. A great novel, as many would claim this is, must possess the language and have something to say. It seems, especially at the beginning, that Dickens is taking his stand against early Industrial Revolution labor practices. However, the book never really delves into that in any way shape or form. When Dickens chooses to describe Joe's house or some other hovel, he persists to use the same kind of language as when he describes, for instance, Miss Havisham's or Wemmick's house. This book, on the whole, is as dry as Spanish sherry and is simply not meant for anyone who wishes to extrapolate anything of meaning from the books they read."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I must admit that beyond my initial attraction to the novel's title I made several attempts over a period of years to settle into the story but could not get past the first several pages. There are many things to throw off potential readers to aged classics like this one, not the least of which is Dickens' choice of character names such as Pumblechook, Wopsle and Magwitch, which I at first found absurd and annoying. However on a recent attempt I made it as far as chapter 10 (of 59 total) when it dawned on me suddenly and unexpectedly that I was hooked and that there was no turning back.The unabridged version is not something one can breeze through in an afternoon, especially considering that it requires the development of a certain skill to absorb Dickens' narrative style, much as it is with the often difficult prose of Henry James. Some parts read very fast while others are tortuously overwritten creating a virtual standstill as the eyes glaze over and one starts to look for good reasons not to throw the book against the wall and pull out tufts of hair from one's head in frustration - a good editor would do this book no injustice but I am not going to recommend the abridged version because most parts are not to be played with. But as is the case in life, our accomplishments must be earned, and so I will make this promise to those contemplating reading this work: make the effort, put forth the time to read this novel, which is not a short one, and before long it will grow on you and you will come to treasure your time spent with it, and even savour its pages as the story unfolds and comes to an end.It would be so much easier for the many students who are assigned this book to take the low road and read only a study guide and then rent one of the movies of it and then definitely not ace the class, but the intelligent ones could pull off a pass; but they would be cheating themselves of something that one cannot put a price on- a well told story with vibrant characters who share in our capacities to be hurt, to feel joy, to be knocked down and to live life, for what are stories if they are not reflections of ourselves, our desires, our fears, our untold secrets, our ability to connect to other souls and grow or be cut off and wither.Let me tell it to you straight. Dickens is a master storyteller. He has created a legacy that has been surpassed by only a few and is a standalone in terms of sheer narrative prowess. Modern writers, especially screenwriters (like myself, eventually) would do themselves no harm if they took Dickens' work to heart and used it as a model for their own for here there are no pyrotechnics, no stretching of rehashed plot ideas into the thinness of an overblown balloon, no exaggerated or contrived formulae, granted there is no small measure of coincidence in his stories, but here there are real characters with beating hearts and flesh, fully capable of a misstep and fall, part of a story that is relevant and timeless and enriching, even necessary to the human spirit if we are to grow and thrive and not kill one another with the evil and savagery that we are all capable of.As Nicole Kidman said during her Oscar acceptance a few years back: \\"art is important,\\" and for Dickens' contribution I am grateful and would be doing a disservice if I did not write this ditty for those that may listen. To Kidman's remark I would like to add that without art, life would no longer be tolerable and not worth living. It even convinces one to stick around for a little while longer. Those who do not feast on classics like \\"Great Expectations\\" are paying a very heavy price, one that not even Mr. Gates can well afford."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I spent a whole term going over this book in freshmen English class. It is an overall good book, full of interpritations. There are many symbolisms and allusions. However, it is important to remember that this book was originally a serialization, as it came out every week in the paper. There are some parts when Dickens drawls on with his plans, events, ect. However, there are scenes that are very fast paced and action filled. The overall plot is a young, naive boy of about ten lives with his sister and her simple husband named Joe. However, Pip is given a secret benefactor and is thrust in the life of nobility. Pip is tangled in his probelems of leaving Joe behind and his encouters with the shallow (and I mean SHALLOW) Estella and the wicked Miss Havisham. Dickens is a master with characters and the languege, but he doesn't describe any everyday events. For example, Pip goes to study law, but thats all we know. In my opinion, it gives the characters this higher than life importance, and less real. But, if you take this book slowely, maybe a chapter a night (instead of the five I had to do), you will definately enjoy this book."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"&quot;Great Expectations&quot; seems to be a term used to describe a young man with expectations of becoming a Gentleman. This is the story about a young boy named Pip who though considered poor, was raised as an apprentice in a respectable trade. When his parents died when he was very young he was brought up by his older sister and her husband Joe Gargery the blacksmith. Joe although a little slow, acts in many ways as a loving father and friend to the boy, and is more noble than any of the other characters in the whole book. His older sister however isn't as nice, and in the modern day world probably would have been brought up on charges of child abuse. (If this book was ever remade into a modern day movie I couldn't think of anyone else I'd rather see playing Pip's older sister than Kathy Bates. I pictured her every time the character is mentioned.)Pip then comes into some money by a mysterious benefactor, and becomes an ungrateful little boy who looks down upon those he used to associate with and puts on airs. At this point, in my opinion Pip becomes a very unlikable character for most of the remainder of the book. He believes Miss Havisham who is a mysterious mean old wealthy lady is his benefactor and falls in love with her adopted daughter Estella. I believe this makes Pip look very shallow, since the only redeeming quality she seems to possess is her looks.Pip moves to London and is entrusted to a lawyer named Jenkins and his assistant Wemmick to teach him how to become a gentleman. The lawyer Jenkins, while unloving, is likeable, and in his own way noble. Wemmick who leads a double life is one of the best characters in the book. (I believe there are many people who would like to keep their work life separate from the home life, and can relate to this character.)Jenkins hires a tutor for Pip to teach him how to act like a gentleman. It seems that all the gentleman in this story do however is spend money. Pip and the tutor's son Herbert who becomes Pip's best friend then proceed to work themselves into debt.A pirate which Pip met in his childhood comes back into this life, and brings many changes. (The pirate Pip meets reminded me of the sea captain from &quot;Treasure Island&quot;, or the main character in the &quot;Count of Monte Cristo&quot;.)In the end Pip tries to redeem himself, and in some ways does.There are some plot twists and mysteries to solve. Some work out well and are pleasant surprises, others just seem unnecessary to the story."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"GE is one of the better books that I read in my illustrious high school education. The book threw me a little because of all the words Dickens used to describe every character right down to the tiniest little thing. Pip and Joe is a good pair of characters to have in this book, because they are so different and so alike at the same time. They both like to work with metals and Joe is a blacksmith and pip is his apprentice. They are different in the way that they act. Joe takes the brutal ness of pips sister, and pip does not. When pip starts to work for Ms. Havisham it shows his torture that he has to take from Ms. Havisham in the way of verbal bashings. Thought Ms. Havisham does not beat him unlike his sister does, she is a very cruel and malignant women. Then one-day pip meets Estella, she seems like a nice girl but in fact she is a very cruel women just like her grandma. This is the beginning of pips crush and then turns into a passion. Dickens then goes into the part of the story where pip finds out why she wants Estella to hate men. He finds out that she was left at the alter by her ex. This set a fire in her and that is why she hates men. Then pip returns home one day from work at Ms. Havisham's house and he finds a lawyer there with Joe and some one gave him enough money to get a good education and a home. So he takes the money and pip goes to school in England and the story pretty much lost its importance after that, but pip does find out that the person who gave him the money was from the Escaped convict, he owned his own farm in Australia and he was rich from that. These are just some of things that happened in the book, to find out some of the finer details I urge to you read the book for yourself. It will give u a better insight into dickens writing also."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Great Expectations was the greatest book that I've ever read.

A great deal of scandal goes on, and if I tell you anymore than you'll know what happens, but I will tell you this.

For any one who has read everything by Dickens, I'd suggest &quot;Titus Groan&quot; and its follow up &quot;Gormenghast&quot; by Mervyn Peake. They are fantasy novels but are extremely Dickinsian (though original enough to keep from being derisive) and in my opinion equal to any thing Dickins wrote and in better prose."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Sorry for the nasty mean review.

But anyway, if thats the way they feel then I guess thats just the way they feel and nobody should write such nasty reviews or get mad for such a petty, stupid reason anyway. So, anyway, this is one of Dickens best, as I've said before."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Of all English writers,Charles Dickens is the champion of the genre of \\"Bildungsroman\\",a department of fiction writing pertaining to growth and development of the protagonist. Dickens's writings are darkly underlined by an all-dimensionsal illustration of aperson's character and by an uncanny portrayal of childhood. \\"Nicholas Nickleby\\",\\"David Copperfield\\" and \\"Great Expectations\\" have gone into the literary folklore as novels containing some of the finest amd most vivid passages ever composed on children's psyche and indignified lives. Perhaps the author's this ability to paint children's woe stems froms his own abusive and disruptive boyhood and perhaps in several of his fancy's infants,Dickens was actually trying to reflect his very own horrible childhood. \\"David Copperfield\\" is undoubtably his most personal and in certain fractions autobiographical novel but in \\"Great Expectations\\",employing a compatible first person narrative method,Charles Dickens conjures up a very much real life character who,like David Copperfield,narrates the story of his life as he progresses through his childhood,errors of judgements and unseeming expectations to a tragi-joyous adulthood;as he stives on in life with a plethora of illusions;as he realises the moments of truth one by one.\\"Great Expectations\\" is young Pip's story,a trajectory of his yearning to excel and drift away from the \\"oncommon\\",a desire to be loved and respected in society, a not-so-uncommon craving to grow up and establish himself. For an orphan living in the country marshes in England and brought up \\"by hand\\" by his sister Mrs. Joe Gargery,Pip's on;y genuine friend in his early boyhood was Jor Gargery,the blacksmith---also supposed by the central character to have been made to \\"marry her by hand\\". But a sudden and apparently misfortunate meeting with a fugitive from the nearby Hulks---and the consequent burden of guilt his troubled conscience has to bear---a visit to the queer Miss Havisham's and an unexpected deliverance of all his miseries all consire to Pip's rise in life. The mysterious London lawyer and master defender of criminals Mr. Jaggers arrives one day to inform Pip that if he would,then he is entitled to excercise a proposition of going to London and studying and doing all he can to rise up in life and be an established gentleman with no cost from his side---a mere boyish fancy of Pip till that moment. so marches on our gentle little gentry class boy to the city on te back of the notion that it was Miss Havisham who was actually his benefactoress and who had destined him and her adopted daughter,the cruel,unforgiving and heartless Estella,to be together. And thus begin young and inexperienced Pip's trysts with harsh realities of life.In a novel that essentially figures around human expectations and failures through the tame medium of words,Pip's story is massively apt for the enlightenment of this theme. Pip is found to be a real-life character leafed out of life's own text book and not an imaginary effigy of fairy-tale gratifications,which David in \\"David Copperfield\\" in some stretch is. He's an ordinary person with extraordinary aspirations but as he moves on in life,he learns about himself and this personal growth is exquisitely and relistically portrayed by Charles Dickens. Indeed it's in a great city like London where truth dawns upon Pip,truth that demolishes all ethereals about life,about riches,about Miss Havisham and EStella,and most important truth of them all,the truth about himself. Pip runs into debt,makes several mistakes,is broken down and broken apart by an illusory love and endures fits of remorse,which punctuate his entire existence arising out of a marked ingratitude towards Joe and Biddy,his friend from his old school. His only means of moral salvation from this quicksand of sin is te hearty relationship with Herbert Pockets,his best friend and companion in all his catastrophes. Actually in Herbert and his father,also the tutor of Pip,Charles Dickens creates two characters dissolved in innocence and ignorance with no big aims for money. When all of Miss Havisham's near and distant relatives are coaxing her to milk her fortune,the Pockets are the sole remaining figures to brush aside such ideas. This is one of Dickens's numerous tricks as a writer to subtlely show that goodness can still be glimpsed in an otherwise sadly denudating world.Charles Dickens is believed to have gone through his work \\"David Copperfield\\" thoroughly before writing \\"Great Expectations\\" but even so on certain occasions,the reader does decipher resemblance between these two high acclaimed novels. The shape of Pip's path i life doesn't bear that great degree of difference with these two popular fictional characters are often found to merge. Miss Havisham is reminiscent of Betsy Trotwood's resentment towards the male society,only more elongated and elaborate;in Pip's detest of Drummle and his love for Estella,the reader catches a fair glimpse od David's own contempt towards Uriah heep's lust for Agnes;Mr.Pockets and his family's fiascos and innocence bear a certain kinship with those of Mr. Micawber's;and Pip's deep friendship with Herbert reminds the reader of David's relationship with Traddles. These similarities could blot Dickens's claim to unprecedented imagination power or may strangely prove that life of one is often intertwined with aanother's. The first person narrative technique used to describe Pip's story in this book too isn't without some strong criticisms. The opinions and witty contemplations formed by Pip of people both is his marsh country as well as in London from an early stage in his life render the reader musing as to how his innocent and delicately humorous conjectures could suddenly be transformed into something satirical and concrete. Are his views constructed on the spur of the moment or are they being built now as Pip stares down the years and pens down his history? If the latter be more inclined towards the truth,then it definitely distorts Pip's authenticity as a writer and his memoir is left somewhat ineffective with misleading overlapping of the past and te present.Certain detractions are not so difficult to eke out from \\"Great Expectations\\" really but flaws are a regular parameter of any work of literature. The genius of Charles Dickens is never in doubt in this book as the reader discerns the author's accustomed mingling of humour and dark pictures in a book that promises life as it is. Dickens's obsession with wit and humour is revealed in the features of Mr. Pumblechook and Mr. Wopsle and in incidents such as the latter playing Hamlet on the stage. That when perceived from te swift flow of narration perfectly complimented by the dialogues and conversations and punctuated by moods of reflections makes the book instantly appealing. The caricature of the marsh country is another point of revelation of the author's informed and classy state. The world of Dickens is one of individual identities and aspirations,where all characters find their own proper places. And this world isn't a big one but a narrowed and trimmed realm of compulsive non-overlapping characters all fuctioning significantly in the due course of Pip's realisation of the world and its intricacies.The most beguiling factor in providing Pip's tale a touch of realism and in turn making the novel more touching and endearing is the evident defects in his character. He feels remorseful at his ingratitude towards his poor and \\"common\\" family;he is exasperated at the return of his \\"old convict\\" years later and in his refusal to address him not as Magwitch,his real name,but as Provis,his assumed name,he subconsciously admits denial of his own humble past. Pip isn't mature enough to handle his own humble past. Pip isn't mature enough to handle his own present either,and time and again has to rush to Herbert and wemmick,Mr. Jaggers's assistant,for solace and help. As illusions fade one by one and emotions of al sorts jumble up together in Pip's life,he's found to portray at least fractions of our own lives. \\"Great Expectations\\" is vastly a cofession of a dilapidated soul whose expectations in life are not without unforseen twists and turns. This is an immensely moving tale of a young man's ineptitude and discontentment told in restrained sentimentality,empathic ruminations and glittering descriptions. This classic is a gem for any literature lover,where Charles Dickens;s authority as a writer is amazingly deft."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Dudes. You gotta read this book.

Periodically, I try to stretch myself by taking on works that I might not otherwise gravitate toward. Sometimes I am rewarded; that is how I discovered Hemingway and Vasily Grossman (much to my delight). However, I generally read for pleasure and will never be considered an erudite literary critic; in other words, you won't find me reading Shakespeare.I recall reading A Tale of Two Cities in high school and to my recollection, enjoying it. With that in mind, I was determined to give Charles Dickens another shot, with the knowledge that if it were to my liking, there would be a wealth of material at my disposal. That is how I came to read Great Expectations.The novel centers on young Pip, an orphan taken in by his domineering older sister and kind, blacksmith husband. Pip is destined for a life as an apprentice blacksmith, a member of the English lower class, until an encounter with an escaped convict radically changes the course of his life. For you see, young Pip harbors \\"great expectations\\" and a life far beyond that set before him. With the help of an anonymous \\"sponsor\\", Pip begins his journey toward life as a gentleman.When reading Dickens, Tolstoy, and even more so Shakespeare, the first hurdle is becoming familiar with the language, the style of writing and the idioms and terms used by writers of the era; even more so with Dickens, where he routinely spells words phonetically when spoken by Cockney British commoners. Somewhat offputting at first, the reader soon becomes comfortable with the style and is amply rewarded and entertained.Having read numerous novels from the period, I was well familiar with the British class system on the mid-19th century, but nowhere is its rigidity more apparent than in this work. Within days of attaining a sponsor, young Pip completely removes himself from his former friends and relatives (both geographically and socially), even expressing embarrassment for having been associated with them. There are several story threads that work themselves together nicely near the end of the novel.Having become reacquainted with Dickens, I fully expect to sample more of his work."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"First of all (as I like to say!)

Hating &quot;Great Expectations&quot; is kind of like hating Beethoven, Shakespeare, or Monet: O.K., it's not your taste, but it's really a waste of time to say &quot;IT SUCKED.&quot;Dickens's novel is one of the all-time champs. Unforgettable characters, beautiful writing, and a depth of understanding of human nature rarely equaled in English or American fiction. As they say in theory class, it works on many different levels. If you hated &quot;G.E.,&quot; well, then, you probably wandered into the Literature aisle by mistake. You probably also don't like &quot;Wuthering Heights,&quot; &quot;Jane Eyre,&quot; &quot;David Copperfield,&quot; or anything by Hardy or Austen, if you've bothered.Otherwise, if you love literature and haven't read &quot;Great Expectations,&quot; consider your education incomplete."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"This has to be my favourite Dickens novel. In fact, I would go so far as to place it alongside Flaubert's &quot;Sentimental Education&quot; and Dostoevsky's &quot;Brothers Karamazov&quot; as one of the great novels of the 19th century. I am astonished by the number of one and two star reviews even though they do appear to come mainly from high school students being &quot;forced&quot; to read the novel for English class. Judging by the spelling mistakes and grammatical errors which proliferate these submissions, Dickens is not the only thing that they've had trouble staying awake for. In addition, it is ridiculous to suggest that Dickens's novels were so lengthy because he was &quot;being paid by the word.&quot; His books initially appeared in serial form as books were very expensive in the Victorian era and he understandably wished to avoid precluding large sections of his target readership from being able to sample them. The fact that some current &quot;readers&quot; find this novel &quot;too long and boring&quot; is, I believe, a sad reflection on our media saturated society where a two-second attention span is rapidly becoming the norm."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Why, in God's name, do high school teachers insist on stuffing this complex novel down the throats of their teen-aged students? Because the initial chapters are narrated by, Pip, a little boy we watch become a young man? Because there are pirates and bad guys in it? Because there's a sort of love story? I'm sure some high schoolers understand GREAT EXPECTATIONS but the majority of them... I don't think so.GREAT EXPECTATIONS contains many complicated, adult themes and issues that adults will surely appreciate. A virtual encyclopedia of human emotions--fear, child abuse, anticipation, disappointment, love, jealousy, manipulation--this greatest of all of Dickens' novels has everything. And all these ingredients are woven into an incredibly entangled plot, full of twists and turns. On top of all that, the novel is also a virtual encyclopedia of the layout and attitudes of Victorian London.Holding it all together is Pip's incredible perceptions into his world and his emotions. Never before had there been a character so aware of his feelings and, still, because he is human, he allows these emotions to sometimes compel him to do the opposite of what is right and best. Pip does sometimes behave like the child and young adult he is, but that doesn't mean this novel is suitable for anyone of that age.Rocco Dormarunno, author of The Five Points"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Great expectations is an extremely wonderful book!this book starts talking about a boy named Pip.he is trying to live up to everybod's expectations of him while trying to live his own life.Pip was born an orphan.his older sister adopts himand thats how his sister is admired for bringing him home and raising him. she was married to joe her husband. this story really starts off when Pip meets the convict on the old church graveyard on the hill of the marshes.The convict told Pip to bring a metal file,pork pie and a meat bone. The convict was very thankful. from that day on Pipd id not tell anybody about that day. His sister later on dies and he meets a girl named estella. estella was adopted by miss Havisham. Pip loved her but miss Havisham taught her to hate all men.This book is a wonderfully good book. I would recommend this book for children ages 13-21. It is an arduous book for some readers but it is aninteresting book to read. I love books that Charles Dickens writes. He is an awesome writer.

I decided to try Great Expectations as my first introduction to the great English author, on the recommendation of a friend of mine. And I was not disappointed!That said, I had a bit of a difficult time at first getting used to Dickens's use of language, and I found the first part of the book a little hard to get into, but I didn't have to struggle too much or for too long: after a short while the characters came alive for me and the story became so absorbing, that I could not put the book down. The novel has a fantastic, very tight plot, and the characters are memorable. This always works for me as a reader!Great Expectations was my first Dickens read, but it will certainly not be the last."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"** This review is a synthesis of the three Charles Dickens books that I've read:A Tale of Two Cities (Penguin Classics),Great Expectations (Penguin Classics), andDavid Copperfield (Penguin Classics). The rationale for reviewing in this manner is to provide a foundational point of reference for those new to Dickens' work.In the last two years I have read, in this order, Tale of Two Cities, Great Expectations, and David Copperfield. All three of these books were exceptional reads, and if you are thinking about dipping your toes in the waters of Charles Dickens you can't go wrong with any of them. However, notwithstanding the fact that these three books are all in the upper echelon of world literature, I have no difficulty in distinguishing between them and coming to the conclusion that they are properly ordered, from \\"most best\\" to \\"least best\\": David Copperfield, Tale of Two Cities, Great Expectations.It seems generally to be the case that, for those who have read just one of Dickens' books, Great Expectations is the book most people have been exposed to. And most people who read Great Expectations love it. The genre is probably best described as romance meshed with individual tragedy among numerous characters. However, perhaps the strongest part of the book is the manner in which the secondary characters present a contrast to the primary story. I liked the book very much, but I think it suffers from two flaws not present in the other works reviewed here. First, the characters are not as believable as in the other two works. Second, the plot follows an unlikely path, especially in the end. Concerning this second point, it should be noted that Dickens struggled with the ending of this work, and I think it shows.Tale of Two Cities ranks second in this group in my mind. This book is a combination of political intrigue, romance, and personal triumph. I rank this book above Great Expectations for the sole reason that the characters in this book are so strongly developed. I don't think I have been exposed to more memorable characters in any book I've ever read. The story is interesting, too, because it takes place against the backdrop of a historical event, the French Revolution. I think Dickens had an easier time writing a convincing plot in this story than in Great Expectations because he had the aid of a real historical event.Great Expectations and Tale of Two Cities are both excellent books, but David Copperfield is simply the best piece of literature I've ever read. To be sure, I'm only 24 and have only read 10 pieces of classic literature since my high school years. However, David Copperfield so outdid anything I've read that I feel more than comfortable in recommending it as certainly one of the best books of all time. Dickens did a remarkable job of capturing a wide variety of human emotions and mindsets. He was aided in this by two things. First, the length of the book gave him space to fully develop his sentiments. Second, the book is written in a first-person autobiographical voice, which I think made capturing sentiments much easier than in attempting to narrate them in the third-person. Further, because the book chronicles David's life from childhood through middle-age the reader is exposed to a wide variety of human thoughts. The characters, for the most part, are more believable and the plot is generally good; I took offense to only one chapter in the whole book.Now, if you haven't read any of Dickens' books, I don't recommend starting with David Copperfield. I would start with Great Expectations and work through a couple others before David Copperfield. In terms of the plots, David Copperfield is much more similar to Great Expectations than Tale of Two Cities. So if you loved Great Expectations I think you will be well satisfied with David Copperfield. The plot from Tale of Two Cities is the odd-ball of this trio. In any case, all three of these books are great pieces of literature... enjoy."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Many people scoffed this book back in my freshman English class, because it was Dickens, and Dickens meant \\"boring\\" to them. However, shrug off the normal tendencies to stereotype an old-time classic to be a bore, one can find a true delight in this beautiful story of a young man struggling with an impossible love, the pressures of money and society, and, of course, himself. It is an excellent, absolutely enriching read."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"This is certainly one of my favorite books. It's about a boy named Pip who struggles to find his own identity. While struck with unfortunate circumstances, Pip remains resilient and continues his struggle in becoming a \\"gentleman.\\" Truly a Brittish classic, it has been called the unofficial autobiography of Dickens and it can be easily called one of his best works. The novel is filled with symbolism and characters that come to life as you read the pages. This book still graces my shelves and I look forward to reading it again. I recommend you pick it up and rea it too."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Perhaps the greates novel I have ever read. Not only enjoyable but contained relevan lessons for my life - you can't escape who you or where you come from by changing your circumstance."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Like several of the people on this review page, I had to read this book for a 9th grade English assignment. Unlike most of the people in my class, I read the whole book and liked it. The book is about a young English boy named Phillip \\"Pip\\" Pirrip living in 1800s England. He is the son of a blacksmith and then is invited to play at an old woman's house. The impression Pip gets from the old woman and her daughter is that Pip isn't good enough. From then on, he grows up and tries to get better for his life after getting a fortune, but things go downhill from that as he gets deep in debt and becomes ill. This book is by no means perfect and has plenty of flaws. The book is way too wordy and could probably be half as long as it is and still get a good point across. I also felt that the ending of the book was a little strange, but overall it was an okay book and I was not bored with it at any point."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"...the defect of almost all the movies (except, perhaps, the 1989 version with Jean Simmons as Miss Havisham (!)) is that the movies emphasize Pip's pursuit of Estella to the exclusion of almost all else. In truth, the core of the story is Pip's class strivings and his inability to distinguish the valuable from the shiny and superficial. Read the book and you will appreciate the character Biddy who is the polar opposite of Estella in every way, and the way, to paraphrase Othello, Pip \\"threw a pearl away richer than all he yearned for.\\"Some of Dickens' characters and coincidences are a little stretched, but they nevertheless are woven together very nicely in the fashion of a good suspense novel. Great Expectations is divided into three volumes, each representing a phase of Pip's Expectations. The structure is strangely like \\"The Monkey's Paw\\": The first expectation (wish) is for riches; the second expectation finds the granted wish not exactly what the protagonist thought it would be; and the third and final expectation leaves the protagonist trying to pick up the pieces.As another reviewer commented, do get an edition that includes the original ending. It is only a few paragraphs but it wraps up this morality tale in a way that is appropriate to the entire theme of the story. If you wonder where the \\"new, happier\\" ending was substituted, just look for the place in the very last chapter where Pip suddenly changes direction and makes a lie of what he has just told his family.If you feel that you cannot sit through the novel, then at least get the 1989 film version (though it is out of print--you will have to pay a little more than you might like) and watch it for probably the accurate representations of the various characters, if not some of the stellar performances of the most acclaimed 1946 version. If nothing else, you will see something very rare for any actor or actress--the opportunity to define two characters in the same classic. In 1946, Jean Simmons' Young Estella defined \\"beautiful but cruel\\" for a generation, and in 1989 the same Ms. Simmons revealed the pain but even greater cruelty of Miss Havisham."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"This is another book which is forced upon unsuspecting high school students. With many younger reviewers giving this classic 1 and 2 stars shows that this novel will not be appreciated by most studetns. If you hated this book in high school I recommend picking it up again after college.This novel follows the protagonist Pip, from inncocent boy, to dreaming adolecent, to proud gentelman, and comes full circle to the disullusioned adult. Tha characters he meets along the way are some of the most memorable in english literature, especially Miss Havishham, Estella, and Magwitch. Dickens also treats us, about half-way through, to perhaps the best twist of any novel I've ever read.The only thing I at first disliked about this novel were the bizarre coincidinces which caused seemingly unrelated characters to actually have close histories with each other. But I reconciled this for myself in the following way: A major theme of this novel are the machinations of characters to control other characters. Well we must not forget that there are meta-machiantions above this by Dickens himself, and for that all readers can be thankful."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Charles Dickens' Great Expectations portrays the life of the protagonist, Pip, and how he begins as a mistreated orphan and transforms into a gentleman with a mysterious benefactor. Set in the mid 19th century, Great Expectations is a novel with a surprising plot that keeps its readers guessing. Its' intriguing story line and interesting characters keep the story light-hearted and humerous, but Dickens' dreary descriptions and gloomy details bring also a sense of sadness and compassion to the novel. Aside from the novel being time consuming, indepth, and in great detail, Great Expectations is a classic novel that all should read."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Though someone stated you have to be over 21 to appreciate this book (and I am 21 now) I first read this story when I was 14 years old, in 8th grade, and understood (and loved) it right away. Why? As an adolescent struggling with popularity (the modern, teenage equivalent of the English class system) and unrequited love, I immediately identified with Pip. Furthermore, the romantic atmosphere was completely intoxicating, from the vast marshes to the city of London; though the narrator describes it as disappointingly crowded and dirty my sense of the city from this book was much more elevated. I also admit I was helped by the updated Classics Illustrated comic book version of the book, which I peeked at now and then while I was reading Great Expectations--despite my aversion to revealing the ending before I reached it in the text (eventually, I succumbed to my temptations). If you can find this (probably) out-of-print illustrated version of the story--not sure what the status of Classic Illustrated is these days--make sure to buy it. But to return from my digression, the novel is where it's at. Dickens' impeccable imagination creates an vivid sense of place, an unforgettable cast of characters (including the ultimate romantic ideal: Estella), a rich and textured story, and an immortal message of aspiration, disappointment, and dreams. This story really fired my imagination as a teenager, so I encourage those youngsters who may be dissuaded from reading it to pick it up--I'm not guaranteeing you'll like it but if you read it before you're forced to you just may find something valuable in it. As for the rest of you \\"grown-ups\\" if you haven't read this masterpiece yet, get off yer asses and take a trip to the local library. It'll make your day."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Hi, Great Expectations is probably (besides David Copperfield) my favorite Dickens novel. I read it when I was a child, and having been re reading it ever since. It is told through Pip, the narrator. His voice is clear and realistic.The reader feels for him as if he were a real person. Miss Havishman is a sad character and her disappointment in love is very understandable. Mr. Jaggers the lawyer is sharp as most lawyers ought to be and are. I felt for Magwitch, Pip's benefactor. And I understood Pip's feelings towards him when they meet again after many years, Estella is not my favorite character, but she learns to be a better person. Charles Dickens is, needless to say, a timeless writer, one of the very best. Eugenia RenskoffDifferent Flags"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Charles Dickens, Great ExpectationsDickens tells an intriguing yarn, creates suspense and amuses us with a range of eccentrics, friendly such as Wemmick or Herbert Pocket, or macabre as with Pumblechook or Jaggers. As in David Copperfield, he gives us strong and often threatening women, like Betsy Trotwood, and here Mrs Joe. Both of these semi-autobiographical novels begin with a shock to a child that reverberates through the rest of the action. Both are seen from the dual child-adult perspective; both belong to the Bildungsroman genre. Both have been repeatedly adapted for stage, screen and radio drama, and yet both have their weaknesses of characterisation and narrative tedium.Several decades ago it was not unusual to find a Dickens novel as a set text for public examinations. Today this would be unheard of: \`Too long, Sir!' \`Boring, Sir!' I recall attempting to \`teach' Nicholas Nickleby to secondary modern school pupils in the Sixties. Then that outmoded method of \`reading around the class' was still in vogue. The lads enjoyed that and were doubled up laughing as Nickle Arse and Queers went about their business. Those who say they still love Dickens today, are probably thinking of one or more of the excellent BBC adaptations rather than the text of the book itself. Reading a Dickens novel today, except as a Simplified Classics text, is no mean feat.It has taken me several weeks to get through Great Expectations, reading it in bite-sized pieces, often as a Book at Bedtime treat. That is probably the best and most appropriate method, since like most Victorian novels it was designed for serialisation, which also of course accounts for the repetitiveness and the prolonging of tension by ending each Part on a cliff-hanger. It is not easy for the modern reader to read with the eagerness and innocence of his Victorian counterpart. The sheer thickness of the books and the at times plodding nature of the narrative demand a time and patience that for most of us today is in short supply.Nevertheless, I am pleased to have made the effort, and was for the most part captivated by the narrative and relished the sheer exuberance of the language, as when Dickens allows Pumblechook or Joe Gargery to indulge in their respective bumbling monologues. True, I got tired of Pip's continual self-analysis as he expounds on his guilt in rejecting the advances of good friends like Joe, Biddy and, later, the convict Magwitch aka Provis. I cringed, too, at the moral miracles of a converted Miss Havisham, kneeling before Pip. And the fire was an unconvincing contrivance. As for the cooked-up non-serial happy ending, the less said the better."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I read this book when I was in high school.

Shakespeare trying to write his masterpiece 'Love's Labour's Won' and trying to decide how to spell his name, Sir Walter Raleigh desperate to get a new cloak and introduce the Potato at court, Francis Bacon scheming to get his hands on one of Queen Elizabeth's used beds, the Queen herself trying not to make up her mind about anything. Fictional characters mingle with the real ones, particularly Viola, the lady-in-waiting in love with the theatre and wanting to be a player, disguising herself as a boy so she can join Shakespeare's company and then falling in love with him. Sounds familiar? Yes, but Brahms and Simon did it first, and funnier."},{"Title":"No bed for Bacon","review":"This enchanting little novel, first published in 1941, traces the intertwining adventures of Shakespeare's theater company and Elkizabeth's court, mingling historical figures and charmingly imagined fictions. Shakespeare, intent on his new play, Love's Labors Wonne, can't be bothered to pay attention to the new production of Henry VIII. Sir Francis Bacon dances around the outskirts of the theater, while parsimonious Lord Burghley and ambitious Sir Walter Raleign pursue their own schemes. Dagglebelt the jester tries (unsuccessfully) to juggle pumpkins while Will Kempe discovers with delight the comic possibilities of a pail of whitewash dumped over Richard Burbage's unsuspecting head. To the modern reader there are all sorts of hints of the film, Shakespeare in Love, but this book was written more than fifty years earlier, and has an air of lunatic delight all its own."},{"Title":"No bed for Bacon","review":"Fans and scholars of Shakespeare will find this book very entertaining.

Definitely worth the read."},{"Title":"Scenario Planning: Managing for the Future","review":"I bought this and the Van Der Heijden book together and found this book very frustrating to read. There is some good practical writing in the first section of the book, which describes the basics of scenario planning and how scenario planning and strategic planning work together. If this is where the book stopped, it would have rated much higher. The rest of the book is almost a total write-off though.The examples and case studies read like a patched-together compilation of other people's writings. There are huge differences in style, voice, and detail which make the examples difficult to compare and contrast. Actually, it makes them difficult to read. The balance of the book would really have benefitted from a re-write and some further research into the examples and case studies.If you are interested in developing and using scenarios check out the Van Der Heijden book - &quot;Scenarios - the Art of Strategic Conversation.&quot; Also, &quot;the Art of the Long View&quot; by Peter Scwartz is a great introduction to developing and using scenarios."},{"Title":"Scenario Planning: Managing for the Future","review":"Aimed at business strategists or consultants, this book provides many deep, usable tools, examples, and approaches assisting the development of more robust projects and organizations across a range of futures.The attractively illustrated, deep resources span:++ Part 1 (a standalone \\"book\\")- history and background of scenario planning (SP); current state of the art; ICL use of SP in projects; examples of SP (including 2 day workshop at world-class Manufacturing Systems Integration Research Institute at Loughborough University, UK); and learning.++ Part 2- describes various approaches - BASICS, CSM, STRAT*X, Copenhagen Institute, EC,, French School, Futures Group, Global Business Network, NCI, and SRI.++Part 3- case studies for range of approaches used across sectors- British Airways, Cable &amp; Wireless, ECRC, Electrolux, UK National Health Service, KNRONE, Shell and United Distillers.++ Part 4- scenarios- ICL, the Internet, Telecoms industry, Shell, Hemingford, and 21st Century Organizations.Despite covering a very broad and deep content, the structure, style, and excellent use of sidebars/charts/lists/ and \\"glue\\" (or linking text) make this a very approachable working book &amp; reference source for the scenario planning. The emphasis is on practicality, rather than theory, as befitting an author with significant practical experience. The only complaint, is that sometimes too much detail is given (reading a bit like a lab-report- the author's a physicist, after all!).Overall, a great practical text which goes very well with the high quality and more abstract view (less case studies, more emphasis on process) in Kee Van Der Heijden's \\"Scenario's- The Art of Strategic Conversation\\" (Wiley, 1997, ISBN 0471966398)."},{"Title":"Scenario Planning: Managing for the Future","review":"Most books on scenario planning either entertain us with their stories of possible futures or delve into intensely dull details of scenario construction. Ringland's book has the virtue of avoiding these two extremes. This wide-ranging book will suit both newcomers and veterans of scenario planning. Each kind of reader can pick out what they need from the four sections. Part I introduces scenario planning from the point of view of strategic planning at ICL in the UK. Ringland shows how scenarios can be linked to strategic planning and how they can be used for learning or to influence public opinion. Part II take a more theoretical approach, outlining eleven different methods, including those used by the European Commission, Global Business Network, and SRI, as well as computer-driven simulations. Part III presents eight case studies, allowing the reader to see the process as it was applied to British Airways, Cable and Wireless, the UK's National Health Service, and Shell. Finally, Part IV shows examples of scenarios including those developed by the author's company ICL, and MIT's scenarios for 21st Century organizations.Hardly anyone these days has the time to read a 400-page book. Fortunately, Ringland has structured Scenario Planning to make it easy to pick out just what the reader needs. The variety of approaches explained and the range of case studies and examples is like a large menu from which the reader can choose just the tidbits desired. A well-balanced reading of selected chapters will provide all the essential elements needed to understand scenario planning. On the other hand, the book's main shortcoming arises from its breadth. No one approach is explained in sufficient detail to create a systematic and thorough understanding of any particular method. Such detail can make for tedious reading and may be unnecessary. But if you want to drill down to minute details, skimming Ringland's book will be a great warm-up before tackling Van der Heijen's book."},{"Title":"Scenario Planning: Managing for the Future","review":"Sure, you worry about what changes the future will bring for your business. But do you have a sensible and logical way to respond to the uncertainties that keep you up at night? If not, this intriguing book will set you on the right path. British corporate strategist Gill Ringland offers persuasive evidence that scenario planning is a worthwhile pursuit, and she recounts in useful detail her own experiences and those of large corporations looking for an edge up on the future. The book is organized in four sections: the links between scenarios and strategic planning, a rundown on different theoretical approaches (French School, Futures Group, CSM, Copenhagen Institute, and more), a set of eight case histories and several examples of actual, step-by-step scenarios. While Ringland's writing is inconsistent and can be dense and jargony, she nevertheless offers plenty of useful information that serves as a path for anyone embarking on scenario planning. We suggest this book to managers and corporate strategists seeking ways to deal with the uncertain future."},{"Title":"A Parisian Proposition","review":"No one tells an outback story better than Barbara Hannay.

The illustrations found in the book whose authors fondly refer to as \\"The Little Book\\" are contrary to the advise found in the book: they illustrate nothing related to the principles so clearly explained by the text. The illustrator takes a random phrase or word from the text and makes an illustration of it. For instance, the authors use as an example of Rule 3 \\"Well, Susan, this is a fine mess you are in\\". The illustrator takes this sentence and draws a picture with that title (the picture in the cover of the book). What the doggie's drawing has to do with Rule 3 (Enclose parenthetic expressions between commas) is anybody's guess.Because the illustrations do not add to the text, they are not needed for the explanations. As stated in the introduction to the 1979 edition (reprinted in the illustrated edition) \\"Rule Seventeen. Omit needless words! Omit needless words! Omit needless words!\\" (Yes, the rule is printed three times in the intro). Rule 17 could extend to needless illustrations and thus they should be omitted.

This little red book contains a cache of rules, definitions, punctuations, and proper expressions condensed into five, clear, user-friendly, concise chapters.\\"Get to the point. Omit needless words. Don't overwrite. Compose an accurate, concise discourse.\\"White demonstrates that the beauty of our language, as demonstrated by himself and other classical authors, is that we can all follow the same formalities of one another yet be so individualistic in style without sacrificing clarity. While the first half covers simple grammatical rules, the latter half of the five chapters is devoted to rules that will foster each writer's own unique ingenuity. In a rare assurance, this is one of the books that promises to change how you see your own words on paper."},{"Title":"The Elements of Style Illustrated","review":"This guide is an absolute must for the PhD student getting ready to write a dissertation. The whole process of writing will go much easier knowing the \\"elementary rules of usage\\". What more can I say, this is a critical guide that have."},{"Title":"The Elements of Style Illustrated","review":"Reviewed by Joanna Pearson for Small Spiral NotebookIn ninth-grade English, I was introduced to The Elements of Style by William Strunk and E.B. White. Needless to say, this was a while ago, and I've both read and written a few things since then. Nonetheless, just weeks ago I managed to turn in a poem to my writing workshop containing the line, \\"He lifts the ringing culprit in his fingers.\\" My instructor looked at me askance before asking why I hadn't simply written, \\"He answers his cell phone.\\" Oh....Yeah. Clearly for some of us, the reissue of Elements, newly illustrated by Maira Kalman, has come not a moment too soon. Kalman's strange, gorgeous paintings are a treat that will charm readers into rediscovering a book that is as fresh, relevant, and funny as it was back in its first edition.The Elements of Style has always been the original in the way of tart, pithy guides to writing and grammar. Long before Lynne Truss delighted readers with her curmudgeonry in Eats, Shoots & Leaves, there was old Strunk- railing against words like \\"beauteous\\" and \\"utilize,\\" offering such sage advice like \\"Avoid fancy words.\\" By adding her quirky pictures, Kalman is both paying homage to a classic and inviting new readers to discover it. Elements is now a two-fold experience; visual and literary.One has to imagine Kalman as one of those geniuses who lose themselves every morning over their breakfast cereal, constantly struck by ideas-\\"I know, I'll paint about sentence structure! Illustrate a grammar book!\\"-that would sound ridiculous to the rest of us, and yet turn out to be brilliant. In addition to devising this new illustrated Elements, Kalman also commissioned Nico Muhly to compose an opera. Performed recently at the New York Public Library, it was by all accounts crazy yet wonderful, complete with Kalman's friend Isaac Mizrahi playing an eggbeater. We non-geniuses, on the other hand, have probably not considered the idea of singing about words and sentences since the last time we watched Sesame Street.Kalman's ideas work. The new book is a slim, appealing red volume. Gone is the fusty plainness of the ninth-grade classroom. This book is classy. The inside front cover says \\"hello,\\" and the inside back cover says \\"goodbye\\" in tiny cursive script like elegant hostess cards. Almost every other page is illustrated, and the illustrations range from Kalman's interpretation of \\"overly, muchly, thusly\\" (a top-heavy ship-on-land structure) to \\"Chloe smells good, as a baby should\\" (the huge gurgling face of red-headed baby Chloe.) All the pictures are bright, and many of them demonstrate a deliberate absence of compositional depth that seems to be one of Kalman's trademarks. As such, the odd tangle of characters she paints in an illustration like hers for \\"None of us is perfect,\\" seem ready to tumble on top of each other or out of the page. Some of the paintings like \\"What a wonderful show!\\" to me resemble the flurried, brilliant compositions of the painter discovered in the lunatic asylum. Kalman's bright oddness, her weird lines of perspective, have something off-kilter to them, something more often found in outsider-art.If Kalman had illustrated the phonebook instead, it would be worth reading just for the sake of seeing her pictures. In this case, however, in addition to Kalman's illustrations, one has the barbed imperatives of good old Strunk and White to look forward to, like :Nauseous. Nauseated. The first means \\"sickening to contemplate\\"; the second means \\"sick at the stomach.\\" Do not, therefore, say, \\"I feel nauseous,\\" unless you are sure you have that effect on others.and:Muddiness is not merely a disturber of prose, it is also a destroyer of life, of hope: death on the highway caused by a badly worded road sign, heartbreak among lovers caused by a misplaced phrase in a well-intentioned letter, anguish of a traveler expecting to be met at a railroad station and not being met because of a slipshod telegram. Think of the tragedies that are rooted in ambiguity, and be clear! When you say something, make sure you have said it. The chances of your having said it are only fair.It is both his grumpiness in misuse and the genuine joy in clarity that make Strunk a wonderful guide. Strunk saw bad writing as insidious and disruptive, an ever-present trap into which it was easy to slip. Similarly, his view of the precarious position of the reader is observed by White in his introduction:All through The Elements of Style one finds evidences of the author's deep sympathy for the reader. Will [Strunk] felt that the reader was in serious trouble most of the time, floundering in a swamp, and that it was the duty of anyone attempting to write English to drain this swamp quickly and get the reader up on dry ground, or at least throw a rope.All in all, the illustrated Elements of Style is well worth the reader's time-a sturdy rope with which to rescue anyone stranded in a morass of unclear language, whether your own or someone else's. Kalman's bright, dreamy images are persuasive in their own right too. And even if you've never mixed up \\"which\\" and \\"that,\\" misplaced a single comma, nor composed an overwrought line, you should still pick up what remains one of the funniest books on writing ever written."},{"Title":"The Elements of Style Illustrated","review":"English is not my native language. However, I consider my command over written and spoken English as a matter of great pride! Since coming to North America, I have received many a compliments on the same. But again, English is not my native language, and that remains a fact.There are many a tips and tricks that I did not know before I started to read this book. I ordered the book as it was a required text for one of my courses, but never really read it in full. I would pick it up occasionally and randomly select a page and start reading. I was astounded at how the book kept my interest alive each time I did so and would make me feel pressed to go on. Eventually, I decided it was about time, I paid respect to the \\"little book\\" and started off at page one. I have learned a lot from this book and recommend it to one and all, but most especially to people who study or work in an environment where English is the preferred language of communication, but whose native language is not English. This book should be read by all such people, regadless of their level of fluency. Trust me you will be smiling all along, either at having learned a neat little tip, or reminiscizing about the many times you have made the blunders that the book warns about!"},{"Title":"The Elements of Style Illustrated","review":"This book provides excellent information on use of the english language and does so in a way that is easy to understand."},{"Title":"The Elements of Style Illustrated","review":"Almost every American college student and certainly every writer has been touched by this book. This new edition adds a hardcover and fifty or so illustrations. The text is the same - we don't want to change that - but the whole presentation is wonderful and will make a great replacement for the beat up paperback sitting on your shelf."},{"Title":"The Elements of Style Illustrated","review":"I needed to re-purchase this classic after many years, and am happy to have a larger-format, illustrated version. It is enjoyable to read!"},{"Title":"The Elements of Style Illustrated","review":"The Elements of Style has long been a staple for writers. Now the book adds an element of humor in the delightful drawings by its illustrator. The rules are just as helpful as they have been for decades. The illustrations bring the written examples to life. They're bright, sunny, funny, and fun."},{"Title":"The Elements of Style Illustrated","review":"This is one of the finest books there is on writing. Clear, concise, and easy to read -- this is not your typical English text book.Possibly the most useful (and important) gift one could give to a college student, budding writer, or anyone anywhere that needs to communicate through writing (whether it be corporate policies, e-mails, or weblogs)."},{"Title":"The Elements of Style Illustrated","review":"Never has such a dry subject been so infused with wisdom ( of course) but also with humor and beauty."},{"Title":"The Elements of Style Illustrated","review":"I totally rely on Strunk. And now it is illustrated. For me, this is wonderful. I can see what I sometimes can't read. Although I improve daily. I hope."},{"Title":"The Elements of Style Illustrated","review":"Throughout my college years I have managed to collect at least three different editions of this wonderful little book. I find the illustrated edition interesting but somewhat unnecessary. The illustrations don't impart much of an edge to this book, IMO."},{"Title":"The Elements of Style Illustrated","review":"I need a resource, not a coffee table book. The font is hard to read. The pictures do not seem to make sense with the content, and it is hard to find the rule you need. Grrr.If they are going to jazz this gem up, they need to remember that we *use* this book. The artwork should complement and aid the understanding, not confuse the reader.Blah.Why a dog on the cover? Why????"},{"Title":"The Elements of Style Illustrated","review":"The new illustrated version is no improvement over the original Strunk & White, which can't be beat as a writing guide. My copy came with no dust jacket, so I couldn't even give it as a gift."},{"Title":"The Elements of Style Illustrated","review":"The Elements of Style was great before pictures were added, but the color adds even that much more to a great source for grammar and punctuation. Easy to navigate, great examples through sentences and excerpts. Strunk and White have done it right!"},{"Title":"The Elements of Style Illustrated","review":"It's alright. I had to buy this book for school, so I am not too thrilled about reading it, but it's definitely informative and explains everything to you like you were a child, so it's a quick way to study basic composition, including grammar."},{"Title":"The Elements of Style Illustrated","review":"I gave this book as a gift to someone who has always touted the original. She was skeptical at first about its needing illustrations, but thought it might induce younger people to check it out. As far as I know, she is very satisfied."},{"Title":"The Elements of Style Illustrated","review":"The Elements of Style Illustrated by William Strunk Jr. is a welcomed edition to my desk. The artwork gives the otherwise dry information some flare. I am enjoying it."},{"Title":"The Elements of Style Illustrated","review":"Look folks, read the publisher's blurb about this book. Especially pay attention to the part where it quotes Whatshername describing herself, or her work, or some such thing. Apparently she hasn't even learned that sentences are supposed to contain verbs.Seriously, this books is a travesty. The publishers have taken one of the greatest books on writing in English and have trivialized it by adding illustrations that profit little and editorial changes that destroy the book's original integrity. Please buy the original instead of this edition."},{"Title":"The Elements of Style Illustrated","review":"If you want to see the clean, elegant prose of the true Strunk & White turned into a mamby-pamby of gender-inclusiveness and political correctness, buy this book.If you want silly, pointless illustrations randomly scattered around your manual of style, then by all means, spend far more than you need to.Otherwise, forget this book and buy the real one!"},{"Title":"The Elements of Style Illustrated","review":"Another great reason to buy this classic--again."},{"Title":"The Elements of Style Illustrated","review":"A copy of The Elements of Style has been on my shelf for more than 20 years now. It is a timeless, marvelous reference. Here, now, we have an illustrated edition. Wouldn't it be nice to actually see a few of the illustrations? I know what the original says. It's the pictures that make this edition much more expensive than the paperback version, so why not let me browse through a few here online? Guess I'll have to go to a bookstore (remember those?) and actually turn through the pages if this online offering won't show them to me."},{"Title":"The Elements of Style Illustrated","review":"I have my own artistic musical compositions posted at various sites (they were available here at Amazon, but I think that the free amateur MP3 section has been eliminated), and it hurts my feelings when people speak poorly of them, so I will not comment on the quality of the paintings by Maria Kalman that are used in this edition of The Elements of Style, or criticize her ability as an artist. She's apparently successful as an illustrator of children's books, and best wishes to her. I will say, however, that my late uncle Al, who specialized in murals in the basements of neighbors, was far superior in technique.My complaint is that, why does The Elements of Style, being a manual for English grammar and punctuation, contain any paintings in it at all? Just how does that improve the book's utility? You are searching for assistance on some thorny point of punctuation, and you turn the page, and instead of examples, there's an Uncle Al painting. It's the worst idea since stamps you have to lick.What next? Watercolors in anEngine Manual? Abstract expressionism in the set-up instructions for your new camcorder? Perhaps Ms. Kalman's next assignment will be to illustrate theBook of Random Numbers.I would assume that this edition is being marketed as something suitable as a gift, but I can assure you that whomever you give this to would much rather have $10 and a used edition of the plain book."},{"Title":"The Elements of Style Illustrated","review":"This book is an essential for every writer, student and secretary as well as an excellent \\"how to\\" that should be in every classroom in America!"},{"Title":"The Elements of Style Illustrated","review":"wonderful presentation of a text that is showing its age and not nearly as accessable as it should be - ironic given the intent of the autor"},{"Title":"The Elements of Style Illustrated","review":"The Elements of Style is, hands down, my favorite book of English usage. It is as pure and simple and perfect as a reference book can be. That is, simple, not simple-minded.This much lauded illustrated edition, with its simple-minded illustrations, is yet another sad example of the dumbing down of western culture. In Will Strunk's time this sort of treatment, if it existed at all, would have been intended for children below the age of six or seven. It's current target reader is apparently the developmentally challenged adult. While we all sympathize with those struggling with learning disabilities, it is pathetic that such a degradation of a classic work is received with respect. My four year old grandson finds the illustrations to be as he says, \\"pretty stupid\\". Of course, he is a child of normal intelligence, and is thus at a critical disadvantage in a world designed for the lowest common denominator."},{"Title":"The Elements of Style Illustrated","review":"Why have I been required to buy (let alone read) a poorly-illustrated book for a college class??? What a strange world in which we live. Fifty years ago the very idea of this book would have been ridiculed; today it is lauded. I yearn for the past."},{"Title":"The Elements of Style Illustrated","review":"This jazzy edition of the classic \\"The Elements of Style,\\" by Strunk and White, features stylized, exuberant, riotously colorful, and often whimsical illustrations by Maira Kalman. In addition, a few references have been changed to make the book more relevant. For instance, in the earlier edition, the authors cautioned against the use of acronyms with this example: \\"Not everyone knows that SALT means Strategic Arms Limitation Talks.\\" The new edition states, \\"Not everyone knows that MADD means Mothers Against Drunk Driving.\\" In the section on slang, Strunk and White advised writers to use standard language and avoid such words as \\"uptight, groovy, rap, hangup, vibes, copout, and dig.\\" In the new edition, examples of slang are \\"psyched, nerd, ripoff, dude, geek, and funky.\\" Strunk and White advocated \\"using scissors on the manuscript, cutting it to pieces and fitting the pieces together in a better order.\\" In the current edition, writers are encouraged to use a word processor to move text from place to place.Is a new edition of this handbook really necessary? I believe that it is, not only because of the archaic references that needed updating, but also because today's younger writers need visual stimulation and pizazz to capture their attention; this edition has both. Strunk and White's words of wisdom are, for the most part, reprinted as they appeared in earlier editions. The authors discuss such topics as elementary rules of usage, principles of composition and form, words commnonly misused, and tips on how to develop an effective and natural style. Even experienced writers would do well to review \\"The Elements of Style\\" now and then to remind them of the importance of clarity, brevity, simplicity, and consistency."},{"Title":"The Elements of Style Illustrated","review":"Strunk and White's Elements of Style is the absolute classic guidebook to grammar and to clear writing. It is underpinned by a simple philosophy of making every word count. The paperback edition resides on millions of desks world-wide: a wise guide to people who appreciate words and clear communication.But here's a hardback edition, beautifully illustrated. Why not just go for the paperback? The answer is because Elements of Style has become much more than a reference text: it is an icon, and this edition is like a glorious piece of birthday cake that celebrates the fact that we've been in the presence of a faithful and inspiring servant for almost 50 years. Elements of Style is a classic that retains a resilient role even (or especially) in this age of txt.If you love artful writing, buy a copy for yourself. For any friend who cherishes the written word, this book is the perfect gift. It allows us to stop, to marvel and to appreciate the power of simple truths, well told."},{"Title":"The Elements of Style Illustrated","review":"For the reviewer who pines for life as it was 50 years ago, actually in 1959, William Strunk Jr.'s Elements of Style, which had gone out of print at that point, was revised by a former student of Strunk's, E.B. White. This 2005 revision takes nothing away from the book, but reconsiders the original from a design perspective. As far as I'm concerned, the cloth cover, the 57 color illustrations, the high-quality printing, only add to the pure pleasure of reading or re-reading this book."},{"Title":"The Elements of Style Illustrated","review":"The illustrations are interesting and nice. But this edition is certainly not a \\"user\\". Page numbers are all \\"inside\\" - along the binding side and at the bottom of the pages. To accommodate the illustrations you can go six pages without a page number. When you try to use this book as a reference, the illustrations just get in the way, breaking up your train of thought.Not that I'm pushing book sales, but if you get this illustrated edition (or plan of giving it as a gift), do yourself a favor and also get the paperback version. That way you have something you can actually use, as well as having a volume for muse."},{"Title":"The Elements of Style Illustrated","review":"My new \\"The Elements of Style\\" by William Strunk Jr. and E. B. White, illustrated by Maira Kalman, lies before me now, beside the 1959 edition that I have had since August of that year.Since I hadn't reread the old one in who knows how many years, what induced me to buy a new one? I have always retained affection for Strunk's \\"little book.\\"Recently I read a review of the new \\"The Elements of Style Illustrated,\\" and saw a few of the paintings by Maira Kalman. And I heard of the song cycle, based on the book, composed by young Nico Muhly in collaboration with Ms. Kalman and premiered in the Rose Main Reading Room of the New York Public Library.The illustrated book sounded like fun, so I ordered it, which prompted me to read Strunk's words again with new appreciation.The overall design of the new book is appealing -- bright red covers, a somewhat larger format (about an inch wider, a half-inch taller, and 156 pages as opposed to 71), the cleaner look of the pages (with more white space and semi-glossy). Both books are hardbacks; I think I would not like the feel of the new one as a paperback.Most striking on the mostly bare, red front cover, is a huge white colon punctuation mark, centered below \\"THE ELEMENTS OF STYLE.\\" The printing is white (no connection to E. B. White, I'm sure). The word \\"illustrated\\" in small gold italic is printed near the lower right. The red back cover is completely bare except for a matching, centered white semicolon.The cover designer, presumably Ms. Kalman or someone she worked closely with, no doubt intended that we follow these magnified punctuation marks: The colon by reading and viewing the book. The semicolon by proceeding to our own independent work.Ms. Kalman's paintings are colorful, mostly full page, some double page, and attractively quirky. Her subject's eyes are intelligent and draw you in. The first double page appears to be of E. B. White, comfortably seated with a book, in a roomful of books -- piled on the tables, stacked on the floor, shelved in bookcases; on another chair, I think I see his dachshund Minnie who won't relinquish her place to more books. At the end of \\"Elements\\" are Ms. Kalman's paintings of Strunk, White again, and of herself.Those of you who were introduced to Strunk years ago, in a Diction and Usage class somewhere (say, Ann Arbor), don't need anyone else to tell you of his value and influence. You who have yet to read him, should have confidence in the millions who already have, knowing that his brief remarks about writing will prove clarifying, incisive, and encouraging. Enjoy Maira Kalman's gallery. The book is a thing of intellectual and visual beauty."},{"Title":"The Elements of Style Illustrated","review":"This book was required for my high school English classes back in the late '60's. As an English professor, I use this book today. Many generations of students have benefited from this book's informal, conversational approach to teaching formal English (that is, excellent English that is precise and concise in form and content). Although I don't personally like the illustrations, this is my favorite edition of the book because the illustrations add a whimsical informality to substantive content."},{"Title":"The Elements of Style Illustrated","review":"Many of us baby boomers have lived and breathed William Strunk Jr.'s and E.B. White's \\"Elements of Style\\" as we attempted to reacquaint ourselves with the rules of the road when it comes to writing clear prose. Its compact size (only 105 pages) and clear organization made the tome the pinnacle of usability before such factors came into play as successful criteria for any easy-to-use reference manual. The book, at least White's famous revision of it, is as old as me, both of us born in 1959, and clearly both of us are in need of an overhaul to refresh the knowledge we present to a more contemporary audience.Enter artist Maira Kalman, who was so inspired by the book when she discovered it at a yard sale four years ago that she applied her considerable artistic gift and contributed 59 colorful illustrations to this version. The net result is a charming and comical addendum to an established classic. Keep in mind that the original intention of the authors was simply to present eight elementary rules of usage, ten elementary principles of composition and a list of commonly misused words or expressions. Consequently, it's impressive how Kalman is able to stay true to the rigidity of the book's structure with her whimsical images. Even though in earlier days I actually preferred the slap of the ruler of White's terse instructional style, I think Kalman brings a sense of humanity that is totally unexpected."},{"Title":"The Elements of Style Illustrated","review":"The illustrations are wonderful, as are the font and graphic design. The paper on which the book is printed also seems to be fairly high quality, bright and heavy to the touch, and looks to be acid-free. HOWEVER, the cloth binding is execrable. My copy is brand new, yet the front and back covers are already warping, and the text block itself is noticeably curved and starting to warp. The garish, cheap red cloth cover is poorly embossed; the title and spine lettering looks painted on with white-out and a cardboard stencil. I suspect that it will probably flake off in a matter of months. It's bewildering to me that the Penguin Press would lavish so much attention on the text block, then skimp on the binding, for an edition whose principle allure is as an objet d'art."},{"Title":"The Elements of Style Illustrated","review":"______________________________________________The Strunk & White classic, in a classy new hardbound edition, with sprightly illustrations by Maira Kalman.

The placement of the possessive \\"'s\\" is an example of where the book seems out of date. Example (and I write this from memory), Strunk argues it's correct to write \\"Charles's horse\\" and not \\"Charles' horse\\". I always thought the second application is correct.

The organization is very strange (there isn't any to speak of) and the writing style is very direct. The result is a no-nonsense book that teaches you to cut the crap out of your writing.There are many, many valuable lessons contained in Strunk's short and useful guide but the best ones, for me, are the ones regarding comma usage and his favorite command, \\"Omit needless words.\\" During everything I've ever written since reading this book I've heard a disembodied voice telling me to remove words.

White's \\"The elements of styles\\" has given facts and rules about English language and writing. Half a century later some of these suggestions, so to speak, have been overcame, but, on the other hand, many of them are still quite useful - especially for the wannabe writers and students. But, if not for those who dared to break some suggested laws the literature could be in a standstill.What is very useful about this book is that it is very sensible when it comes to give advices. \\"Omit needles words\\", \\"use the active voice\\", \\"express coordinate ideas in similar form\\" are some of them. Many are a little out of date, but most of them are still quite useful. In a time when people want to type fast, or use only 140 characters, abbreviations are very common, but very annoying as well. \\"They [abbreviations] distract [the readers'] attention and exhaust his patient\\".In the special edition of \\"The elements of style\\" Maira Kalman's illustrations make reading the book a colorful experience. Her drawings help to highlight and fixate the main points, but what is most beautiful about Strunk & White's book is that the authors know that language is a entity in constant change. \\"The language is perpetually in flux: it is a living stream, shifting, changing, receiving new strength from a thousand tributaries, losing old forms in the backwaters of time\\". It is as if they were inviting us to break the very same rules they have just exposed - after all, rules are made to be broken."},{"Title":"The Elements of Style Illustrated","review":"This edition is perfect for the bibliophile, writer or grammarian.

Yet Kalman's images work with it effortlessly, perhaps because they offer a counterpoint to the prose rather than an attempt to depict it literally. I didn't see the \\"exuberant, rioutously colorful\\" quality referenced in \\"booklover 10's\\" review here on Amazon; though they are certainly colorful, the images seem more subtle than that to me, always whimsical but sometimes a bit plaintive, if also sometimes obviously funny. Much of the appeal of this particular marriage of authors and illustrator is the disjunction between the text's emphasis on detail and accuracy and Kalman's deliberately naive and simplified (yet always resonant) renderings.I guess you could say that I've had to do an about-face: hard as it was to imagine the book with illustrations before this edition, I now find it almost impossible to imagine it without them.

Despite the often contentious debate, few practical alternatives have been proposed in the literature. Rosenthal, Rosnow, and Rubin have changed that, with their discussion of contrast analysis and effect sizes.Plus side: The text gives in depth coverage on the design and conduct of contrast analysis, testing particular theoretical predictions using more general data sets. A good example from the book is the influence of age on performance in a video game: do older children perform better than younger children? With five age groups sampled, a standard ANOVA might inform you that the data are very likely close to what is expected from random sampling. However, the ANOVA treats all 120 possible orders of the age groups as irrelevant to your theory. In fact, there is only one ordering that is important to your theory, but ANOVA can't test it! Contrast analysis can. The authors also offer several novel descriptive statistics, using regression and correlation, that can inform you about relationships in a data set that ordinary omnibus tests can't detect. This approach is a serious improvement over the advice to merely use confidence intervals, or the positively primitive reliance on omnibus null hypothesis tests.That said, the book has a few defects. First, it assume the reader has a solid grasp on ANOVA, regression, and inferential testing generally. It is thus an advanced text. For an introductory text I recommend Howitt & Cramer's An Introduction to Statistics in Psychology: A Complete Guide for Students.The text is also quite mathematically oriented, and does not have adequate expositions of all the computations used across the book. If you're not comfortable with inferential statistics and mathematical notations, the book will be a ponderous read. Finally, the book gives very short shrift to the history of omnibus tests and ways they are misinterpreted. On this score, I recommend Gigerenzer's Empire of Chance, and Oakes' Statistical Inference. The latter is now unfortunately out of print.It is clear that complex theories generate complex predictions, and can be tested using only complex tools applied to large data sets. Omnibus tests like ANOVA are clearly inadequate to the task. Contrast analysis is a novel and potentially rich approach to this problem."},{"Title":"Our valiant few","review":"Loved the book, the period and the story.

He simply points out that when Paul speaks against the Judaizers of his day, we can not, as Luther did, project onto them a meaning consistent with that of the Medieval Catholic Church. That is, Luther read Paul struggling with the Judaizer's speaking of the \\"works of the law\\" then saw his own struggle with the Church that seemed to place an endless string of hoops to jump through to achieve salvation. He assumed Paul was speaking to him in his situation directly. \\"The Just shall live by faith\\" became for Luther a liberating statement. Faith, not works, is how one is justified before God.However, Wright explores more precisely what it was Paul was up against. What it was, was those who insisted that the things which made the Jews separate from the nations, such as circumcision, food laws, etc. desired to impose these on new Christians as a badge of their membership in the New Covenant. No, Paul says. It is faith, not these works of the law, which mark you out as a true covenant member. If you live in faith, which is of course outwardly exhibited in obedience, then you will be known as a true covenant member. This is most definitely not telling us that through our works we are or even can be justified before God.Instead, God's justification is really closely tied to his righteousness. Not just righteousness in terms \\"God is better than us\\" (though he certainly is) but righteousness in terms of His faithfulness to His covenant. God will justify His people. In fact, in time and history, He has done so in the cross. The cross is very central to Paul's writings.But, who are God's people? Those who believe the Gospel. What is the Gospel? According to Wright, the gospel Paul preached was not a set of instructions on how one goes about \\"getting saved,\\" but the gospel was the proclamation of the good news that God had redeemed his people in the cross, that Jesus had rose from the dead, and (this is very central) that Jesus is now the reigning King of kings and Lord of lords. He is the King over all of the universe, so this is a universal message, not confined only or even primarily to the Jewish nation. Those who profess a belief in this are part of the visible covenant people, but the true members will be known by their fruits.All this is not to say Luther was totally wrong or without merit, and certainly it was not to say the Roman Catholic Church was right. Yes, Wright is a Protestant, the reader from Canada's criticism notwithstanding. The first century Jews just simply did not hold to a works based salvation as many since Luther have supposed. With this in mind, we can not take Luther's interpretation as completely accurate.Another somewhat soft criticism is that the book is mis-titled, since only the last chapter actually concerns the issue of whether St. Paul was the true founder of Christianity. Admittedly, I had the same initial reaction because this is not something overtly talked about for the majority of the book. However, the entirety of the book outlines the fact that Paul was simply taking the teachings of Jesus as they were to be interpreted for those in Paul's time - and all subsequent ages. He is building the case throughout that Paul is not creating something new, but is a Jew of Jews who is interpreting Jesus the only way one can - through the scriptures of the Jews. Therefore, though he only speaks directly to the point in the final chapter, the point is actually built upon throughout the whole book.Wright does, I believe, a masterful job of taking what is obviously deep, scholarly work and putting it into terms an average Christian can understand. I think this is a much-needed gift, as deep theological works are above the ability of all but a few, yet most popular books are nothing but fluff and baptized pop-psychology.I highly recommend this readable, and enlightened interpretation of Paul. I have a whole new outlook on Paul and look forward to reading through his letters again 'with new eyes\\"!"},{"Title":"What Saint Paul Really Said: Was Paul of Tarsus the Real Founder of Christianity?","review":"Although many within the traditional Protestant camp dish out some harsh criticism toward Wright, I think no one will contest that Wright is a first rate scholar and that his views must be taken seriously and engaged by other evangelical Protestants. That being said, I think Wright's new work on Paul's gospel message is a great work that sheds new light on a topic that most think they have fully grasped. The reason why I like Wright's work is because he attempts to understand Paul from a 1st century Jewish mindset, and not from a later perspective. I think most Protestants would do well to reconsider if the 16th century interpretation of Paul is really the best one, and understand that that interpretation is a product of 16th century scholastic Augustinianism, and does not try to understand Paul as a first century Jewish scholar. This is why the New Perspective is so helpful at giving us a new dimension within which we can understand Paul's teachings.Briefly, Wright begins the book by arguing that the heart of the gospel is not how one can get into a right relationship with God, but that it is an imperial proclomation that Jesus and not Caesar is Lord. I thought this idea was well argued for and has some merit, but I am not fully convinced. Then Wright argues that membership in the covenant community is much like that of traditional Judaism; One becomes a member of this corporate community via the covenant, and then one remains in that covenant community. In addition, Wright takes a different view of what exactly the righteousness of God means in a book like Romans. Wright believes the genitive construction is best understood as a subjective genitive and not an objective genitive; That means the righteousness of God is God's covenant faithfulness to his creation, and not some gift of righteousness that God bestows to mankind. For those in the Protestant camp who might disagree, even John Piper holds a similar view so this idea is hardly novel or not well accepted within traditional Reformed circles.Wright believes that God's covenant faithfulness was manifested when he sent His Son, Jesus Christ into the world to redeem creation. This act was a demonstration of God's faithfulness and ushered in the time of renewal and the new age that Paul had so eagerly awaited as a zealous Pharisee. Not much disagreement here, but where I do have qualms with Wright is over his denial of imputed righteousness. Wright believes that there are few Scriptures that speak of an imputed righteousness of Christ and the ones that do are misunderstood. Right believes that faith is not what makes one right with God, but what identifes one as a valid member of the covenant community. Thus, justification is not soteriological but ecclesiogical. If one is going to accept this view I believe Wright will have to develop this idea more fully and should devote a future book solely to this topic. Although there are a few areas of disagreement, I believe this book should be read by all Protestants so that they can approach the Pauline corpus from a more Jewish mindset."},{"Title":"What Saint Paul Really Said: Was Paul of Tarsus the Real Founder of Christianity?","review":"N.T. Wright is a tremendous author, whether you agree with him or not. He does a wonderful job of showing that Paul was the faithful interpretor of Jesus, and not the founder of Christianity. Wright argues that if Paul would have said the same things Jesus did, then he would have been claiming Messiahship as well.A previous revewier has stated that this book is the end of Protestantism. His reason is that \\"the central theme of the gospel to Protestantism is justification by faith\\". That may be the case within some strands of Protestantism, but is not so all throughout the board (i.e. the Redemptive-Historical school of Reformed Theology with Vos, Ridderbos and Gaffin).Now to the controversial \\"Fresh Perspective on Paul\\" as Wright calls it. I am a confessional Protestant who adheres to the Westminster standards, and do not have a problem highly endorsing the eschatological focus of this book. He says that the crucifixion is the chief eschatological act. This ligns right up with what Richard Gaffin says in 'Resurrection and Redemption' from a Reformed perspective.I really liek his interpretation of 'dikaiosune theou', or righteousness of God. That has been a perplexing topic in the history of interpretation and is usually identified as a genitive of origin to uphold the doctrine of the imputation of Christ's righteousness. However, Wright classifies it as a subjective genitive, where the righteousness is God's own righteousness in His covenental faithfulness by redeeming Israel. This clears up a lot of muddled water where that the genitive of origen will not work in all contexts.His notion of justification is the other controversial aspect of his theology. He puts it in the first century Jewish context, rather than a polemical context of church history. The three themes of 1st century Jewish theology that he explains are law court, covenant and eschatology. This has some interesting twists that many will not like, but I find to be quite helpful. I have little problems with an already/not yet aspect to justification (to be more biblical theological), which would correlate with his emphasis on the eschatological nature of justification (see Romans 2:13).This is a tremendous work that is highly recommended!"},{"Title":"What Saint Paul Really Said: Was Paul of Tarsus the Real Founder of Christianity?","review":"In this work, Wright sheds light on certain epistles of Paul which have been, for lack of better term, misinterpreted (perhaps misapplied) in recent commentary history to fit a \\"reformed mold,\\" if you will. Having read Wright's work, for the second time now (once before seminary once after), and also having heard certain popular reformed evangelical thinkers respond to it, I think Wright has been wrongly assessed by these thinkers. In this work, Wright is not denying nor rejecting the \\"reformed doctrine of justification,\\" rather he is simply declaring that Paul is not communicating this doctrine in his epistles which many contemporary reformed thinkers have concluded that he is. I believe Wright has shed some very important light on these texts that perhaps has long been overlooked; perhaps this is so due to a search for passages (proof-texting) in order to 'prove' a particular doctrine (i.e. the reformed doctrine of justification).Wright provides three categories that he thinks Paul's view of justification entails; Covenant, Law Court, and Eschatology. Here is how Wright describes each:\\"Covenant. Justification is the covenant declaration, which will be issued on the last day, in which the true people of God will be vindicated and those who insist on worshipping false gods will be shown to be in the wrong.\\"\\"Law Court. Justification functions like the verdict in the law court: by acquitting someone, it confers on that person the status \`righteous'. This is the forensic dimension of the future covenantal vindication.\\"Eschatology. This declaration, this verdict, is ultimately to be made at the end of history. Through Jesus, however, God has done in the middle of history what he had been expected to do-and, indeed, will still do-at the end; so that the declaration, the verdict, can be issued already in the present, in anticipation.\\"Back in 1997 or 1998 when I first read \\"What Saint Paul Really Said\\", as a good friend of mine from Marquette University often liked to say-I was scandalized. Back then I was so entrenched in my reformed thinking that this book offended me. Almost ten years later, tons of research in Paul's epistles, deeper research into the Catholicity of the Reformation, a deeper and formal study of hermeneutics (inside and outside the classroom), and my studies in Luther's theology, I'm not as scandalized with this second reading.For the last ten years I have struggled with certain aspects of reformed theology, especially as it has been presented by contemporary thinkers (i.e. the confusion between the gospel proclamation and the doctrine of imputation, the casting away completely of Church Tradition as if it had no importance at all, etc.). Moreover, when I always came to the texts of Paul (and the book of James), there were various things that just did not \\"click\\" within my reformed framework, certain texts that did not make sense in light of certain thinkers/reformed commentaries. After reading Wright for the second time certain things about Paul's Epistles just jumped out at me and they made more sense.All that being said, the question remains, am I totally convinced by Wright's small work? Not completely, but it has at least opened my eyes to a newer way of looking at Paul. Furthermore, many of the Pauline texts that \\"baked\\" my mind when I read them many years ago and confused my \\"reformed\\" senses suddenly made much more sense. So, with this history of entrenchment in reformed doctrine I can fully understand that when someone who is in that same position reads Wright they seemed \\"scandalized.\\" However, that should not keep you, if you are reformed in your thinking, from reading this work. It is definitely worth reading and considering."},{"Title":"What Saint Paul Really Said: Was Paul of Tarsus the Real Founder of Christianity?","review":"I have skimmed or read in detail most of Wright's book, but since I will be working with it for the rest of this semester I may find need to reappraise it. So far, so good, as I am concerned.This book is only &quot;dangerous&quot; and &quot;unorthodox&quot; if you interpret the entire Pauline corpus based on Romans 5 and Galatians 3. Wright's claim is that a larger horizon needs to be accorded to Paul's thought than justification by faith (which is NEVER &quot;alone&quot;)--however, what some other reviewers here neglect to mention is that Wright says that this is *central*, but not THE center, of Paul's theology.I approached the book very guardedly, because I thought his prologue was rather pompous. But I actually found the writing to be very good and the scholarship to be judicious, even if he doesn't on the surface appear to immerse himself in &quot;hardcore&quot; exegesis. He takes what is good from Sanders and other modern biblical scholars and tries to separate it from liberal crap.His exposition on the Pauline Trinity--God, Lord, and Spirit--was breathtakingly good. His defense of Jesus' primacy in the founding of Christianity is admirable. Finally, his treatment of Paul's Jewishness was very helpful and gives further motivation to my desire to immerse myself in the OT/Jewish world, to help my understanding of the roots of Christianity.As an aspiring scholar, with conservative-leaning tendencies, I found this book to be quite inspiring. I think Wright provides a good example of scholarship that is largely CORRECT, illuminating, and at the same time beneficial spiritually.May the grace of Jesus Christ our Lord be with you."},{"Title":"What Saint Paul Really Said: Was Paul of Tarsus the Real Founder of Christianity?","review":"Wow...This is one of the best books on Pauline thought I have ever read.It is difficult for many Western Christians to hear, but much of what we believe about what Paul really said is born out of the polemics of the reformation and counter-reformation. Eastern Orthodoxy never went through the fires of a reformation (save a comparatively minor bout with iconoclasm that did not end up splitting the eastern wing of the church). Thus, it is arguable that the three great branches of Christianity ended up developing Pauline theology in different ways due to historical forces largely beyond any one individual's control.This book, it seems to this reviewer, tries to cut through the muddle by placing Paul firmly in his first century context. The image of what St. Paul really said emerges as layer after layer of what has been added to Paul by centuries of history and scholarship (liberal and conservative) is removed. Those fiercely loyal to the 16th century reformationist view of Paul will find some things to agree with in this book, but for the most part will be challenged. Those loyal to the Catholic tradition will perhaps be less challenged by overall thesis of the book, but they will be challenged to examine just where Protestants get Paul \\"right.\\"I have one observation about the supposed \\"New Perspective.\\" It is, to me, a problematic moniker. Rather, Wright seems to be arguing for the \\"orthodox perspective\\" (small \\"o\\") of Paul. This book is way more Catholic and Orthodox than many other evangelical Protestants might like. This book is more protestant than some Catholics (especially traditionalists) might like. However, it is clearly not an exercise in syncretic ecumenism. Rather, Wright is pointing to truth, by giving an authentically biblical and historical reading of the Pauline texts, and letting the evidence, as opposed to any pre-existing loyalty to a dogma, lead him where it may. This is what the best biblical scholars do. And Wright is one of the best living."},{"Title":"What Saint Paul Really Said: Was Paul of Tarsus the Real Founder of Christianity?","review":"\`What Saint Paul Really Said' by preacher and Canon Theologian of Westminster Abby is yet another installment in the very old dialogue among Christians on the understanding of Paul's background, writings, and theology. As someone who is just now entering into this conversation, I am exceedingly happy to have come across this book, as it goes a long way in laying out the various positions of the major speakers on the issues found in Paul's letters. And, it is not simply a \`survey' of positions, as it definitely takes a stand on the most important issues in Paul's theology.While other books deal with earlier centuries, this volume really only deals with the most important voices of the 20th century, beginning with Albert Schweitzer. One of Wright's best services is to discuss Schweitzer's four questions we need to ask about Paul's writings, which is only appropriate, since, Schweitzer's voice is the first and one of the most important in this conversation of the last 80 years. I'll repeat them here, because they have been immense help to me in learning how to present Paul's writings to a Bible Study class. Therefore, I suspect they will be of great value to anyone else starting on a similar journey through this material.1. Where does Paul stand in the history of first century religion?2. Where is the center of Paul's theology? Where does it start?3. What is the exegesis of Paul's individual letters?4. How do we apply Paul's theology to our lives today?I'm inclined to reverse 2 and 3, as we would seem to want to interpret individual writings before doing a synthesis in assembling Paul's theology, but who am I to argue with Herr Schweitzer, who maintained an interpretation of Paul's theology which stressed one's \`being in Christ' and made the \`justification by faith' so dear to Luther a relatively less important issue. From Schweitzer, we move on to Rudolph Bultmann, who interprets Paul through Heidigger's existential glasses, and sees Paul as a Hellenist, applying Greek philosophy to Christian doctrines. Next are the scholars, W. D. Davies and Ernst Kasemann (sic). The last and possibly most important figure from Wright's point of view is Ed. P. Sanders, who literally effected a revolution in Pauline studies by focusing on Paul and the doctrines of the Jewish factions within which Paul studied as a youth.I can see the importance of Sanders' point of view in a heartbeat, as my most pressing question in all my reading about Paul up to this point is \`how really different was first century Judaism from Paul's framing of Christianity. Lo and behold, I now discover that this is in fact a critical milestone in Pauline scholarship. Makes me feel I'm on the right path in understanding these writings.What I find enormously ironic is that after all the other voices in this conversation, the weight of opinion, especially after Ed Sanders' key work, \`Paul and Palestinian Judaism' seems to have returned to the position held by Schweitzer in his 1930 \` The Mysticism of Paul the Apostle'.On the face of it, this historical interpretation may not seem too relevant to Paul's theology, but I believe it is important in understanding Paul, if only to be accurate in how he is translated from his original Greek. So, Wright, along with Sanders and Schweitzer is convinced that Paul's theology grew directly out of his background in radical Pharisaic Judaism.A second really important lesson I get from Wright is that if I really wish to understand Paul, reading him through Luther's eyes may not be the best idea. For as right as Luther may have been about many things, he tended to misinterpret Paul by equating the doctrines of Paul's Hebrew contemporaries with the mistaken doctrines of the Roman church that Luther wished to reform. Luther may go so far as to see first century Hebrews as Pelagians, who thought the only way to salvation was through good works. Paul's citing Abraham's covenant with God is more than enough to show Paul understood that Jewish beliefs rested on a faithfulness to their God and not on adherence to special markings or practices.A third illumination from Wright's book is a demonstration of how complicated some key issues in Paul's writings may be. One important topic is the \`righteousness of God'. Wright demonstrates how this expression in its original Greek can have as many as eight (8) different meanings. Some of these interpretations are plainly unlikely, but one is much more likely to get it right (especially if you happen to encounter some bad translations) if you know what meanings to avoid.After reading through most of Wright's book, one may come to wonder if it's true that Schweitzer and Sanders have managed to get it right in the first place, why do we need Wright's voice chiming in with yet another book? The answer lies in the publication of the book \`Paul: The Mind of the Apostle' by A. N. Wilson, which presents an interesting psychological portrait of Paul, but gets his theology and historical influences all wrong. Oddly enough, I may still read Wilson's book, as it may reveal the one thing Paul has most in common with Augustine, Luther, Calvin, Edwards, Nietzsche, and Kierkegaard. This thing is the soul-wrenching fear and guilt so effectively captured by the Existentialists, but by no means original with them.This may not be the best book for answering the fourth of Schweitzer's issues on applying Paul's message to our life today, but it is a dandy discussion of the other three issues. If you read Wilson's book, you really must read Wright's book as well before letting Wilson's interpretation get too strong a foothold on your view of Paul."},{"Title":"What Saint Paul Really Said: Was Paul of Tarsus the Real Founder of Christianity?","review":"N.T. Wright again bridges the gaps between scholarship and spirituality; liberal and orthodox. Many readers will find his work shocking because he is conservative, but never orthodox. The most controversial aspect of this book challenges the tradition interpetation of justification (righteousness) by faith. For Wright, righteousness before God is not imputed or imparted by God, for instance by \\"accepting the free gift of Christ.\\" Righteousness and Justification are the verdicts rendered in the law court to those that keep the covenant.This raises the question about who is \\"in\\" and who isn't, as well as how can you tell who is \\"in.\\" What are the markers of covenant membership? Wright tells us that Paul's great ephiphany is that the covenant markers of circumcism and keeping Torah have been replaced by the covenant marker of Faith. Justified by Faith, not works.Recommended, but this book will leave you wanting to explore Wright's ideas to their fullest implications."},{"Title":"What Saint Paul Really Said: Was Paul of Tarsus the Real Founder of Christianity?","review":"This is one of the best books I've read in a while. For those unfamiliar with N T Wright this is the book to get. He conciselt and clearly articulates his Pauline theology, which is definitely in line with the \\"New Perspective\\". Basically he sees the gospel as the announcement that Jesus is Lord - not the announcement of \\"salvation by faith alone\\". In Wright's mind Paul never left his Jewish stances at all - rather he realized that Jesus was the Messiah who has fulfilled all of the prophecies of Isaiah 40-55, Ezekiel 37, Daniel 7 etc. As such he sees Jesus' resurrection as God having returned to Zion. Thus he does not hold to a premillenial or dispensational scheme.His stance overall is conservative - he holds to a divine Jesus whi DID rise bodily. But his New perspective leanings will be different than most fundamentalists are used to.I rated it five stars because it is so clear and readable. I do not agree with Wright on most points - but I know well where he stands and why he stands there! The only complaint would be that he does not interact much (in this book) with other scholars and thus has very few footnotes - but in Wright's defense this book was not intended to be an in depth scholar-level piece. One can readily find that in his 3+ volume series on the NT."},{"Title":"What Saint Paul Really Said: Was Paul of Tarsus the Real Founder of Christianity?","review":"In the first two volumes of his series NTPG &amp; JVG, Wright has stressed two methodological principles which he now applies to the relation between Jesus and Paul: 1) understanding Jesus and the earliest church in its Jewish setting, and 2) recognizing both a continuity and discontinuity between Jesus and Judaism &amp; early Christianity. His main point in this book is to show how Paul's mission and theology are a legitimate development of Jesus' preaching, symbolic representation and embodiment of Yhwh's becoming King.Wright not only shows how Paul's Kingdom thinking is a continuation of Jesus' own Kingdom ministry, but why it is also discontinuous. Paul stands at a different point in the story, after the Kingdom has been inaugurated. This is why he does not simply repeat or reproduce the preaching/teaching of Jesus. The Kingdom has come in power and the reign of God must now be extended to the world. It is, then, the different places they stand and roles they play in the story-line that account for the discontinuity and development. Thus, in his development, Paul is being faithful to Jesus and his mission, for Christ now reigns through the gospel and its spread throughout the world.One of the things I noticed particularly in the second work of his set, is that Wright, while he denies that we should read later orthodox theology back into the N.T., nevertheless, continued to suggest that Jesus was a prophet, the Messiah, but more. In this book, Wright also warns against reading back later Christological dogma but, rather than interpret Paul's Christological formulations within the Jewish context, Wright reverts to later Christological formulations or words to characterize Paul's thinking. Hopefully, in his upcoming volume dealing with Paul's theology, Wright will do a better job of explicating Paul's Christology in terms of its Jewish context that he has championed and stressed as a methodological presupposition for his work."},{"Title":"What Saint Paul Really Said: Was Paul of Tarsus the Real Founder of Christianity?","review":"A fascinating book that puts Christianity back into its historical Jewish context, in a way that strengthens the case for Christ instead of relativizing the faith.

A must read for any scholar; Jew, Christian, Muslim, or secularist."},{"Title":"What Saint Paul Really Said: Was Paul of Tarsus the Real Founder of Christianity?","review":"There are multiple ironies at work here. First, it is ironic that such a slight book could signal the end of Protestantism. But that is what this thin volume does. How? By definitely demonstrating that the heart of Protestantism--the Reformation understanding of Justification as primarily the imputation of Christ's righteousness--is not really what St. Paul was getting at. Honest Protestants like Alister McGrath have admitted as much, while still maintaining the &quot;usefulness&quot; of the Reformed understanding of Justification for soteriological purposes (a position that is absurd on its face). By the way, it does no good trying to make Wright's critique go away by labeling it Covenantal Nomism, identifying it with Sanders and Dunn's New Perspective, or by simply reissuing warmed-over Protestant classics. For the Protestant project to continue, Wright must be answered. And so far, he hasn't been.Second, it is ironic, but perfectly understandable, that the deconstruction of the Protestant project comes from within Protestantism itself--and from the conservative not the liberal wing, at that. How does this work? Well, Protestantism arose as a critique of abuses in the Catholic Church. If it is to be true to itself and its highest aspirations, it must be honest and open enough to investigate anything of substance that presents itself to its purview. As N. T. Wright has unfolded the aims of Jesus in his magisterial projected six-volume undertaking, Christian Origins and the Question of God, the first three of which are out, certain questions have presented themselves for investigation, one of which is the relation of Jesus to the movement (and esp. to St. Paul, as the definitive spokesman for that movement) that arose after his death and resurrection. That he has done both in this book and in The Climax of the Covenant. Interestingly, Wright was a St. Paul scholar before he began Christian Origins, having written The Climax of the Covenant before writing The New Testament and the People of God (vol. I of Christian Origins).If the Wright project succeeds, that is, if Protestantism cannot adequately answer the issues he raises, it will mean, I believe, the end of Protestantism. Conservative evangelical Protestantism will find itself in a position of having to thematize its soteriological understandings in accordance with the new paradigm, which sees Justification not primarily as the imputation of Christ's righteousness, but as the believer's entrance into and faithfulness to the Covenant community that Jesus established. That raises a whole series of further relevant questions, such as, What is this Covenant community? Where can it be found? What constitutes entering it? What constitutes faithfulness to it? How does the gospel endure in time? Once these questions are carefully addressed, it will be seen that this Covenant community has existed continually and continuously from the first century A.D. through today, that it is, in fact, the Catholic Church. The reason for being a Protestant--that is, one who protests against the Catholic Church--will have ceased to exist.Perceptive Protestants, especially those of a strict Reformed orientation, have recognized the threat that Wright poses to their position, accurately understanding that acceptance of the Wright project entails the collapse of the cornerstone of Reformation thought, and thus the end of Protestantism itself. For example, you can see this hinted at in their reviews posted here and on other Amazon pages featuring books by Wright. And they are correct.For me personally, the writings of N. T. Wright have been a significant (though by no means the only) factor of a move from the conservative evangelical camp to the Catholic Church, where this summer I will be entering the RCIA (Rite of Christian Initiation for Adults) class at our local Catholic parish, St. Peter Church of Monument, Colorado.Be that as it may, What St. Paul Really Said is among the most important works on the Christian faith ever written (along with Climax of the Covenant and the Christian Origins volumes). Essential reading for anyone seriously interested in what has divided the Church in the West for 500 years, as well as a possible basis for ending that divide."},{"Title":"What Saint Paul Really Said: Was Paul of Tarsus the Real Founder of Christianity?","review":"If there be a more gifted writer, more knowledgeable source, more scholarly person than N.T.

NTW gives again clear interpretation of many details in Paul's writings. Revealing to me was his effort in explaining what he sees as the real meaning of \`justification'. There are however places where I ask myself if he did not look at certain of Paul's concepts through his &quot;Christian spectacles&quot;. F.ex. &quot;The closer we get to his own terms , the more we discover that his view of God is (we have either to use the word or find a direct equivalent) trinitarian&quot;. (p.73) And: &quot;that the God of Israel was now revealed in and as (!) the crucified and risen Jesus of Nazareth&quot; (p.135). Why do statements like these make me feel less satisfied? The Jesus I find in this work is so different again from the Jesus in the two master volumes. With me questions like these linger: Did Paul come up with his own understanding of Jesus of Nazareth? Were the \`revelations' a source for this new and personal understanding? Or can Paul be understood in such a way that his Jesus can be acceptable for Jews and Christians who have trouble with a \`trinitarian' God?"},{"Title":"What Saint Paul Really Said: Was Paul of Tarsus the Real Founder of Christianity?","review":"Until Bishop Wright finishes Volume 4 of his magnum opus, Christian Origins and the Question of God, we will have to do with his shorter monographs on Paul's thought.

For example, he decries widespread consumer debt as creating \\"misery for millions\\" and profits for a \\"tiny minority.\\" As if borrowers don't borrow because it is in their interest to do so, and as if lenders would lend without being paid a return for their trouble.

While Wright brings helpful insight into the mind of a 1st century Jewish convert, he overstates his case by attacking the orthodox and historic Christian understanding of justification by faith apart from works. Serious consideration of Romans 5 is not given in this book, and the Lutheran/Reformed/Evangelical understanding of justification as the foresnic imputation of Christ's righteousness to undeserving sinners is scoffed at as unscholarly.But nothing could be further from the truth.

Sanders' conclusion that the church has misread Paul because they did not understand the nature of 1st century Judaism. E.P. Sanders however is consistent with his conclusion and his interpretation of Paul. He sees that Paul's view of justification would not fit into his findings on 1st century Judaism. Sanders concludes that Paul did not understand 1st century Judaism as well as he does. Arrogant but consistent.Wright is not willing to go as far as saying he understands 1st century Judaism better than a 1st century Jew of Paul's status. Therefore Wright is forced to do extremely poor exegesis to come up with the trash that is in this book.Wright states that the evangelical view of justification comes from the Reformation rather than from Paul. According to Wright we don't have a personal guilt before God and therefore we don't need to be justified in the traditional sense. It does not take someone of Wright brilliance to see that the \\"reformed view of justification\\" was present much earlier than the reformation. It takes little effort to find it in the early church fathers of the 2nd and 3rd century.I feel Wright is more concerned with being recognized as a brilliant scholar than doing sound scholarly work. He longs for the status of being considered one of the top five theologians and realizes he can not support traditional views and obtain this status.He is arrogant like Sanders to believe that he is the only one to get Paul right in almost 2000 years of interpreting Paul.

Was Paul the founder of Christianity? Not according to professor Wright, and he is correct. Did Paul Hellenize Christianity? No. These are just a few of the misconceptions we've all held to, including the academicians who claim to study his writings. NT Wright sets the field aright with an in depth look at Paul through the eyes of a master historian as well as world renown theologian. Paul's views, according to Dr Wright, on justification, righteousness, and who Jesus really is, are not of quite the same flavor as we grew up knowing.

I am always impressed by the tidbits he gives that get to the cultural and historical root of the subject, and he is loaded with them here.To view Paul as some kind of heavily influenced teacher of things Hellenistic will guide you down the entire wrong path of understanding every time. I jumped into this book because of how highly it was spoken of by Scot McKnight in his book The King Jesus Gospel: The Original Good News Revisited which I found very enlightening. I was not disappointed.The gospel message has truly been redefined and basically truncated from what it started as. In a nutshell, the gospel message is about the whole story of Israel and how all the promises and blessings come to us through Christ Jesus. When we look at the \\"gospel\\" as solely a message of personal/individual salvation (which is an end result included) - a we make the gospel nothing more than a piece of a story that has a limited overall affect in the long term discipleship of believers. The full orbed gospel story needs to be rediscovered and applied in ways long lost by the church.Aside from that, this book provides a look at many of the writings of Paul and his view on justification, righteousness and more, and provides a good example of just how much historical understanding most church goers are totally ignorant of, and how it greatly affects the understanding of key scriptural passages. I won't say I can agree with everything espoused here, but the greater majority of the book is excellent in my opinion."},{"Title":"What Saint Paul Really Said: Was Paul of Tarsus the Real Founder of Christianity?","review":"This was my first N.T.

Much explanation of the cultural and political contexts of 1st-century Judaism in Rome cleared up or redefined some of the language used in his letters. For instance, I knew Saul was a \\"Zealot\\", but had no idea that described his political inclination more than mere personal fanaticism.The comparison of major views on the doctrine of Justification was the first I've encountered. I found it fascinating and easy to digest, particularly the charts he included.I recommend it to anyone looking to better understand Paul's writings or the socio-political landscape of the time.The book is just shy of a 5th star because it does lag a bit towards the end and while it was supposed to be a direct response to a work by A.N.

Wright has written, not a biography on Paul, but an account of Paul's central thought and meaning and has done so accurately in my opinion.This book starts out with a look at A. N. Wilson (and ends with him as well), Sweitzer, Bultmann, Davies, Kasemann, and E P Sanders and how they have dealt with Paul. Both Wilson and Bultmann see him as moving away from Jewish roots and founding Christianity (at least Wilson takes this approach) and the others, including Wright sees Paul as holding to and being identified in Jewish roots.In chapter 2, Wright explains that Paul was a Shammaite Pharisee who hunted down renegade Jews (Christians) and brought them to what he thought was God's justice. Wright explains that Paul believed that the great prophetic promises had not been fulfilled and that God's people must act to be ready for their fulfillment. Paul discovers on the Damascus road that God had indeed made good on his promises and that he had done so in the resurrected Jesus that Paul encounters on his way to arrest His (Jesus') followers. This chapter lays the ground work for the developement of the meaning of Paul throughout. In Jesus Paul sees all of the promises of God to be yes and amen (2 Corinthians 1:20). N. T. takes this view and shows then what Paul (and indeed the New Testament and Old) mean by the word \\"gospel\\" and \\"justification\\".\\"Gospel\\", as Wright points out, does not mean a system or formula that one teaches or preaches to someone in order to get them saved so they can miss Hell and make it to Heaven, but rather the gospel is the proclamation that exile is over, YHWH has returned to Israel, sins have been forgiven, and it has taken place in Jesus who is Lord. It is the proclamation that Jesus is Lord. Wright says it often that Jesus is Lord and Caesar is not. Jesus is Lord and Herod is not. Jesus is Lord and mammon is not.

If you read anything on Paul, read this book!!"},{"Title":"What Saint Paul Really Said: Was Paul of Tarsus the Real Founder of Christianity?","review":"N.T. Wright's subtitle to What Saint Paul Really Said, written in support of the New Perspective on Paul, asks, \\"Was Paul of Tarsus the real founder of Christianity?\\" Unfortunately, Wright does little to address this question, despite the back cover's description suggesting otherwise. This, in fact, is one of the foremost criticisms that can be laid against the book. However, with that being said, Wright does manage to successfully relay the New Perspective and provide a challenging critique for traditional methods of interpreting Paul's theology.Wright begins his book by explaining Pauline interpretations made by several prominent biblical scholars, the most important being E.P. Sanders. Sanders' research provides the basis for many of Wright's arguments, in that Sanders challenged the traditional Reformed perspective of Paul's theology by providing evidence that first century Palestinian Judaism was not a religion of \\"works-righteousness\\" equivalent to the Renaissance-era Catholic Church that Martin Luther and John Calvin fought against. Instead, it was grace-and-covenant based, in that Jews believed they couldn't do anything to earn salvation, and works were the natural result of faith (see James). The implication for this discovery has birthed what is commonly referred to as the \\"New Perspective on Paul,\\" which assumes that Paul, who would have been a grace-oriented Jew, must've been using terms such as \\"faith,\\" \\"justification,\\" and \\"righteousness\\" in more abstract manners than would be read by a modern audience (ie, James and Paul appear to disagree, but Paul is actually saying the same thing as James in different terms). Paul was not necessarily condemning doing good deeds to earn God's favor, but was condemning the use of the works of the law to gain membership in God's community. Salvation is unmerited and grace-based, but righteous works are a natural and inseparable part of one's faith. Wright spends a large portion of his book attempting to stress this point, using historical and biblical references to make sense of what Paul truly meant in his epistles.The second chapter is largely relegated to attempting to place Paul on the spectrum of Jewish thought in the first century. Here, Wright's arguments do seem to lack some explanation. Paul, we are told, was likely a Shammaite Pharisee, the most zealous of all Jews, unwilling and unable to cooperate with Rome, determined to see every Old Testament prophecy fulfilled, and declare victory as the entire world bows to the Jewish Messiah and the God of Israel. Assigning Paul to the sect of Shammaite Judaism gives N.T. Wright a powerful argument for dismissing claims of pagan influence several chapters later. It also provides Wright with the ability to support the New Perspective's version of Paul's gospel; a strict covenantal Jew would not proclaim, for example, that a messianic gospel is about salvation of individuals, but rather, that said messiah is Lord. Paul did not abandon Shammaite Judaism after becoming a Christian, but rather, saw Christianity as the fulfillment and continuation of his Shammaite faith.Enough information is provided to understand the basics of Shammaite Judaism, but it's not nearly enough. The glimpse we get of the sect is distinctly \\"works-oriented.\\" It almost seems to contradict the New Perspective and suggest that Paul felt he could fulfill the Jewish covenant and salvation by his own works, the exact type of Judaism that Sanders \\"debunks.\\" Wright even suggests that Paul \\"conceived of his own task to bring [about] an ending [to the Jewish story].\\" The question becomes whether Shammaite Judaism should be set apart from the forms of Judaism mentioned by Sanders in Paul and Palestinian Judaism. Dare we assume that Shammaitism was a very conservative, yet Pelagian, form of Judaism in the first century? The New Perspective would become null and void--Paul would have, in fact, been openly and clearly rebelling against the works-righteousness based faith he held earlier in his life. Of course, it's quite doubtful that such a prominent scholar as Wright would make such a damaging mistake, but the lack of details about Shammaite Judaism, central to Wright's arguments, either posit that it should not have been included at all, or else expanded considerably. However, these assumptions about Paul are nonetheless shown to be well-founded for their specific purpose in his arguments, and to use them as a basis for his main points cannot be overly criticized.Wright spends the next portion of the book proclaiming that Paul's gospel was actually centered on the concept that \\"Jesus is Lord,\\" rather than the ideas of salvation or justification. This argument would be the natural result of both Shammaite Judaism and the New Perspective. In fact, arguing from either of the aforementioned opinions, there is no reason to argue that salvation was central to Paul's gospel over the claim that Jesus was the messiah and king over all. As a result, Wright powerfully suggests that faith was never meant to be something strictly personal; Jesus replaces the worldly rulers, and must be proclaimed as such, leading to an interesting idea that Paul was anti-government. This portion of the book--the middle portion--is very well written and provides a satisfying answer (or at least raises intriguing ideas) to the question of what St. Paul really said.The prominence of Paul's Jewish thought implies that he could not possibly have been influenced by Hellenism, nor could he conceivably drawn from Mithraism, a religion baring numerous similarities to Christianity, and a major religion in Paul's believed homeland. This is the major theme of the final chapter, along with the suggestion that Paul could not have been the founder of the religion of Christianity. Unfortunately, Wright provides a fairly poor argument in this instance. Rather than citing the fact that Paul had joined an existing sect in his conversion to Christianity (and therefore could not be the founder, but at most the most prominent proselytizer and organizer), Wright produces a faith-based argument that suggests that Paul cannot be the founder of Christianity due to the fact that his thoughts were the natural continuation of Jesus's ideas. It certainly wouldn't seem so to the average reader, and there is no evidence to back up this claim other than opinion and faith in the idea that both Jesus and Paul were appointed by God, as well as the presumption that Christianity is true.Lastly, I'd like to share my thoughts on some of the more outlandish criticisms that I've read about this book on this website and others. Many Calvinists and Reformed theologians and adherents, when reading What St. Paul Really Said, do so with the assumption that their perspective of the Bible is correct, and any different thought is \\"dangerous\\" and inherently wrong. This is an absolutely horrible way to approach a new idea. You must start with the evidence, and find the conclusions that can be drawn from it, not start with the conclusion and find evidence to support it, dismissing anything that doesn't fit the conclusion. The latter is illogical and redundant. Wright's book isn't perfect, but it presents enough historical and scriptural evidence to show that at least some of what is traditionally believed about Paul could be wrong. Readers of this book should be open-minded in investigating the possibly that what Paul really said might disagree with their current beliefs, and the implications that might have for their faith."},{"Title":"What Saint Paul Really Said: Was Paul of Tarsus the Real Founder of Christianity?","review":"I enjoy so much of what Wright says, but he doesn't go far enough. We could all learn from his knowlege of second temple Judaism and what things were like during the times of Paul. It is a refreshing read that would be helpful to a much needed overly Americanized view of Christianity. But to say that the entire history of the church including the Reformers got it wrong and to say that the difference between Rome and Protestants shouldn't be there is, to put it bluntly, very arrogant and dangerous. To say that Christ came to redeem the whole world is correct, but to say that this has no bearing on individual salvation is inherently wrong. Paul said Christ came to save sinners of which I am the chief most. To say that first century Jews weren't legalistic by looking at external resources may be compelling, but if one takes Jesus and Pauls own words then all the external resources are irrellevant. Not to mention that if second temple Judaism had escaped the flaws of legalism then it is the only religion in history to do so and that seems to meet outlandish. Overall, I would recommend the book, but if you are not a discerning reader then it won't be helpful. There are more ambiguities than clarifications. Wright says correct things but stops short of saying the whole truth."},{"Title":"What Saint Paul Really Said: Was Paul of Tarsus the Real Founder of Christianity?","review":"Oxford educated, N.T. Wright became the Anglican Bishop of Durham in 2003. On 4 August 2006 he was appointed to the Court of Ecclesiastical Causes Reserved for a period of five years. This is a kind of an Anglican Supreme Court in matters of Church discipline and doctrinal boundary protection. He is a prodigious author, whose sentiments resonate with E.P. Sanders and the New Perspective on Paul. His views on hell and on justification are matters controversial with some. However, he is a writer whose breadth, brilliance, and clarity demand respect and always, a hearing.Wright sets out not to do a complete study on Paul, but rather \\"to focus on some key areas of Paul's proclamation and its implications--including some not usually noticed--in an attempt to uncover \`what Paul really said' at these vital points\\" (8). This he does in ten chapters.Chapter 1 surveys major figures and schools of Pauline studies and situates Wright's perspective with respect to them. In Chapter 2, Wright sees Saul of Tarsus as foundationally a Shammaite Pharisee zealous for the people of Israel, the Land and the Temple in the context of Torah obedience and the progress of a story in search of an ending. For Wright, and for Paul, Judaism is not simply a religion, but a covenantal way of life in service to a divine plan and certainly not a religion of works righteousness (not proto-Pelagian) or a religion for souls in search of heaven. Paul believed in the resurrection of the dead, not the soul's journey to heaven. And for him, justification had to do with the vindication of Israel (See Isa 50:8-9). In Jesus, Paul sees proleptically present the future toward which he has always labored. Chapter 3 begins by exploring the overlay between Paul's conversion and his call, often considered an either/or matter by scholars, but not by Wright. Paul's gospel message is in continuity with expectations he had always known and served. The message is about the end of the Exile (??), the Jewish view of good news (see Isa 52:7 ff.), and the proclamation of the arrival of a victorious King (the Roman view). The gospel is emphatically NOT advertising for a new religious experience. In the cross, God has overcome all that opposed him, the Exile ends (??) and the Gentiles are ushered in. Wright stresses that Jesus is the Lord and King, and the gospel God's means of calling pagans to himself from out of idolatry. However, Wright fails to appreciate Jesus's continuing role as King of Israel and the nations. By this I mean that it seems that for Wright, Jesus' role as Israel's champion is eclipsed and replaced by his role as King of the nations. I cannot agree.Chapter 4 examines how Paul's encounter with the crucified and risen Messiah reconfigured his view of God from within a thoroughly Jewish monotheism, giving him a redrawn Jewish mission to the pagans, employing available linguistic categories, and configuring his selection and reading of key OT texts. Chapter 5 considers how Paul remains rooted in the Jewish monotheistic project, but with a reconfigured message for the pagan world which overturns pagan idolatry and immorality while also chastening an Israel needing to catch up with what God has done in Messiah. In Chapter 6, \\"Good News for Israel,\\" Wright examines \`the righteousness of God.\\" Principally and foundationally this is God's covenant faithfulness. Israel has failed to understand that in Christ God is fulfilling his faithfulness for Israel and the nations, and proudly seeks to hold on to pride of place and status. (Here, as elsewhere, Wright demonstrates his readiness to think disparagingly of a superseded Israel. It is disappointing). In Chapter 7, \\"Justification and the Church,\\" Wright calls for a recontextualization of the standard Christian salvation narrative within Paul's gospel. The popular view skews and distorts Paul's theology. A proper view of the Pauline gospel yields a proper view of justification, so that is where we must begin. He examines key passages in Galatians, Romans and Philippians, defending a different definition of the gospel and of justification than is normally discussed. This changes and clarifies how we understand Paul's corpus in general. For Paul, justification language is covenant language concerning God's covenant faithfulness. It is law-court language of the vindication of the accused, and has eschatological content and thrust. Chiefly, justification concerns how one tells someone is part of the people of God prior to the end of all things. It is more about ecclesiology than soteriology. God's righteousness intrinsic to himself is a moral quality, but for us, a verdict of acquittal from the bench. Paul sees people drawn to God by the Spirit through the preaching of the gospel, with faith being the badge God places upon such people indicating that they are His. This verdict is proleptic of the final judgment when the assessment of our lives will indicate if the verdict holds true. The gospel is not the message of justification by faith, but rather the proclamation of who came, why, what happened to him, and the difference it makes.In Chapter 8, Wright shows \\"that Paul held out to hearers, urged upon his converts, and did his best to maintain in his churches, the reality of God's renewed humanity which at every level and in every way proved to be the reality of which paganism was a parody, and at every level and in every way proved to be the fulfillment of Israel's aspirations\\" (150). Chapter 9 shows how the gospel creates the church, while justification defines it. In this chapter he summarizes Paul's gospel around three foci: The coming of the king, the meaning of justification, and the redefintion of God, suggesting how this could or should impact contemporary life. Such a gospel creates allegiance, not experience per se, although experience will come. Wright says the only experience guaranteed by Jesus is carrying the cross, but in this he forgets John 14:21 which promises the obedient disciple the manifestation of Messiah. And he points out that we are not justified by sound doctrine, and certainly not by believing in justification by faith, but rather by Messiah Jesus. Christians are commanded to bring their bodies into subjection, and if they are not going to live the gospel, they cannot expect that their preaching will be heeded. The Kingdom of God is not a matter of talk, but of power.In the final chapter, Chapter 10, using A. N. Wilson as his foil, Wright examines whether Paul was the real founder of Christianity. His verdict is \\"No,\\" refuting Wilson point by point. Ultimately, for Paul the resurrection of Jesus was the beginning of the end, and the cross was the moment when sin and death were defeated. Jesus and Paul are not ethically or spiritually parallel but rather two points on a continuum of God's eschatological purpose.This book is an indispensable primer in N. T. Wright's views on Paul and his theology. A mere 192 pages, and clearly written, it warrants more than one reading, as it lays out a holistic view of the work of God in Messiah in exciting and compelling terms.However, all is not well. Although Wright is likeable and worthy of deep respect, he will disappoint most Messianic Jewish readers because of his pervasive supersessionism of which he is himself likely only dimly aware. His views are skewed, and are either unsatisfactory or even objectionable for Jews. For example:* Wright emphasizes Jesus as King but fails to see or present him as the continuing King of Israel and the nations;* He sees Israel as elected for service and that is all: \\"Israel, clinging to her own special status as the covenant-bearer, has betrayed the purpose for which that covenant was made. It is as though the postman were to imagine that all the letters in his bag were intended for him\\" (108). This is appalling and insults the Jewish people, indicating that Wright sees her election as being solely for service, and showing himself to be a proponent of economic supersessionsm--viewing Israel as having served a now expired purpose, after which she should simply get out of the way. He gives no indication that God chose Israel not simply for his purposes, but out of everlasting love;* He sees Jesus as the replacement Israelite (127), rather than really as the representative Israelite in whom God's triumphant purposes for Israel go forward;* He contends that what Judaism expected God to do at the end of things, is done in the middle of things in Christ. Thus, all eschatology about Israel collapses into Christ;* He offensively parodies Judaism as a religion of blood, soil, race and tribe (137);* He redefines Israel, with the former definition of Israel expiring (138-139);* He repeatedly characterizes Judaism as \\"unbelieving Judaism.\\" This is offensive, implying that Jews without Jesus faith have no valid faith at all;* He seems to assume that the eschaton will result in an undifferentiated humanity, since he leaves no room for a special destiny for Israel qua Israel.Despite these glaring blind spots, there is much that Wright does see clearly, helping us to see these matters clearly as well. The blind spots justify the subtraction of one star. This book is well worth reading. I only hope I someday have the opportunity to remove the speck from Bishop Wright's eye."},{"Title":"What Saint Paul Really Said: Was Paul of Tarsus the Real Founder of Christianity?","review":"Without a doubt the letters of Paul have created plenty of doctrine and discussion in the Church, even in 2 Peter the writer mentions that Paul's letters contain some things that are hard to understand. N.T. Wright sets out to explore Paul again this time focusing on what he might have thought in a 1st century Jewish context. Overall this book was pretty interesting, it starts with a brief summary of the recent Pauline studies, and it gives plenty of places to go if someone wants to dig a little deeper. He ties Paul's zealous Pharisee thoughts to his new thoughts in Christ and how that defines his view of the Gospel which is Jesus is Lord. He also claims that neither Judaism nor later Paul's later Christian thought were a form of a Pelagian religion of self-help which might disappoint the people who don't actually read this book and assume that any difference in the idea of Justification in Faith Alone means that Wright is now advocating a new form of Pelagianism. (Although any mention of works will get the label of Semi-Plegianism thrown around, I never got the impression that he believes we're made righteous because of someone we do, at the same time does anyone truly believe that you can only have faith alone and live an antinomian lifestyle and still be saved in the end?)My favorite part of the book was the last true chapter(9) which is sort of an application chapter, focusing on changing the world, especially moving away from serving mammon and Aphrodite, and instead serving Jesus as Lord and moving towards \`the ecumenical task'. He quotes someone saying that \`One is not justified by faith in justification by faith'. I have to completely agree, I wonder what Paul would think had he seen the split this justification by faith has caused in the church for the past 500 years. Does anyone really think that Christian's who lived during the first 1500 years aren't really Christians because they didn't believe in Justification by Faith Alone as presented by the reformation? Is this doctrine really worth a lack of unity in the body of Christ which according to Paul was supposed to be one body, I don't think it is.The subtitle of this book is \`Was Paul of Tarsus the Real Founder of Christianity?' This question is briefly discussed in the last chapter of the book which was apparently added on after the book was completed, and it focuses on a book by A.N. Wilson. Its pointed out that Wilson has some pretty inventive ideas about Paul (some of which are completely off base), but in the decade plus since this book was published Wilson has returned to Christianity, I'm more interested in seeing him write his own critique of his Paul book."},{"Title":"What Saint Paul Really Said: Was Paul of Tarsus the Real Founder of Christianity?","review":"Ok, I admit my review title is silly but that is one thing this book is not.

As for the fellow who only gave him one star, come on cake-walker... I'm a conservative, reformed evangelical too but &quot;you gots to give Wright his props&quot;.Please don't dismiss Wright because he doesn't tow the party line!

Wright, whether it is his gigantic book on the Resurrection of Christ or his joint book with Stephen Neill on the history of New Testament scholarship. Wright comes through again in this smaller book. What is most striking--because it is so simple and elegant--is that Wright's common sense adherence to the Pauline texts is what enables him to escape the absurdities of so many other Pauline scholars. Wright fortunately makes clear what many an ordinary Christian would affirm in the face of generations of scholarly confusion: we are not saved by the doctrine of \\"justification\\" but rather by Jesus Christ who died for us and rose again. Wright demolishes the great Lutheran cul-de-sac of \\"justification\\" as the way Christians are saved. Instead, Wright argues that \\"justification\\" is more about ecclesiology, that is, about the community that results after we are saved by Messiah Jesus (see pp. 122,133). Remarkably, Wright's reworking of the much abused notions of \\"justification\\" and \\"righteousness,\\" reminds me of the insightful and passionate writings of Fr. Rainero Cantalamessa, the current preacher to the papal household, even though it must be said that their approaches do differ (see p. 164). It seems to me that Luther dropped the ball on justification. We are still recovering from the effects of that grand and highly influential diversion from Paul's real focus."},{"Title":"What Saint Paul Really Said: Was Paul of Tarsus the Real Founder of Christianity?","review":"I have a great deal of respect for N.T. Wright--he is a first rate scholar and a good writer to boot. I was trained in a Lutheran model of Pauline scholarship (heavy on the German Lutheran writers) so Wright and other Brits (especially the other \\"new Perspective\\" folks such James Dunn) are a welcome challenge and change of peace to my \\"default\\" was of thinking.The so-called, \\"new perspective\\" in Pauline scholarship has really stirred the anthill, so to speak. It used to be that for the past 450 years, Protestant scholarship has more or less conceded Paul to us Lutherans and our \\"imputed righteousness\\" focus. But for the past thirsty years or so, this \\"new perspective\\" has challenged us all to see that Paul may be about more than one thing and that maybe, just maybe, Luther didn't get it all right.I may not agree with everything that these \\"new Perspective\\" folks have to offer, but I think most of what they say is compelling and even convincing.I recently used this little volume to help teach laypeople about Paul-his life, ministry and his influence. The class loved this book and thought it was definitely worth recommending to others.This book would be helpful for pastors, students, church libraries and interested laypeople"},{"Title":"What Saint Paul Really Said: Was Paul of Tarsus the Real Founder of Christianity?","review":"This is the first book by N.T. Wright I have read and it was difficult to get my mind around. I am still working on it but the concepts taught by Mr. Wright are profound. Basically N.T. Wright begins with a thorough description of the beliefs of 1st Century Judaism. Wright then goes on to explain Paul's message in light of those beliefs. The book covers so much ground that it would be impossible in this review to explain all the ground covered. However, my take on his general message is that the reformation resulted in an over-reaction to abuses within Catholicism in the sixteenth century. That over-reaction continues to this day and colors the lense through which we read scripture. As such, we tend to view Romans and Galatians as a polemic against legalism, whereas, they are actually a polemic against some first century Jews who wished to exclude Gentiles on the basis of Torah observance. The demand for Torah observance simply would have made Christianity a sub-sect of the Jewish religion.Also, Wright does an in-depth explanation of the greek dikaos set of words (translated justify or righteous, depending on the context). Martin Luther understood the phrase \\"righteousness of God\\" grk (dikaiosune gar theou) in Romans 1:17 to mean that God transferred His own righteousness to believers. N.T. Wright challenges this belief, explaining that, rather than indicating a righteousness transferred to the believer, this phrase depicts God's righteousness or His determination to fulfill the covenant He made with Abraham in Genesis Ch. 15. This fulfillment occurred at the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ. Our faith in the God who raised Jesus from the dead denotes all who believe as the people of God. The effect of our inclusion is that God's covenant with Abraham has now been fulfilled; he has truly become \\"the father of many nations\\" fulfilling the covenant. My explanation is a simplification but I recommend that you buy the book. It will challenge your current understanding of \\"What St. Paul Really Said\\". The implication of Wright's teaching is a call to ecumenicalism. It finally relieves the tension between the cry of the reformists \\"sola fide\\" and what we all know that James wrote, \\"you see that a man is justified by works and not by faith alone\\". Wright concludes that those welcome at the table of fellowship are defined, not by their belief about how someone is justified but by their faith in Christ. Excellent book."},{"Title":"What Saint Paul Really Said: Was Paul of Tarsus the Real Founder of Christianity?","review":"Wright begins this book by examining many twentieth century scholars and listing their various understandings and views of how to interpret Paul. Some scholars believed that Paul was primarily Hellenistic in his thinking, while others believed that Paul was primarily Jewish with Wright himself falling in line with the latter. At the very end of this section, Wright argues that Ed P. Saunders has made vast grounds in the area of Pauline Scholarship over all other scholars. Saunders discovered that there was no proof within Judaism that there was a legalistic works-righteousness religion in New Testament time as commonly believed. Therefore, Paul was not attacking the idea that Jews believed they had to work their way into heaven, but instead the idea was that the law was the basis for knowing that one was within God's covenant. Grace was the basis for God's covenant, and the law was the means for staying within that covenant family. Therefore, those of the reformation have misunderstood Paul's teachings of justification and as a result, modern views of justification are the result of that misunderstanding.Several chapters later Wright delves into some interesting points. He believes that the term \\"gospel\\" has been misunderstood. He argues that in today's church, the term has come to describe a way of \\"how people get saved.\\" Although Wright is perfectly fine with that assessment, he does not feel that Paul had that concept in mind. Wright argues that Paul's use of the term gospel means that Jesus Christ has conquered all sin on the cross; he has been resurrected and as a result, a New Age has dawned. He was all along Israel's king, and is also the king and Lord over the whole world. Pagan deities are idols and God is the only real king. The God of Israel is now made known in and through Jesus himself. So basically it is an announcement answering, \\"Who is Lord?\\"The next doctrine that Wright examines is the doctrine of justification. Normally, Christians use the term justification as a term that reflects a legal act of God, whereby he declares the believer righteous. Wright, however, breaks it down into three categories: the first is covenant language, which means that the people of God would be vindicated from those persecuting them on the last day. It also functions as a verdict in the law-court by acquitting someone. It confers on that person the status of righteousness. The final category is eschatological, which seems similar to the first one. Nonetheless, at the end of history, this verdict will ultimately be made and believers in the present can anticipate vindication in the future. Wright believes that it was not Paul's agenda to argue about how one gets saved, but rather justification points to who is already within the group of believers. In books like Galatians, Paul's point is \\"how can we tell who are members of the covenant family?\\" For Paul, covenant membership is found in the gospel declaring that Jesus is Lord, not an account of how people get saved, which works to bring people into the family of Abraham. Justification insists that all those who have this faith belong as full members to this family on this basis and no other.Wright's understanding of justification stems from his translation of the phrase, \\"The righteousness from God,\\" (Rom 1:16-17; 3:23) which is vastly different from how Luther and the reformers understood it. Luther understood justification as a free gift given to men through Christ by God's grace, which was imputed to the unbeliever. Wright believes that \\"the righteousness of God.\\" refers to God's own faithfulness to his covenant promises. God in the past made some promises to Israel. Israel can trust God's promises. Wright believes that the reformers were right in arguing that justification had a legal sense to it, but he believes that they have misapplied it, for in the Hebrew Law Court, there were three parties, the judge, the plaintiff, and the defendant. Whenever the judge ruled in favor of the plaintiff, that person was righteous. It does not mean that the person is good, morally upright or virtuous. In the case of the defendant, he has been vindicated against the accuser. He is acquitted; it again does not mean that he was morally upright. He was simply vindicated.What this means is that in God's court, his righteousness is not transferred to the sinner. Instead, God keeps his promises to his covenant people, vindicating them as righteous. It is not something that is transferred to his people. Therefore, justification is covenantal language and only describes those who are part of the covenant. Thus, what the Judaizers were guilty of was not self-righteous or working their way into heaven but rather nationalistic pride and exclusivism. They wanted to argue that the only way to fit into God's covenant family was by observing the law. But Paul argued that since Christ came, all people can belong to God's covenantal family regardless of race. Faith in Christ is the means for all people to enter into that covenantal family, not just Jews.I appreciate the work of Wright because it makes one examine his/her own doctrine. It is quite possible that many of the ways the church views Paul's writings stem from the reformation time period as opposed to how a first century Jew would understand him. Books like these should not be viewed as negative simply because they disagree with how we normally look at things, but they should be welcomed and taken open mindedly with the hope of further understanding Paul.The major problem with the book is that the system that N.T. Wright proposes is undeveloped. There is not much going on here with regards to the atonement as it relates to the sinner. He does not really get into personal sins or guilt a lot; it is really not a concern of his. Wright's view of Philippians 3 is a little weird as well. Wright seems to re-write the entire verse with the end result being that righteousness equals covenant membership. I don't think that is the natural reading of the text. It seems to be the result of someone forcing a particular view upon a text.A verse that seems to contradict Wright's view point is Acts 13:38: \\"Through Christ the forgiveness of sins was proclaimed to you.\\" So the gospel does have an element of the forgiveness of sins within it. Then he equates justification with the forgiveness of sins. Several other verses such as Luke 18:9, state that the people Jesus was talking to viewed themselves as righteous and looked down on everyone else. In this parable, the tax collector asked for forgiveness of sins and was justified because of his humility. Those who are not humbled are brought down. Finally, Romans 1:16, clearly indicates that the gospel is clearly about salvation and Jesus being King. These are some issues that I would personally like to see addressed by N.T. Wright."},{"Title":"What Saint Paul Really Said: Was Paul of Tarsus the Real Founder of Christianity?","review":"Wow,In Some ways this might be one of the best-written books I have read. If you want to see just how good a communicator Wright is, read this book. That being said, I disagree with the central part of the book: justification by faith, more on that later.Wright completely undoes the liberal charge that Paul invented Christianity. He sees Paul, rightly, as establishing the proper continuity rightly proclaiming the victory of Jesus over the world, thus demonstrating to the principalities and powers of the world a new way of being human (181). However, Paul did not repeat everything Jesus said and did--that would contradict Jesus's role as Messiah.To understand Paul, according to Wright, one must understand his background into Shammiel Judaism. In short, pre-convert Saul trusted in God's kingdom to break into human history and overcome the whole world, by violence if necessary. He lived on passages such as Daniel 2, 7 and 9. Not only would pagans be put to shame but also compromising Jews as well (ie, Christians).However, upon conversion Paul continued to see the Kingdom of God overtaking the world but in a different way. Israel had failed to be a light to the world and now would face judgment. At the same time, Jesus by his death on the cross and vindication through resurrection, had indeed fulfilled what Israel failed to do. Most importantly, he had been liberated to serve God in a new way (37). If any were to be saved (more on that word later) they would have to submit to Jesus's way of being Israel. Paul saw himself as herald to the King, this Jesus to whom all the Caesars of this world owed their immediate allegiance.Paul accepted the Divinity of Jesus, according to Wright, but in a different way than phrased by most scholars, liberal or conservative. Paul took the Shema of Dt. 6--stating that God is one--and placed Jesus in the center of it (66). Of course, any Jew would easily see this as asserting that Jesus is the God in whom Israel would be redeemed. Moreover, the Spirit of Christ that is with his church in their gospel message is--to use theological language--the Holy Spirit.This was good news for the Pagans. Paul was not either/or Jewish or Hellenistic. He essentially Jewish who challenged by way of Parody the pagan worldview, a few examples being his critique of pagan creationism and power/empire. Unlike the pagans Paul denied the divinity of creation and asserted that since creation is from God it relfects God's beauty and goodness, allthewhile DENYING ITS DIVINITY. Paul's message challenged Caesar: Christ, not Tiberius is Lord and King. At the same time Paul offered a critique FROM WITHIN Judaism: it has failed to be Israel and is no different from the Pagans (82-83).Wright's next two chapters form the central and most controversial section of the book. Briefly stated, Wright is correct in defining dikaiosune theou and justification as legal terms but errs, in my opinion, in saying that they are appropriated through covenant. I really can't go into the disagreements here--that would be a monograph that perhaps needs to be written anyway.He further defines justification as the symbol by which one is known to be a member of the covenant community. Here is argument is the most controversial and in my opinion, falls short. Had his knowledge of Reformation and historical theology been broader than merely quoting Alister McGrath, then his thesis would have been stronger in this area by modifying it.Paul's ethic--if one wants to call it that--according to Wright, is worshipping God by being the renewed humanity. Such worship can only come from those who have surrendered their lives to the Lord Jesus Christ. We see this renewed humanity through worship, love, resurrection, mission, and Holiness.Wright ends his work by butchering infidel covenant-breaker Ian Wilson's badly written work on Paul. Wilson just rehashes liberal arguments and Wright roasts them over the fire.Final Analysis: Extremely well-written, provocative and engaging: Unfortunately, Wright's limited knowledge of historical theology and casual dismissal of Reformation thought call certain parts of his thesis into question, desperately in need of modification. BTW, the last pages of the book are worth the price of the boo."},{"Title":"What Saint Paul Really Said: Was Paul of Tarsus the Real Founder of Christianity?","review":"I am a avid fan of N.T. Wright's writings on the New Testament. He has proved himself to be an excellent source for a balanced and critical scholar who is not afraid to go against the grain. As we await the 3rd volume of Christian Origins, promised to be written about Paul, this is a decent foretaste. I enjoyed the book but gave it three stars for the following reasons. The title is really misleading. It was not so much about the answering the question present in the subtitle. He writes only his last chapter addressing this question in response to A.N. Wilson's popular, though flawed, biography of Paul. Secondly, I was disappointed in the amount of detail and comprehensiveness in the book. If you're a beginner in Pauline studies, I recommend this book highly. It discusses the main issues of Pauline studies concisely and clearly and points one to further studies. If you're anxious to read Wright's 3rd volume, you should wait a little longer. This book will disappoint you -- unless you're looking for a light weekend read."},{"Title":"What Saint Paul Really Said: Was Paul of Tarsus the Real Founder of Christianity?","review":"This book is a well written explanation and defense of the New Perspective on Paul. Wright breaks down Paul's theology in a way that makes sense of his background as a first century Jewish Pharisee. He indeed shows that Paul's theology is not a new faith as a mixture of Judaism with Hellinism, but rather it is Jewish to the core reshaped and redefined around Jesus of Nazareth, who showed himself to be the very face of Israel's God. I think he does a good job of demonstrating that Second Temple 1st century Judaism was not a religion of self-help morality, but rather it's obsession with the Law was more or less an ethnocentric way of keeping the covenant all to themselves.From all of this stems Wright's view on justification and the righteousness of God. As a North American Protestant/Evangelical, many of the people with whom I have discussed this issue completely reject and condemn it right from the beginning. But I don't see things that way. I believe that Wright's view of justification is a completely valid and biblical view to hold. And honestly I hold almost the same view of justification (I don't know all the intricacies of his view, therefore I say 'almost'). His basic argument is that justification in Paul's law-court language has nothing to do with how a person \\"gets saved\\" but rather is the declaration that a person \\"is already saved\\". He seems to distinguish between regeneration (the new birth) and justification (and rightfully so), however most Protestants, especially those of the Reformed tradition do not. To sum it up, Wright believes that justification is God's present declaration that someone is part of the covenant family in anticipation of the future declaration of vindication.From this issue, Wright tackles the issue of the righteousness of God. Most Protestants, especially Reformers hold to the doctrine of imputation. That is the actual righteousness of Jesus is somehow transferred to the believers \\"account\\". In light of Wright's defense of his view of justification imputation is simply not needed. It's not only not needed but there does not seem to be ample biblical support for the doctrine, which Wright demonstrates in the classic proof texts of the doctrine. Instead of the righteousness of God being something given to the believer, it is actual God's own righteousness, his justice towards his covenant. Wright defends this notion beautifully from historical 1st century Judaism and the Old Testament itself.I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"What Saint Paul Really Said: Was Paul of Tarsus the Real Founder of Christianity?","review":"S. Wuest, Evangelical, BA in Classical Languages and Literature, MSThere has been almost a phobia of history, among conservative Christians, because of the bizarre interpretations of the New Testament by liberals (starting with Schweitzer). This book shows that Christians have nothing to fear from historical studies.Wright is a 1st century historian, and an Anglican Christian. He refuses to prostitute his historical studies and evidence, to his theological beliefs. This is a breath of fresh air in modern Christian studies. Wright starts with the constraints of history that exist on all interpretational schemes for the New Testament, develops basic \\"vocabulary\\" in the sense of themes and meanings in 1st century culture and Judaism, then moves on to the development of theology which is fully integrated into this 1st century context. On fully historical and cultural grounds, Wright argues that the liberal conclusions on who Paul was, and where he got his theology, are implausible.Wright goes on to what Paul's theology meant in 1st century Jewish language, and the result may as well be a commentary on basic Paul's major theological writing in the New Testament (especially Romans), and the major vocabulary used in that writing (grace, salvation, justification, gospel).Wright has revolutionized the way that I read Paul...."},{"Title":"What Saint Paul Really Said: Was Paul of Tarsus the Real Founder of Christianity?","review":"I came to this book on purpose because I noticed that at least among my evangelical peers, there is a distinct preference for preaching from Pauline texts versus from Jesus' own \\"red letter\\" discourses. Critics who claim Paul as the true founder of Christianity have a strong case to make, at least so long as our preachers interpret Jesus in light of Paul's teaching (rather than the obvious inverse, interpreting Pauline texts as being subordinate to the Christ he preached.)\\"What Saint Paul Really Said\\" does a wonderful job at restoring a Christ centered understanding of Paul's epistles.Why not five stars? Wright overdraws his thesis (continuity of a Judaic-minded Kingdom of God into the New Testament writings) and in places stretches it pretty thin. In fact I agree with the thesis, but as it is developed one must temporarily ignore much of the \\"red letter\\" discourse (especially John 14-16.)I loved the book, however, and it has been an enormous influence on my reading of scripture."},{"Title":"What Saint Paul Really Said: Was Paul of Tarsus the Real Founder of Christianity?","review":"I was interested to understand what N. T. Wright had to say since he is so controversial. The first thing that struck me was his very obtuse style of communication. He really could cut out 50% of the repetitive jargon and cut to the chase. I'm thinking his is the British style.Some of his ideas regarding the Covenants are interesting i.e. Jesus initiated the new Covenant thereby restoring what paganism and Judaism were SUPPOSED to be. OK...I can go with that. But I sense a mite too much triumphalism is his theology. What...so very little text devoted to atonement, wrath, SIN? Odd. A large part of his thrust seems to be that Christians are to be devoted to taking back the world so it can be restored. Funny I thought restoration was God's job.And here's a clincher that something odd is up (pg. 158): \\"The Gospel creates, not a bunch of individual Christians, but a community. If you take the old route of putting justification, in its tradition meaning, at the center of your theology, you will always be in danger of sustaining some sort of individualism (wha????). This wasn't so much a problem in Augustine's or even in Luther's day, when society was much more bound together than it is now. But...individualism has been all the rage, with its current symbols of the personal radio and the privitization of everything, Tragically some...presentations of 'the gospel' have actually bought into this, by implying that one is justified or saved first and foremost as an individual. Paul's gospel could never do that...\\"Huh? The privitization of \\"everything\\" is considered to be a peril even while the State grows larger and larger? Methinks Wright's socialism is creeping into his theology. Look out, boys and girls...we definitely have a very strange teaching blurring the truth when it is depicted as a BAD thing to consider salvation or justificaton \\"foremost\\" as an individual. Very odd dynamics indeed."},{"Title":"What Saint Paul Really Said: Was Paul of Tarsus the Real Founder of Christianity?","review":"N.T. Wright is one of the leading voices within New Testament scholarship today. Wright taught New Testament studies for twenty years at Cambridge, McGill, and Oxford Universities. He has recently been appointed a Chair in New Testament and Early Christianity at St. Andrews, Scotland.Wright, a prolific author, has written over thirty books, including both scholarly and popular works. His major academic series Christian Origins and the Question of God is making no small contribution to New Testament studies. There are six proposed volumes in this series. The fourth volume is anticipated as being Wright's magnum opus on Paul.Along the way in constructing his magisterial work on Paul, Wright has written several books that reflect his long admiration and journey into the mind of the Apostle, and he does so with a commitment and concern for interpreting Paul within his first-century context.In his book, What Saint Paul Really Said: Was Paul of Tarsus the Real Founder of Christianity?, the preeminent British scholar gives a devastating but humble critique of the view that Paul is the force at work behind Christianity.[1]Wright sets out to prove that there is certainly not a parallelism with Jesus and Paul, but there is an \\"appropriate continuity\\" between the two (181).Wright begins his presentation with a brief review of Pauline scholarship in the twentieth century. Although Wright doesn't agree with all of his views, he especially finds Albert Schweitzer's four questions concerning Pauline studies a \\"benchmark for subsequent study\\" (14). The book is arranged according to the questions that deal with history, theology, exegesis, and application.Rooting the historical \`Saul of Tarsus' within the radical wing of Shammaite Pharisaism, Wright sets the stage for some sort of dramatic encounter that converts Saul the persecutor into Paul the preacher. Wright is concerned to show that Paul never leaves his \\"home base of Jewish monotheism\\" (63).This may be an appropriate summation of how Wright's so-called \\"new perspective\\" is sustained throughout this book and his life's work on Paul. It is what Wright has in mind as he interprets Paul's use of \\"righteousness\\" and \\"justification\\" within his letters, particularly the epistle to the Romans.There will no doubt be some scholars, pastors, and teachers that will find it most offensive that Wright admonishes his readers to \\"repent of the ways we have mishandled\\" Paul down through the years. He declares that it is time to \\"study Paul in his own terms\\" (23).Wright definitely does not mince with words. His passion for his subject and his conviction born out of his in-depth study of Paul is commendable. For the most part, Wright's exegetical honesty and his refreshing humility come through in his writing and potentially make allowances for his bold rhetoric.However, it could be said that he rushes to conclude that he is the only scholar concerned with interpreting Paul within Second-Temple Judaism. Wright accuses Wayne Meeks and Hans-Dieter Betz as being secretive about an agenda that has Paul deriving his central concepts from the pagan world (77).The reader could hear Wright say that any sort of interaction with first-century paganism in Paul's thinking is headed for trouble. Yet, a few pages later, Wright allows for Paul to adopt pagan concepts to express gospel truth (81). A little clarity might resolve what appears to be a touch of contradiction.The real firestorm of current debate seems to be between those who resonate with Wright's interpretations and those who have committed themselves to the sixteenth century reformed view of Paul and his theology. The center of the controversy, and what many reformed scholars take issue with, is articulated in chapters 6 and 7 in this book. Wright says the Reformers were reading their personal problems with the medieval church into Paul--instead of reading Paul through the lens of Second-Temple Judaism. This has those committed to reformed theology gagging at Wright's Pauline-pudding.Wright redefines Paul's use of \\"righteousness\\" and \\"justification.\\" Wright has been most outspoken that \\"righteousness\\" in Paul has little to nothing to do with \\"moral quality\\" and everything to do with God's covenant faithfulness and the \\"status\\" of those who stand before the Maker of that covenant in the heavenly law court.Wright says it has always been about faithfulness to the covenant, not about imputing moral goodness. Faithfulness to the law and covenant was never about achieving salvation through ethical living---it was about identifying with God's divine program. The cosmic judge does not give his goodness to the accused, he pronounces the status of \\"righteous\\" (i.e. covenant faithfulness) to those whom he has set free. Wright doesn't deny some sort of imputation of moral goodness, just that Paul isn't thinking of it with his employment of the biblical law court metaphor.Paul's use of \\"justification\\" follows in this covenantal reading to mark off those who are already included in the covenant of God. Wright says that \\"justification\\" is not how someone becomes a Christian, it is a declaration that they have already become a Christian (125). He says that there is so much to be said on what Paul meant by justification that it could easily occupy another book.[2]It is rather difficult to criticize Wright's re-interpretations of Paul when it appears to be consistent with recent scholarship on Paul within Second-Temple Judaism.For Wright, a covenantal reading of Paul accentuates his entire message as it brings all elements of his thought together. Wright convincingly presents Paul as the zealous Pharisee who met Jesus on the road to Damascus, interpreted Jesus within Second-Temple Judaism, and still has a message for the world today.In the last two chapters of the book, Wright attempts to make application to the church today. It is at this point where his conclusions are less than satisfying. He draws clear lines of distinctions between the factions within pagan life and the agape community that is to be found within the church (147).He even points out the problems between Christian denominations and the task that lay ahead as believers bridge denominational divides (158), but he doesn't seem willing to remove those glaring divisions called \`denominations' within the Body of Christ. It begs the question: \\"Is there a respected scholar that is willing to consider that celebrating our differences by congregating with those like us does not allow for true ecumenism?\\"Finally, Wright rightfully states that it is a \\"matter of urgency\\" (157) for the gospel to confront the realm of worldly politics. Wright says part of the mission of the church is to proclaim Christ's rule over Caesar. What does that look like in the age of presidents and prime ministers that have yet to deify themselves? There is a diametric difference in proclaiming the gospel to politics and proclaiming the gospel through politics. Maybe Christ's claims over us and his world speak the loudest when Caesar is truly seen as a parody not to be reckoned with in every age.Overall, this book is so far the most readable of Wright's books on Paul. If you have been wondering what all the fuss is about with Wright and his controversial views of the historical Paul of Tarsus who lived and died within Second-Temple Judaism, I highly recommend reading What Saint Paul Really Said.The serious student of Paul should consider the claims that N.T. Wright makes in this wonderful treatment of the biblical text.Is Paul of Tarsus the founder of Christianity? Did Paul invent Christianity? Wright says that Jesus went to his death clearly believing he was the culmination of Israel's history. The resurrection vindicates Jesus and substantiates Christ's claims.Paul meets the resurrected Jesus while on his zealous way to opposing those who are unfaithful to the covenant. After meeting the resurrected Jesus, Paul believes his vocation is to announce the gospel to the whole world. Paul's gospel is that Jesus of Nazareth is the promised Messiah and Lord of the cosmos!Paul believes that in Jesus... the new age has already begun.[1] A.N. Wilson, Paul: The Mind of the Apostle, New York: Norton, 1997.[2] N.T. Wright, Justification: God's Plan and Paul's Vision, Downers Grove: InterVarsity Press, 2009."},{"Title":"What Saint Paul Really Said: Was Paul of Tarsus the Real Founder of Christianity?","review":"Tom Wright is at the forefront of Pauline scholarship as well as studies on Jesus. His historical instincts, engagement with primary sources and 'big picture' exegesis have led him to a fresh reading of Paul in the historical context of the Graeco-Roman-Jewish world of the 1st century. The outcome is a breathtaking view of the Gospel as understood and preached by Paul to a world dominated by the Roman imperial cult, pagan idolatry, Greek wisdoms and Jewish Messianic hopes. It is in such a world, Wright argues, where Paul does his business and his writings can best be understood against this background. This means that the popular, truncated notion of the gospel as a timeless system of salvation that will 'save our souls' and 'get us to heaven after we die' would have to be jettisoned in favour of the gospel that announces God's reign that has been inaugurated here on earth in the person of Jesus the Messiah. This means that the gospel has a much larger scope (indeed cosmic) than the private relationship one has with God or the eternal destiny of the individual souls. Rather, it speaks of God's faithfulness to the world he has made and how through the covenant relationships with his people, he will set the world aright - culminating in the new heavens and the new earth. This way of reading Paul would require a paradigm shift for Christians who have got used to reading the NT through the 'works righteousness vs salvation by grace' debates that have coloured our reading of Paul since Augustine. Hence, the evident unsettling of some readers. Wright's proposal, while we do not have to agree with every fine point of his exegesis , has the huge edge over the traditional reading for taking the historical setting far more seriously and in so doing invites us to hear Paul afresh as he announces the good news in all its ramifications.I've found this book to be a great primer to Wright's other more extensive treatments of Paul in many of his other works, including 'Paul for Everyone' commentaries, 'Paul in Fresh Perspectives' and 'Climax of the Covenant' - listed in ascending order of profundity. I recommend it to anyone who is open to letting his reading of Paul be challenged by one of the most respected NT scholars of our day."},{"Title":"What Saint Paul Really Said: Was Paul of Tarsus the Real Founder of Christianity?","review":"For almost 500 years, Protestants and Catholics have been locked into a debate on \\"what Paul really said,\\" especially in how it relates to justification. For over 100 years, scholars have been attempting to reinterpret \\"what Paul really said\\" with wildly divergent results, most of which have more to do with their personal ideologies than the thought of the Apostle. In this short book, N.T. Wright attempts to show that all of this study and debate doesn't really address \\"what Paul really said.\\"N.T. Wright is a prominent proponent of the \\"New Perspective on Paul\\" which was pioneered by E.P. Sanders. Those who wish to get an overview of that movement would do well to start with this book. Wright is eminently readable even when discussing finer theological details. What he does extremely well is describe Paul's thoughts before his conversion on the road to Damascus. This is the key to understanding Paul, for if you read him carefully, you will see that he views his newfound belief in Christ as the fulfillment of his previous beliefs, not their complete repudiation. The death and resurrection of Christ, for Paul, is the unexpected way in which God vindicates Israel. Instead of it being a political victory over the world, instead it is a victory of a perfect representative over sin and death. Understanding this background has far-reaching consequences, especially regarding the view that Paul was an over-scrupulous believer in salvation by works before his conversion (a common view coming out of the Protestant Reformation); a view that falls into disarray when one understands Paul's true background.Wright also goes into some detail regarding Paul's view of the \\"righteousness of God.\\" Without going into too much detail here, he shows how Paul's Jewish background calls into question the common view that this righteousness of God can be imputed or transmitted to the believer. This is the section in which I wish Wright had gone into more detail. He obviously wanted to keep this book short and accessible, but in this case it would have been worthwhile to go into more depth, as his arguments are not comprehensive.For any student of St. Paul, this is a must read. Even if you don't agree with his conclusions, Wright forces you to address the issues he raises."},{"Title":"What Saint Paul Really Said: Was Paul of Tarsus the Real Founder of Christianity?","review":"I groaned when a fellow Eastern Orthodox Christian, a former Protestant, lent me this book. Reading it, however, I became hooked; I was more than pleasantly surprised. NT Wright's \\"daring\\" view of St. Paul is old hat, or should be, to Orthodox Christians, but it's still refreshing and illuminating to read what he has to say, even if the Church (the Orthodox Church) would find nothing very new in it. The only question that remains is--why shouldn't Wright, now an Anglican bishop, make the jump to Orthodoxy? His ecclesiastical messmates, as it were, are not even sure of Christ's divinity, so one wonders when Bishop Wright will make himself honest, or at least put himself in like-minded company. In any case, this work is highly recommended."},{"Title":"What Saint Paul Really Said: Was Paul of Tarsus the Real Founder of Christianity?","review":"Taking a note from the Barth/Brunner debate a century ago, N.T. Wright has challenged A.N. Wilson's assertion in another book to formulate this book (although the Wright/Wilson controversy will unlikely produce the same long-lasting theological impact that Barth/Brunner did). Still it is an interesting dialogue spanning different books and articles now. Wilson made the historical assertion that Paul was the real founder of Christianity. There are many historians and biblical scholars who would agree with Wilson, in whole or in part. Certainly the Christianity that we have today is influenced by the writings of Paul. However, is our current interpretation of Paul's writing in accord with what he would have wanted?With regard to that idea, Wright states that 'His [Paul's] fate in this century has been not unlike his fate in his own day. Nobody who wants to think about Christianity can ignore him; but they can, and do, abuse him, misunderstand him, impose their own categories on him, come to him with the wrong questions and wonder why he doesn't give a clear answer, and shamelessly borrow material from him to fit into other schemes of which he would not have approved.' Wright highlights the riot in Ephesus of showing that, with regard to Paul, there is often a lot of sound and fury, but we're not always sure what it signifies. Wright traces the different ways in which major thinkers of the twentieth century have portrayed Paul - Schweitzer, Bultmann, Davies, Kasemann, and Sanders primarily. He also develops the framework of the key questions to be asked - these deal with history, theology, exegesis and practical application.Saul/Paul considered himself a Pharisee, but even this group wasn't the monolithic community as it is often portrayed (any more than saying someone is a Protestant Christian can give you much more than the broadest of categorial information). Wright argues that Paul is a messianic believer who sees in Jesus a four-fold 'gospel', not one that is salvific in the modern Christian of 'how one gets saved' as an individual task, but rather as communal call that recognises Jesus (particularly his death on the cross and resurrection) is the long-awaited Messiah of Israel and the true king of the world. Paul's identification of Jesus with God was, for Paul, good news for Jews and Gentiles both.For Paul, according to Wright, 'the \\"gospel\\" creates the church; \\"justification\\" defines it.' By justification, Wright says this is 'the doctrine which declares that whoever believes that gospel, and wherever or whenever they believe it, those people are truly members of his family, no matter where they came from, what colour their skin may be, whatever else might distinguish them from each other.' Paul takes the idea of covenant seriously, bringing about community, which is the locus of the church, and the arena for justification. However, this is not the final end - Wright quotes Richard Hooker here, who stated, 'One is not justified by faith by believing in justification by faith.'Wright then returns to the claim against Wilson that Paul was not the 'founder' of Christianity - 'Jesus believed it was his vocation to bring Israel's history to its climax. Paul believed that Jesus had succeeded in that aim.' Jesus was the first and focal point, and Paul was acting in accordance with what that experience and revelation had to say, according to Wright.Wright is a careful scholar, skilled in the tools of modern scholarship but distrustful of certain enterprises such as some of the Jesus Seminar applications, and certainly not in the post-modern camp of deconstruction of all metanarratives and paradigms for meaning and understanding. Indeed, Wright argues that what Paul has to offer is a counter to this kind of deconstructionist nihilism.This is a worthy text in the ongoing development of biblical scholarship."},{"Title":"What Saint Paul Really Said: Was Paul of Tarsus the Real Founder of Christianity?","review":"In a relatively short and easily readable book, N.T. Wright deals in a very systematic way with Pauline Theology, doctrine of Justification, and the Gospel. For the first time, I feel I am reading a book that is explaining to me in a rational way, what I have always believed in my heart, but could not explain it. All of a sudden Jesus is making sense to me in my mind, as I have always felt Him in my heart. I believe the scholarly world in in-debted to N.T. Wright for his Godly effort, and beautiful articulation of a very controversial topic. A must read for serious students of Christianity!"},{"Title":"What Saint Paul Really Said: Was Paul of Tarsus the Real Founder of Christianity?","review":"This book is a popular overview of the work that Wright has done on Paul up to his point (97'). Of course, Wright is a well known advocate of the new perspective on Paul. He is a regular whipping boy for many Calvinists. In reading this book, I have found that N.T. Wright is regularly either misunderstood, or misrepresented. This was a fun book to read, as Wright's theology reads like prose, although I do not recommend it to anyone who doesn't have a firm grasp on the doctrine of justification, or who is unaware of the surrounding controversy. Wright is a biblical theologian and historian through and through. He is well-read in the 1st century sources and Second Temple Judaism. He is a big picture guy for sure. Much of Wright's exegesis is insightful and stimulating, but at places one is left scratching his head as to how he is coming to his conclusions (cf. Rom. 7, Phil 3, 2 Cor 5.21). For the many good things that could be said about this book, I will focus on a few negatives. Wright wants to separate the gospel, and the doctrine of justification more that the Apostle does. In fact, Wright redefines the term justification, along with works of the law, and the righteousness of God (he considers Sander's proposal as established). This has obvious implications for the reformation doctrine of sola fide. On imputation, he writes \\"If we use the language of the law court, it makes no sense whatever to say that the judge imputes, imparts, bequeaths, conveys or otherwise transfers his righteousness to either the plaintiff or the defendant. Righteousness is not an object, a substance or a gas which can be passed across the courtroom.\\" He redefines the righteousness of God as his covenant faithfulness. In my opinion he is unfair to the best of the reformation, and reductionistic at many points. I appreciate Wright's emphasis on Christ's resurrection as thou roughly eschatalogical. Many Calvinists have accused Wright of having ecumenical motives, which seems to me to be unfair. His conclusions are no doubt ecumenical (even calling the doctrine of justification the great ecumenical doctrine), but I truly believe that Wright's honest aim is to be faithful to the text. He just so happens to get fuzzy on the gospel in the meantime, limiting it to 'Jesus is Lord.' He overreacts to Western individualism (even found in Reformed circles) but doesn't do justice to Paul in the meant time. See Richard Gaffin's book \\"By Faith Not By Sight\\" for a refutation of such thinking. I think we have much to learn from Bishop Wright, but still think the Reformers had it right.\\"As far as Paul was concerned, the most important eschatological event, through which the living God had unveiled (or, if you like, 'apocalypsed') his plan to save the whole cosmos, had occurred when Jesus rose from the dead. He wasn't just living in the last days. He was living in the first days--of a whole new world order.\\" 50"},{"Title":"What Saint Paul Really Said: Was Paul of Tarsus the Real Founder of Christianity?","review":"My view of Paul was starting to lean this way before I read this book.

Just to simply say 'compiled from classical Ottoman Turkish souces' is simply not good enough. What Ottoman Turkish souces? Cevet Pasha? Suleyman Chelebi? While Martin Lings clearly states where he has taken his source material there is neither footnote nor bibliography for further reading. This is a great pity as it greatly decreases the value of this book especially as Islam has a tradition of scrupulously stating all sources. If one was to quote this work in a University paper for example, it would most likely be rejected as it does not quote any source.Thankfully, the history books of Tabari have all been translated into English as has the work of ibn Ishaq, the Nahjat of Imam Ali, the first 4 books of the Bidayat of ibn Kathir, the al-Kafi and most of the books of traditions of Sunni Islam (Bukhari, Muslim, Abu Dawud etc) so the English speaker has access to some original sources.The book contains details of the birth of the Prophet and events surrounding his birth and the Isra and Miraj introducing new material that many people may not be aware of (another important reason that the sources needed to be stated)it is unfortunate as this book could have been a very valuable work and probably still is but due to it's lack of any sources it is more likely to cause more debate and controversy than anything else.The lack of index is also a problem.Sorry to sound so negative but if only for the above reasons this could have been one of the most important books on the life of the Prophet Muhamamd in the English language."},{"Title":"Muhammad: The Messenger of Islam","review":"I purchased this book without reading the 1-star reviews- BIG MISTAKE.

Some of our cases involve members of the Islamic faith, many of whom are first or second generation Americans. This book has helped me better understand how their normally peaceful religion has been hijacked into what we see today, with a heavy discrimination against women and people outside the Islamic faith. According to this biography, Muhammad taught religious tolerance and respect for all God's creatures, and he held eminent respect for women, included them in important work and often consulted them. I enjoyed the book immensely, but more than this I found a deeper appreciation for one of the world religions that is so little understood here in the US."},{"Title":"Muhammad: The Messenger of Islam","review":"This book is one which was written for one main purpose which is to increase the love of the Prophet (saws) in the hearts of whoever reads it. If it is read for that purpose this book is rivaled only by the Shifa of Qadi Iyad. I honestly was brought to tears almost every time I read this book and I think if you can read this whole book with dry eyes you need to check your pulse.On the negative side I thought that far too much time was spent on certain subjects while others were virtually ignored. An example is that over 100 pages was spent on the mi'raj. This was an important event and the source used for this section was very good, but I think that it would have been much more beneficial to publish a commentary on the Dalail al-Khayrat separately rather than bogging down the book with minute details of the event. The book is also a little slow getting started and I originally had trouble getting into it. The lack of a index was also a glaring and annoying omission that caused me to waste lots of time flipping through pages. Finally, this book is not for those who are looking for an account based on modern ideas of historical accuracy. The author unashamedly uses weak reports which is an accepted practice by muslim scholars, but is not considered valid by orientalists.If you accept this book as the devotional piece that it is then it will exceed your expectations.

If you have the patience, his work will never fail to amaze you with the new light refracted from a jewel you had convinced yourself you'd seen from all conceivable angles. He deals in foundations, and any modernist or self-proclaimed secular skeptic or atheist must grapple with his presentations of the Primordial Tradition. This book is a diverse and gripping introduction to his work and incredible mind."},{"Title":"The Eye of the Heart: Metaphysics, Cosmology, Spiritual Life (Library of Traditional Wisdom)","review":"The image of seeing with the heart is a powerful symbolism found in many spiritual traditions. It combines a lofty and &quot;abstract&quot; element with one that is profound and &quot;concrete,&quot; encompassing the highest as well as the deepest faculties of man. But Schuon is above all a realist, and thus the horizontal plane of what is human-and even all too human-necessarily finds an important place in his writings.This book brings together some of his earliest articles with the last of those belonging to his metaphysical prose works. Among the latter, &quot;Between East and West&quot; is a particularly interesting description of the flaws as well as the positive characteristics of the &quot;average mentality&quot; found among modern Orientals and Occidentals and their spiritual consequences. In a general way, Easterners are more sensitive to the symbolism or the spiritual intention of things than to the &quot;objective facts&quot; which are more convincing for Westerners. Schuon sets forth with precision and finesse how this contrast or oscillation between &quot;faith&quot; and &quot;reason&quot; shows itself not only among different groups of humanity but also within our individual souls.One of the singular features of Schuon's perspective-and of a jnanic viewpoint in general-is the absence of a denominational zeal that wishes to convert or a moralizing approach that tends to elevate a particular human style to the level of a goal in itself. Whether one experiences this as a shock or as a relief, Schuon unwaveringly looks at the essential nature of things in all their degrees and modalities. And the immutable reference point is always the sense of the sacred. Reality is sacred, therefore man is a theophany or he lives below himself-in his thoughts, in his actions, in his sentiments and imagination: &quot;...What is \`true' is what opens the door towards the Truth at once transcendent and immanent... There is the symbol and there is the \`fact': now the understood symbol is worth infinitely more than the misunderstood fact.&quot;It is striking to find the same &quot;faith-reason&quot; or &quot;symbol-fact&quot; polarity in the chapter &quot;Intellectuality and Civilization,&quot; written in the 1940's, at the beginning of the Schuon opus. Everyone can agree that intelligence is preferable to stupidity, just as truth is superior to error and illusion. The difficulty is that the modern definition of intelligence tends to limit it, either by specializing it into a kind of cerebral virtuosity or by flattening it into mere reason or, worse yet, the infra-reason of existentialism. Thus, as Schuon points out, to its great harm, today's culture ignores the cosmic laws that have always governed humanity. It replaces them with either an &quot;idealism&quot; or a &quot;realism,&quot; both misconceived. &quot;The first will always be above collective human possibilities, and the second altogether below them.&quot;Modern man suffers both individually and collectively from the pervasive illness of relativism. Then, precisely because of his malady, he bitterly rails against centuries of saints, sages and pious men before him. The rejection of the religious traditions goes hand in hand with the loss of what Schuon terms &quot;integral intelligence,&quot; one that is proportioned to total Truth, which is necessarily eternal and spiritual. To read Schuon is to be reminded that this total Truth is always at hand, for those who seek it with the eye of the heart."},{"Title":"The Eye of the Heart: Metaphysics, Cosmology, Spiritual Life (Library of Traditional Wisdom)","review":"_Without a doubt Schuon Knows what he is talking about. He obviously has the intellectual grasp of the eternal truths of the perennial philosophy. It is rather inaccessible to the outsider however. I am almost inclined to believe that you already have to have grasped inner Knowing yourself, before his explanations become clear. It is like he is writing to make himself understandable to the conventional rationalist philosopher or theologian. Why bother- they have failed._The core essay of this book expresses the perennial truth that the Eye of the Heart both sees all things and is how we truly know all things. To this end the brain is merely a secondary and not essential organ. It, and rational thought, may support our Knowing and Connection, but it will never be the cause of it. It is a lesser tool for a lesser world. The Eye of the Heart is that two-way lens by which we Know the Creator, and by which the Creator Knows us. It is our center by which we are joined by the vertical spiritual axis with our Source._Schuon mentions that we will probably never know whether there is a historical connection between the \\"Eye of the Heart\\" teachings of Plotinian Doctrine, Augustinian Doctrine, and Sufic Doctrine. He also points out that it is unimportant. This is part of the perennial philosophy, the golden chain that has always existed. Who received it first is irrelevant. It predated all three schools._In his perceptive introduction Huston Smith admits that at first he found Schuon to be somewhat difficult to penetrate- but he persisted. He also reminds us of that apt statement from _The Cloud of Unknowing_: \\"The point that I am making is correct, but if you cannot grasp it, then let it be, until God himself helps you to understand.\\"_If this book appeals to you, then you might like to attempt the more complete exposition in the author's _Survey of Metaphysics and Esoterism_."},{"Title":"The Eye of the Heart: Metaphysics, Cosmology, Spiritual Life (Library of Traditional Wisdom)","review":"Schuon is the most significant and valuable sage for these technological, polluted, hedonistic, perverse, arrogant and narcotic times. Of course reading Plato, Plotinus and other classic sages is very useful for spiritual growing, but Schuon is a sage that has experienced the ugliness and perversity of humanism and modern times. This means that he has had to suffer and overcome a darkness that those antique sages never had to face. I have never read a critique of the modern world as clear, just and precise as that of Schuon. Anyhow, the most valuable part of his oeuvre is his metaphysics and his guidance to spiritual growth under the awful pressures exerted by contemporary madness. I have read his books once, twice, thrice and, Deo juvante et volente, I will read them more and more times. I think that his living along the despicable twentieth century is but a manifestation of the reality of the divine law of compensation."},{"Title":"Where on Earth: A Geografunny Guide to the Globe","review":"If you're looking for the perfect geography overview for elementary students, even those who are bored, fussy, or non-spatial learners, this is the best you'll ever find.

Once Maltz and Carol Marcus were gone (I'm not even going to whine about Saavik not being in this story!), then it should have ended nicely.This novel seems very forced! \\"Let's mix in all the characters that were introduced in the earlier books, so we can call it Genesis!\\" There is NO EXCITEMENT and NO INTERESTING SUBPLOTS. I skipped through most of the story to only see how Picard's team handled this new adventure.Save your money, folks!

In this process they encounter a culture that has decided to preserve themselves in their orbital transporter network.Tim Russ (Voyager's Tuvok) does an excellent job of portraying the full gauntlet of characters ranging from the out-of-favor scientist turned savior to the planet's genetically-perfect ruler to Worf and the Klingons.The story brings back a few now-older characters like Worf's son Alexander and Jeremy (the kid that Worf took under his wing because he lead the away team that resulted in his mother's death). Both have ended up serving under Worf on the Klingon ship (Jeremy apparently through some sort of Federation exchange program). Unfortunately, the rest of the enterprise crew play a very minor role in the whole saga.The story begins to pick up when the now-destroyed and supposedly lifeless planet appears to have life on it; moreover this life form seems to be able to shape-shift and nearly convinces the colonists to begin coming down in droves before the Klingons discover that the life forms are not what they appear.The Klingons want to put everything on hold until they can figure out the mystery of the planet. In the interim, however, another mystery (which becomes Alexander's challenge) is formed when the planet's leader is killed and the heir-apparent and scientist-savior are the two leading suspects.The colonists are not willing to wait (with the transporter systems failing and afraid of loosing lives) and begin a process that is supposed to re-terraform the planet. However, what they don't know apparently can hurt them and does."},{"Title":"Star Trek:The Next Generation : Genesis Force","review":"It is amazing tale of how two very different scientific phenomenon come together to produce the story of Genesis Force. The first is the Genesis Force itself, which we first saw in the Original Star Trek Series, and anyone who follows the Trek series know this creates life from nothing. When it hits planet after planet where there is life, it destroys. Who unleashed this terrible force?The Federation is looking into putting a stop to the Genesis Force doing any more damage while the Klingons go to the planet to try to help. In attempting to do so, they come up against a race whose scientific community wants to change the way their planet is ruled. So along with trying to reestablish life on the planet, they are up against a governmental overthrow.The characters are very colorful from the ruling family to the Klingons and right down to the young scoundrel that ends up being the ruler of the new world as the story comes to an end. It tells of the murder of the ruler and the creatures created by the Genesis Force as well as the atmospheric conditions that must be fought in order to regain control of the planet and make it habitable again. There is even time in the book for a bit of a love interest between Geordi and Lea Brahms who we have seen in earlier stories of Star Trek. In the final attempt by the scientific community to create the same wonderful place they had before Genesis Force, they unleash a new force into the atmosphere on their devastated planet. The result is anything but what they wanted to create.Tim Russ is the reader of this audio book. He reads the story with the fervor that only a person who has actually been a part of the Star Trek Series could give the book. He is able to inflect the words almost as perfectly as the character that played the original role. This is a must have for any Star Trek fan."},{"Title":"Star Trek:The Next Generation : Genesis Force","review":"There is good science fiction out there. There are good Trek novels. This isn't them. This was awful.It started out interestingly enough. The author explores in depth a number of characters on an non-Federation planet. We see a new culture, and new people. But even here there are a lot of missed opportunities. The culture is not delved into; we see few differences in culture other than what you might find on earth. Indeed, this culture is about as different from 20th century American culture as 20th century England is. It is written like a TOS episode, without a great deal of imagination.The book goes downhill from there. There are few explanations for the events which follow. Characters are not believable, and amazingly flat. I have no idea why most of them did what they did. The Enterprise shows up at the last second, and I think saves the day, but there was no point to include them, other than that this is a Star Trek novel. There are scenes of amazing gruesomeness, which one does not usually find in a Trek novel or show- and there is no point to their inclusion. Except perhaps to claim to be cutting edge by being gruesome. I'm reading this novel, thinking that there are only about ten pages left- how are they going to satisfactorily resolve everything? Sure enough, they resolve everything- and it's anything but satisfactory. It's like there was a page limit, and the author realized that there were only ten pages to finish up the story, so lets come up with any old way to fix things.The first half of the novel is in-depth; the second half rushed and confusing.
