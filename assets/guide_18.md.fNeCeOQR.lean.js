If you are a Catholic on the other hand, it is well worth the read. It can add to your understanding of Catholic beliefs. It also gives a good history of how the church developed and evolved. I would reccomend this book to read if you are seeking answers to the questions of why do we do this."},{"Title":"Catholic and Christian: An Explanation of Commonly Misunderstood Catholic Beliefs","review":"This book needs a serious revision.

Rom. 3:24-26, 28; 4:5; 11:6; Eph. 2:8-9; Titus 3:5; Gal. 2:16Salvation conditional on man's faithfulness .......

Best overall explanation of misunderstood beliefs about the church I have read. Both Catholics and non-Catholics will benefit from this read. When I explain to my family and friends my reasons for converting, I usually refer to this book."},{"Title":"Catholic and Christian: An Explanation of Commonly Misunderstood Catholic Beliefs","review":"The author skillfully blends theology and history to demonstrate Catholicism's sound rational basis and validity. The book is somewhere in between an overview for beginners and a scholarly analysis for experts. It provides a wealth of information on what and why Catholics believe. Catholic readers may especially enjoy the \\"why\\" information; for example how bishops developed into the role they have today starting all the way back in second century. Non-Catholic readers will find clarification on many serious misconceptions about the faith, including issues relating to Mary, papal infallibility, celibacy, and Sacraments. Easy to read, balanced, containing a healthy number of Biblical citations and historical references, the book will help just about everyone advance their understanding of Catholicism."},{"Title":"Catholic and Christian: An Explanation of Commonly Misunderstood Catholic Beliefs","review":"AS others have said, this book is an explanatory book, not a book to convert people. It explains Catholic dogma clearly, concisely, and charitably. It is written by a very able philosopher/theologian and is highly reccomended."},{"Title":"Catholic and Christian: An Explanation of Commonly Misunderstood Catholic Beliefs","review":"I was given this book by a priest while in the process of converting to Catholicism. It was exceptionally helpful in understanding the basic teachings of the Church, and explains Catholic beliefs in such a way that even those with no background in Church teaching can understand them. I have used it numerous times since my conversion as a resource in conversations with non-Catholic friends."},{"Title":"Catholic and Christian: An Explanation of Commonly Misunderstood Catholic Beliefs","review":"If you want to know what Catholics believe don't ask your Orthodox priest or Protestant minister .... go to the source and read what the Catholic church has to say. Alan Schreck is a professor of Theology at a Franciscan University in the US. Additionally, this book has been sanctioned by the Roman-Catholic Church as being \\"nihil obstat and imprimatur\\" or Latin for \\"free from doctrinal and moral error.\\"A great book, an easy and fast read on the fundamental core beliefs and practices of Catholicism. This book also delineates the beliefs and practices that comprise a secondary doctrinal tier from the core. The explanations are easy to follow and they make reference to the Holy Scriptures. Quotes are also drawn from early Church tradition and written historical accounts.As a result of reading this book, I can debunk the misconceptions taught in Sunday School early in my life about the Roman Catholic Church. As a Protestant believer I have more appreciation for my Catholic Christian brothers and sisters in Christ.As other readers have mentioned, this book's role is NOT TO CONVERT but rather TO TEACH and is done with respect to the non-Catholic Christian readership.Its main two (2) roles are (in no order of importance):a) to teach Catholics of what their church teaches, andb) also to raise awareness among the Protestant ranks of the most commonly misunderstood Catholic beliefs and practices, and how Catholics \\"should\\" understand them.As such I can see myself using this book quite often with my Protestant friends and relatives to kindly expose their false ideas about what Catholics believe and practice, and also gently correct my Catholic friends about what the Roman-Catholic Church teaches and believes.THANK YOU for your VOTES (up or down)!"},{"Title":"Catholic and Christian: An Explanation of Commonly Misunderstood Catholic Beliefs","review":"Of the many books I've read explaining Catholic beliefs, this is definitely right at the top of my list of the best. As the author explains, the purpose of the book is to clarify the Catholic understanding of certain Christian beliefs in order to promote unity among Christians. After reading this book I must say I have a better understanding and appreciation of numerous Catholic teachings - some of which had been seriously misrepresented to me in the Protestant churches I've attended. The chapter titled \\"Salvation: God's Free Gift in Jesus Christ,\\" and the chapter titled \\"The Work of the Holy Spirit\\" provide a clear exposition of Scripture, explaining how through faith in Jesus we are saved by God's grace, and how through the power of the Holy Spirit dwelling within us we can go on to live a life worthy of calling ourselves Christian - a life pleasing to God.The author does an excellent job of describing the role of faith and good works in salvation - in particular explaining that by \\"good works\\" Catholics do not mean the \\"works of the law\\" that the apostle Paul condemns, but rather the \\"works of charity\\" or love that \\"flow from living faith in Jesus Christ.\\" As a Protestant I believe faith is not genuine unless produces good fruit such as charitable works as described by the Epistle of James. I'm delighted to see the author describe Catholic doctrine as also believing that good works are produced by the Holy Spirit in us and demonstrate active, living, saving faith.The entire discussion of faith, grace, works, salvation and the Holy Spirit provided in this book would be an excellent tool to use for a Catholic to better explain his or her faith to a Protestant. And, since as candidly stated by the author, many Catholics do not grasp the principles described in this book, it would also be a great source for Protestants to share with their Catholic friends who are seeking a deeper, personal relationship with Jesus Christ. As stated by the author, \\"Even if we do not agree in all points of doctrine, Catholics and other Christians do agree and proclaim together that Jesus Christ is our Lord and Savior, and we are united as Christians in the Holy Spirit, even while we still are divided in our understanding of certain doctrines.\\" From this book, I believe the reader will see much greater commonality than difference in the faith of Catholics and Protestants."},{"Title":"Catholic and Christian: An Explanation of Commonly Misunderstood Catholic Beliefs","review":"This book is worth it for the early discussion on the Catholic faith and then Dr. Schreck's discussion of Justification by faith and works. If you are like me, you might have a Protestant view of salvation. For me I could never quite reconcile this view with the book of James. If you are not quite sure of the Chhurch's position on faith, grace, works, salvation, etc., this book places it all in perspective and clearly explained. Th eother parts of the book were interesting, but not like the first third of the book."},{"Title":"Catholic and Christian: An Explanation of Commonly Misunderstood Catholic Beliefs","review":"I have recently joined the Roman faith. I found this book to do an excellant job at using the Bible to show where Catholic teaching comes from. I found that Catholicism and Protestantism are very closely related. We do have some political and some idealogical differences. However, we are united in Christ which does make us brothers and sisters in faith. This book is great if your a Protestant and are just curious about the Catholic faith. It really helped me become more firmly rooted in Catholicism. Thanks, Alan Schreck!"},{"Title":"Catholic and Christian: An Explanation of Commonly Misunderstood Catholic Beliefs","review":"when father at my church gave this book to a friend of mine who is not a catholic, i was wondering a little about this book. i had a chance to read this book later and realized why he had given this book to my friend. it really explained the thorny issues very fairly. i could see that the author took very careful approach to not offend any non-catholics. i heartly think that this book is a great introduction to everyone who likes to know more about catholicism, non-believers, non-catholics, and catholics. i highly recommend this book. it won't make people defensive but rather it will make people think."},{"Title":"Catholic and Christian: An Explanation of Commonly Misunderstood Catholic Beliefs","review":"I'm planning on loaning this book out to some of my Protestant friends who have misconceptions about Catholicism. Mr. Schreck successfully refutes such notions as \\"the Catholic Church puts its own hierarchy above scripture,\\" \\"the Catholic Church teaches Pelagian works righteousness,\\" and \\"Catholics deify Mary and the Saints.\\" Mr. Schreck has done an excellent job of stating what Catholics really believe, as well as presenting the Scriptural foundations of those beliefs."},{"Title":"Blue-Eyed Child of Fortune: The Civil War Letters of Col. Robert Gould Shaw","review":"Russell Duncan has done us a favor by making available, and editing meticulously, Colonel Shaw's letters. The problem lies with his bias: it's fashionable today to read the biographies of old-time heros with suspicion, running any plaudits they may have amassed through filters of class, race, politics, gender, and so on. The result usually debunks the hero, which is fashionable, too. This &quot;hermeneutic of suspicion&quot; can introduce a real Rob Shaw beneath all the canonization piled onto him, but here it has blended into what's called &quot;presentism,&quot; whereby a historian judges the subject's classism, racism, politics, gendered outlook--or whatever--according to today's baseline. I have a problem with this approach, found in the preface and several footnotes (the adjective &quot;gentlemanlike&quot; seems to give Duncan a special problem whenever he meets it; he needs to find out what it meant, and didn't mean, in the 1860's). Further, his analysis of why Shaw decided to leave his beloved 2nd Massachusetts seems way off-base. Duncan seeks to present to us a hapless young man who &quot;never understood,or fully dedicated himself to&quot; the abolition of slavery. It seems Shaw braved ridicule from his friends and death from the enemy if captured, taking on the labors of raising, training, and leading something new, a black regiment, before dying in the middle of it to ensure its work would be recognized and other black soldiers appreciated by racists North and South, all this only because his mother's apron strings still held him tight. Meanwhile we need to notice that Duncan has left out letters which don't support these appraisals, for example Shaw's letters protesting the iniquitous pay decisions coming out of Washington (cutting the 54th's pay below the standards they had signed on to receive), or the letter in which he rebuffs his mother's plans for a &quot;show wedding.&quot; I also disagree with Duncan's analysis of the Shaw family dynamic, because he seems unaware that gender and family norms then are different from ours now. These seem like serious problems for a serious historian; most are found in the biography and some footnotes. Otherwise Duncan lets Shaw speak for himself (in the letters he offers us)and Shaw does so articulately and often eloquently when given the chance. Buy the book for the letters, thank Duncan for making them accessible, and take his commentary with a grain of salt."},{"Title":"Ready, Set, Crochet: Learn to Crochet with 19 Hot Projects (Stand-Up Book)","review":"I had attempted to crochet several times after having been an obsessive knitter, but have always gotten frustrated with learning on my own. On a whim I got this book, and within 15 mins had a pretty good-sized crochet sample that was neat and contained several different stitches.For such a small book there are very detailed instructions for beginner crocheters for many stitch variations and projects. The directions are so crystal clear that even a younger teenager would have no problems learning, and the projects are contemporary and varied. Teens and young adults would especially like some of the projects, such as a delicate lacy camisole or the beach cover-up. I crocheted a square variation on the cat bed which my cat adores. The example pictures use yarns with shimmer and contrasting colors so the stitches really stand out, a solution to an annoying problem I have had with many knitting and crochet books. As an added bonus, the book has a trifold so you can stand it up and look at it as you crochet."},{"Title":"Ready, Set, Crochet: Learn to Crochet with 19 Hot Projects (Stand-Up Book)","review":"This book made me want to crochet more (if that is possible).

Two thumbs up!!!"},{"Title":"4 Secrets of High Performing Organizations: Beyond the Flavor of the Month to Lasting Results","review":"I recently re-read this book as well as Bud Bilanich's more recently published Straight Talk for Success (2008). The four \\"secrets\\" to which the title refers to are certainly not secrets to most executives. They really are core principles and should be viewed as such, not as revelations. Obviously, their value will be determined by whether or not each is executed effectively. That's a huge \\"if\\" because some initiatives are at first successful but soon evaporate. The key is to sustain high performance. Bilanich correctly describes what he provides in this volume as a \\"framework\\" for his readers to use when creating their own high performing organizations. His approach is to prescribe rather than to share real-world situations that he encountered during lengthy, comprehensive, and rigorous research such as Jim Collins, Jason Jennings, Rodd Wagner and James Harter, and countless others have conducted prior to writing their books.However, what Bilanich prescribes is based on his own extensive experience with all manner of companies. Everything he suggests is sensible. He is by nature a pragmatist, curious to know what works and what doesn't...also why. Her is also an optimist who seems convinced that effective application of the four \\"secrets\\" will achieve high performance. Of course, success will depend on those who apply them.The four core principles have almost unlimited applications. For example, as Bilanich asserts, it is imperative to view an organization's mission in terms of a \\"map\\" by which to fulfill it. Clarity also helps to \\"chart the course,\\" serves as a \\"strategic guide,\\" and offers sound principles to guide and inform appropriate decisions. If (huge \\"if\\") all of the separate but interdependent components are explained and advocated with absolute clarity, the chances for ultimate success are improved substantially. The same is true of each of the other three core principles, Commitment, Execution, and Relationships. They are also separate but interdependent. In the last of six sections (Chapters 25-28), Bilanich concludes what has been a business narrative in which a fictional (but exemplary) protagonist, Brennan Newell, participates in a journey of discovery. What the CEO of Diamond Inc. learns about \\"basics\\" is what Bilanich would have his readers also learn.My own opinion is that Bilanich's skills as a business thinker are far greater than his talents as a storyteller but, that said, I think this book will be of substantial value to those preparing for a business career or have only recently begun one. It may be of even greater value to the owners/CEOs of small companies who must understand how to \\"nail the fundamentals\\" in order for their businesses to survive. C-level executives should also consider purchasing this book in sufficient quantity and then distributing copies among the less experienced managers for whom they are responsible.The copy I have of this book was published in 2002 and a great many other books have since been published in which their authors examine in much greater depth than does Bud Bilanich the challenge of achieving and then sustaining high performance growth. Here are two I highly recommend: Jason Jennings' Think Big, Act Small: How America's Best Performing Companies Keep the Start-up Spirit Alive and The Catalyst: How You Can Become an Extraordinary Growth Leader co-authored by Jeanne Liedtka, Robert Rosen, and Robert Wiltback, and Robert Wiltback."},{"Title":"4 Secrets of High Performing Organizations: Beyond the Flavor of the Month to Lasting Results","review":"a friendly and ever-illuminating exploration of the founding tenets for success within a special company.

He was able to observe at first hand the consequences of the expansion of the State and the Party, and the corresponding erosion of the value of the individual. The author called \\"We\\" his \\"most jesting and most serious work\\", and I think the reader will be able to appreciate both aspects of this peculiar book.This novel takes place in the future, where the One State is ruled by the great Benefactor, and separated from the rest of the world by a Great Wall, that doesn't allow the outside world to \\"contaminate\\" it. The citizens of the One State aren't persons but merely numbers. They have almost no privacy, due to the fact that most things are made of a material similar to glass but much more resistant. In any case that isn't a problem, because as everybody does the same things at the same time, nobody has much to hide.The One State begins to build a spaceship, the \\"Integral\\", that will be used to conquer other worlds and show them to be happy, in the way the citizens of the One State are happy. But how exactly are they happy?. Well, they have a rational happiness that can be mathematically proved. To mantain that happiness, they must always follow some rules. For example, there is no place for spontaneity in the One State. Imagination is considered a disease, and all art and poetry must be at the service of the State. The function of poetry is clear: \\"Today, poetry is no longer the idle, impudent whistling of a nightingale; poetry is civic service, poetry is useful\\".As if that weren't enough, almost all activities are organized according to the Table of Hours: \\"Every morning, with six-wheeled precision, at the same hour and the same moment, we -millions of us- get up as one. At the same hour, in million-headed unison, we start work; and in million-headed unison we end it. And, fused into a single million-handed body, at the same second, designated by the Table, we lift our spoons to our mouths.\\"That main character in \\"We\\" is D-503, an important mathematician who is also a faithful follower of the great Benefactor, and a key participant in the building of the \\"Integral\\". He starts to write a journal, to allow other less fortunate societies to learn from the way things are done in the One State. This novel is that journal...D-503 believes, at the beginning of this book, that the state of things in the One State is wonderful, and considers himself fortunate for being able to live in such enlightened times, where \\"everyone and I are a single We\\". But the unexpected happens when he starts to \\"fall in love\\" (an alien concept) with a number that has strange ideas, I-330. She makes D-503 start to question everything he had until then given for granted, and due to her he starts to develop a dangerous illness: a soul. As a consequence of that, D-503 cannot feel anymore as part of the whole, of \\"We\\", he cannot be merely a part of the whole...D-503's inner turmoil is shown to us throughout the pages of his journal, and it is rather heartbreaking how much he suffers when he can't return to his previous state of certitude. If at the beginning of the story he was consistently logical, and used a lot of mathematical metaphores, as chapters go by the reader begins to notice a certain incoherence. That inconsistency probably has to do with the fact that D-503 no longer understands himself, because he has been deprived of certitudes that he considered essential in defining himself (\\"I have long ceased to understand who They are, who are We \\"). Before, he didn't exist as anything else that as a part of the State. After I-330's pernicious influence, he begins to suspect that things might not be so simple.There are many themes present in \\"We\\", for example love, obsession, betrayal, freedom, the purpose of art and poetry, different kinds of revolutions, perfection, chaos... I haven't told you about many other interesting things I deem worth commenting about this book, but I think you will take greater advantage if you read \\"We\\" by yourself.Zamyatin's book is a good science-fiction novel AND a dystopia. One of the many meaning of dystopia is a work that describes a state of things that is possible but not ideal. Its value lays, in my opinion, not in the likelihood that what it tells us will eventually happen, but rather in the fact that by deforming or satirizing reality it allows the reader to see it from another perspective. From my point of view, this novel is a classic, and has the distinct advantage of being both entertaining and easy to read. If you can, read it soon!!. I highly recommend it :)Belen Alcat"},{"Title":"We","review":"This novel (the edition I read was a translation from the Russian by Mirra Ginsberg in 1972) is an excellent satire by Yevgeny Zamiatin (or, Zamyatin). Reading it, I find it remarkable that Zamiatin was not sent to Siberia or executed in one of the many purges occurring in the Soviet Union at that time. Apparently, the book was never published in the Soviet Union. It appeared first in English in 1924 (and obviously had a major influence in the development of Orwell's &quot;Nineteen Eighty-Four&quot;) and then in Czech in 1927. The Soviet authorities began to put pressure on the author through the Writers' Union and, probably due to the help of Maxim Gorky, Zamiatin was allowed to leave for Paris in 1931 (he died in Paris in 1937). The story is an extrapolation of a totalitarian world. The population of Earth that have survived a 200-years war find themselves members of a single state (the One State) where imagination is considered a disease. In this society the individual does not count, only the multitude. The central character is D-503 (all the inhabitants are numbers in this State), a mathematician who is building a space ship to bring their \\"perfect\\" world and culture to others. The whole novel consists of D-503's journal. However, D-503 soon meets I-330, a woman who shows him that there are numbers in the One State that feel that the State is in error and are striving for a new revolution. He begins to have strong feelings for her. He thinks he is ill but he can't help himself. And, he must keep his feelings hidden from the Guardians, the One State's \\"protectors.\\" What a terrific &quot;read.&quot; I highly recommend it (as well as &quot;1984&quot; and &quot;Brave New World&quot;). As can be seen in the comments by the other reviewers, &quot;We&quot; is a great book to discuss: with respect to politics, history, science fiction, or literature."},{"Title":"We","review":"Evgeni Zamyatin's novel &quot;We&quot; is often compared to Orwell's &quot;1984&quot; and Huxley's &quot;Brave New World&quot;, and rightly so, since it is a strong influence on both (though Huxley of course denied it). &quot;We&quot; is a terrifying vision of a future, in which all aspects of life have been rationally mechanized, according to the best tradition of Taylorism. The residents of OneState have no freedom; instead they have infinite, mathematically proved happiness. &quot;Those two in Paradise were given a choice: freedom without happiness, or happiness without freedom. The fools chose freedom. But we brought them back the chains,&quot; says R-13, one of the OneState's chief poets.This nightmarish vision sheds light on the present, as well. Not necessarily, as is often stated, on the terror of one Stalin. The book was written well before the establishment of the Soviet state, and on an impulse that had long before prompted Zamyatin to write in a similar vein. An earlier novella of his, &quot;Islanders&quot;, as well as many of his short stories and plays, all have the same philosophical purpose behind them: to show that the contemporary (at the time) trends in European society, culture and art are leading to a destruction of the individual will and a horrible mechanization of life. A recurrent theme in Zamyatin is the escape from overly-civilized cities, to the freedom of the countryside and of the nature itself. Zamyatin felt, and I would gladly argue that he was absolutely correct, that the modern European civilization gradually limits the scope of the individual's understanding of the world and draws him into a sort of slavery of the spirit.I recommend &quot;We&quot; to everyone. For the depth of its philosophical stance, for its brilliant structure and wonderful language, this book is clearly superior to either &quot;1984&quot; or &quot;Brave New World&quot;, though it is, unfortunately, not nearly as widely recognized."},{"Title":"We","review":"Other reviewers have had plenty to say about the significance of this book to political and literary history. As an English teacher who regularly teaches an elective in Dystopian Literature, I can't help but agree with their comments.However, something has been lost in many of the reviews that I've read here. Much of our difficulty in reading and understanding We arises from Zamyatin's ability to effectively adopt his main character's voice and concerns. It is a product of his literary success, not of any clumsiness or mistakes.We is written in an eccentric voice: the voice of a mathematician and scientist of the twenty-sixth century, D-503, who is gradually confronted with the irrationality of his own self. As the book opens, he is self-assured and composed. He dazzles us with his mathematical metaphors for the beauty of OneState and his praise for its hyperrational society.As the book progresses, however, D-503 becomes gradually more confused, conflicted, and, in his own words, \\"ill.\\" He begins to enjoy irrational things (like \\"ancient\\" music), to want irrational things (like sex outside of the prescribed Sex Days), and to avoid rational behaviors (like turning in I-330 when he realizes what she is up to).Since We is written in the first person, it only makes sense that as D-503 struggles to understand what is happening to him, we too should struggle. The simple, mathematical prose with which D-503 opens the book gives way to an increasingly confused jumble of thoughts. Zamyatin intentionally includes us in D-503's psychological journey. Not until the last chapter, when D-503's conflict is resolved, is clarity of voice reestablished.Following someone's deepest internal struggles, by examining both what is said and what is left unsaid, is one of our most challenging reading experiences. That difficulty, however, doesn't betray Zamyatin's weakness as an author but rather his sensitivity to the character he created.As a work of literature, We doesn't need to be defended. For those who are willing to invest the time, D-503 is anything but flat. He comes alive as a character caught between a society he admires and his own irrational urges. Whether you have read 1984, Brave New World, or any other dystopias, We is well worth your reading and rereading."},{"Title":"We","review":"This little-known and stream-of-consciousness dystopia is actually called 'Yedinoye Gosudarstvo' in the original Russian (which can be translated as 'One State,' 'Single State,' or 'United State'). Calling it 'We' is more eye-catching and more fully gets across what all the book's about. This book is also very similar to 'Brave New World'; I wrote a paper in my Modern Russian Lit class, when we read this book, about those similarities.The book is told in the form of D-503's notes, notes he originally began taking on government orders to write or create something celebrating OneState once his precious creation, the spaceship INTEGRAL, blasts off into space and colonises other worlds and brainwashes them with their own brand of totalitarianism and forced conformity. Since he is a mathematician, he intends it to be a mathematical poem, until he meets I-330. Up till then, he had been in love with the sweet O-90 (who looks like her name, a round little O-shaped woman who still has baby fat on her), whom he and his best friend R-13 have been sexually sharing for at least three years, though O-90 doesn't feel any love for R-13 when they're together. At first he is repelled and horrified by I-330's nonconformist ways, like wearing forbidden clothing, smoking, drinking, lying to authorities, hanging out in the Ancient House a lot, going behind the Green Wall (which is like the &quot;savage reservation&quot; in BNW), and being very sexually liberated. As time goes on she gets to him more and more, though he never stops supporting OneState and the Benefactor. He even starts to go along with her plan to lock up the factory workers when they're at lunch so they can use the INTEGRAL for good instead of evil, and begins to have dreams and an imagination, things which had been stamped out for hundreds of years. D-503 also resists getting a new imagination-removing operation done on the day that everyone was supposed to get it done.This is probably the most un-Russian Russian book I can think of; there is no mention of where they are in Russia, obviously no one has Russian names or any names at all apart from numbers and letters (women have vowels, men have consonants), there's no Russian food, history, or culture mentioned, nothing which would tell the reader that this was a Russian novel apart from the writer's name and the original language. The closest we get to Russian aspects are the old woman who guards the Ancient House and U, the guardian of D-503's house and who has a bizarre, laughable, and decidedly nonmutual crush on him; one might say they are like stereotypical old Russian grandmother-figures. There is also a bust of Pushkin in the Ancient House and a brief discussion on him. And it doesn't really matter where this takes place; there is no identifying national culture here because individuality has been crushed and the masses have surrendered to a collective state which controls every single part of one's life, right down to how many bites to take when chewing a morsel of food or what one has to do at nearly every single second of the day."},{"Title":"We","review":"Zamyatin wrote this book in the early 1920s, allegorically depicting what the newly-born Soviet state was becoming at the time. Stalin did not allow the publication of the novel, but allowed Zamyatin to leave the country. This dystopian book paints a grim picture of society governed by One State (Stalin's &quot;socialism in one country&quot;), which having consolidated intself, intends to carry its principles and ways of life into other places in the universe (the part of the world outside the Soviet Union) in a spaceship called &quot;Integral&quot; (all-encompassing doctrine of Marxism-Leninism).This book is the precursor of well-known dystopian novels &quot;1984&quot; and &quot;The Animal Farm.&quot; Zamyatin's book is not polished: the narrative is repetitious and excessively brooding. But the theme is powerful and poignant: human aspirations to create heaven on earth (and beyond) lead to de-spiritualization and total oppression. The rebelious and creative are destroyed. Human beings are turned into organic automata that serve the State for the benefit of perpetuating its existence and its power. This grim, potent, and pseudo-mathematical narrative is a warning and a sad prophecy of totalitarian miseries of the twentieth century."},{"Title":"We","review":"A great political dystopia written in 1924, We lays the foundation for Brave New World and 1984 and remains shocking and relevant. The story follows a mathematician named D-503 who lives in a bleak totalitarian society. When a comely resistance leader named I-330 seduces D-503, he accidentally discovers his soul, his unique individual identity, and is nearly driven insane by the revelation. The story contains several wonderful philosophical debates about the nature of freedom, art, and government. Written in a highly poetic, sometimes challenging prose style. Not surprisingly, this novel never got published in the USSR and Zamyatin was eventually exiled because of it. That which gives us comfort induces stasis; only things that make us uncomfortable challenge us to change and grow."},{"Title":"We","review":"Odd that so many consider this book to be SF, but more odd still that not one reviewer sees the many parallels between &quot;We&quot; and Ayn Rand's &quot;Anthem&quot; (her best work, IMHO.)Rand lived and was educated in St. Petersburg, also the home of Zamyatin and a group of &quot;supressed&quot; Bolshvic writers. Although younger than Zamyatin, &quot;We&quot; was circulated &quot;underground&quot; within a circle of Russian writers, and it is hard to believe she did not read it (and meet him) before emigrating to the USA.Interesting, too, is that her novella &quot;Anthem&quot; was first published in Britain, in 1937, just after Zamyatin died in Paris. Also, &quot;Anthem&quot; is written in the form of a personal journal. Rand loved to brag that she had beaten both Orwell and Huxley into print with &quot;Anthem.&quot; Of course it's much easier to improve someone else's work, than to create your own, which is exactly what I believe Rand did. Why not read both and decide for yourself? You'll find &quot;Anthem&quot; far more poetic (in English); but she is serious, whereas Zamyatin is brilliantly satirical."},{"Title":"We","review":"This book is a classic and must read for any fan of &quot;1984&quot; and &quot;Brave New World&quot;. The quintessential &quot;negative utopia&quot; book, and the prototype as well. I first read it 15 years ago, and have been finding and giving away used copies ever since. Glad to see it out there again. It goes in and out of print far too often..."},{"Title":"We","review":"When you read this book, so many visions should come to mind, 1984, Brave New World, Animal Farm, Fritz Lang's Metropolis and Chaplin's Modern Times...and Solzhenitzyn's Gulag. This is a terrifying world where everyone has literally been reduced to a number, and happiness is guaranteed by a operation to remove your imagination. People have to chew each bite of food fifty times, and sex is based on a weekly allowance.D-503 lives in the glass strucure of the ONE STATE (whose leader is refered to as the Benefactor). You have to get permission to put down the blinds in your room when you are allowed to have sex. The rest of the time you can see all of your neighbors because all the interior walls are glass too. Each night he walks in step, four abreast, to the marshall music that plays over hidden speakers.His \\"lover\\" is an O (who seems to represent motherhood), and her friend is R who is a poet (and represents the arts and creativity). He then meets I-330, who is part of a small group of rebellious numbers who sneak out of the city into nature. Among her friends is an ethereal member who is described to be like a 'shadow', and goes by S. O gets pregnant, I starts her revolution, and S does his 'judas' or 'snake in the garden of Eden' act.What makes this so amazing a story is that it was written in 1920 and never published in the Soviet Union. It also was written before any Totalitarian System existed. Before Mussolini,Stalin, and Hitler, Zamyatin saw them coming, and knew they would destroy all that came before them."},{"Title":"We","review":"Zamyatin's masterpiece &quot;We&quot; (&quot;My&quot;) is not a satire of the furture, communism, society, or the USSR. It has nothing to do with politics at all. This is why &quot;We&quot; is so misunderstood.&quot;We&quot; is actually about heaven and how human nature would conflict. The one state (the country in We) is supposed to be heaven, with its &quot;Guardians&quot; (Guardian Angels), and god (the benevolent Benefactor.) If a human had no desire, he would be in the state of Nirvana, the Bhuddist afterlife. Zamyatin proves that the One State is heaven using math. (the amount of happieness divided by the amount of desire. the one state does not permit desire, so the happiness become a beautiful infinity.)Zamyatin, who's father was a priest, was very knowledgable about religion. D-503, the main character, n one chapter replicates adam. the enitre book follows parts from the bible. Zamyatin was telling people in a satircle, maybe cold way, that human nature limits happiness, and in order to be truly happy, the true heaven would not permit human nature. Pure and simple.&quot;Because reason must prevail.&quot; Zamyatin, through D-503, was saying that the end result of the book (you have to read it to find out) was the true way, the true path! Zamyatin is satirizing the Soviet Union, he is preaching to us! The horrors of human nature and desire (especially sexual desire in &quot;We&quot;) only make one less certain and less happy. they limit the possible infinite happiness.So read We, now! Find out its true meaning, read in between the lines. the book is like an action movie with brains!Read it. best book i ever read besides 1984 and A Clockwork Orange (who both have things stolen from We.)Read it now!"},{"Title":"We","review":"This is the first sci-fi novel I've ever read &amp; it was required reading for my Russian literature class. I must say I was pleasantly surprised! This book was written in the early 1920's (which means it was around before &quot;Brave New World&quot;)and is a satire about the horrors of Stalinism. It is very creative in its concept...individuals no longer have names, but rather numbers. Everybody lives in glass buildings, eliminating privacy. Sexual relationships must be approved by the State beforehand and an unplanned pregnancy resulted in a death sentence for the mother. This book is written in diary-form with very short entries, making it a quick and easy read. I thoroughly enjoyed this book &amp; think anyone interested in sci-fi or in Russian literature would enjoy it also."},{"Title":"We","review":"We is the first real dystopian novel. Inspired by Zamyatin's experience with the early Soviet state, We is an anticipation and allegory of what the Soviet Union would become under Stalin. We is distinguished from better known english language dystopias like 1984 and Brave New World not only by its originality but by the poetic quality of the writing. In Zamyatin's hands, what could be mechanical allegorical items, such as citizens living in glass houses, become striking images. A surprising source of this poetic imagery is Zamyatin's reliance on scientific terminology. For example, the space ship Integral, a symbol of the state's need to project and extend its power is so named because it embodies the incorporation (integration) of individual actions into collective action. In the state described by Zamyatin, dreams are suppressed, individuality is crushed, and service to the state and its leader is the highest goal. Still, the crushing burden of totalitarianism is unable to destroy the power of human passion. This is a better book than either 1984 or Brave New World. A superb and unusual book."},{"Title":"We","review":"Written by a Soviet author a few years after the Russian Revolution and considered the 1st major dystopian novel of the 20th Century, We anticipated the excesses of Stalinism as it depicts a totalitarian state of the future where everyone lives to serve the needs of the One State and its leader, the great Benefactor. The Collective is of supreme importance in We's society, to the point where individuals lack names and are only known by numbers. Not quite as good as I hoped it would be and the translation, at times, felt awkward, but still an interesting read since the novel created a number of archetypes used in later dystopian stories (particularly in Ayn Rand's Anthem and Orwell's 1984). While it didn't do it best, it did do it first."},{"Title":"We","review":"This was written sometime in the early 20th century, and the author was commenting about the rise of socialism in Russia.This is my favorite paragraph:\\"Even among the ancients, the most mature among them knew that the source of right is might, that right is a function of power. And so, we have the scales: on one side, a gram, on the other a ton; on one side \\"I,\\" on the other \\"We,\\" the One State. Is it not clear, then, that to assume that the \\"I\\" can have some \\"rights\\" in relation to the State is exactly like assuming that a gram can balance the scale against the ton? Hence, the division: rights to the ton, duties to the gram. And the natural path from nonentity to greatness is to forget that you are a gram and feel yourself instead a millionth of a ton.\\"Sort of sounds like the whole \\"99-percent vs. the 1-percent\\" argument we've heard during the past year or so.The more things change..."},{"Title":"We","review":"Quite interesting compared with Orwell's 1984: a particular type of science-fiction.

If you like books like Anthem by Ayn Rand, 1984 by George Orwell, and Brave New World by Aldous Huxley, this is the book for you."},{"Title":"We","review":"In general, I tend not to like books in the journal entry format, but this was a good read. Most know the basic principles behind the futuristic, dystopic, freedom-deprived, non-individualistic world presented in this book but it's the characters that count and the finer details that make this book worth reading. Some parts were a little dry, and others a little too muddled in symbolism. With all the crap science fiction books out there, however, this one is definately worth reading, science fiction fan or not."},{"Title":"We","review":"I read this book about 10 years ago in native language and it made a profound impact on me. This is a master piece as good as Dostoevsky, except that \\"We\\" was written in the early 20th century.

It was an excellent fit. jag"},{"Title":"We","review":"We is a book all about beating the system. It follows one man's life through a journal he is writing to send on the spaceship, Integral, to primitive civilizations like us. The journal writing style and many other features reminded me greatly of 1984. This is a classic book about the impossibility of a true utopia. The love story that flows through the book ads intrigue and seems to parallel 1984 in several ways as well. The reader begins to feel the author of this journal's thoughts, regrets, and inner struggles. A true classic that few have read or even heard of that I believe should be added to every need to read list."},{"Title":"We","review":"In the rational future world of the One State, life is perfect under the benign rule of the Benefactor. D-503, a mathematician, is building a ship called the Integral, which will spread logic, reason and \\"happiness\\" to the rest of the universe. As D-503 quotes from the One State Gazette: \\"If they fail to understand that we bring them mathematically infallible happiness, it will be our duty to compel them to be happy.\\"D-503 suffers from a terrible sickness: he is afflicted with a soul.The One State is a mathematically structured, artificial environment where life is sterile, spartan and mechanical. Buildings are all made of glass, citizens (numbers) have to march in time to the anthem of the State. At regulated mealtimes they also chew their artificial food in unison.One of the strange things about D-503's life is that he believes his world is enviable. Just as we look back at our own history with an amazed shudder of disbelief, so too does D-503. His society has done away with horrible things like hunger, love and freedom in order to experience happiness. Even so, there are still a few \\"enemies of happiness\\" among the numbers who are publicly liquidated by the Benefactor's Machine.Although this is the book that influenced \\"1984\\" I only heard of \\"We\\" about two years ago, when I saw its name mentioned in one of Anthony Burgess' novels. (\\"1985\\".) D-503 writes the book in a series of entries, in a style that reads almost like poetry. (Although D-503 says he has no gift for poetry.) I can imagine the narrator's voice sounding dull and lifeless. As someone who puts great value on privacy, I find the idea of living in a glass house completely repulsive.The influences on \\"1984\\" are obvious: The Benefactor = Big Brother, the Guardians = the Thought Police, the One State = Oceania. But even though \\"1984\\" enjoys wider recognition than \\"We\\", there is no doubt that Yevgeny Zamyatin's novel is the definitive bleak future; the template for all dystopian novels."},{"Title":"We","review":"This is my second endeavor into the famed distopia trilogy. Unfortunately, I should have read this one first. I loved Brave New World, but I think this is in a class by itself. I read somewhere that Brave New World was written without knowledge of this book, which would make the similarities uncanny. Anyway, This story grabbed me from the very beginning with the effective use of numbers to substitute characters names. This let's you know right off the bat that this future society is not joking around. The intertwining fashion used between dreams and reality was especially appealing, giving this novel a surrealistic feel. The thing that hooks this novel into masterpiece status is the ending. Unlike Brave New World, this was one I was not expecting. Also, the fact that a man living in communist Russia wrote this novel really enhances the experience and shows you the nightmarish visions this man derived from his way of life. Platinum."},{"Title":"We","review":"Then you MUST get this book. We is the first and best book out of the &quot;Dystopian Trilogy&quot; of books, and, not surprisingly, the most penetratingly honest and hopeful of the three works. As is common with Russian authors, Zamyatin coupled a vision of a bleak future with a piercing ray of hope in the end. D-503's internal struggles and those with his other &quot;numbers&quot; as he is facing these new feelings brought about by I-330's attentions also add a great deal of soul which is missing from the later works by Orwell and Huxley. This is definitely a book that is well worth anyone's time, and I particularly recommend it to anyone interested in dystopian literature and the writings of the Soviet dissidents, or anyone who has an interst in great literature."},{"Title":"We","review":"This book was perhaps as intriguing as 1984, but the format was a little odd for me. It is written as the diary entries (intended as a story of the main character's life for his ancestors) of a mathematician in an age where everyone belongs to everyone else, nothing is private.Very fascinating, right up to the last sentence. A must-read for the prophetic-scifi reader."},{"Title":"We","review":"Zamytin was a Bolshevik who knew something had gone terribly wrong with the dream of a socialist utopia born of ideology.Though others find humor in it, this epic proves a stark reminder of the corruption of a state gone mad with technology, making pretentious claims that it has 'the people's best interest at heart'.So circumstanced, Zamyatin endows us with the didactic framework of a literary legacy, strong drink for the elitist hagiographers of Lenin and Trotsky.In doing so, he elliptically reveals the blunders of history's other utopian strategies as well.As Shakespeare said in Measure for Measure, it is excellent to wield a giant's strength, by tyrannous to us it as a giant."},{"Title":"We","review":"&quot;We shall break down all the walls-to let the green wind blow free from end to end-across the earth.&quot;No ordinary SF novel, &quot;WE&quot; questions the wisdom of 1920's Russian body politik, The Party. Banned and suppressed there, even today, Zamyatin's distopian nightmare demands of the reader a re-thinking of their rights to choose and the necessity of eternal change, r/evolution.Earnest and beautiful, one man's personal diary of the events surrounding the legislation of mandatory brain operations within a hermetically enclosed city-state, is a subtle, terse and poetic examination of fear of, and need for freedom. I highly reccommended to anyone without hesitation. Zamyatin's philosophical enquiry is personal and lyrical"},{"Title":"We","review":"He is the good boy - an upright member of society and an accomplished mathematician. She is the bad girl - a rebel who smokes and drinks and challenges authority. He has strong morals, yet he is infallibly attracted to this rebel girl. Can he resist her temptations, or will he be drawn down into her abyss of nefarious behavior? Will he stand up for what he knows is right, or will he succumb to her whim and be duped into abetting her criminal activities?Such is the story of \\"We\\", by Yevgeny Zamyatin. It takes place some thousand years in the future, where the \\"beneficent yoke\\" of the One State has had a strangle hold on freedom for hundreds of years. All the citizens are faceless numbers, cogs of a massive machine, who walk, sing, and eat in unison. D-503 is one such number, a mathematician and builder of the spaceship Integral. D-503 is a loyal member of the One State and extols its virtues in a journal.I-330 is the rebel girl. Her revolutionary group, Mephi, is aimed at overthrowing the One State and restoring a free society. D-503 is indelibly attracted to her, yet he remains loyal to the One State. As the seeds of a soul and imagination begin to grow within him, the torment and conflict he endures drives him into near insanity. He does not agree with I-330's ideas of a free society (for every number knows that unfreedom equals happiness), but he is too weak to resist her.Throughout the novel, D-503's soul (considered a dangerous illness) tries to overcome all the propaganda that has been ingrained in him since birth. Through vivid imagery and scenery, Zamyatin presents a complex and challenging picture of one's inner essence. Through symbolism and metaphors, Zamyatin provides a convincing portrait of an individual and his tortured soul.This is a superb novel, but it can be challenging and confusing to understand, particularly in the middle passages. The book is written in a stream of conscience perspective and the logic and sequence of events is irregular, to say the least. As D-503 descends deeper into insanity triggered by his imagination, his thoughts and reasoning become harder to decipher, as he has lost the ability to differentiate between dreams and reality. One such example of this:\\"It moved like a horse-front right foot, rear left, front left, rear right. It ran up to my bed, climbed into it, and I made love to the wooden chair. It was uncomfortable and painful.\\" Ouch!But the bizarre hallucinations aside, this is a rewarding book to read. This is the predecessor to other dystopic novels, such as \\"1984.\\" If you are a fan of dystopic novels, then I would highly recommend this book and see how this novel started the dystopic genre and helped to inspire George Orwell to write \\"1984.\\""},{"Title":"We","review":"Cynical and cold story about a 'Benefactor', who creates together with his lackeys a state of totally depersonalized citizens: conscience is a disease, cruelty is a sign of love, without liberty no crimes can be committed, sex is planned ...The precursor of George Orwell's '1984' and, more, of Aldous Huxley's 'Brave New World', for the novel lacks the 'human' touch of '1984'.

Instead now We is a strong reminder of what has already occured in our past. When reading We think of Stalin, Hitler, and the Berlin Wall which was yet to be built when We was written but whcih strongly resembles the Green Wall depicted in We.Zamyatin, the author of We, was exiled from Russia, and his book was never published there, or in the Russian language until 1988. This is interesting to note because so much of what Zamyatin prophecizes comes to pass and the book was totally suppressed while these actual events were happening.We is the original Dystopia and both Orwell and Huxley recognize their debt to Zamyatin. If you have read 1984 or Brave New World, you will recognize many similarities and at times you will even feel like you are rereading one of these works.

One, it's always interesting to see what an author tried to accomplish during Soviet oppression; and two, it's interesting to see the evolution of this genre and where it all began."},{"Title":"We","review":"We've all read 1984, we've all seen the movie, and we've all used the term, \\"Big Brother\\" in our modern day society; and it's pretty clear that all of us have a good understanding of what a dystopia is.But I really wished I didn't because Zamyatin's We would've been a great read. However, it's got some interesting concepts like the, \\"Integral\\" a giant ship the builders make so their society can use it to explore new worlds and colonize distant lands; and everything in their society is constructed from glass so everyone sees all with the exception of sexual intercourse which is conducted behind a curtain. The story is well written, although it becomes a little frustrating when you're reading d-503's new found thoughts and sensations because his mind goes all over the place. The story is well structured, but towards the end the story becomes all too familiar with fans who take interests in dystopian sci-fi.But that's the probelm! Because of Orwell's '84, movies like Brazil and Kafka, and other dystopian novels this book becomes predictable and trite! The only thing that kept me hooked was the technology and mathematics they used in the book-other than that it really didn't grab me.It's not like this book is bad, don't get me wrong, I just wished I read We first. But go pick up the book if you're just getting into this genre and you'll find yourself having a great time."},{"Title":"We","review":"I had more of a struggle plodding through this book than I have had with any book in years. I love dystopian novels--I've taught Brave New World, 1984, and The Handmaid's Tale in high school courses--and science fiction in general. Having heard that We inspired both Huxley and Orwell, I knew I had to read it. But for some reason, reading it was an experience completely devoid of pleasure for me. Instead, I got increasingly frustrated at the ambiguous language and the narrator's hopping from one topic to another. I don't know if the translation is to blame, but the language of the novel seemed very disjointed to me. And I've read translations of Dostoevsky, so I don't think it's just a difference in writing styles between Russian and English speakers. I came very close to giving up on reading it, but I haven't done that with a book in years, so I forced myself to finish it yesterday. Yes, it is clear that Zamyatin's ideas are precursors for several aspects of 1984 and, to a lesser extent, Brave New World. But trust me: that don't make it fun to read! The only person I can see needing to read this chunky stew of a book is someone writing a scholarly essay on the history of the dystopian novel or something like that. And I can't even see how someone like that would actually enjoy reading We."},{"Title":"We","review":"First in the well known \\"Dystopian Triad\\", that further includes Brave New World (A.

It only deserves points because it was before those others. At best it is a bland description of an impossible world: Glass tenaments, marching queues of citizens, copulation tickets, forced surgery, schoolchild indoctrination, assemblys, a single ruler, pre-decided elections, gas chambers, etc.Part of SciFi though is to pay attention to details and try to create believability and some drama. Even if the world is one that obeys different rules, SciFi should set up a consistant system of rules and how they are then obeyed or disobeyed. This novel does nothing of the sort. It is a tragedy, but you don't feel sympathy with the protagonist. You don't know (or care) who is a good guy and who is a bad guy. It is completely unbelievable that the simple-minded protagonist is a highly technical designer of a spaceship. The size of the city-state is unbelievably small. The ride in the ship is anticlimactic. The comparisons of life with mathematics are juvenile and no one with a 6th-grade math education would buy them. Even if there were an oppressive rule, this world could not exist."},{"Title":"We","review":"We, for me, was not a good read. Perhaps if I was a mathematician and not have read the other dystopia books, Brave New World and 1984, it would have been a fun book to read as other reviewers have stated. Perhaps this was a serious book, but it was not an entertaining book to read. The book was a can."},{"Title":"We","review":"\\"We\\" is the progenitor of all twentieth century dystopian science fiction novels and movies. As an obvious sign of its influence, the novel's themes and settings can be found in a number of derivative works: a woman causing a man to doubt (1984), a glass dome and wall keeping nature at bay (Aeon Flux), the elimination of arts and a single person who still has access (Equilibrium), crowds gathering to watch citizen vaporization (Logan's run), recreational sex (Brave New World), and so on.As the book is closing in on 100 years, the \`science' is antiquated, but the \`fiction' is timeless. Zamyatin's central themes still resonate: there is no \`final' revolution, freedom of choice is a necessity, and even though the collective is important, the psyche cannot function without attending to the individual. The staccato prose takes getting used to but is a device necessary to reflect a mathematician's attempt at capture thoughts and conversations verbatim. Overall this was an entertaining book, both as a piece of science fiction history and on its own merits. I recommend it highly."},{"Title":"We","review":"The key difficulty in reading this influential dystopian novel is that virtually everyone who cracks the cover, does so having already read 1984 and Brave New World. To a very large degree that is a pity, since this work predates those considerably-Orwell cited it as the key influence on 1984. However, once you've read those, Zamiatin's work has little new to offer, and unfolds in much less readable language. Our book group read it and discussed it with great vigor, but ultimately concluded that we wouldn't recommend it to anyone who had already read Orwell and Huxley's works.The story is related through the diary entries of D-503, a rather important cog in the machine of a future city state which has hermetically sealed itself from the wild and primal outside world that is left after the Two Hundred Years War. The staccato form of the entries makes for rather cumbersome and occasionally confusing reading. The society is strictly regimented, everyone wears the same uniform, and follows set schedules throughout the day, and literally lives in glass houses. The aim of the society is to scientifically manage everyone's time and energy for maximum efficiency and smoothness, a notion Zamiatin extrapolated from the writings of Frederick Winslow Taylor, the founder of modern scientific management principles, who was highly influential in the early part of the 20th century. However, this \\"perfect\\" society-where happiness is considered inversely proportional to freedom-has yet to figure out a way to eliminate that most primal of urges, sex.This achilles heel is what sets things in motion, as D-503, who is the lead engineer in the construction of a rocket ship being designed to expand the society to other worlds, falls for a dishy rebel who has access to the outside world. This sparks emotions and feelings he's not familiar with, the discovery of a soul within him, and wild mood swings within him as he grapples with the implications of all this. Zamiatin seems to be indicating that in our most primal urges are also the last vestiges of our individual souls. Clearly the novel is meant to attack both the rise of modern industrialism, and totalitarianism in general (not Stalin specifically though, he didn't consolidate his position until almost a decade after the book was written). Zamiatin was a revolutionary, and was jailed by the Czar's secret police on several occasions. He never renounced the revolution but did have plenty to say about those who hijacked it and created the world's most brutally efficient police state (for a good short history of that, see Martin Amis's Koba the Dread). Ultimately, this is an important novel, but not a particularly enjoyable one to read."},{"Title":"We","review":"and we are all together.These lyrics by the Beatles provide some flavor of the atmosphere of the futuristic society found in Yevgeny Zamyatin's dystopian classic \\"WE\\". Written in the fledgling Soviet Union in 1920 \\"WE\\" had a direct influence n Aldous Huxley's Brave New World, George Orwell's Nineteen Eighty-Four and Ayn Rand's Anthem. In fact, Rand's Anthem tracks \\"WE\\" so closely both as to plot and character development that one cannot help but think that Zamyatin's influence on Rand was significant, to say the least.Zamyatin was born in 1884 and studied naval engineering as a young man. Like many young Russian intellectuals Zamyatin was something of a revolutionary. He was arrested and exiled more than once by the Tsar's secret police for revolutionary activities. During the First World War Zamyatin, by now a naval enginner was sent to England were he supervised the construction of icebreakers for the Russian navy. He returned to Russia upon the outbreak of the October 1917 revolution. Zamyatin turned to writing full time after the revolution. Although a Bolshevik, Zamyatin chafed at the increasing censorship the Bolshevik's imposed on artists and writers. In fact, WE was the first novel to be banned by the newly formed literary censorship board, GLAVLIT. WE was not officially published in Russia or the USSR until 1988. Not able to earn a living as a writer in the USSR, Zamyatin applied for an exit visa. Zamyatin was granted an exit visa and he emigrated to Paris, were he died a sick and poverty stricken man in 1937.WE takes place in the twenty-sixth century a time in which a totalitarian regime has created an extremely regimented society where individual expression simply does not exist. All remnants of individuality have been stripped from its inhabitants including their names. Their names have been replaced with an alpha-numeric system. People are not coupled. Rather, each individual is assigned three friends with whom they can have intimate relations on a rigid schedule established by the state. Those scheduled assignations are the only times the shades in a citizen's glass houses can be closed. Apart from those hourly intervals everyone's life is monitored by the state. As in Orwell's 1984 language has been turned on its head. Freedom means unhappiness and conformity and the submission of individual will to the state means happiness.D-503 is a mathematician. He is busily engaged working on the construction of a spaceship, the Integral, which will carry the wonderful benefits of \\"The One State\\" to those living on distant planets. He keeps a diary to provide a record of his feelings in the weeks before the launch. But into his perfectly well-structured life walks I-330. She evokes in D-503 feelings which he has long suppressed or never knew he had. He falls in love, can't sleep, and starts breaking rules and generally acting like most of us do today. But I-330 is a heretic, an individual who smokes, drinks, loves carnal knowledge and seeks nothing more but the dissolution of the One State. The next thing you know D-503 finds himself on the side of revolution. As the book reaches it climactic moments questions as to the failure or success of the revolution are answered.WE was a fascinating book to read. Some of the language is a bit dated and Zamyatin's 1921 idea of what the future might look like has been outstripped by the reality of 20th-century developments. However, the underlying themes of conformity v. freedom and \\"the state\\" v the individual still have great contemporary significance that keeps WE as fresh as it was when originally written.Some have said that WE represented Zamyatin's attack on the oppression of the Soviet system. I would have to disagree. The book was written in 1920 well before the Soviet regime consolidated enough power to be considered a totalitarian society. Further, even though WE contains some reference to the damage caused by regimes such as the fledgling USSR it also contains reference (looking back from the 26th-century) to societal ills caused by both capitalism and organized religion. As such, Zamyatin believed in equal opportunity when it came to instruments of oppression.At the end of the day it seems that what Zamyatin valued most in society were those people will to play the role of heretic. It certainly was a trait he valued in artists. As he noted in an essay written in 1919:True literature can exist only where it is created, not by diligent and trustworthy functionaries, but by madmen, hermits, heretics, dreamers, rebels, and skeptics.Zamyatin was a heretic, a dreamer, and a rebel. WE is a worthy monument to a person who believed that the individual was more important than the state without regard to whether that state had \`all life's answers'. WE should be enjoyed by anyone who has read and liked H.G. Wells (who influenced Zamyatin), Huxly, or Orwell. This is a book worth reading."},{"Title":"We","review":"WE is highly recommended for anyone with a soul; anyone, that is, who feels singular in a society without intellectual and emotional diversity. WE addresses the political climate of early 20th century Russia, but asks more disturbing questions (and possibly makes predictions) upon the logical outcome of our own societal direction."},{"Title":"We","review":"&quot;We&quot; is a brilliant book. Zamyatin manages to encasulate, not so much in the future but a parallel world, questions which we are afraid of making, or considering. His clever style manges to undermine our concept of order being proportional to logic. Even logic may be chaotic, things can never be logical, there is always the root of negative one... A very succesful piece worthy of being read by anyone who has read 1984. Follows a similar context of the Big Brother."},{"Title":"We","review":"Zamyatin's &quot;We&quot; is a complex and intricate novel. The nuances are too many to discuss and I have not sorted them out for myself. There are a few points which I believe are key to appreciating the novel. First I would recommend reading &quot;The Cave&quot; by Zamyatin. I believe that &quot;The Cave&quot; gives an insight into Zamyatin's philisophical and scienctific beliefs and there intergration. One of the most important ideas in Zamyatin's &quot;WE&quot; is the idea of Entropy. The law of Entropy is (I believe)the second law of thermodynamics. This law basically says the a given system (molecules, society ect.) tends to move to a state of rest, i.e., low energy. The idividual who constantly denies the status quo and looks beyond the horizon adds energy to the system, i.e., creativity. But there is no rest, there must be a constant state of revolution because systems move towards order a low energy and death. &quot;WE&quot; is a testimony to th! e importance and need of free thought. Some readers may see &quot;WE&quot; as an anti-Soviet communist documment which it well may be, but the ideas go beyond a mear political protest. Zamyatin tries to point out the constant striving of humankind.I would also like suggest a reading of the &quot;Undergroung Man&quot; by Feodor Dostoevsky."},{"Title":"We","review":"A lot of very early science fiction remains great reading, but it's remarkable that a science fiction novel written in the 1920s and set approximately a thousand years in the future reamins so plausible and eerily realistic. The horrifying vision of the future presented in \\"We\\" could still take place. In many ways, it has taken place, time and again (most obviously in Stalinist Russia). In many ways, the disturbing scenarios described here continue rearing their ugly heads even today.\\"We\\" is one of the earliest (to my knowledge) 'dystopian future' stories, a field that also encompasses such tales as \\"1984\\" and \\"V For Vendetta\\". It is presented in the form of a journal, written first person by a character known as D-503 (individual names no longer exist in this future; all are numbers) and intended to be read by the inhabitants of alien planets, describing the world (Earth) and how it came to exist in its current (future) state. D-503 makes new entries daily, so we read from the beginning, where D is an adamant supporter of the world order, through later entries as disillusionment begins to creep in on the narrator before he's even aware of it. The alien planets in question are those to be visited by the Integral, mankind's first interplanetary spaceship, nearing completion as the novel begins, and intended to bring the 'benefits of the One State' to all the stars.The world of \\"We\\" is one of a single city state of millions, where all 'wild' (trees, grass, birds, etc.) has been permanently banished behind the walls of the city. All citizens of the One State exist to serve the One State, and individuality has been pretty much abolished. The One State makes all major decisions and most smaller ones, each life is regulated, hour by hour, to an extraordinary degree; the very buildings people live in are transparent and 'Guardians' are everywhere, watching to make sure no one steps out of the precise lines the One State has so carefully formulated. Its similarities to real-life authoritarian regimes are unmistakable, but taken to an even more all-encompassing degree.Two events that coincidentally both happen in the months leading up to the completion of the Integral are of great signifigance. State scientists discover the physical location within the human brain of the 'illness' known as imagination, and the means to finally excise it completely; and D-503 himself discovers emotions he's never experienced before, triggered by a chance meeting, and subsequent acquantaince with, a woman known as I-330.\\"We\\" is a grim and profoundly troubling book, but there are moments of brightness and optimism from a fairly early stage. Such things as friendship and hope have survived into the future, often within those who aren't even conscious of their prescence. And as change continues within this future socity toward an even bleaker future (the possible eradication of imagination; the forcible spreading of this severe existance to space beyond), change also remains capable of moving in the opposite direction...Thought-provoking and overall a great story with an intriguing plot, memorable characters, and great turns and surprises. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"We","review":"Simply, \\"We\\" blew me away.Expanding on that, of all the dystopias, I do not think it could be argued that \\"We\\" has the finest prose and literary quality. Certainly, I enjoy the others of the great triad, \\"1984\\" and \\"Brave New World\\" and some of their lesser cousins, but \\"We,\\" stylistically, trumped them. Throught the book a key elegant metaphor is the glass, everything in D-503's One State is glass, their homes, their streets, the great dome covering their city, even the fabulous \\"Integral\\" is glass. Every citizen sees the actions of every other, but everywhere there seems to be a blindness--especially to the self, D-503 sees.\\"We\\" does fascinatingly paint the ultimate threat of Stalinism and the Totalitarian regime that emerged in Russia following their revolution, but it can present itself as the natural progress of our own society, and even, in the latter chapters, brings up the issue of Christian vs. Paganism--with One State believing themselves the heirs of Christianity and their Benefactor as a god-like avatar of divine power. Through this we certainly do have a reflection to our Christian-majority western world. We get an idea that it's not the atheism, as in \\"1984\\" or \\"Brave New World\\" that can drive these nations. It gives us the image of the real difference Zamyatin may have seen between \\"good\\" and \\"bad\\" societies--the good ones are built on humans, and humans are still the core focus; in our dystopic ones the state's own survival that is important. Allegories could certainly be drawn between \\"We\\" and the history of any nation and the major religious powers of our world.Along with this we are presented with issues that are worth thinking about in our own civilization: One State's belief that it is the eternal government, the final revolution; their (as we might see it) bizarre election system; their definition of happiness; repression of free will and even the restriction of their entire society to but a small block of our whole planet (our own problems of urban concentration). One State stands apart from their own ecosystem in a world of glass and petroleum--a future that surely has even been touted as the dream of modernization at many points. \\"We\\" is a chilling look, not only at what the USSR might have become, but what horrific potential lies in our civilization to this day, as well as one of the most emotionally driving and crushing of all the dystopias."},{"Title":"We","review":"Yevgeny Zamyatin's We, written before Dystopian novels became widely popular, is a fascinating, thoughtful read that those interested in speculative sci-fi will probably devour in a day or two. The author creates a world of the far future where most of humanity has supposedly been wiped out in a Two Hundred Years War. The survivors, organized under the Benefactor's One State, live in a sterile, scientifically regimented world where everyone lives in a glass house and even dreams have been eliminated. Zamyatin's narrator, designer of the space ship Integral, the magic bullet by which the One State will export this harmonious way of life to other planets, begins the book (actually the character's journal, meant to be an educational tool for the social primitives on other worlds) a staunch advocate of the One State and its system of law. But when he meets a mysterious woman whose sheer unconventionality makes him love her, the narrator finds himself drawn ever deeper into doubt, rebellion, and perhaps madness. A book of questions, We is sometimes overly ambiguous and it's rather unclear what the author's ultimate message is. Though Zamyatin plainly marks totalitarianism as the greatest social evil, he alternates other philosophies in such a way that no truly desireable remedy ever manifests itself. The ending is particularly enigmatic, leaving the reader doubting not only the narrator's future but many of his previous experiences. Nontheless, We is a worthwhile literary achievement, and deserving of any self-respecting non-conformist's perusal."},{"Title":"We","review":"This classic dystopia is essential reading in the genre. Asidefrom Brave New World and 1984, other dystopias include Erewhon bySamuel Butler, A Clockwork Orange by Anthony Burgess, and, for the younger (and older) folk, The Giver by Lois Lowry. I would also recommend Kafka's The Trial, Lord of the Flies, and, of course, the anti-utopian rant of Notes from Underground (and the short story &quot;Dream of a Ridiculous Man&quot;) by Dostoevsky, but these are not strictly dystopias but have some concerns in common with dystopias (namely, individual freedom vs social conformity). For those who love utopias, some common ones are Utopia, News from Nowhere, Looking Backward, and Lost Horizon. Also check out H.G.

A fairly quick read, &quot;We&quot; will keep you interested and leave you with an interesting literary history lesson."},{"Title":"We","review":"Though not the first dystopian novel (Jack London&quot;s &quot;The Iron Heel&quot; dates from the 1900's), nor the most famous (ever hear of &quot;1984&quot;), it is indeed the most influential. It is the father to all literature which bases itself on a world worse than the one we live in today, based on the trends we are currently experiencing. For Zamyatin in 1924, that meant the rise of Stalin and the concurrent decline in liberty. Zamyatin wrote in obscurity the same things Orwell would become famous for 25 years later when he was critiquing the post-Hitler Europe that still smoldered from half a century of war. Zamyatin's take was that society was hopelessly becoming too logical, and that all work was done to uphold the One State. Now, the parallels to propoganda and totalitarianism in Soviet Russia are obvious. But it goes to the extent that logic and order defined unquestioned beauty. Mathematics becomes poetry. Art is superfluous if it doesn't glorify logic as its god. But Zamyatin's novel has a soul. Below the surface pamphleteering, there is a love story. If there is a thesis statement, it's that love prevails, even over deified logic. The hero, the builder of the very vehicle designed to take the One State's logic to other worlds, fails himself in the most human of ways--he falls in love. Now, the hero has a girlfriend so to speak, but its within the rules of society. He meets another woman he initially hates because of her carefree attitude and mannerisms, yet falls for her for the same reasons. Hence, he has internal conflict, and how better to portray what drama goes on in one's head than through a journal? Hence, the style of the book. At the very least, it's interesting to see how dystopian literature develops because of &quot;We&quot;. It's interesting how you can see Huxley develop his orgy-porgies and how Orwell came up with brainwashing brutality by reading this novel. The final sentence sums up the futility of trying to rage against the machine--&quot;Be! cause Reason Nust Prevail.&quot; Orwell wrote &quot;He loved Big Brother&quot;. Same effect."},{"Title":"We","review":"This is more of a philosphy novel than anything else. There are intertwinnings with beautiful fantasy, pure logic and a personalisation that you will not find in 1984 or Brave N ew World. There are direct references to religion, science experiments that were the buzz of Zamyatin's time and still ring with us today.The main problenm with this book is for people to take it too seriously. This is partly a mix of an author's life and his fiction. The 70s feel is amazing considering the time it was written in. I recommend people not to take to heart that this book may have influenced 1984 and BNW because then you will read too much into this and not enjoy it."},{"Title":"We","review":"Sometimes I wonder if the clarity of this novel is affected by its translation or if it is simply characteristic of D-503's writing style.

D-503 began the novel a perfect subject of the central authority. For him, the power and organization of central authority was synonymous with the power of the rules of mathematics. Both were absolute. When he first encountered the square root of negative one though, D-503 became frustrated, because there was something that mathematics couldn't answer: a limit to knowledge, a limit to what the rules could do. In the totalitarian world that D-503 lived in, it meant that there were things that the central authority would never be able to control or understand. By the end of the novel, D-503 had come to embrace the square root of negative one. He learned that the unknown and the unknowable are as important to existence as the known and the knowable.\\"We\\" was written by Yevgeny Zamiatin at the time of the Communist Revolution in Russia. It was the first book banned in the Soviet Union, and it remained banned until 1988. The square root of negative one means that there will always be things beyond the rules. It means there are the things that will always elude control and remain wild, and there are no final revolutions."},{"Title":"We","review":"We was written before 1984 and Brave New World, and yet I never heard of it until coming across it on a store shelf! It's a haunting scifi story and too good not to tell others about. It is also similar in some ways to The Giver. Written in the form of the journals of a tormented genius, D-503 lives in a world so bizarre that it almost seems like he is inside a computer. Each \\"number\\" is almost identical, and most are expendable, but he is the builder of a great starship, therefore of importance to the One State, and so is granted more tolerance when his behavior gets eccentric. Life is totally regimented except for 2 personal hours each day, and even then, most numbers either go for a walk or get a coupon allowing them to have sex with a partner they have registered with. D-503 has one male friend, a Black poet who writes for the State, and a female partner who he shares with his friend. Like all oppressive states, this one has an underground, and D-503's life falls into disarray when he meets and falls in love with I-330, a mysterious woman of the resistance. There is little in this world that stands out, but the author focuses on facial features and body shapes that attract and repel him at the same time. His mind whirling in confusion, he goes to a doctor who says he is sick because he has developed a soul, and that the condition is \\"incurable.\\" Yet he is given permission to be sick because he is so important. As the time for the ship's launch is at hand, to spread \\"perfect happiness\\" throughout the universe, the resistance bubbles to the surface, and the state devises a ghastly cure for imagination, the last shred of humanity that is left. Society explodes in chaos as numbers refuse to submit to the Great Operation that will take away their imagination, their resistance, and with it, their soul. To tell any more would ruin the story. A word of warning: DON'T read the introduction before the story, it tells how the story ends!"},{"Title":"We","review":"This 1920 book is a powerful example of prototype dystopian science fiction. It exists on more than just one or two levels. Impeccable math and science (Zamyatin was a Naval architect), religious imagery, jokes (that's right), and of course, scathing political prophecy are all present in this melting pot. Not to mention it's actually a fun read! The influence of this novel cannot be overstated in the political history of the world and in the science fiction genre. The amount of subtleties in this book that aren't shoved down your throat will guarantee your continued (and renewed) enjoyment of successive reads; there's something new on every round. Clocking in at a modest 232 pages for the paperback edition, it won't take you that long, though you may find yourself spending a lot of time in thought after finishing it.I've heard that there are better translations than this one. It's all a matter of preference, really, and this is the one that's most widely available. If you fancy yourself a science fiction fan or politically aware, this is more than worth your time."},{"Title":"We","review":"I was reading an article some time ago that mentioned this novel as a precursor to George Orwell's 1984. Well, as 1984 is one of my favorite novels, I thought I should take a look at this one. Boy, am I glad I did. This is one fantastic book.In a world where no one has a name, this is the journal of D-503. He is a man who lives in a city entirely made of glass (since who would have anything to hide from the state?). He may only pull down his shades if he has the proper coupon (such as a permitted tryst with O-90). He must take his daily constitutional walk with the rest of the city and watch the films supplied by the state.But D-503 is a man who believes in reason and the correctness of the state. He chews his food the suggested number of times before he swallows. He lives his life by the routine given to him by the state. He works to build the Integral, the first rocket ship to take reason to the stars. All seems perfect...until he meets I-330.I-330 shows him the power of desire and soon independent thought takes over his mind. He learns of a more primitive world that exists outside the glass walls of the city. He even begins to believe he should participate in the revolution against the state.And how does it all end? Well, I don't want to give too much away. Besides, there's so much more than I've even hinted at here. Do yourself a favor and read this book for yourself."},{"Title":"We","review":"The first anti-utopian fantasy, with glass towers, schedules and the 'Benefactor'. Here are the seeds of 'Brave New World' and '1984'. A study of human emotions or is the book about the final nail, the final step in the 'Revolution'? Yet beyond the glass walls are people who know nothing of schedules and are free. Unlike '1984' where the three nations of the world are really nothing more than twisted mirrors of each other and, therefore, offer nothing in the way of outside ideas nor a way of escape, 'WE' is a police state in a sea of unknown chaos. Will the outside forces break down the walls or will the State, having found a way to cure people of their souls, win in the end?"},{"Title":"We","review":"Where George Orwell's 1984 was an attack on Stalinism, We is an attack on Leninism. This makes it particularly uncomfortable to Communist apologists who like to blame the brutality of the Soviet Union on Stalin, while freeing Lenin of any respondsibility. Zamyatin contradicts any such whitewash; the &quot;Welldoer&quot; (Lenin), is still just a dictator. A prison, even a comfortable one, is still a prison. Individuality Zamyatin argues, is too high a price to pay for security. The writing is excellent, the story is timeless, and the novel is a triumph of both Science Fiction and political satire. This is the book that made &quot;liquidation&quot; a euphemism for murder"},{"Title":"We","review":"Read for a philosophy class in college, but I had fun with it. It's really amazing reading science fiction that's so old and seeing the similarities, both with our world today, and later science fiction. This book inspired 1984 and Brave New World."},{"Title":"We","review":"The book has as its obvious shelfmates Anthem by Ayn Rand and 1984 by George Orwell, but it is more lyrical, more hysterical, more stream-of-consciousness. I suppose Orwell's prose is stronger and Rand is certainly more direct, but I actually loved its dreamy and confusing style, and didn't mind not knowing what the hell was going on a lot of the time. It seemed more true that a journal entry from this future world, with its strange premises and priorities, would read as confusing and boggling to me. Sometimes I didn't know which end was up, and it almost felt like the narrator was writing blind. I think that was intentional and masterful. One of the best and most convincing aspects of the book was that the narrator didn't always seem in control.This book begins with the narrator not only a willing part of this world without individuals, but an enthusiastic supporter of these ideas. He isn't grimy and hopeless about it all (ahem, Winston Smith?); he's a cheerleader for the system. Of course, it all goes terribly awry.It occurred to me as I was comparing those three books that the oppressive, dystopian system never seems to break down for these people because of acquisition of material wealth. It doesn't break down because they don't like being told what pants to wear either. These characters, denied property, denied privacy, denied choice, do not rebel to get their own TV or to get their own bank account or their own window shades. They rebel to get their own girl. It's always love that breaks the system down, that sends the main character tangentially off, destroying himself to be alone with the woman he loves. Interesting. I wonder if that is really true. Maybe it just makes good books, to say that people will give up fortunes but not give up a mate. We'd have a harder time cheering for the grey little cog in the machine, who breaks out of his place so he can triumphantly and emotionally buy a Corvette. Love makes a good novel. But is that really how it would work? The characters in We are allowed to bed whoever they want -- they just have to register and receive a \\"pink coupon\\" to make it happen. Would people really bring the world down around their ears just to reinstate monogamy?"},{"Title":"We","review":"The book is remarkable for when it was written, at least as much as for what was written in it. First, though, the 'what' is well worth the attention.The setting is some time after a long and destructive war, within the enclave of the victors, or so they style themselves. They have created a technological heaven on earth, tamed the wind and waves to human use, and very nearly tamed the human animal. Nearly, but not quite. D-503 (the protagonist) is a driven man. First, he is driven to the most demanding feats of engineering achievement. Later, he is driven to the wildness of his passion by I-330, a woman who has manipulated the movers of that world to the edge of revolution. Other characters offer contrast; O-90, for example, is the archetypal woman: petite, soft, emotional, with an uncontrollable urge towards the crime of unauthorized motherhood.There are many ways in which this parallels Orwell's later 1984, down to the forced conversion of the protagonist at the end. This book predates Orwell's by over 20 years, however. It also predates Huxley's \\"Brave New World\\" with which it shares much, including technologically enforced, ineffectual happiness and the idea that everyone belongs to everyone else. Although Zamyatin's characters tend towards the one-sided, the book's situation is a good deal more complex than either Orwell's or Huxley's. What, for example, is that Green Wall? And what, beyond one glimpse, would we find behind it? This also raises the idea of the \\"Stockholm Syndrome\\" when an entire society is held captive. D seems to have an overwhelming sense of duty towards the state and its Benefactor, even when confession would mean his own destruction.Though generally good, I have reservations about aspects of the translation. Zamyatin seems to have had fair grasp of math and science, and used the square root of negative one as a metaphor. In this translation, that strange number is termed \\"irrational.\\" Modern English usage would call it \\"imaginary\\" instead, and irrationality would name a different property of numbers. That peculiarity makes no narrative difference, however, and the translation holds together well in other respects.Most interesting is that Zamyatin wrote this around 1920, after several run-ins with the early Communist government. He wrote with prescient authority about what he saw happening in his world, and this book was suppressed for many years. Although weaker in some ways than later, similar books, it carries first-hand passion as well as seniority in its genre. Anyone who reads 1984 should read this also, for the striking similarities as much as for the differences. Or just read \\"We\\" - it's worth it by itself.//wiredweird"},{"Title":"We","review":"We is an SF (speculative fiction) novel about a man living in a futuristic distopia, and is the predecessor to other distopian novels such as Brave New World and 1984. It was written in 1921 by Zamyatin in communist Russia and he was exiled because of it, but still managed to get it circulated throughout the world. The novel is written in a series of entries each beginning with a few set out topics and the number of the entry it is. The man is the builder of a new spaceship called the \`integral,' a ship whose purpose is to bring \\"mathematically infallible happiness\\" to galactic civilizations. He writes a journal to his ancestors before the \`one state' in which he lives, which makes the book unique and interesting to read.His writing style is interesting because of the entry format and his writing to the past from the future. The image that he is trying to is one of communism in Russia, and how it will become universal and almost unquestionable in the future. It contributes the element of big brother in 1984 just without the cameras; instead, they have everything made of a high-tech glass. In addition, it contributed the reservation system to Brave New World by having a jungle like world outside the walls of the city. It has the obvious theme of that someone is always watching, and questions if our world will become one state working for the common good.The whole society is based on happiness and making sure that no one is ever in a place were they want to rebel, but just in case there is a futuristic torture device. Of course, the narrator decides to rebel from the beginning of the novel, showing the theme that society as a whole cannot be completely contained even in a perfect ignorant society. The end though is very shocking and compares a lot to that of 1984, it is predictable if you have read 1984 but the ideas of the novel are way beyond its time.I cannot state that it is a better novel then 1984 or Brave New World it is just comparable and a wonderful worthwhile read. Its themes and ideas are way beyond its time especially for being written only in the beginnings of communism. We is a bold and strong novel that portrays what it sets out to and proves that communism or any government cannot hold down the human nature of rebellion. This novel is a testament of a man who saw the beginnings of the end in Russia and had the courage to stand out and write this great SF novel. His conviction and ideas are vividly portrayed because he was actually living in the beginnings of this, and I recommend this novel highly to any SF fan or curious reader, it is a great piece of literature and history."},{"Title":"We","review":"Inspiring and Passionate about the human condition.

I can't add to their editorial in a meaningful way, but suggest you add the following to your collection of utopian/anti-utopian (same thing) literature: &quot;Huckleberry Finn&quot;, by Mark Twain, and, &quot;Utopia&quot;, by ST Thomas More. There are many, many others, but these five comprise a good starting point. LOVE! Starla"},{"Title":"We","review":"This is a desperate plea to open ones eyes and view the stark truth of collectivism, totalitarianism, State control and the reduction of individuals to a cog in a wheel. Written from Russia in the early 20th century directly after the Red victory, it literally radiates with a forceful tale of evil in the guise of good. Worse, the evil thinks it is good.Modern totalitarian states are based on the premise of a Utopia - entites that are by their very nature static and unchanging. No surprises, no questioning, everything planned to the last nut and bolt. This utter predictability is a major drawing card for the masses since both democracy and capitalism are messy, unplanned, redundant yet gloriously effective in granting to the individual almost unlimited freedom.The novel reminds one of Anthem by Rand in its depiction of the solitary man attempting to rise above the herd. Then again, one hears echoes of 1984 and the everpresent voice of Big Brother. In all three cases, the State strives to eliminate any display of personal privacy. Remarkably, WE was completed long before either of these and holds up well today.Modern technology has allowed the State to become all powerful, all-intrusive, awesome in its ability to warp and trap the minds of human beings. The scariest messages today are those promising planned societies in which everyone has their place while the benevolent leaders care for us all - shades of North Korea.Russia has always been a collectivist nation from its earliest days. Whether it was tribe, religion, Party, economic class, ethnic class - the group was always paramoung over the individual. This book is a lesson we shun at our own peril."},{"Title":"We","review":"The main character, D-503, realizes something interesting: he has a soul. And it just so happens that he's the head-honcho behind the development of a spaceship called the Integral. In this &quot;utopia&quot; people live in glass domes--what an Arizonan like me would call a biosphere--and have no privacy, expect for certain special times. So there is definitely a heavy science fiction aspect to this work, quite amazing for 1920-21 Russia. One thing that really stuck out was how believable the main character--D-503--was. As a mathematician, he thinks in numbers and geometrical shape. Instead of saying of a table, &quot;it looked like a wooden animal&quot;, he might say something like, &quot;it looked like a rectangle sitting atop four cylinders.&quot; A small detail, but one worth noticing. As in Brave New World and 1984, the ending line has the power of a knife being driven into your stomach. I'll disagree that WE is better overall than BNW and 1984, but it a good book in its own little way. The writing style can be a little clunky--as is usually the case with translated works--but not terribly so. Yes, this is a good book, well worth your time, effort, and money."},{"Title":"We","review":"I have long been a fan of the 'dystopian' genre, and in my opinion this certainly ranks among the best. \\"We\\" is often compared to \\"1984\\" and \\"Brave New World\\", and although I think \\"We\\" is slightly inferior to both, I still would not hesitate to heartily recommend it to anyone who enjoyed either of those books. The premise for the society in the book is not the menacing security of Big Brother (although there is certainly some state security), nor is it the drug induced happiness of \\"Brave New World\\"'s some, but rather an interesting notion of a mathematically proved happiness whose value is infinity for all people.The book itself is written in quite a different format from either \\"1984\\" or \\"Brave New World\\"; it is told in a personal diary format. This is part of both the book's strength and weekness. It really makes the book for a quick, exciting, page turning read, but at times it feels like the author has to do a little stretching and straining of the personal narrative in order to convey some of the aspects of the society he is describing. That was probably the biggest problem I had with the book, but it is really something of a trifle, and it doesn't impact the flow of the story that badly. Again, I very much recommend this to fans of \\"Brave New World\\" and \\"1984\\", and if could give out partial ratings, I would say that this is a closer to a 4.5 star book."},{"Title":"We","review":"Eugene Zamitian's \\"We\\" is better than Huxley's \\"Brave New Worlds\\" and Orwell's\\"1984,\\" but is equal to Anthony Burgess' \\"The Wanting Seed.\\" The reader will not be disappointed after reading \\"We,\\" perhaps they will see a new world without privacy, especially when going through airport security when asked to take off their shoes by people who might also take those jobs because of having a foot fetish? \\"We\\" was written at the time the Soviet system was starting in Russia when Stalin inherited it from Lenin, a time not unlike now with people like U.S. Attorney General John Ashcroft, an equal of Laventrii Beria and an unelected leader, George the Second (George W. Bush, Jr.), and a conservative Republican regime, not a far cry from the dis-Utopia of Soviet Russia under Stalin who suppressed the writer's like Eugene Zamiatin, Bulgakov, and others. Perhaps we in this totalitarian regime will experience what the characters in \\"We\\" experienced with lack of privacy and freedom?"},{"Title":"We","review":"Anyone who reads &quot;We&quot; and &quot;Brave New World&quot; will notice an astounding number of similarities, enough to make one wonder whether Huxley borrowed a little more than he should have. Nonetheless, this is a pretty good apocalyptic novel. I would rank it somewhere above the aformentioned &quot;Brave New World&quot; and below &quot;1984&quot;. Perhaps the most interesting thing about the novel is the mathematical subtext. Zamyatin was a professional mathmetician and the names of his characters (which are numbers) supposedly are part of some master equation. Unfortunately, my Russian isn't up to reading the book in the original. Neither is my math, for that matter. But this is a quick read, very much a product of its time and location. It will probably take you an afternoon; and there are certainly worse ways to spend an afternoon."},{"Title":"We","review":"I have alot of interest in the books 1984, and Burgess's 1985 who also wrote Clockwork Orange.

Pick up the book and the CD. They both rock and are a mindasul"},{"Title":"We","review":"Since I was 12 years old and first read 1984, I have loved dystopian literature. When I was reminded of We while checking out the terrific wikipedia list of dystopian literature, I knew I had to read one of the classics in this subgenre. While 1984 and Brave New World are generally regarded as the English language classics, new entries such as Hunger Games and Margaret Atwood's terrific Oryx and Crake and The Year of the Flood have reinvigorated interest in a world turned upside down.Like many other dystopias, We is written from a first-person perspective where the narrator slowly figures out the holes in the mythology of the world he/she is living in. One of my main problems with the book was the pacing - at the beginning, it was so slow I bought another dystopia, began to read it, and then had guilty pangs of conscience and returned to We. The second half really clips along and is well-nuanced, subtle and engaging, especially on a philosophical level.!!SPOILER'ALERT!!My second issue was I-330 - at a certain point, it seems like she is an imaginary aspect of our narrator. Her disappearance from the Ancient House seemed a bit contrived and I was caught thinking this was a Fight Club/Tyler Durden progenitor. This was not a major issue and may have been me reading too much into the book, but I felt it was a bit unclear; not that clarity is always needed, but to drop clues that this might be happening and then have it clearly not be true was disconcerting.!!SPOILER OVER!!My third issue is one of the limited knowledge of our narrator - at times, he seems to know nothing of Ancient Man - the man of the modern era, or of the era before OneState. But then, he will describe a character as looking like Socrates. There were a number of other logical errors like those one, where the character will make a reference to something that we are led to believe he does not know about.This book is terrific, and could make a great movie. But it is hard to read after enjoying Atwood's aforementioned works. Her superiority as a storyteller (in terms of pacing, consciousness, emotion) and a writer (Zamyatin's prose is lacking and a bit bland) make it hard to appreciate this classic. For teachers interested in teaching literature, perhaps use this as the intro, followed by 1984 and Brave New World. Just as a reader of Tolstoy should work through War and Peace before devouring Anna Karenina, in this case, the original is surpassed by its descendants.We is a work of literature that survives based on its ideas and influence, not on the merits of its writing alone."},{"Title":"The New Heir's Guide to Managing Your Inheritance","review":"This is a fine resource, though a virtually verbatim adaptation, using Canadian $ and tax law, of the earlier &quot;Managing Your Inheritance&quot; by Card and Miller. Unless you are inheriting in Canada, get the Card and Miller book...."},{"Title":"The Daughter of Time","review":"This is not really a mystery. It is a very cleverly written exoneration of Richard III. Tey and a great many historians today believed that whatever Richared was; he wasn't a child killer. Tey puts the blame squarely on Henry VI and she is probably correct. I enjoyed the cleverness of the idea and the sharpness of the writing but I didn't care for the smug snobbery or the religious predjudice."},{"Title":"The Daughter of Time","review":"All the ingredients for complete satisfaction with this book seemed to be in place: I love Josephine Tey (anyone that hasn't read The Singing Sands is missing out on the most beautifully written, thoughtful and perceptive mystery ever, I think); I'm very familiar with the names and dates of sixteenth- and fifteenth-century England, my country, and yet, I found myself losing interest in this book. Here, the characters, particularly the character of Inspector Grant, really take a back seat to the story of Richard III... and it turns out to be less a story than a polemic. This is a good old-fashioned political pamphlet, five hundred years out of date perhaps, but no less impassioned for that -- asking us, imploring us, to redeem the reputation of an 'evil' king. And why? Well, 'king' is a very powerful word in the English language (indeed, in any language), and it is especially exalted in England. The king has a spiritual demension -- he is anointed, after all, he is set apart from other men -- and for a king to be a base murderer of innocents is a grave, unforgivable betrayal of the generosity, loyalty, and even love that the people give to their king. Conversely, to wrong a king by misreading him, by being fooled by his usurper's self-serving propaganda: This is also a sort of crime. Josephine Tey's devotion to her country, and to the kingship that is so much a part of it, is understandable and even, in this who-cares, debunking post-modern world, even laudable; yet it gets in the way of a good read. After one has read her scornful reference to 'the sainted Thomas More' once or twice, one feels like saying, 'All right, Josephine, we get the point: You don't think Thomas deserves the praise'; but it goes on and on. At one point Inspector Grant says to himself (I'm paraphrasing): 'Get a hold on yourself. You're becoming partisan.' Only becoming partisan? Who is she/he kidding? He was partisan from the beginning. So I'm afraid the book didn't grip me, because I learned very early on where! she stood on this issue of Richard's guilt or virtue, and I'm afraid I don't agree. My feeling is, by the way, that Tey's views are not politically well-informed and thus naive: it was dog-eat-dog in those times: if you were a king you had clear the field of possible pretenders (that's rival claimants to the throne, for you Americans), and if you were a claimant you lived in constant fear for your life. No one could afford to be lily-white."},{"Title":"The Daughter of Time","review":"the book is very boring for my taste but its essential for what you may have to study for the class."},{"Title":"The Daughter of Time","review":"Touted as &#34;The greatest dectective story ever written,&#34; it was a very tangled story unraveling the mysterious death of Richard III's nephews.

This is a mystery novel that deals a lot with English History and Old Kings and stuff, whic is something that I just don't mesh with. On a scale of one to ten I would have to rate this book a three. The reading was a bit hard, and I often found myself counting the pages until I was finished. Though I usually love mystery, this one was definitely a disappointment on countless levels. The book was written well and I think that if I had been a tad bit older and wiser on English History that I may have enjoyed it more. Overall I think that I would personally have to give the book two thumbs down."},{"Title":"The Daughter of Time","review":"This book was assigned to my class as part of a summer assignment. My teacher assigned the book to illustrate how history is distorted and to teach us how we should interpret historical documents and textbooks. I felt the fictional aspect was extremely boring and repetitive."},{"Title":"The Daughter of Time","review":"Actually, Tey would likely be pleased at me saying she is not a historian since, according to her, historians are \\"silly\\" -- among those many people with no common sense or psychological acuity and inability to reason properly. In this book, as in others by Tey, she shows herself to be a misanthrope (with a special emphasis on misogyny). She's a Tory who prefers people to know their place, and believes that sparing the rod spoils the child. She's condescending and smug about her Inspector Alan Grant's realization that Richard III can't have killed his nephews because -- first of all -- he doesn't *look* like a murderer... !In this book, Grant is bedbound with a broken leg and, to entertain him when he ungraciously rejects the books given him, a friend brings him \\"pictures of faces\\" associated with some historical mystery. One of these is a portrait alleged to depict Richard III, and before he looks at the name Grant decides this is the face of some distinguished person, likely someone on the bench rather than in the dock (disturbingly, Tey appears to believe that anyone in the dock is a criminal -- no presumption of innocence for her).So, Grant is quite surprised to find that his thoughtful, judicial person is actually Richard III, presumed murderer of his nephews (so-called the Princes in the Tower). Puzzled, Grant spends hours wondering how he could be so wrong and soon delving into histories of the period to find out why. A reader might easily think that all this angst is more about Grant finding himself wrong in his (apparently infallible) ability to read faces, so a minor character asks Grant \\"but surely you don't believe in reading faces\\", and Grant assures him/us that no, he doesn't -- but clearly he does, disclaimers to the contrary. This is really annoying for those who don't believe in phrenology and who might find Grant's/Tey's crush on a picture and post hoc attempt to heroize its subject embarrassing.Grant's actress friend Marta follows up the pictures with a \\"woolly lamb\\" -- an American lad called Brent Carradine who acts as Grant's legs in undertaking research at places like the British Museum. When the lamb finds out discouraging evidence, e.g. that there were contemporary records of rumours that Richard had done away with the princes, Grant easily finds explanations pointing to his chosen villain, Henry VII, instead.This book has generally been praised as a unique detective novel, which it is -- just not a very good one, Actually, it is hardly detection at all, since few of the staples on which detectives rely is present. And it certainly isn't history either for the same reason.I listened to this book on Audible, and that was awful. Despite heroic efforts by the reader, Derek Jacobi, the book's faults were highlighted -- especially Tey's condescending attitude toward the lower classes (for instance, nurses) and the absurd dialogues between Carradine and Grant, in which Carradine typically reports evidence and Grant spins it to prove not only that Richard couldn't have killed his nephews but would've been one of England's most enlightened kings. This is really ahistorical and goes further to support that Tey had a fangirl crush on Richard, and wrote this book to support it.I read this book in paperback a while back, and drew many of the same conclusions. I mean, whether you are a writer of detective stories or a historian it's just going to sound ridiculous when you say that such-and-such an act was \\"deeply silly\\", and \\"Whatever he was, Richard wasn't silly.\\" Really? Seriously? That wouldn't go down well in a history paper *or* in the Old Bailey, I should imagine."},{"Title":"The Daughter of Time","review":"This book is very clever and well-written, and when I first read it at the age of about sixteen I found it totally convincing. Yes, yes, of course Richard was a nice man, of course he was innocent. It wasn't until year later when I read some real history books on the subject that I realised that the book is not sound history. A bedridden police inspector decides Richard must be innocent because he likes his face? That seems to me an extremely dangerous supposition to start from. If it was possible to tell if a person was guilty or innocent merely by looking at their face,then we could do away with trial by jury altogethere &quot;yes, m'lud, he's innocent, just look at his face&quot;. Richard III usurped the throne from his nephews, imprisoned them in the tower, then they just happened to dissapear, whoops, he mislaid them? Just coincidence/ I don't think so.

He's fascinated by one portrait in particular - a man with a face full of suffering. Shocked to discover that it is Richard III, the Beast who murdered his nephews in order to secure his right to the throne, Grant embarks on a full-scale historical investigation to uncover the truth surrounding this atrocity.This book was slow to start, but once Grant was engaged with uncovering the mystery, it was like an avalanche. The story completely swept me away. I have to admit that despite being a history major, I successfully avoided most of the British and European history classes offered by my college. (I specialized in Middle Eastern history.) Because of this, I don't know how much credence to lend Josephine Tey's theory of what really occurred, but the evidence laid out in this little book seems very compelling. Whether she's right or not, she successfully lit a fire under me to pick up some Brit history. Double win!Well-thought out, interesting book. 4.5 out of 5 stars."},{"Title":"The Daughter of Time","review":"This is supposed to be Tey's Magnum opus and, indeed, it is a fine and unique British mystery, a pillar of the genre; however, I think it's more of a writer's book than a reader's book in that it's artfully conveyed but atypical of cosy murder formulas.Here, Inspector Grant is hospitalized, taken out of action, with a broken leg. In an effort to keep him entertained, a murder investigation is laid in his lap... a very old one. Based upon his renowned skills as a crime solver, he's challenged to discover whether or not Richard III actually murdered his nephews, a long standing British legend.Thus, the story is sort of told in retrospect and there is quite a lot of historical filler in order to arm the unapprised with the background of the orginal saga.I first read this book (1997) as an assignment for a western culture class. I have since read it again recreationally. As I said, it's a fine mystery but, because this title was so very popular, Tey seems to have gotten tagged with it as this being her \\"personal writing style\\". As a result of this paradigm, the bulk of her notable other works are intermittently viewed by some as being inferior in quality, which they are definitely not. I think that this dichotomy is more demonstrative of Tey's versatility as a writer.The Scottish Josephine Tey (real name, Elizabeth Mackintosh, 1896-1952), was taken from us far too soon and so she did not ultimately yield all that many books when we compare her to, say, Dorothy L. Sayers or Agatha Christie. I find that her books fall into two categories, albeit they are all mysteries: Arty Mysteries and Cosy Murders. So, if you like \\"The Daughter of Time\\" you'll probably also savor \\"Brat Farrar\\". But if you prefer the more stereotypical British murder mystery, read \\"The Man in the Queue,\\" \\"A Shilling for Candles,\\" or, \\"The Singing Sands\\".I much recommend \\"The Daughter of Time\\" for fans of the genre."},{"Title":"The Daughter of Time","review":"In Josephine Tey's The Daughter of Time a policeman is confined to a hospital bed, literally unable to sit upright, and from that bed he solves a double homicide committed four hundred years before. The crime scene is sixteen generations out of date, there is no surviving forensic evidence, and the chroniclers of the time prospered through patronage, which could and did influence their reporting.The plot is perfectly paced and sustaining of tension throughout, an extraordinary accomplishment when you realize that the facts of the case have been known for over four centuries. Characters range from that intelligent, charming protagonist, Inspector Alan Grant of Scotland Yard, to the much-maligned Richard III himself. And then there are the dead-on and frequently devastating sidelights that have nothing to do with plot and everything to do with condition and culture, as in this description of the pile of books Grant's friends have brought him in hospital:...the public talked about \`a new Silas Weekly' or \`a newLavinia Fitch' exactly as they talked about \`a new brick'or \`a new hairbrush.'...Their interest was not in the bookbut in its newness. They knew quite well what the bookwould be like.Ouch. After that, I won't even mention Tey's character assassinations of Mary, Queen of Scots and Sir Thomas More."},{"Title":"The Daughter of Time","review":"A good example of how the Creation of Official History, plus a witty, popular play by Shakespeare can heavily influence public opinion and obscure truth. Or more simply put: History is written by the winners. A little comparison. One monarch created the right to post bail & protection against jury intimidation and tampering. The other is known for the Star Chamber & Morton's Fork(a clever ploy to increase taxation.) Henry was also the first English king to have a personal bodyguard."},{"Title":"The Daughter of Time","review":"This is a wonderful genre bending book...part mystery, part history. Written by Scotswoman Elizabeth MacIntosh, who wrote under the pen name Josephine Tey, it was first published in 1951. It is tragic that the author died in 1952 and was never to know the pleasure that this book would bring to generations of readers and that the Mystery Writers of America would ultimately rank it fourth among the one hundred best mysteries ever written.The title of the book is derived from a historical source, as it is attributable to Sir Francis Bacon, \\"For truth is rightly named after the daughter of time, and not of authority.\\" The book itself is not a traditional mystery but rather an application of deductive reasoning to an actual historical event. The event in question is the murder of the princes in the tower, sons of King Edward IV, allegedly by their uncle, Richard III, who eventually usurped the English throne after the death of his brother. It has been widely held that Richard III did, indeed, murder the two young princes, his nephews, in order to secure his claim to the throne.The reader is introduced to Scotland Yard Inspector Alan Grant, who is hospitalized and recovering from injuries sustained in the line of duty. While convalescing, he becomes intrigued by a picture of a portrait of Richard III, a likeness with which he is unfamiliar. Grant is puzzled that someone with such a sensitive face could have been such a monster as to murder his two nephews in cold blood. So, our intrepid Inspector decides that he will reconsider the evidence upon which such a dastardly assumption has been based. With the help of an American researcher doing the necessary legwork, Grant compiles enough archival historical fact that incrementally helps him formulate a new theory as to who actually may have murdered the princes in the tower.This analysis and reformulation is done as though it were being argued to a jury. Indeed, so persuasive is Inspector Grant through the application of some insightful deductive reasoning and clever dialogue that the reader comes away thinking that Grant has solved one of the most intriguing historical mysteries of all time. This is certainly an unusual book conceptually but one that succeeds brilliantly. It should appeal to those readers who enjoy having a mystery unraveled, as well as to those who harbor a love of English history. Bravo!"},{"Title":"The Daughter of Time","review":"In one of the finest examples of historical research and logical thinking I have ever read; Josephine Tey proves beyond any doubt that history tells lies. In reexamining the reign of King Richard the Third through the mind of a Scotland Yard Detective,we get an entirely clear and logical look at the historical facts, and solve one of History's greatest mysteries. If you lovehistorical mystery novels, get this one ASAP!"},{"Title":"The Daughter of Time","review":"It took me too long to finally get to Josephine Tey's The Daughter of Time. I gulp down mystery novels whole and I devour unreservedly every scrap of British royal history so what could be more appropriate than this classic. Perhaps I have read too many actual works of history, albeit of the wonderful pop variety kind of Alison Weir, that have refuted Tey's conclusions. I was delighted from the moment I began the book. It was more clever and far more humourous than I had anticipated and I could not recommend it more highly (although I still have doubts about the verdict reached). I have no doubts, though, about the journey. It was pure, unfettered joy."},{"Title":"The Daughter of Time","review":"Never having heard of Josephine Tey, I purchased this book and another, &quot;Brat Farrar&quot; on the strength of the description.I have since read several other of the Tey collection, and I find them wonderful. Not a &quot;mystery&quot; in the usual sense, this is a novel which contains a so-called mystery. In other of her works, her Inspector Grant follows more conventional lines of investigating crimes. If you like one of Tey's books, I thinkyou will like them all. I highly recommend them."},{"Title":"The Daughter of Time","review":"&quot;The Daughter of Time&quot; is a wonderful book but not without its difficulties. On the plus side is the way the laid-up detective slowly deduces the riddle of who killed the two nephews, and he does so without using traditional histories. We definitely get a feel that the &quot;great man&quot; theory of history is frequently, if not almost always, wrong, because everything he reads--from a children's schoolbook to Sir Thomas More--portrays Richard III as a vicious hunchback and poor administrator who had his nephews slaughtered for no good reason, but in reality none of that is likely to be true. This book invents (or, more likely, popularizes) social history, using things like diary entries, bills of lading, doctors' notes and the like to ascertain where people were situated and how they lived. On the other hand, traditional histories are motivated by politics and emotion and tend to flatter or condemn, and then those errors are perpetuated down through the centuries.On the minus side, for Americans at least, are that this book reads best if you carry some background knowledge of the York/Lancaster &quot;Wars of the Roses&quot; of the late 15th century with you, also some idea of rights of inheritance and succession. (Precisely the things those of us who live in a republic don't need to know!) There is, at least, a genealogical table at the beginning of the book."},{"Title":"The Daughter of Time","review":"As an early modern historian, well, a student of history, I have to give this book only 3 stars. But as a reader, I give it five stars. My first year of university was dominated by studies of The Wars of the Roses and Richard III - in English and History. A friend gave me a copy of Ms. Tey's book and it got me thinking about the bad rap Richard III has got. I have since delved deeper into the mystery, at least as far as the resources of the University of Western Australia's library will allow, (and this is a lot as it has a fantastic collection of History resources), and have decided that Richard III wasn't AS bad as he is made out to be. The Daughter of Time is an entertaining and thought provoking fiction. I reccommend it for all amatuer historians out there. It opens your eyes to the bias of history."},{"Title":"The Daughter of Time","review":"I read \\"The Daughter of Time\\" as an adolescent, joined the Richard III Society in my twenties, wandered around Bosworth Field at thirty. Found Derek Jacobi's recording at a book sale last year and have listened to it many times since. Hearing a well-narrated book that you previously embraced while reading it is a unique pleasure. The opposite of loving a book, hating the movie. I am sorry that Derek Jacobi recorded no other Inspector Grant than this single book. His Inspector Grant is much different that Stephen Thorne's - they could never be mistaken for each other, and Stephen Thorne's is also brilliant."},{"Title":"The Daughter of Time","review":"This is a wonderful genre bending book...part mystery, part history.

The story is told in an intelligent manner and seems to logically solve the mystery. Until I read another theory on these two little princes I find more believable I'll stick with this one!"},{"Title":"The Daughter of Time","review":"Josephine Tey wrote this in the 1950s, an examination of the place of Shakespeare's arch-villain King Richard III in history, as a detective story of a kind. The attitudes it reveals are dated, and the environment in which the book is set (a hospital) quaint social history. But the story she explores is exciting, challenging and will change your mind about the history you learned at school and never questioned afterwards. My only quibble is that the most famous picture of Richard III, in which he is shown putting on or taking off a ring and in which it can clearly be seen that he has one shoulder higher than the other, which is much referred to in the book, is not the one used on the cover. Read this book, it will change your mind."},{"Title":"The Daughter of Time","review":"Confined to a hospital bed, Josephine Tey's inquisitive Inspector Grant is given a handful of portraits to study while recuperating. Grant prides himself in being able to &quot;read&quot; people's faces. When he shows one picture to his surgeon, the doctor surmises the man had been a victim of polio, perhaps a merchant. Grant's nurses know better &amp; declare the man to be England's Wicked Uncle, Richard III. This surprises the good Inspector because when first setting eyes upon the portait, he had opined that it was perhaps a judge.Only upon turning the paper over does he discover it was indeed England's most reviled king -- he who had killed his nephews in the Tower of London &amp; died at the Battle of Bosworth bellowing for a horse, as per The Bard in his play penned a century later.In search of facts, Inspector Grant discounts the records of two of histories greatest luminaries (&amp; gossips, for neither Thomas More nor William Shakespeare were there), to discover the truth about this much-maligned king, who was mourned by his subjects &amp; ruled his short reign with a fair &amp; generous hand.Learn from THE DAUGHTER OF TIME about how to look for the real history behind the winners' versions -- the incoming Tudors -- who survived, what families were killed off, what were the coverups &amp; what the Wars of the Roses was all about. Revisit the real far past, as well as 1950s England (long before cell phones &amp; computers), when this little mystery rattled many a historian's cage.Vastly entertaining &amp; beautifully read by the great thespian Derek Jacobi, of GADFAEL &amp; I CLAUDIUS fame."},{"Title":"The Daughter of Time","review":"First - I should say that I rarely give even the books I enjoy five stars. Of mysteries, this novel, Murder on the Orient Express, and the Westing Game (as a kids book) are the only ones which would rate five stars in my book.The thing that distinguishes Tey from other mystery writers is that each book is original in format and theme. She does not write books such as most of Christie's Hercule Poirot series where the same thing always happens (you read confusing elements and become more and more flummoxed, until the end when Poirot pulls the answer to the riddle out of thin air.) Each of Tey's novels builds and reveals itself differently. I want to put a plug in here for Tey as an excellent classic mystery author.That being said, Daughter of Time is her best work. She brillinantly captures the aura of mystery that surrounds a historian when she is researching a topic for the first time. I first read this book after I had been researching the development of cultural mythology, so the book resonated with me personally, but I think that anyone should appreciate the originality of using this theme for a mystery.As the book progresses the tension level rises and new twists keep you glued to the pages. Her side characters are also an interesting commentary on the meaning, impact, and value of truth. I could say more, but I don't want to reveal the plot.This book is original, insightful and well-written. I recommend it for mystery lovers bored with formulaic novels and for non-mystery readers who will simply appreciate the book on its own merits."},{"Title":"The Daughter of Time","review":"I read this in two evenings. That means I found it interesting, even though the setting of the book is quite different from most mysteries that I enjoy -- although, as an historian, I found the &quot;detective's method&quot; was portrayed quite accurately. It was interesting to see that Ms. Tey has developed a theory as to why, after theories have been proven historically inaccurate, the theory continues to be held to as Gospel Truth. Tandypony. I think I will remember that phrase -- especially as many items in American history seem to fall into that category. Not exciting, nor thrilling, The Daughter of Time is well worth the time it takes to read."},{"Title":"The Daughter of Time","review":"I am not surprised that The Daughter of Time is one of Josephine Tey's most loved and revered books. This is a mystery book, but it is also a quite absorbing historical tale. In this book we examine, along with Chief Inspector Alan Grant, the age-old question about Richard III of England. Was he indeed the monster that we all have assumed he was from history books and from Shakespeare, or was he a very unfortunate political pawn? Inspector Grant is lying in a hospital bed and in order to reliev his boredom, he embarks on a journey to solve this mystery. With the help of a young American reserch assistant, they actually determine that the whole story of Richard III's infamy is suspect. It is truly sad that Ms. Tey's life was cut short so soon after the publication of this book. She was a truly great novelist, and we are blessed for having her works in our libraries."},{"Title":"The Daughter of Time","review":"Josephine Tey's heroic Inspector Grant finds himself literally flat on his back in hospital: the result of his previous adventure. Unable to engage his mind on a case in the police blotter, he stumbles on mystery that is 500 years old. Who killed the princes in the Tower?Part historical tableau, &quot;Daughter of Time&quot; is a true detective story. Just because the witnesses are long dead, written accounts remain and Grant's (i.e. Tey's) exegesis separates fact from propaganda. Intermixed with the history are Tey's charming cast of characters more reminiscent of a Noel Coward comedy than a traditional British mystery. Characters appear cliche at first introduction, but become more supple as the novel and Grant's recovery progresses.Having the benefit of Derek Jacobi's narration, the players in the story are quite vivid. This is most appreciated early in the novel when the reader is introduced to the several characters of the cast at once. Later, Grant has moments of reflective solitude, and Jacobi ably translates this quiet time.It is no wonder that this book is very popular. There is a little something for everyone. Fans of historical fiction get their fill. Students of history can learn the importance of first hand accounts. It still is very much a detective novel, and the characters are all likeable. (The one true bad guy has been dead since the 16th century.) It even carries the banner of a moral crusade: the pursuit of truth and the defeat of tonypandy.But Jacobi's narration enlightens one of the drawbacks of this work. Just when the incidental characters -- the ones that will not appear in the next Grant adventure -- develop, the story ends. Unlike Grant and his regular cronies who have been sketched and shaped in previous stories, these new people grow with the reader. We like them and miss them when the novel ends. And &quot;Daughter of Time&quot; does end abruptly. The case is closed, and the colorful world of the last Plantagenets and first Tudors is closed with it."},{"Title":"The Daughter of Time","review":"This book deserves far more public acknowledgement.

An excellent book."},{"Title":"The Daughter of Time","review":"Thanks to Radio 4 book show & Mr Hitchens recommendation, I discovered this gem if a book. Have read many books on Richard III and this one is near the top of my list. The facts are all there, and prove, once again, what we in York have known all along, that Richard is a much maligned man who would have been a great king. Instead we got saddled with the odious Henry VII and hus murderous, lecherous son, Henry VIII, who was only redeemed by the daughter he tried so hard to keep from the throne. If you have read and enjoyed Sharon Penmans classic, 'The Sunne in Splendour', then you must read this book."},{"Title":"The Daughter of Time","review":"This is a very topical book, despite its having been written more than 60 years ago about a man who died more than 500 years ago. I had been meaning to read it for 40 years but the discovery of the skeleton in the car park in Leicester finally prompted me to do it. It did not disappoint. A fascinating historical investigation into whether Richard III did or did not murder the princes in the Tower, and it teaches you not to take at face value what you are told by people in authority. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Daughter of Time","review":"Yes, everyone. I mean it. Tey's storytelling is terrific. Her arguments in favor of Richard's innocence are compelling. Far more important, however, is her brilliant ability to help us truly understand what it means for history to be written by the victors. Anyone who reads this books and does not spend some time re-examining his or her own biases is just missing the point."},{"Title":"The Daughter of Time","review":"I'm no expert when it comes to English history, the monarchy, etc. I've read a couple of Agatha Christies and wanted something a little different from the usual whodunnit. This was recommended to me in a message board, as a 'detective story for those who aren't into that sort of thing'. I'm more than glad I tried it, even if I had to read up a bit on Richard III and the War of the Roses to prepare.First off, I love how straightforward this book is, how simple language is used (no high-faluting words to confuse readers like me) and how it manages to be fast paced even if most of it consists of dialogue. It really was an interesting read and the author obviously did a load of research. Research she was able to put into writing without making it boring for those who aren't into history- a nice consideration. Most of the time, all we hear about, read about and watch about is Henry VIII this, Elizabeth Tudor that, Mary Queen of Scots this, Thomas More that...it's about time we got to focus on someone who got the short end of the stick. This book is more than the usual murder mystery. In a way, it teaches us to question what is taught to us by institutions that aren't always free of bias and to give someone the benefit of the doubt, especially if this someone's circumstances weren't favorable and made him/her an easy target for the 'victors.' While this is a fictional account, I'm now more than willing to keep an open mind when it comes to these things and right now, I want to read up more on Richard. I'm glad that (based on what I've seen online) many other people have come to realize that he probably wasn't the monster the Tudors made him out to be and that Shakespeare's account of him is so exaggerated. Murderer or not, at the very least, people have come to a point that they don't just accept things because the big guys tell them to.Hopefully, someone produces a film that doesn't portray Richard as a monster, but as a normal man, with flaws and all."},{"Title":"The Daughter of Time","review":"I was exploring Edogawa Rampo and Seishi Yokomizo when I found this book by sheer accident. It proved to be the most wonderful detective story I ever read. In fact it could not be classified as a detective story at all, being more like the story of how two non-historians doing historical research and were then puzzled by how professional historians doing serious historical research. I say serious historical research because I do believe this is how professional historians typically do it. I had a professor in ancient Roman history who helped me in the writing of an essay on the Byzantine Iconoclasm. I intentionally disregarded all information sources related to lives of great saints during the period I studied, because I thought them too fantastic to be reliable, and therefore not at all eligible to be evidences for my arguments. My professor then asked why I didn't use materials about the lives of great saints. I said I was disgusted with authors spending half of their time trying to record nonexistent events, such as how a saint's birth was a blessing from God, how a saint with the help of God repelled a whole army, how a saint with the blessing of God brought people back to life and made old people younger and so on. My pro. said contemporary accounts must be scrutinized with a pair of \\"contemporary\\" eyes. If the contemporary believed those accounts, historians should \\"believe\\" it and they were qualified evidences for my research in iconoclasm, however fantastic might they be. I was shocked. I did cite lives of great saints in my essay in the end. Now come to think of it, after finishing reading this book, isn't that the way most historians do research? to shun modern analytical methods; to present the perspectives and analyses of contemporaries. However the saddest thing about their approach is that even the most erudite historian could not faithfully present a \\"contemporarized\\" account of a period much earlier than that of his own. The Daughter of Time is masterpiece in its plot and more importantly, in that it constantly reminds one that sometimes history is more dramatic than novels, sometimes more farcical than novels. And at the end, kudos to Inspector Grant. Most wise of him not to concern about historical studies any longer."},{"Title":"The Daughter of Time","review":"Tonypandy is a town in South Wales where in 1910 an all-out labor riot took place.

His friend Marta Hallard, a woman of the Theatre who has adopted Grant as a \\"spare escort,\\" brings him flowers and books and suggests that instead of spending his days gazing at the ceiling in boredom, he become a bed-bound sleuth and a solve a mystery no one has ever been able to solve. \\"You could do some academic investigating,\\" she says. \\"Finding a solution to an unsolved problem.\\"Marta brings in a collection of pictures including a National Picture Gallery portrait of Richard III. Grant is captivated by the face of the king whose appearance doesn't match his portrayal as a monster, the destroyer of innocence. Grant sees a portrait of \\"Someone too conscientious. A worrier; perhaps a perfectionist. A man at ease in large design but anxious over details.\\"And so the sleuthing begins. With the help of a young American researcher Brent Carradine, Grant digs into the historical record and finds documentation that paints Richard in a different light and points to other suspects in the princes' disappearance and presumed murder.During Grant's historical investigation, conducted while he's flat on his back, questions uncover new fact and facts begin to lead to truth and a different reality emerges, about Richard's deformity, about the death of the princes. It's a fascinating detective story that leads to a plausible conclusion about the real Richard and the name of the person behind the dual murder.Tey wants us to believe that what we read in the history books is not necessarily the way things happened. In convincing us she tells a riveting tale that unfolds through dialogue and banter. It's a fascinating book for its humor, its subject matter and for providing a conclusive solution to a mystery that has remained unsolved for more than four centuries.I believe I now know beyond a reasonable doubt who did the deed in The Tower.

I couldn't really believe that this lovely man could do such a thing to his nephews. It was totally out of character. And after reading Tey's brilliant book, I am even more convinced.

The event in question is the murder of the princes in the tower, sons of King Edward IV, allegedly by their uncle, Richard III, who eventually usurped the English throne after the death of his brother. It has been widely held that Richard III did, indeed, murder the two young princes, his nephews, in order to secure his claim to the throne.The reader is introduced to Scotland Yard Inspector Alan Grant, who is hospitalized and recovering from injuries sustained in the line of duty.

This is not a story for the passive reader, as it randomly visits different points in time, both &quot;present&quot; and past and invokes a series of questions which are ultimatley never answered. The most intiguing element is the supposition that history's account of King Richard III is flawed, either by purposeful acts of those who opposed him, or by mere consequence of events. &quot;Daughter of Time&quot; is quite difficult to follow at times and is best read when one is fully alert; a nice pot of hot tea or coffee will help. Not recommended for junior readers unless mystery is their forte'; the story is severely lacking in action although the tale is quite adventurous. See if you can unravel the mystery, if at all possible, then read &quot;Spring Moon&quot; by Bette Bao-Lord for a refreshing look at the opposite end of the world/political spectrum."},{"Title":"The Daughter of Time","review":"I listened to the audio version of this book and was enchanted from the beginnning. Derek Jacobi is engrossing as Detective Grant.I found myself listening and becoming steadily wrapped up in his research as he tried to unravel the mystery of Richard III.My only regret is that it ended. I wanted it to go on for a lot longer."},{"Title":"The Daughter of Time","review":"It's a little deceiving to consider this book a mystery novel in the traditional sense; it's much more of an historical study. The topic itself is fascinating: was Richard III the murdering, amoral monster that Shakespeare made him out to be, or was he merely misunderstood? Tey makes a cogent and compelling argument that Richard did not, in fact, murder his young nephews in the Tower of London, nor possess the negative qualities so often ascribed to him. Her historical analysis is cleverly contained in a contemporary setting; Inspector Alan Grant of Scotland Yard is laid up in hospital and sets his mind to figuring out the conundrum of Richard III while he recuperates. Grant enlists the help of a young American researcher; dialogues between the two and Grant's internal analysis form the &quot;action&quot; or &quot;plot&quot; of the story. If you are in the mood for a classic whodunit, a body in library-type mystery, this is not your cup of tea -- no one in Grant's time is murdered and his &quot;solving&quot; of the crime is only speculation. If you like history and have an open mind about Richard III, this is a well-written, well-researched and well-argued book. One thing I had trouble with was the author's assumption that the reader is familiar with much more of English history than I was, so at times, I was a bit overwhelmed by the names and references I didn't always get. If, after finishing &quot;Daughter of Time,&quot; you're interested in learning more about Richard III, try &quot;Royal Blood,&quot; by Bertram Fields as a good and thorough overview, with arguments both pro- and anti-Richard set forth."},{"Title":"The Daughter of Time","review":"This book definatly focuses more on character than action (unlike most mysteries, no one's life is endangered), but I found the combination of intellectual passion and frustration that drives Grant more than enough to make me want to keep turning the pages.

Can someone tell me why its called &quot;The Daughter of Time&quot;?"},{"Title":"The Daughter of Time","review":"Curling up with this combine of history, mystery and Shakespeare was a real treat. I'm not overly familiar with the mystery genre or the era of history she's exploring, and was totally unfamiliar with Ms. Tey, so it was all a pleasant surprise. That was two years ago and I'm still so pleased to have read this book. Regrettably, the really good ones seem to show up with less and less frequency...."},{"Title":"The Daughter of Time","review":"Not Tonypandy, site of early 20th century riots by coal miners. But when Tey wrote this fine mystery (1951), the conventional wisdom about Tonypandy was all wrong. The challenge of accepted but inaccurately recorded historical events becomes a major theme for Scotland Yard's hospitalized Inspector Alan Grant, and Tonypandy comes to be the word Grant uses with his researcher to reflect such historical error. Grant is a skilled reader of faces, and when presented a portrait of disgraced former King Richard III, he embarks on a four hundred year old case to determine the validity (and method used if it's true) of the accusation that Richard III killed his own nephews, an idea perpetuated in common belief and English history books. With the unlikely aid of an unexpected source, Brent Carradine, an American studying at the British Museum, Grant applies police procedure to investigate the accusations. Tey deftly lays out the case point by point. Grant, Carradine, and Grant's visitors and nurses are established well. The writing is lovely and clear. The only thing keeping this from being five stars is about me, not the book. There were times when my ignorance of British history and leaders interfered with my understanding of the relationships of those surrounding Richard. Wonderful writing, pacing, characters, and analysis makes this a thoroughly enjoyable read. If you are willing to doubt the veracity of recorded, accepted history, that's gravy here, and you'll like this all the better. I will definitely be looking for more of Tey and of Gordon Daviot, another pseudonym, like Tey, of Elizabeth MacKintosh."},{"Title":"The Daughter of Time","review":"We tend to believe that the history we are taught, certainly at least in regard to the major figures and events, is as actual and factual as any hard science. In fact, the narratives of history, even the common structures about which there seems to be scant controversy, are in great measure opinions bequeathed to us by power brokers in justification of the continuation of their power and our subservience to it. This little entertaining book, presented as a novella, tears the cover off of this charade and once you have read it you will never be able to relax back into the quasi sleep of mass societal amnesia from which it has awakened you. While the story here is the pursuit of the truth of Richard III, who we all \\"know\\" as taught to us by Shakespeare and academic history primers was a disfigured arch villain who murdered the innocent princes in the Tower in unrelenting pursuit of the crown and who it turns our was nothing of the kind, this propaganda concocted by...... (here I stop so as not to spoil the mystery!) we then feel empowered to eschew mindless acceptance of all similar tales we have been spoon fed. Let this tiny classic illuminate some rainy afternoon.

I suspect history is written by the winners, and it takes a long time for the truth to come out. I had some background knowledge about Richard III before reading Daughter of Time, so I don't want to say anything that spoils this book. I did find the theory interesting and well-presented, since I had heard a convincing argument for another perpetrator (not Richard). The portrait of Richard III referenced in this book is easy to find on the internet, which is fun to have while you read."},{"Title":"The Daughter of Time","review":"This novel is a delicious mix of history and mystery, two of my favorite genres. Tey has turned one of the great unsolved mysteries of all time into an intriguing mystery novel. The murder involved is the disappearance of the two princes in the tower, and the suspect is Richard III. Did he do it? This is one of those unanswerable questions that intrigue the history buff as much as the historian. The question has never really been answered to anyone's satisfaction, except perhaps those historians who have written their version of the facts.Tey's protagonist finds himself captivated by the mystery, when he discovers that the face of Richard III does not strike him as that of a villain. As he explores the facts of the case that still remain after all of this time, he delves deeper and deeper into the intrigues and battles of that era, and into the personality of Richard III. I found myself becoming captivated as well. It was a true page turner."},{"Title":"The Daughter of Time","review":"Did Richard III have the princes in the Tower \\"done in?\\" That is one of the great mysteries of history, and Tey \\"solves\\" it in the Daughter of Time.

It is \\"who-done-it\\" but definitely not your average story of this type, in as much as it deals with the centuries old disappearance and possible murder of two young boys, both of royal blood. The mystery of the Princes in the Tower has never been solved and it continues to fascinate people over the years. I found this book as hard to lay down as I did the first time I read it."},{"Title":"The Daughter of Time","review":"The Daughter of Timeis an historical mystery structured as an investigation by a bored and bed-bound detective, contemplating a portrait of Richard III.The title of this book is itself something of a mystery - who is the daughter? The mystery revolves around Richard III, his brother Edward IV, his cousin Henry VII, and the nephews Richard was blamed for murdering. The story is told in the male voices of detective Alan Grant and his research assistant Brent Carradine. Josephine Tey opens her book with a proverb attributed to Aulus Gellius: \\"truth is the daughter of time.\\" So the title is ostensibly nothing but an irrelevant personification. But reader will notice that much of the story development relies on snippets from \\"The Rose of Raby,\\" a fictional biography of Cicely Neville, the mother of Edward IV and Richard III. \\"The Rose of Raby\\" is Ms. Tey's own invention. It is tempting to suppose that her original intention was to write a romantic history of a woman who raised both the best and worst of Kings (Edward vs. Richard). This intention would have been sidetracked when her research proved that the popularized villainy of Richard was nothing but the well-publicized slander of Henry Tudor.I note that in 2002 C. L. Grace published a derivative detective story titled \\"La Rose de Raby.\\"Nevertheless, the story is compelling even for the modern reader who expects a more naturalistic treatment of history and the American reader who has no natural respect for royalty.And the title of this review? The cover illustration on my copy of this book is appropriately a mirror image of the National Gallery portrait that is the subject of the story."},{"Title":"The Daughter of Time","review":"Dynamic and uncomplicated story that keeps unraveling with the speed of an avalanche.Set in an unexpected surroundings (a hospital), the story evolves around the investigationand subsequent discovery of the true reason behind the murders of the Two Princes in 1483.The writing style is engaging, full of interesting fact and witty comedic nuances that make one oblivious to the time it takes to finish the book. The author gets to the heart of matter without painting unnecessary surroundings. It's a well-written, entertaining book and I recommend it if you have an afternoon to kill.by Simon Cleveland"},{"Title":"The Daughter of Time","review":"Some say this book is responsible for the renewed interest in Richard III. Whether true or not, it certainly peaked my curiosity.It's chock full of history. But I have one word of caution: If you know nothing about the Wars of the Roses, the reign of Edward IV or Richard III, I recommend you first read Sharon Kay Penman's THE SUNNE IN SPLENDOUR. Without a good foundation in the history of the times, you'll miss much of the subtle references.On the other hand, the unveiling of Richard III (biased in favor of the man) appears secondary to the point of the book. Rather, I think Tey meant to call historians to task. If history were written after proper (or legal) interpretation of the evidence at hand, she seems to contend, it might prove a whole lot more accurate."},{"Title":"The Daughter of Time","review":"I read this book when I was a teen-ager before reading Richard III the play. This became problematic for me since I was then shocked that people still believed that Richard was guilty, and that the play wasn't wishful dramatic fiction. Now whenever I think of it, I urge people to read the book. Tey takes something that could easily be dry and tedious and weaves it into a convincing page-turner."},{"Title":"The Daughter of Time","review":"From his hospital bed, Scotland Yard detective Alan Grant is intrigued by a portrait of Richard III, the humpback, the child murderer. Grant is impatient with himself for thinking that the notorious king looks more like a judge than a criminal.So from his bed, and with a little help from American student Brent Carradine, Grant takes on history, and researches the case with a detective's eye.Richard is innocent, he decides. Bit by bit, like drops of cream in coffee, Tey introduces the facts of the case-- not what people said, or reported long after the fact, but what they did.This is by far one of the best, if not the best, mysteries from that great fount of paperback mysteries, England. This book is the definition of &quot;page-turner.&quot; People who know nothing of Richard III, and have never cared really, whether the historical rcerd is correct, will not only be fascinated by this story, but will, after putting it down, be ready to carry the banner of Richard's innocence.One warning: do not begin this book late in the day. You will probably want to read it cover-to-cover, so if you do not start reading early enough, you will end up losing a night's sleep."},{"Title":"The Daughter of Time","review":"Ok what can I say about this book apart from the fact that I &quot;LOVED it&quot; Since the age of 10 after seeing Sir Laurence Olivier in Shakespeare's &quot;Richard III&quot; I have been intrigued with this story. In this book Policeman Alan Grant recuperating in hospital becomes interested in the idea that Richard III was not responsible for the death of his nephews in the Tower. I read this book in my teens and reread it every now and then and still love it. Then again I was born in Yorkshire and we all know that Richard was innocent.

Read and change your outlook on history."},{"Title":"The Daughter of Time","review":"This is a &#34;mystery&#34; story that involves debunking the bad reputation of King Richard III of England. The writing, the set-up, and the characters are awkward and not believable. But the &#34;evidence&#34; that King Richard III has been unfairly maligned through history--especially by Thomas More and William Shakespeare--becomes compelling in spite of the serious shortcomings of the novel. The recent discovery of what some consider to be the remains of the real Richard III makes this story much more interesting than it would be otherwise. I found myself delving into English history and researching the Richard III Society, the members of which have been arguing that Richard deserves to be rehabilitated. For that reason alone, the novel is worth reading."},{"Title":"The Daughter of Time","review":"The day after the announcement that the remains found under a carpark in Leicester was indeed the last of the Plantagenet kings, this book arrived from Amazon.

Love it."},{"Title":"The Daughter of Time","review":"If we could go back in time to solve mysteries it would benefit all of history. But to engage with the mystery by looking through time and engaging with the written word to solve crimes is, I think brilliant. I loved Tey's use of modern deductive reasoning. Getting to know the people involved and working backwards to solve the mystery is, I think, very interesting but also difficult. Brilliantly written and a very difficult time period to try to understand. I would recommend this book very highly.

And better, in my opinion, than both."},{"Title":"The Daughter of Time","review":"I read this story a few years ago and would reccommend it to any history class as an example of history made interesting.The story is pretty simple. I do not know how she came upon it, but, all in all, she does a fantastic job setting up the situation and then bringing in the mystery, seemingly from left field.Her examination of the evidence leaves no doubt about the guilt and innocence of the those involved. As it turns out (I forget if it is mentioned in this book or elsewhere) a lot of history has been written correcting the popular fable, but the popular fable keeps on keeping on.It is quaint that Ms. Tey mentions Shakespeare's \\"Richard III\\" in another book, \\"Miss Pym Disposes\\", &#8220;criminal libel on a fine man, a blatant piece of political propaganda, and an extremely silly play&#8221;.Ms. Tey's writing style is very English.

By the time I reached the end Iwas ready to question the veracity of every snippet ofsanitised history I had absorbed, unquestioningly, in myschool days. And as for Richard III...well, see for yourself"},{"Title":"The Daughter of Time","review":"This book was not at all what I had expected. After having this book pop up as a recommendation in several Plantagenet arenas, I decided that I had to have it. It is not, however, really a novel about Richard III in the traditional sense.I was disappointed at the outset of this novel when the first several chapters were about Grant, a detective who is laid up in the hospital with a broken leg. (Did they truly keep patients in the hospital for weeks with a broken leg at the time this was written?) I was not much interested in the characters of Grant, Marta, or anyone else who was introduced at this time and wondered why the book had come with such high recommendations.Soon I realized that Grant was to investigate, as fully as he could from his hospital bed, the mystery of Richard as the murderer of his nephews, the Princes in the Tower. After studying a picture of Richard III, Grant decides that he has the face of a judge not a criminal and is determined to fill his time while bedridden with learning as much about the man as possible.Brent Carradine is introduced as Grant's partner in this investigation, and most of the remainder of the novel is dialog between the two of them weighing different sources of contemporary information regarding Richard. The revisionist argument for Richard's innocence is very clearly laid out through Grant and Brent researching his case. They quite thoroughly consider each person involved before and after Richard's death and become irate that accepted history could be so obviously distorted. Their conversations reminded me of similar rants that my poor husband has had to endure whenever I read about Richard.Tey also includes other quips about historical falsehoods that are readily accepted as fact which helps aid the reader in believing that we could be wrong about poor Richard as well. So the book that I was anxious to read but disappointed in at the beginning ended up captivating me in the end. I read it within 24 hours. Though I was familiar with the information presented, I think that it would be a great introduction to anyone who is interested in the Ricardian revisionist theories. This is a novel but reads like well written non-fiction, an excellent presentation of Richard's character and the case against him."},{"Title":"The Daughter of Time","review":"This is one of the 2 or 3 must reads in the entire history of detective fiction. It's also the book that was most responsible for popularizing the revisionist narrative of the life of Richard III.

A must-read for all lovers of historical fiction. This is based on really sound research and presents &#34;difficult&#34; history in an appealing and compelling way. If you live in, or can go to London, I highly recommend a trip to the National Portrait Gallery to view the portrait of the king as described in the book. I still have the postcard i purchased there 40 years ago."},{"Title":"The Daughter of Time","review":"This book shows how Richard III got a &#34;Bad Wrap&#34; in the history books: they get written by the Victors.Even Shakespeare was duped by the Tudor version of history!"},{"Title":"The Daughter of Time","review":"I had only marginal interest in Richard III before but the book was so compelling that you are drawn into the search for how and why Richard got his reputation and now I am a fan of both Josephine Tey (the late) and Richard.

I read it over 30 years ago and it remains one of my favorites. It's a tightly written and compelling page turner. However, it is fiction, and in-depth analysis of the history of the Princes in the Tower does make Richard III seem to be the culprit."},{"Title":"The Daughter of Time","review":"A pleasant little historical screed, Daughter of Time seems to be in love with revisionism for its own sake. To the detriment of its thesis, it presents all arguments against Richard III's villainy as good arguments, and all arguments for his villainy as bad arguments. While the factual arguments set out in the book, such as the unreliability of More's account of Richard III's reign and the lateness of the accusations against Richard, are persuasive, Tey also places great reliance upon her (and her characters, Grant and Carradine's) ability to judge a man's character and motives from his face and his actions after 400 years. This kind of &quot;a person like X would never have done Y&quot; argument counts for beans with me -- people are way too complex for such simple and subjective judgments.When it is not writing in full-out polemic mode, Tey's dialogue is urbane and fun to read. If she had only had the sense to separate the good arguments for her thesis from the bad ones, she would have been convincing as well as entertaining."},{"Title":"The Daughter of Time","review":"This book's strong point, as other readers have pointed out, is that it attacked what was then universally presumed &amp; taught about Richard III's role in the murders of his nephews. It is indeed instructive and illuminating to think about all the ways historians can blur, misrepresent, and misunderstand the facts in a case. My problem with it is that Tey herself displays an egregious, fervent bias toward all things monarchist-Protestant-English, to the point that as another reader noted, Thomas More is constantly referred to, sneeringly, as &quot;sainted&quot; (really, is Thomas More the villain we want to malign here?). Also, in the course of making her point about the fallibility of historians, she laboriously attacks various stories of Scottish and Irish rebellion against English tyranny as being factually untrue-- as if to say that because SOME such stories may not be historically accurate, ALL incidents of the English oppression of the Scots and Irish people are nothing more than scurrilous lies. (the implication being, &quot;Can you believe those stupid, inferior Scots &amp; Micks we English have to put up with?&quot;) Accordingly, she maintains a smug, disdainful, condescending attitude toward &quot;lower-class&quot; characters throughout the book-- not surprising considering the time it was written, but unpleasant to read nonetheless. Finally, her pro-Richard argument, while quite convincing, is put forth so repetitively that it's like being hammered over the head-- okay, okay, WE GET IT already, Josephine! Sheesh! I've never seen a detective character in a mystery novel who behaved in a less professional, detached, detective-like way. This is not so much a mystery as it is a fascinating but one-dimensional screed."},{"Title":"The Daughter of Time","review":"Once when I finished the book, and thought about it, it was an ok story. However, when I was actually reading it, there were too many boring parts that made me stop reading because I was to distracted to go on. This book was required summer reading for a class that I will be taking as a sophomore. According to the other reviews on this site, I might be too young to appreciate the book and all of its qualities. Maybe as an adult, I might find reading it more enjoyable. There were two things that bugged me in the book that I wish to share with you before you decide to purchase the book. The first thing is that even though the book is about Richard III, toward the end, for three chapters, all she talked about was Edward IV and Henry VII. Switching to those two people, and then going back to Richard III really got me confused! The other thing that irked me was Tey didn't have a bibliography. I would like to know whether the books she used as references in the story are true."},{"Title":"The Daughter of Time","review":"This novel is apparently well-loved but although it's clever, it's certainly not great. First, unless you're a fan of British history, you'll hate this novel. If you like action mysteries, you'll hate this novel. It's an intellectual's mystery and Tey is a good writer but this novel is not her best."},{"Title":"The Daughter of Time","review":"I ordered two copies of the Daughter of Time for gifts. They arrived promptly and were in good condition."},{"Title":"The Daughter of Time","review":"Daughter of time is a novel by Josephine Tey set in the early days of 1485. It is about the then king of England Richard III who allegedly saw to the murder of his two nephews in order to extend his time on the throne. Alan Grant, the main character, is a policeman whom, after breaking his leg in a chase is left in hospital. During his extended stay he and his young researcher Brent Carradine embarks on a journey deep into a time long ago to find out what really happened to the two unfortunate young boys. The major downside to this novel is the lack of humour within, a part which is desperately needed in order to grasp the attention of today's average reader. Without this subtle yet vital factor many minds begin to wander. The little humour present is of a linguistic nature and often hard to detect. The novel; more of a history textbook, is definitely that of a formal text. The fact that it was first publish years ago accounts for this. Tey often tries to link her story with that of the days in which Richard III reigned supreme and hence archaic words are often found within. Words like gay (happy) and usurpation are found throughout the course of the &quot;novel&quot;. Set in England the Tey uses little to no slang throughout. The book seems to be more of a history textbook than a novel giving insights to the world of Richard III and Edward VII and does tend to get boring at part. However it does gives plausible theories towards the death of the to young princes, Richard III's nephews. It is often hard to tell whether the book is boring due to the abundance of archaic words or if is because the reader in question knows little about the history of England."},{"Title":"The Daughter of Time","review":"In 1990 &quot;The Hatchard's Crime Companion &quot;,published in the UK listed the selection of Crime Writers Association members for the best 100 crime novels.Topping the list,inexplicably so in my view was this novel.I say ,inexplicably not because I deem it to be a bad novel.It is not that,but I do feel it is a curiousity within the genre one that does not really grab the reader the way the alleged best in any genre should do.The book unfolds within a single setting-a hospital ward in which Inspector Grant,a regular Tey hero , is confined to bed with an injury rendering him virtually immobile.He is struck by a picture of Richard the Third and resolves to set about proving his innocence of the charge of murdering the Princes in the Tower of London as insisted upon by Shakespeare and Tudor propagandists and instead casting the blame on his successor,Henry the Seventh.A young female American researcher acts as his &quot;legs&quot;in carrying out the actual delving around in dusty archivesThe evidence is not new to scholars of the era but is laid out clearly and convincingly and the novel would make a good primer for people interested in the history and characters of that era,and reflects Tey's interest in history,reminding us in the process that ,under the name of Gordon Daviot she had a successful career as a dramatist specialising in historical plays.The book was clearly the model for Colin Dexter's &quot;Inspector Morse &quot;tale &quot;The Wench is Dead &quot;which also featured the investigation of an historical crime by the hospitalised sleuth aided by a researcher.The book is neatly written but I found it an intellectual exercise rather than a novel and almost inevitably it came across as static and mild.On a personal note I am not of the&quot; Richard is innocent&quot; persuasion anymore than I believe that Shakespeare was really Francis Bacon or Christopher Marlowe but believe one pileof tripe and you will be temperamentally inclined to swallow the other crackbrained notion of the period"},{"Title":"The Daughter of Time","review":"Scotland Yard Inspector Alan Grant is bored out of his mind. Due to an unfortunate fall and multiple injuries he is bed ridden in the hospital and the long healing process and subsequent inaction are driving him crazy. A friend, knowing of the Inspector's passion for faces, brings him a portfolio of historical portraits thinking to distract him. She hopes he will involve himself in solving a &quot;classic&quot; historical mystery, since he seems to know all the facts of the Scotland Yard cases by heart. Grant homes in on the portrait of King Richard III, the supposedly wicked uncle who murdered his nephews, the boy princes, in the London's Tower. He remembers how Richard was portrayed in elementary school history and certainly recalls Shakespeare's vivid portrait of the evil hunchbacked king. However, try as he may, Grant cannot reconcile the face in the painting with that of a tyrannical childrens' murderer and usurper of England's throne. He sees conscience and integrity in the face of the painting's subject. And his curiousity is aroused for the first time since his accident.Grant asks for historical books and reads everything he can get his hands on. He finally comes into contact with a young research student from America who also becomes caught-up in the hypothesis that Richard III was framed. Author Josephine Tey, with the skill of the best in Scotland Yard, conducts an objective investigation of a centuries-old crime. She evenly portrays both side of the story, Richard III's and King Henry VII's (the other suspect), with all its twists and turns, reveals compelling evidence and comes to an amazing conclusion.The reader is literally taken back in time to examine the accusations, testimonies and material relating to the death of Richard's brother, King Edward IV in 1483, the known history of his sons, Princes Edward and Richard after their father's death and their mysterious disappearance, the behavior of Edward's widow and children, including his eldest daughter Elizabeth, who becomes Henry's bride, Queen and mother to Henry VIII. Tey provides an extraordinarily well researched profile of Richard III, pieced together directly from historical documents, and another profile of Henry Tudor. The author also examines the 1934 exhumation of the two children who were first dug up in 1674. Motives are examined and finally, conclusions are drawn, proving, once again, that history is written by winners.This is a riveting piece of detective history. Usually historians are detectives. In this case we are introduced to a detective who becomes a historian. Step-by-step, Grant plays out his theories according to evidence and comes up with logical deductions. One may already know what the conclusions are, but that is not the point of this mystery novel. The book provides the opportunity to go back in history and view a more three-dimensional side to well known characters, examine documents, and understand the rationale of those who lied or who closed their eyes to the truth. In this case, a mistrust of the official version of &quot;the truth&quot; brings the truth to light.Alan Grant and the supporting cast of characters are wonderful, as is the witty dialogue. The young American, Brent Carradine, is hardworking and touching in his zeal to do something meaningful. This excellent mystery by Josephine Tey is a delight and a remarkably riveting read.JANA"},{"Title":"The Daughter of Time","review":"What thoughtful reader hasn't experienced Shakespeare's Richard III and wondered about the accuracy of the Bard's portrayal? Thus did Josephine Tey, near the close of her authorial career, delve into some of the lost nooks and crannies of English history in an effort to recover \\"the real Richard.\\"The well-known hurdle for all would-be Ricardians is, of course, the utter absence of source material contemporary to Richard's reign, and most of all anything that discusses the fate of the \\"princes in the Tower.\\" All that is generally counted as \\"authoritative,\\" it turns out, is the product of Tudor dynasty information factories. Tey, however, very likely had in her possession the writings of Sir Clements Markham, a late Victorian-era civil servant, whose careful revisionist argument is here unfolded in a lively, compelling narrative of incremental discovery.Prompted by a reproduction of a famous portrait of Richard, Tey's laid-up sleuth, with the help of an American researcher, marshalls from his bed an archival assault on the estimable Sir Thomas More, Henry (the VII) Tudor, and the entire phalanx of worthies who have reported, for the last half a millennium, that Richard was the demonic crookback murderer of Shakespeare's characterization. Happily for us, there's more (sic) to the story than the traditional record, and those not already sucked into the revisionist Ricardian argument may very well be converted. Tey's engaging \\"fiction\\" is not only a great boon to all Ricardians--who, with Richard III Societies on both sides of the pond, must surely win hundreds if not thousands of new converts yearly as a result of this 50-year-old work--but the perfect place to begin your own exploration of this great historical proto-conspiracy."},{"Title":"The Daughter of Time","review":"Since the winner writes the history books, it's not surprising most people believe that Richard III was evil. According to Sir Thomas More and Shakespeare, he had various members of his family killed, including his poor little nephews, so that he could be king. It's important to remember that much of what we think we know about Richard was written during the reigns of Henry VIII and Elizabeth I -- who were on the throne as the direct result of the defeat of Richard. To justify the Tudors (Henry's father, I believe) seizing power, Richard had to be cast as the bad guy. We may never know what actually happened, but Josephine Tey presents a different look into history using actual letters and documents from that time. It all starts with a modern-day homicide detective who prides himself on being able to read faces. When he sees Richard's portrait (without knowing who it is), he doesn't pick it as the face of an evil murderer. I've seen Richard's portrait in the National Portrait Gallery in London -- and I think Tey's character, although fictional, may be on to something."},{"Title":"The Daughter of Time","review":"This is an engaging detective-story that simultaneously illustrates with blinding clarity the difference between &lt;i&gt;objective &quot;fact&quot;&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;subjective &quot;interpretation.&quot;&lt;/i&gt; Something we all need to be more aware of, more often. This novel's publication led to the creation of worldwide &quot;Ricardian&quot; groups now seeking to clear the name of the 13th-century ruler of England, Richard III, villainized through Thomas More then Holinshed then Shakespeare as a hunchback murderer of his two young nephews in order to become king.For anyone interested in appearance/reality questions, or keen to uncover &quot;truths&quot; about anything at all, this novel is a MUST READ. But in fact, it's good reading also simply for people who enjoy this genre of detective/mystery.Let this testament be my review's closing: since this book's recommendation to me nearly 20 years ago, I've read it again and again at least 10 times. Moreover, I've given it as a gift to at least seven or so friends. And I've recommended its reading in every college course I've taught during the last 10 years. For this is one of those extraordinary books that help shape our thinking while entertaining us all the while."},{"Title":"The Daughter of Time","review":"Well, Richard III can certainly be considered as an unique British monarch: five-hundred years after his early demise (he was 32 when he was killed) he sparks so much controversy you could fill the whole Encyclopaedia Brittanica with it. I must admit that yes, I *do* belong to a branch of the Richard III Society, but I became supportive of him through research that sprung from my own curitosity. But onwards with the review.To start with, this novel has everything I demand from a good mystery novel: good characterisation, a faultless story-line, brilliant dialogue. It is not a book, however, for those who prefer their mysteries with lots of car chases, steamy blondes whenever (un)necessary, gun-toting bad guys, etc. Rather it is a literate mystery, acessible but packing more history and historical analysis in its little-over-one-hundred pages than you can shake a stick at. As such, I would recommend it only for those who like their books with brains. What is more, it is one of those rare books that does a serious contribution to History: you really get to understand how myths are made and how every ruler who usurps his/her position (in this case, Henry VII) does his/her best to totally blacken his/her predecessor's name (in this case, Richard III). Want confirmations, both in History and in literature? Try the Trotsky/Stalin case, or George Orwell's &quot;1984&quot;, and let's have you muttering &quot;Tonypandy&quot;.And as for the historical content, it is top-notch, despite the fact that Tey ignores one of the most probable murder suspect (Buckingham) and the fact that the Princes may not have been murdered at all. Despite the fact that Thomas More was a saint, that does not mean that everything he wrote was inspired by God (what he wrote about Richard was probably inspired by Morton). Whether his work was a satyr of history or whether he intended it as a serious work, the point is that it is riddled with innacuracies, misconceptions and palpable absurdities. Also, he had been 8 when Richard was killed in Bosworth Field. I admire Thomas More and this is not an aspersion on him, but the fact is that his book about Richard cannot be taken seriously.Many other palpable hits are scored, and I must tell to some readers whose comments I read that they are missing the whole point. For starters, not only this book is superior to many &quot;histories&quot; due to its critical treatment of sources, it also succeds in proving that Richard is one of the most unlikely murder suspects simply because a secret murder would obviously defeat its own end. Why would a man renowned by his capacities as a strategist suddenly commit an idiotic murder in the most idiotic manner possible? If it was imperative that the Princes should die, it was also imperative that everybody knew they were dead. What he couldn't possibly afford was a mystery - only an idiot would commit such a crime, and Richard never showed any signs of idiocy. And, as for the comment of the English lady from New York, despite the obvious fact that the fifteenth century was an age of violence and rulers did their best to eliminate all rivals (as a matter of fact, they still do), the point is that Richard died *precisely* because of his lack of ruthlessness - he showed great (and misplaced) leniency towards traitors like Morton and Stanley. If he had really been so ruthless as the Tudor myth paints him, he would have managed to keep his crown. In fact, the Tudor myth has been so successful that although everybody knows the story of the Princes in the Tower, very few people remember the fact that Henry Tudor beheaded 24-year-old Warwick, John of Gloucester (Richard's 17-year-old illigitimate son) and many other members of the House of York. Now *that's* what I call being ruthless!Personally, I think that Richard showed signs of being one of the most enlightened and most humane British monarchs. But whether you agree or otherwise, do read this book for two reasons: the fact that will teach you not to swallow something just because it comes from some &quot;authority&quot;; and the tight dialogue between Grant and Carradine is the best interplay I've ever seen since Bogart and Bacall..."},{"Title":"The Daughter of Time","review":"For those of us who crave a good mystery but are put off by the rather bland and often downright bad writing, Josephine Tey is a great find. Plot, character development, and creative ingenuity are her hallmarks, and her books are an absorbing read -- and more.And more -- because I've read many of her books over and over, I've begun to notice a characteristic of her writing that I find very disturbing and disconcerting, but intriguing. While all authors decide who is good and bad and create a plot around that, she does something a little different in pursing her course: she manipulates the reader by a using a subtle emotional context for information that we then, because she causes us to like or dislike the character so much, accept as a likelihood if not actual fact. By the end of most of her novels, you've learned to dislike the &quot;bad&quot; people (who are unnecessarily bad, when you think about it) very very much and you are absolutely rooting for the main characters -- primarily because they have been challenged by these nasty bad people. This is most evident in this novel and in &quot;The Franchise Affair,&quot; which includes a truly brilliant form of character assassination that I found almost frightening on subsequent readings. She would have been a fantastic political propagandist -- she wins you over to her point of view and gets you emotionally riled up about a cause. In &quot;The Daughter of Time,&quot; we become very absorbed in Alan Grant's search for the real Richard (and are won over to the cause of clearing his name) but overlook the real truth that most of Alan's deductions are merely &quot;the Richard I know wouldn't have done this or that,&quot; which has a foundation on his emotional reading of the portrait and his own assessment of what good younger brothers and uncles are like. He discounts the idea that most portraits flatter their subject to some extent, and that medieval nobility didn't live the kinds of emotional lives that we do. Josephine Tey is unsurpassed, I think, in anticipating the reader's objections and neutralizing them in advance. Doing so creates a sense of objectivity in the narrative and distracts from the emotional manipulation of her choices. Brilliant.What I appreciate greatly about this novel is her ingenuity in setting up the frame and approach to this story, as well as the warm, three-dimensional portrait of Richard and his family and his milieu. I think there is more to Richard and his circumstances and it is great to be introduced to him as a complex individual in dangerous times -- rather than the cardboard evil king we know. However, I suspect that, in fact, he was responsible for his nephew's deaths -- bottom line: he was responsible for their welfare, and they probably died while in his care. One does not dispose of two boys who are in the care of the most powerful man in the land without his knowing. But, I suppose we will never know the answer for sure, and it is fun and rewarding to investigate all the intriguing options. Josephine Tey is not alone in advocating for Richard's innocence, but she has done a lot to popularize the conflict.I would love to use this text in a history course and evaluate with the class this historical argument for innocence, based on this book, and then go back through take another look at argument along with an analysis of the author/proponents's use of propagandistic tools to manipulate the audience to believe in a cause. It would be interesting to take a &quot;guilty/not guilty&quot; vote after each review. The students (readers) could learn a great deal about how to &quot;consider the source&quot; which is a key element of critical thinking. How many people do we all know who believe every story they hear and go gung-ho in pursuit of their biases? I challenge you to read this book and be objective about her arguments. It's as fascinating as the story itself."},{"Title":"The Daughter of Time","review":"I'm happy to see this book printed once again, and happier still to see so many comments posted on it. My own pleasure in the book was that like only a handful of others -- including In the Beginning by Chaim Potok &amp; Contact by Carl Sagan -- this book manages to dramatize the love of truth and the thrill of the quest for knowledge. It doesn't work for everyone. Some people need more physical chase scenes. But Tey imparts the thrill of the chase to historical research, and has succeeded in getting a number of readers interested in exloring more. That's an accomplishment. If you do want to find out more about the subject, the Richard III Society (mentioned in the book) has a website, including an extensive online library. One thing I keep hoping for in books like this is that they will teach readers about evaluating information and filtering propaganda from fact. Whatever you decide about the guilt or innocence of Richard III, examining what happened to history in the hands of More and Shakespeare and all who read them uncritically points out that now and always -- don't just question authority, question *everything*. Francis Bacon said &quot;Truth is the daughter of time -- not of authority.&quot; (The source of the title.) But time itself doesn't uncover the truth -- human minds do. The Daughter of Time is a &quot;research procedural&quot;, demonstrating the methods of checking source documents and evaluating written records much like a police procedural demonstrates search patterns and physical evidence collection. The detective novel has always had a core theme of celebrating human reason and advocating that &quot;the truth will set you free.&quot; I hope the high popularity of the detective novel these days means that theme is catching on."},{"Title":"The Daughter of Time","review":"This is a wonderful genre bending book...part history, part mystery. Written by Scotswoman Elizabeth MacIntosh, who wrote under the pen name Josephine Tey, it was first published in 1951. It is tragic that the author died in 1952 and was never to know the pleasure that this book would bring to generations of readers and that the Mystery Writers of America would ultimately rank it fourth among the one hundred best mysteries ever written.The title of the book is derived from a historical source, as it is attributable to Sir Francis Bacon, \\"For truth is rightly named after the daughter of time, and not of authority.\\" The book itself is not a traditional mystery but rather an application of deductive reasoning to an actual historical event. The event in question is the murder of the princes in the tower, sons of King Edward IV, allegedly by their uncle, Richard III, who eventually usurped the English throne after the death of his brother. It has been widely held that Richard III did, indeed, murder the two young princes, his nephews, in order to secure his claim to the throne.The reader is introduced to Scotland Yard Inspector Alan Grant, who is hospitalized and recovering from injuries sustained in the line of duty. While convalescing, he becomes intrigued by a picture of a portrait of Richard III, a likeness with which he is unfamiliar. Grant is puzzled that someone with such a sensitive face could have been such a monster as to murder his two nephews in cold blood. So, our intrepid Inspector decides that he will reconsider the evidence upon which such a dastardly assumption has been based. With the help of an American researcher doing the necessary legwork, Grant compiles enough archival historical fact that incrementally helps him formulate a new theory as to who actually may have murdered the princes in the tower.This analysis and reformulation is done as though it were being argued to a jury. Indeed, so persuasive is Inspector Grant through the application of some insightful deductive reasoning and clever dialogue that the reader comes away thinking that Grant has solved one of the most intriguing historical mysteries of all time. This is certainly an unusual book conceptually but one that succeeds brilliantly. It should appeal to those readers who enjoy having a mystery unraveled, as well as to those who harbor a love of English history. Bravo!"},{"Title":"The Daughter of Time","review":"SWINDON. I can't believe it! What will history say? BURGOYNE. History, sir, will tell lies, as usual.That telling little exchange comes from a G.B. Shaw play and the thought it expresses is the basis of one of the finest mystery novels ever concocted: Josephine Tey's &lt;The Daughter of Time.&gt; Inspector Grant is injured from a previous case and is lying in a hospital bed memorizing the cracks in the ceiling. An actress friend of his brings him some pictures of people from history and one is particularly striking: sad, wise, a person you would like to know. But the reverse side identifies the face as that of Richard III, the greatest villain in English history.This is the character that all the old history books and especially Shakespeare tell us murdered King Henry VI, had his brother Gerorge drowned in a barrel of wine, drove his older brother, King Edward, into an early grave, put all his in-laws to death, killed his wife, and finally murdered his own nephews once he had stolen the crown from them. Add to this a hunchback, a shriveled arm, and a very sarcastic way of speaking, and you have one of the greatest No Goods ever. But not with that face!Grant, whose professional success depends on knowing a person by his face, cannot believe he could have been so mistaken and recruits his nurses, friends, fellow policemen, and even a young American researcher to bring him all they can about the Great Mystery of &quot;who murdered the princes in the tower.&quot; Little by little, the case against Richard falls to pieces; while the evidence begins to point in the most surprising direction.The wonderful thing about this novel is how it shows that so much of what we consider &quot;history&quot; is merely a pack of lies devised by the winning teams to blacken the opposition and whitewash themselves. The incident at &quot;Tonypandy,&quot; for example, is made much of in this novel. That was a town in Wales in which unarmed police were sent in to calm down striking miners and a bloody nose or two was the result. Yet word got out that armed troops fired into the crowd; and that version was accepted, simply because not a single person actually there felt like contradicting it.Another parallel is our own &quot;Boston Massacre&quot; in which a few thoughtless citizens began to stone a British sentry, thereby forcing a reluctant senior officer to fire into the crowd. Four casualties resulted. Paul Revere's engraving shows dozens being mowed down. But who would dare to say &quot;Liar&quot; to the official version?For a thorough enjoyment of this novel, you really need to be fairly familiar with Shakespeare's &quot;Richard III.&quot; Now bear in mind that the playwright got his information from &quot;Holinshed's Chronicles,&quot; which got its information from authors paid by the king who had defeated Richard III in battle, who got most of their information from one of Richard's deadliest enemies. One might as well accept &quot;Mein Kampf&quot; as an objective look at Germany during the years between World Wars.Reading this book, in fact, will change your entire attitude toward anything you read in any book or periodical that claims to present &quot;the facts.&quot; I will not ruin your enjoyment of this book by pointing out how Grant weighs the evidence that been accepted for so long as &quot;true&quot; and comes to the conclusions he does.Now the really Good News is that we have a wonderful recording of this complete text on a set of four Audio Partners tapes. Better yet, let me tell you it is read by Derek Jacobi--or better still, acted out by Derek Jacobi, because he finds a new voice for each character, the American being the best of the lot.In fact, having read the novel twice before and having heard this recording, I am compelled to try both formats again. Richard III might be a great villain on stage, but I firmly believe that the historical Richard deserves to have his case for the defense heard as often as possible. If for no other reason than to remind us of how many collections of &quot;historical facts&quot; might be little more than an imaginative treatment to bolster one's cause or downgrade another's. History, which is the Daughter of Time by the way, is written by the winners. It takes a good author like Tey to plead the case for the loser.Yes, a good deal of this book is the presentation to the reader of plenty of English history; but it is all made very palatable by the good dialogue and the many little peripheral details that give you rest stops along the way.And while waiting for delivery, watch the Olivier film again to brush up your Shakespeare."},{"Title":"The Daughter of Time","review":"Author Elizabeth MacKintosh, wrote under the pseudonym of Josephine Tey. She died in 1952 but her unique talent continues to entertain and enlighten her readers with her unusual mystery scenarios. With Daughter of Time she invites us to join the team of a 20th century Scotland Yard inspector Alan Grant and an American researcher currently on assignment at the British Museum as they utilized their powers of deductive reasoning (ala Sherlock Holmes) to ascertain the truth about with Richard III. Having been previously characterized by everyone from Shakespeare to Sir Thomas More as an evil hunchbacked usurper who murdered his two young nephews in the Tower of London in order to claim the throne; the Richard Plantagenet of this investigation is portrayed as an unusually trusting, loving and gentle man with no physical deformity.As creatively and intellectually plotted as this novel is, its' true beauty lies in the fact that it encourages the reader to THINK. It obliquely tells us that one should never accept any recorded history without question since most history is written from the perspective of those in power at the time and is not necessarily factual. In addition it enhances knowledge and vocabulary and sent this reader scurrying to the computer to look up definitions of items such as Bill of Attainder, Titulus Regius, and Star Chamber (lo and behold....it is more than a movie with Michael Douglas).Admittedly, this is a novel and the \\"Richard argument\\" presented by Tey's characters, although compelling, should not be viewed as incontrovertible fact.

No. It's not a traditional history, and should not be taken as such. It is a very fun detective story that opens up a fascinating window of how and why historians work, and will inspire anyone who reads it to think twice before taking any history at face value.Although anyone who loves history will adore this book, I think that it would also be a great book for someone who DOESN'T like history, such as a high school student who is bored to tears trying to memorize lists of names and dates.

Before the story opens, Grant took a bad fall while in hot pursuit, and consequently is flat on his back in hospital. (Several of the authors he met during TO LOVE AND BE WISE have sent him offerings to wile away the time, which allows Tey some humour at the expense of these - of course - completely fictional colleagues. If you read the two books out of order, though, you won't get substantial spoilers about TO LOVE AND BE WISE.)Be that as it may, Grant's long-time friend Marta Hallard suggests that Grant pass the time with a little academic investigation of some historical mystery - and given Grant's professional interest in faces, brings him copies of portraits of the principals in various juicy cases. (Some have been tackled by other novelists, such as Fiona Buckley's THE ROBSART MYSTERY, a.k.a. TO SHIELD THE QUEEN). And almost by accident, Grant notices a portrait of a young man with a careworn face: a face he first sees before reading the name attached - Richard III. But first seeing it as the face of a great judge, and being annoyed with himself for reading great integrity into the face of the notorious murderer of the Princes in the Tower, Grant gets interested, and together with a young American history student of Marta's acquaintance, begins casual inquiries as to why Richard almost overnight turned into a kinslayer - to find more than they bargained for below the popularly accepted 'facts' of history.This isn't a typical historical mystery - the only flashbacks are quotations from various sources turned up by Grant and his new friend Brent Carradine. Worth reading, but someone who insists on on-stage action may be disappointed, since the actual events are described through exposition of various academic sources rather than shown 'live'. The entire action of the book takes place in Grant's hospital room, and exactly 10 present-day characters have on-stage speaking parts (counting the telegram-delivery guy but not letter-writers).Derek Jacobi's unabridged audio recording of the text is recommended, although he's a bit weak on producing a plausible accent for Brent."},{"Title":"The Daughter of Time","review":"It's been over 500 years since he was killed in battle on Bosworth field. The DNA evidence is not yet in at this writing, but it's looking like a skeleton unearthed recently in nearby Leicester is very likely that of King Richard III. (Update 2/4/13: confirmed; it's him. see comment below) Many know the last of Britain's Plantagenet kings only as the despicable villain in a famous Shakespeare play--the murderer of the two young princes in the Tower. And that Tudor take on the story lives on in the history books to this day. But is it true? Many say not. And with good reason.In 1951, the late great mystery writer Josephine Tey put her Scotland Yard detective Alan Grant on the case. Something to keep him busy while recuperating in hospital from a fall through a trap door. Result: a heavily researched and absolutely riveting read, which The New York Times calls \\"One of the best mysteries of all time.\\"It's certainly the best history mystery I've ever read. Probably the best mystery of any kind I've ever read. And re-read. Very very highly recommended.(Such a shame the publisher didn't or maybe couldn't use on the jacket the famous portrait of Richard that triggered Grant's interest in his story and is a key component in the investigation. The art on the paperback isn't all that bad but the one on the hardback bears not the slightest resemblance to the face that's so central to this book. Luckily the portrait's easy to find via Google and other search engines.)"},{"Title":"The Daughter of Time","review":"Inspector Alan Grant is laid up in hospital and feeling bored and fretful. His friend, the actress Marta Hallard, suggests he indulges in a spot of academic investigating, to try to find a solution to an unsolved crime. Something classic that has puzzled the world, such as Mary Queen of Scots, The Borgias, the Man in the Iron Mask or Perkin Warbeck. Grant rejects the suggestion, but undaunted Marta returns with a sheaf of historical portraits and he becomes intrigued by the face of Richard III. The Last Plantagenet, the murderer of the Princes in the Tower - or was he? Aided by the young American researcher Brent Carradine, Alan Grant at last finds something to interest him and begins to study the evidence of whether Richard III was responsible for the deaths of his nephews or not.This book appears rather dated now and, of course, there are innumerable more ways to investigate such an issue now than simply using a few reference books and coming to a decision. However, it is a pleasant read, an interesting intellectual exercise to indulge in and, obviously, well written. Alan Grant is an interested, impassioned advocate; although he tries to present both sides of the argument, it is obvious where his (and presumably the authors) theories lay. Overall, a pleasant read and something slightly different."},{"Title":"The Daughter of Time","review":"This mystery novel has been exhaustively reviewed and there is nothing more to add. Still I want to chalk up my 5 stars. During the reading of this book I spent hours on Wikipedia and other internet sites reading everything I could find on Edward IV, Richard III, Henry VII, and as many other players in this story as I could find, a subject that has never before held any interest for me. Henceforth I will question every so-called \\"fact\\" of history. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Daughter of Time","review":"I actually \\"listened\\" to this book narrated by Sir Derek Jacobi on an audio book. It was brillant! The author could very well have written a historical novel to please those who prefer easy reading. Do not think I dislike historical novels. In fact I love them and they have often prompted me to read actual histories. But the author chose instead to present the story as a mystery. One of the reviewers indicated this book was not for people who like action. True, there is little action by the main character. He is after all laid up in bed. But it is a fascinating walk through history, covering the Plantagenets, the Tudors, the War of the Roses, and of course the mystery of the disappearance and death of the two princes. Maybe the book is more for brainiacs than for lovers of action, but there certainly was a lot of action, albeit in the past. I listened to this book to and from work on my long daily commute, and could not wait to finish my work day to get back to it, and it was mighty difficult to arrive home and turn it off until the next morning!"},{"Title":"The Daughter of Time","review":"Many years ago, a friend of mine who was interested in English history (she now writes mystery novels from the Medieval Era), suggested that I read a book on Richard III. I did so and found my prejudices against that monarch begin to fall away as I considered the evidence rather than what had been transmitted to readers.This is that book, Josephine Tey's historical mystery as to who killed the two young sons of Edward IV. The plot is very simple. London police officer Alan Grant is in a hospital for an injury related to his work. While lying in bed, bored, he receives some pictures from an actress friend. One of these is a rendering of Richard III. He finds the image transfixing and decides that he wants to learn more about that monarch. With a young researcher, he sets out to solve the mystery of who murdered the young children. By the way, keep the genealogy on pages 8-9 available at all times. It's hard to know the players without this handy listing of who begat whom and who married whom.Grant, with his young partner, gathers secondary and primary information. Grant, as a result, comes to think that Richard had gotten a bad rap, that he was--in fact--a good brother to Edward IV, a good administrator, a brave and capable military leader, and a person who was willing to forgive his adversaries (much to his regret as events turned out). A curious sort of person to order the death of his nephews. At any rate, some historical figures take a beating in this book. As soon as I read the phrase that the two sleuths used for Thomas More, \\"the sainted More,\\" I knew that this was the book I had written long ago. I recall bon mots with my friend over that phrase after she had convinced me to read this volume.In the end, Grant uses his detective's mind set to determine who the murderer (or he who ordered the murders) was. His logic makes a certain degree of sense, although others would disagree. Nonetheless, this is a fascinating book, written over a half century ago. It still reads well and moves along quickly."},{"Title":"The Daughter of Time","review":"This is a mystery classic written by a highly respected, award winning British author. If you want action, this is not the book for you. If you like history and appreciate an intellectual, careful analysis and don't mind the somewhat tedious approach of the writing, and are familiar with British culture, this is a captivating read that offers an alternative to the idea that Richard III had his 2 young nephews murdered in order to protect his right to the throne."},{"Title":"The Daughter of Time","review":"This is a wonderful genre bending book...part history, part mystery. Written by Scotswoman Elizabeth MacIntosh, who wrote under the pen name Josephine Tey, it was first published in 1951. It is tragic that the author died in 1952 and was never to know the pleasure that this book would bring to generations of readers and that the Mystery Writers of America would ultimately rank it fourth among the one hundred best mysteries ever written.The title of the book is derived from a historical source, as it is attributable to Sir Francis Bacon, \\"For truth is rightly named after the daughter of time, and not of authority.\\" The book itself is not a traditional mystery but rather an application of deductive reasoning to an actual historical event. The event in question is the murder of the princes in the tower, sons of King Edward IV, allegedly by their uncle, Richard III, who eventually usurped the English throne after the death of his brother. It has been widely held that Richard III did, indeed, murder the two young princes, his nephews, in order to secure his claim to the throne.The reader is introduced to Scotland Yard Inspector Alan Grant, who is hospitalized and recovering from injuries sustained in the line of duty. While convalescing, he becomes intrigued by a picture of a portrait of Richard III, a likeness with which he is unfamiliar. Grant is puzzled that someone with such a sensitive face could have been such a monster as to murder his two nephews in cold blood. So, our intrepid Inspector decides that he will reconsider the evidence upon which such a dastardly assumption has been based. With the help of an American researcher doing the necessary legwork, Grant compiles enough archival historical fact that incrementally helps him formulate a new theory as to who actually may have murdered the princes in the tower.This analysis and reformulation is done as though it were being argued to a jury. Indeed, so persuasive is Inspector Grant through the application of some insightful deductive reasoning and clever dialogue that the reader comes away thinking that Grant has solved one of the most intriguing historical mysteries of all time. This is certainly an unusual book conceptually but one that succeeds brilliantly. It should appeal to those readers who enjoy having a mystery unraveled, as well as to those who harbor a love of English history. Bravo!"},{"Title":"The Daughter of Time","review":"I think readers who are more knowledgeable in British history will have even more fun reading this book. Although I am confuse by all the Richards, Edwards and Elizabeths and the lords and the ladies, I still think this is a wonderful story. The case is convincingly presented. I even had a vivid dream in which I was arguing for Richard III's innoncence!"},{"Title":"The Daughter of Time","review":"I just recently discovered Tey (thanks to some Amazon reviews of highly literate female writers who write highly literate heros/heroines), and the Daughter of Time is the first one I read (I've since read 4 more, waiting for delivery on 2 more). I found it exquisite, not only well written but fascinating, particularly in the way Tey documented the solution. Logical, rational, well-written with well-developed characters (including Richard III) - what more could one ask.As to one reviewer's question about the title, I think it's from a Francis Bacon quote, something along the lines of &quot;truth is the daughter of time.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Daughter of Time","review":"I enjoyed this novel very much and feel that the English lady from New York and the person who argues for Richard's guilt are missing the point of the novel. Tey's argument is that not only are sources like More not very reliable, but all the evidence argues that Richard simply did not fit the profile of the murderer. In answer to the English Woman, I think that she, not Tey is being naive in assuming that since competition for the throne was fierce, all the victors must be ruthless. History clearly records that King Stephen, only a few centuries earlier released his cousin Maude from any form of imprisonment even though she was a crown rival with a better claim to the throne and one that had rebelled against him. King John also, supposedly one of the most ruthless kings in history, confined, not murdered his throne rival, Eleanor of Brittany. The reader who claimed that the evidence points to Richard as the murderer has failed to understand Tey's point that the murder, done in such a fashion, would not have been illogical, but irrational for the cold blooded monster painted in history books. By having the princes disappear, instead of poisoning them and claiming a fever or keeping them until they were in their twenties and then executing them, Richard would have gained the worst of both worlds. He would have been suspected as a murderer, yet would still not have been cleared as sole claimant to the throne. Also, if he was so determined to claim the throne, he would have also murdered Edward of Warwick, his nephew, who had an equally good claim to the throne."},{"Title":"The Daughter of Time","review":"Nicely told story of how a modern-day detective using instinct and common sense unravels the defamation of England's King Richard III. Unfortunately the alternate suspect proposed for the murder of his nephews is probably not the guilty party; the most likely suspect, Henry Stafford, Duke of Buckingham, is only mentioned in passing. Also some evidence is now outdated. Still, a nicely told rebuke to the traditionalists and Shakepeare for perpetuating the defamation of a man who might have become one of England's greatest and most humane monarchs."},{"Title":"The Daughter of Time","review":"After having enjoyed Josephine Tey's other mysteries, I stumbled on the Daughter of Time. Inspector Grant at his absolute best! He's stuck in hospital flat on his back and spends his time trying to solve the enigma of Richard III. Was he as evil as most historians say, or was his reputation the result of Tudor propaganda? It's a delightful read...and historically rather well researched. Only thing I didn't like was that it was too short"},{"Title":"The Daughter of Time","review":"This is an armchair detective book, a cross between Cold Case & Nero Wolfe. The Cold Case is centuries old, however, tough even for Lilly Rush. As usual, a small key (a portrait of Richard III) opens up a big can of worms. A bedridden detective uses his criminological skills to explore the murder of the 2 princes in the Tower of London. The clues arrive slowly & the detective uses psychology, logical deduction, & empirical actions by the suspects to reframe the case, concluding that Shakespeare was wrong, & Richard not guilty. Tracing Shakespeare's sources (Holinshed, Sir Thomas More, & Morton), Inspector Grant finds that historians' prior conclusions were based on hearsay evidence. Tey thus suggests that-- p. 201: \\"Historians should be compelled to take a course in psychology before they are allowed to write\\" & p. 173: \\"Grant wondered with what part of their brains historians reasoned. It was certainly by no process of reasoning known to ordinary mortals that they arrived at their conclusions.\\" Unfortunately reliance on the epistemologies of authority & tradition are much more widespread than just historians. As Tey points out--pp. 131-2: \\"It's an odd thing but when you tell someone the true facts of a mythical tale they are indignant not with the teller but with you. They don't want to have their ideas upset. It rouses some vague uneasiness in them, I think, & they resent it.. So they reject it & refuse to think about it\\" & p. 173: \\"Human nature found it difficult to give up preconceived beliefs.\\" The belief that a mystery should be in the present, include lots of action, etc. is belied by this outstanding novel. One does not need to be interested in history to enjoy it, only open to new approaches, ideas, & techniques. A true detective or scientist (real scientists ARE detectives) seeks the truth via the epistemologies of rationalism (logic & theory) & empiricism (data & resulting information & knowledge) vs. relying on authority (old paradigms) & tradition. This book has a great deal to teach us-far beyond whether Richard actually murdered the princes or not. The approach to the problem (how to solve problems=process) is far more important than the content (specific instance). I was fascinated by this wonderful book. Tey has shown herself an exception even to her own astute observations--p. 196: \\"Most people's first books are their best anyway; it's the one they wanted most to write.\\" Not in this case."},{"Title":"The Daughter of Time","review":"Josephine Tey's detective novel, \\"Daughter of Time\\", was first published in 1950s. Since then, this book has attained a kind of cult status among readers of British mysteries, especially those with an interest in history. I heard the book favorably mentioned for years, finally found time to read it, and realized the hype is not overdone.The narrative tone is a little---but noticeably--different in tone from current books of the genre; it is perhaps slightly more formal, more cerebral. The reader is soon aware of the author's carefully chosen words and wit, and senses that here is a rewarding leisure-time read.I won't reveal the plot of the book or spoil any of the mystery except to say that Richard III is presented here in a new, entirely plausible view.

I was too busy at the time to pursue the substance matter further, but recently, after re-reading it again, I started digging deeper, checking history books and encyclopedias, and historical fiction dealing with the period and the character (in both senses of the word) or Richard III.Though the author's logical reasoning is flawed in places, and though she skips some fundamental facts (she barely mentions Buckingham's rebellion and thus his possible hand in the fate of the Princes in the Tower), her book is the best possible introduction (short - about 200 pages - compared to most books of this kind, easy reading, engaging characters, a touch of humor) to the search for the truth about Richard III.Indeed history is written by the victors, and Henry Tudor certainly did his best to blacken his fallen enemy's memory, from having Titulus Regius (the Act of Parliament confirming Richard's right to the succession) repealed and burned without being read (thank heavens a copy did survive) to having his pet historians rewrite the history of his times to - and this is the worst - killing off all other possible claimants to the throne, including Richard's bastard son (his legitimate son having pre-deceased him).Josephine Tey makes that vividly clear, and at the same time fun (though by no means funny) and entertaining. I was totally convinced, not so much by her earnestness as by the logic (despite a couple of lapses) of her arguments.I was pleased to see that she inspired many writers of both fiction and non-fiction to dwell deeper into history and apply logic and reason to counter propaganda and disinformation.I am however dismayed to see that even after 400 years of one author after another trying to rehabilitate Richard III's memory, and the efforts of the Ricardian Society, still so many people subscribe to the \\"traditionalist\\" view and that history books and encyclopedias still maintain the Tudor account of event, and there still lie in Westminster a coffin with two children's skeletons with a plaque saying those are Edward V and Richard, Duke of York, murdered by their uncle. I wonder why the people in charge refuse to disinter the bones for carbon dating and DNA tests?Be it as it may, this book is highly recommended.

There were no gruesome murder details or nasty language for which I was grateful. After finishing, I was digging for more information on the period of history."},{"Title":"The Daughter of Time","review":"TRUTH is the daughter of time, and Alan Grant of Scotland Yard cannot abandon his relentless pursuit of truth. Even when he is flat on his back, convalescing in a hospital bed, staring at the ceiling and desperate for something to occupy his mind and his time.To amuse him, a friend brings him prints of portraits from the National Gallery -- men, women and children -- since Grant has a reputation for being able to read a person's character in his face. Grant is successful in distinguishing offenders from victims, until he reaches the last portrait. A judge? A soldier? A prince? he wonders. The name on the back is Richard the Third.Grant refuses to believe that the man's face can so belie his reputation as a murderer. And so, still on his back in bed, Grant gradually become determined to find out the truth about Richard the Third for himself. With the help of those around him (characters who are also intriguing in their own right), he assembles information from documents of history to help him decide the \\"case\\".It is remarkable enough for Tey to have put together the evidence she assembles for Richard the Third's case. But to present that case in the hospital -- where the quiet, white, solemn setting is in stark contrast to the story of compassion, courage, suffering and betrayal that Grant's investigation reveals -- is inspired. Tey literally resurrects Richard and his story. Admiration, pity, and outrage are aroused in the reader for a man who has been dead for centuries.And Grant, in his meticulous and painstakingly logical way, arrives at a conclusion that you are sure must close the book on the question of Richard's innocence forever.All this (not to mention the subtle commentary on what is truth) in just over 200 pages.

My professor used it to get the point across that all is not as it may seem - even if it's in a history book. I went on to not only read, but to buy, all of Josephine Tey's books.Foul Language - I can't remember exactly. There may be a few mild expletives.Sex - None.

We have an informal book group and discussion, and this is our most recent selection. It's the first Tey I've read, and it won't be the last. It features a character who apparently recurs in several of her novels, Inspector Alan Grant of the Scotland Yard.Laid up after suffering a broken leg, Grant tries to dispel the boredom by trying to solve an unsolved crime: the mysterious disappearance of the two princes in the Tower in the fifteenth century. Using the evidence presented to him, Grant and his research associate from the British Museum come up with a satisfactory and believable solution to a problem that has puzzled people for over five hundred years.One thing I found difficult to believe in this mystery was the fact that Grant knew so little about the history of his own country. For example, he didn't recognize a famous portrait of Richard III on sight. And that he was easily convinced by Thomas More's \\"evidence\\" of Richard's having murdered the boys, keeping in mind that More was writing after the fact, in the reign of a Tudor. Its also pretty obvious what Grant's conclusion is going to be about the mystery. But that said, that conclusion is completely believable (and, I suspect myself, most likely true).

My first thought was it is surprising that other authors haven't really tried to duplicate this type of story, but I think anything would come up short.

It is a good book because it is not like the typical mystery book. It has a detective that is in the hospital and he has other people look up the facts instead of looking them up himself. The detective gets started on this mystery because his friend Marta brings him cases that have not been solved so he can have something to do while in the hospital. He is intregued by faces and Marta had given him pictures of the faces of suspects in the crimes. He finds the picture of King Henry the third mystifying and decides to check out the crime a little bit more. Also, in a typical mystery book it is a mystery that just happened recently, but in this book it is a mystery that happened long ago and is in history books. I think that you should read this book if you love mysteries, or if you like things that happened in medeival times."},{"Title":"The Daughter of Time","review":"\\"Truth is the daughter of time,\\" according to the saying from which Josephine Tey took the title of her book, and time affords Tey's detective Alan Grant plenty of perspective on the mystery he sets out to solve. Laid up with a broken leg, Grant begins investigating the alleged crimes of Richard III after scrutinizing a portrait of the fifteenth century king. According to many historians, (e.g. Alison Weirs' recent, \\"The Princes in the Tower\\"), as well as Shakespeare, St. Thomas More, and common opinion, Richard was a monster who murdered his nephews to secure the throne of England for himself. It is giving nothing away to say that Grant comes to disbelieve these authorities. Who he concludes was the real murderer I won't say, but it is interesting to think about his conclusion in the light of the economic consequence of the Reformation.Teys skillfully summarizes the historical facts and the case for Richard's innocence and presents them in an entertaining way, but considered strictly as a murder mystery her story comes off somewhat strained and contrived. Also she is bit hard on St. Thomas More (\\"the sainted More\\") on whose history of Richard much subsequent history depends, even though she determines that More was deceived by the testimony of the Archbishop of Canterbury, John Morton.

It is supposed to be a mystery, yet the book in its entirity is a historical discussion. If this book were tweaked ever so slightly, you would find it in the non-fiction section of your local library. Instead, the author throws in poorly drawn-out characters to go along with the historical exploration.I consider myself to be fairly tolerant of the books I read, but this is absurd: for nearly the entire book, the main character does not leave his hospital bed. For 99% of the book, he lies in his bed reading books about Richard III and discussing Richard III with anyone he happens to encounter. I'm not asking for your typical \\"who did it?!\\" mystery, but action, or even movement of some kind, would be greatly appreciated. Even more, I think I'm going to get greedy and ask for plot (!) in my mystery novels.To top it off, I won't spoil the end, but it really makes everything you just read a complete waste of time. The ending basically says, \\"All of the historical information I [the author] just threw at you isn't even original!\\" Instead of reading this book, read some quick excerpt from a modern history textbook to tell you the true story of Richard III.On a positive note, Daughter of Time is a fairly quick 200 pages; thankfully, the author decides to not belabor the message. Furthermore, the arguments the author makes through the characters really are insightful, well-thought out, and well-researched. However, these arguments would be much better suited to a work of non-fictional literature since the fictional elements of this book are so risibly horrendous.All in all, unless you are a diehard history buff, avoid this book at all cost."},{"Title":"The Daughter of Time","review":"I found this book to be one of the most historically inacurate books on the Wars of the Roses ever written. Tey uses the shield of &quot;historical fiction&quot; and writes as a dabbler in the history of the period; without a serious consideration of the key players. She maligns the good reputation of Sir Thomas More, and makes ridiculous assumptions about his motives that do not stand up to close academic scrutiny. In addition she bases her detectives entire investigation on a portrait that is totally unauthenticated. I found her dismissal of Historians offensive and her overall lack of scholarship depressing. Read this book if you must, but then go out and get Alison Weir's &quot;The Princes in the Tower&quot; for a more accurate view of the period."},{"Title":"The Daughter of Time","review":"The pro-Richard effluvium is getting rather overwhelming here, so for all of you who think this is actually a history book, I'll recommend another book by a real scholar: The Princes in the Tower, by Alison Weir."},{"Title":"The Daughter of Time","review":"I had great difficulties through the years reading this book.

First, I am not a big fan of Mystery novels (I prefer Si-Fi, and History) and second, it was required reading for a History class. After two days of reading though I found that I completely enjoyed the book. I already had known that Richard III was not really responsible for the death of his nephews, but had not read anything connecting Henry VII. The book was fun to read because it shows how we historians can get sucked into proving or disproving a historical inaccuracy. The only negative part about the book would be that it in no way untangles the mess of the War of the Rose and for people who do not have that background it may be a little confusing. Though written over fifty years ago it is good to see that from a fictional sense, the drive behind research has not changed much. You have an idea, in the book's case the rumor of the Princess' death, and one goes of to find evidence of the rumors. The one thing that the book did not consider was that a lack of evidence does not mean there is none. The evidence the characters were searching for just may not have survived, forcing them to the same conclusion. Overall the book was great and fun to read, even for historians. I would highly recommend this book for people that wanted to read history without suffering through a dry textbook."},{"Title":"The Daughter of Time","review":"I first read this book in 6th Grade based on a teacher's recommendation and loved it (thank you Mrs. Ewing). Ms. Tey's conclusions about the inaccuracy of history written by the victors stuck in my mind then and continue to influence my view of history today.

I highly recommend this book and the other Alan Grant novels."},{"Title":"The Daughter of Time","review":"I recently found myself at SMSU's library with a few hours to kill and an overwhelming desire to read some fiction. The SMSU library's collection was not created with fiction readers in mind. So this is what I wound up with.For the most part, I found Tey's approach to solving the mystery of Richard III intriguing. It could have been much better, however. The &quot;frame&quot; of the recuperating police detective researching, with the aid of his hospital visitors, the documentation of the allegedly murderous king does not have enough character of its own to sustain a few hundred pages of rather dry, repetitious examination of history texts. And it does get repetitious, though I'll allow that the repetition was sometimes necessary to get the confusing assortment of nobility straight. (And this is considering that the book had two genealogy charts in the front, both of which had been annotated in pencil by some kind soul who recognized their vagueness.)I thought Tey made a number of interesting points, both regarding the reputation of Richard III and the concept of intellectual integrity as it relates to the study of history. But I didn't need to be repeatedly bonked on the head with said points.I would not recommend this book for anybody seeking a light tale of mystery fiction. I might, however, recommend this to a high school student or undergraduate who is studying Richard III, as it may provide a new point of view on the subject."},{"Title":"The Daughter of Time","review":"I first read this book many years ago, and it remains one of my favorite books ever. I just re-read it, and, though it was written in the 1950s, it does not feel dated. Only the length of Grant's recuperation (physical therapists will cringe at the length of time he is made to lie in bed) and the absence of computer resources make it seem a bit old.In this book, Josephine Tey, a mystery novelist, acquires credibility in historical circles. She, using the conceit of her Grant character's being laid up and needing an occupation to keep him from boredom, presents the revisionist theory of the fate of the &quot;Princes in the Tower&quot; in an extremely readable, interesting way. It is history presented as fiction. The revisionists believe that Richard III has gotten a bad rap from the Tudors and their tame historians and that he was framed for the death of the princes. Certainly, we end Tey's book being totally in accord with her, and Grant's, opinions.If you want some other reading to follow up after this book, I strongly recommend that you read &quot;Royal Blood&quot; by Bertram Fields and that you read Appendices I and II of Paul Murray Kendall's &quot;Richard III&quot;. Those appendices deal with the accuracy (or, rather, inaccuracy) of historical sources and with the death of the princes in the tower.I have just sent this book, with Field's book, to my law student daughter. I recommended it to her, and I recommend it to anyone who enjoys mysteries and history."},{"Title":"The Daughter of Time","review":"The Daughter of Time is a pleasant mixture of mystery novel and revisionist history. The book itself is thin, and there isn't much of a plot to the story, but the descriptive prose is wonderful and the characters really do seem real (even if rather dull).The premise is that an injured homicide detective is recouperating in a London hospital and, out of boredom, begins to read up on the infamous Richard III. After a few selections he begins to suspect that Richard's infamy may not be well-deserved, so he enlists the support of a young amateur research historian (a friend of an acquaintance) to unravel this &quot;mystery.&quot; There are no surprises throughout the evolution of the story; it plods along just as you would expect, but it is never boring. The realistic modern characters and the intriguing story of the Yorks and Tudors combine for an entertaining and refreshing work of short fiction. It is a fun little book that would be well-placed in high school English classes, where it would easily foster interest in both literature and history."},{"Title":"The Daughter of Time","review":"As a novel this richly deserves five stars: I agree with The New York Times that it is 'one of the best mysteries of all time.' This story has raised genuine interest among many people in the real history of Richard III and the murder of the Princes in the Tower, and made them examine the evidence for themselves.The style and many details of the novel also present a charming picture of Britain shortly after WWII, the period in which this book was written and set.But this is a work of fiction, not a history book, and the reader cannot assume that the evidence quoted by the characters in the novel comprises the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth.In this 1951 novel a police inspector, lying in a hospital bed after an accident, decides to try to solve the mystery of whether Richard III really murdered his young nephews, the former Edward V and his brother, Richard Duke of York, known as the Princes in the Tower. The evidence he discovers convinces him, and has subsequently convinced many of those who have read the novel, that Richard was innocent and the boys were actually murdered by his successor, Henry VII.When I first read this story as a boy, I enjoyed it immensely and it persuaded me for a while to take very seriously the possibility that Richard was not responsible for the murder, though even at that stage I could not accept the argument that Henry was to blame. The balance of evidence seems to suggest that the boys died in 1483 or 1484, which clears Henry Tudor as he was then an exile in France. (That in itself does not prove Richard's guilt - an alternative theory is that the Duke of Buckingham had the boys murdered.)I reread the book as an adult, and still found it extremely entertaining as a work of fiction, but this time I noticed a larger number of statements which the reader would be wise not to take as gospel.For example, the hero of the book, Inspector Grant, convinces himself that there was \\"no contemporary accusation\\" against Richard III of killing his nephews. This is not true. In January 1484 de Rochfort, the Lord Chancellor of France alleged openly at the Estates General (French Parliament) that Richard had had his nephews murdered.Many historians now suspect that Rochfort may have based this allegation on an account by Dominic Manchini, an Italian who visited England from 1482 to 1483, and who reported that it was suspected that the boys had been \\"done away with.\\" Mancini in turn may have gained this view either from popular gossip in London or from Doctor John Argentine, who had been treating Edward V in the tower for an illness and who is one of the last people known to have seen the boys alive.Nor was the French government the only foreign power whose agents told it during or very shortly after Richard's reign that he had murdered his nephews: for example a Spanish envoy, Diego de Valera, wrote to the King and Queen of Spain in 1486 that\\"It is sufficiently well known to your Royal Majesties that this Richard killed two innocent nephews of his, to whom this realm belonged after his brother's death.\\"Note that de Valera is not expecting this to be news: in a private letter to the rulers of Spain by one of their own people who does not appear to have had an axe to grind on behalf of the new Tudor regime, he takes for granted that his superiors will already share his assumption that Richard III killed the princes in the tower and that this will be \\"sufficiently well known\\" not to need further discussion.Alison Weir's book (see below) mentions half a dozen other sources dating to Richard III's reign or within a year of his death which accuse him of the murder.None of which proves Richard III guilty of killing the princes, but it does blow to smithereens the argument for Richard's innocence that there were no contemporary accusations that he had done so. There is no reasonable doubt that there really were allegations that Richard had killed the boys both during his reign and shortly afterwards.If the boys were still alive and well in early 1484 or when these rumours and allegations first started to circulate, Richard would have been very foolish not to squash them at the outset by producing the boys in public or in front of credible witnesses. And the one thing which none of Richard's worst enemies ever called him was a fool.Indeed, the most likely alternative if Ricahrd didn't have the boys killed is death by natural causes: 15th century medicine and hygiene were diabilical and the former Edward V was known to be unwell, which is why Doctor John Argentine was treating him. Death from natural causes would also fit one of the strongest pieces of evidence which Grant unearths: that the boy's mother, Elizabeth Woodville, appears to have remained on surprisingly good terms with Richard until his death.In the novel, when Inspector Grant learns of the speech made by the Lord Chancellor of France, he and the other character in the story who is working with him immediately recognise this allegation as a serious threat to the case for Richard's innocence. But then Inspector Grant decides to dismiss it as a politician scoring a propaganda point, argues that Rochfort was repeating a libel fed him by Richard III's enemy Cardinal Morton, and goes back to making a major part of his case for Richard's innocence the fantasy that there was \\"no contemporary accusation.\\" If the good inspector had ever made a statement that far from the truth while giving evidence in a courtroom, he would have been lucky to avoid a charge of professional misconduct.Indeed, Grant convinces himself that any evidence which doesn't fit his theory has been concocted by Cardinal Morton, and disregards it. He argues that Sir Thomas More's account of the murder might also have been taken from, or even written by, Cardinal Morton. Research by Brian Spencer published in 1973, many years after this novel, casts considerable doubt on this theory.Grant dismisses an important contemporary source, the \\"Chronicles of Croyland\\" as the work of an ignorant monk who may, yet again, have been repeating a story fed him by Morton. Most modern historians including some who are relatively sympathetic to Richard III such as Elizabeth Jenkins, think that the sections of this chronicle relating to his reign are actually the work of Dr John Russell, Bishop of Lincoln and Richard III's own Lord Chancellor.There are also serious holes in some of Grant's arguments that Henry VII was the real murderer. For example, Henry went to considerable lengths to suppress the arguments Riohard had used to justify declaring his nephews illegitimate and claiming the throne: he ordered the destruction of all copies of the act of parliament (\\"Titulus Regius\\") which proclaimed Richard as King. Inspector Grant presents this as an argument for Henry VII's guilt and suggests that the only possible reason for Henry trying to destroy the documents concerned is that he had something to hide.That argument does not hold water. Henry had a much more obvious and less sinister motive: he had married Elizabeth of York, the sister of the Princes in the tower, who would also have been illegitimate if the basis on which Richard took the throne were valid. Henry's position on the throne and his policy of reconciliation between Lancastrians and Yorkists would both have been weakened if that were the case: almost the last thing he could afford would be people repeating the allegation that his Queen was illegitimate.Ironically, the germ of truth behind one of Grant's main arguments for Richard's innocence is also an argument for Henry's. Although there certainly were contemporary accusations and rumours that Richard had murdered his nephews, and Henry Tudor profited greatly from them, neither Henry nor his closest associates publicly and explicitly made that accusation against Richard at the time. The most likely explanation for this surprising silence was that Henry was not absolutely certain that the boys were dead, and feared looking like a fool or a liar if Richard or anyone else could produce them. And if Henry was not certain that the boys were dead, he cannot have murdered them.Elizabeth Jenkins, a historian who shares the view put forward by Josephine Tey in this novel that Richard III was a much better King and man than he is sometimes given credit for, notes that\\"It must be admitted that both Richard III and Henry VII were thoroughly formidable, and that to be found standing in the way of either of them was a fatal misfortune.\\"I've put some of the other side of the case here, not because \\"The Daughter of Time\\" is a bad book or a bad argument, but to demonstrate that it should be appreciated for what it is, a hugely entertaining and informative novel putting one side of a fascinating mystery, and encouraging people to challenge evidence and think for themselves about received wisdom. And not for what it isn't, an objective appraisal which \\"proves\\" Richard's innocence.The one thing which all sides should be able to agree on with certainty concerning the deaths of the princes in the tower is that whether they were murdered or died of natural causes, whoever ordered their deaths or was responsible for them at the time so successfully suppressed or altered the evidence that we can never prove beyond reasonable doubt what really happened. There is no way that a properly-run modern court would convict Richard III, Henry VII, or the Duke of Buckingham on the evidence which survives.If you want to study the controversy, one history book which I can particularly recommend as a good starting point is \\"The Princes In The Tower\\" by Alison Weir, a clear and well-argued book which comes down firmly of the view that Richard murdered his nephews, and indeed that he also murdered quite a few other people.A somewhat different view of Richard is given by Elizabeth Jenkins in her book, also called \\"The Princes in the Tower\\" which, as mentioned, shares Josephine Tey's view that Richard had many \\"fine traits of character and intelligence\\" who made \\"an excellent beginning in his short time as King\\" and clears him of several of the murders of which he is often accused. But not that of his nephews: while she does not regard the case for his guilt as completely proven, she argues that the circumstantial evidence for his guilt is \\"so strong as to be almost conclusive.\\"An early and very forthright exponent of Richard III's innocence and Henry VII's guilt was Sir Clements Markham, who put forward his views in \\"Richard III, His Life and Character: Reviewed in the Light of Recent Research (1906), while a more modern view sympathetic to Richard is offered in \\"Royal Blood: Richard III and the Mystery of the Princes\\" by Bertram Fields.But for all the doubts that I now have about Inspector Grant's conclusions, this book can and should be enjoyed as \\"One of the 20th Century's great works of Fiction\\" and it is on that basis that I have given it five stars."},{"Title":"The Daughter of Time","review":"Josephine Tey was once a well known British writer of mysteries. I'm afraid she is now mostly forgotten---except for the classic \\"Daughter of Time.\\" If you like history, if you like true life mysteries, or children-in-peril stories, in fact if you are a Shakespeare fan or a Tudor era afficiando or any of the above, you'll want to read this slim book. Written in 1951, close to the author's death, the language, and the descriptions of clothes, cars, and the way of life of the two \\"modern\\" young characters strikes one as dated and quaint, but somehow quite appropriate for this story. An injured Scotland Yard inspector is in hospital with a severe leg injury---shades of Patterson's Alex Cross!---so his young female friend has to be his legs, eyes, and researcher, and they become involved in a \\"cold case\\" 470 years old. The mystery is: who killed, or, made to disappear forever, the two young princes who were legitimage heirs to the British throne during the bloody \\"War of the Roses\\". Supposedly for their safety the boys,aged 12 and 10 were put into the Tower of London, which was not simply a jail, but also a royal residence at that time. In the case of the young boys, at the culmination of the horrifically violent War of the Roses, which destroyed many of the oldest noble houses of England, the mother of the young princes is said to have asked their uncle, Richard III to bring them back to her. Their father the king was dead: Richard III was their guardian. At that time, so it said, he told her he didn't know where they were. There was no proof of anything, and no bodies. For the next five centuries, down to the present, Richard III has been blamed for the deaths, probably mostly due to the play of Shakespeare: \\"Richard III\\", written under the auspices of the Tudor monarachy. The sister of the dead boys, Elizabeth of York, was married to the surviving male prince of the opposing side in the war,Henry Tudor, beginning the Tudor dynasty. Richard III who did wantto rule, was killed in battle. He was villified for the deaths of the innocent children. The \\"traditional\\" view of this can be read in Allison Weir's \\"The Princes in the Tower\\", based on the (mostly Tudor) records of the time, which blames Richard III. In Tey's book, the two young people are able to do research and find enough suspicious material that they doubt the story they have always been taught, and come to believe Richard III was innocent. In fact, there are quite a few legitimate historians who do feel Richard III was scapegoated by the Tudors who did not want two boys who were legitimate heirs alive to claim the throne after the war was over. Tey knew of this argument,and put the words into the mouths of her characters. (Centuries later the skeletons of two male children were found under the stairs in an old part of the tower of London."},{"Title":"The Daughter of Time","review":"One of those rare novels that is both entertaining and informative,like the Da Vinci Code.

This book was required introductory reading in Historiography, a course required of history majors or those contemplating that field of study. Indeed, The Daughter of Time was a perfect object-lesson in why we should history critically, why we should question its authors and its source materials, why we should mine footnotes and bibliographies for value or falsity.It helped that Ms. Tey's prose is clear and her modern-day characters likeable, as they unfold the Richard III story anew. It is perfect for teaching history, as an object lesson. No accident that Grant's American friend wants to title his new book about Richard III, \\"History is Bunk.\\" I could appreciate, and savor, reading history only after learning to debunk it, and I'm still grateful to Ms. Tey after these many years of reading history, and writing it, for showing the way."},{"Title":"The Daughter of Time","review":"This is a wonderful genre bending book...part mystery, part history. Written by Scotswoman Elizabeth MacIntosh, who wrote under the pen name Josephine Tey, it was first published in 1951. It is tragic that the author died in 1952 and was never to know the pleasure that this book would bring to generations of readers and that the Mystery Writers of America would ultimately rank it fourth among the one hundred best mysteries ever written.The title of the book is derived from a historical source, as it is attributable to Sir Francis Bacon, \\"For truth is rightly named after the daughter of time, and not of authority.\\" The book itself is not a traditional mystery but rather an application of deductive reasoning to an actual historical event. The event in question is the murder of the princes in the tower, sons of King Edward IV, allegedly by their uncle, Richard III, who eventually usurped the English throne after the death of his brother. It has been widely held that Richard III did, indeed, murder the two young princes, his nephews, in order to secure his claim to the throne.The reader is introduced to Scotland Yard Inspector Alan Grant, who is hospitalized and recovering from injuries sustained in the line of duty. While convalescing, he becomes intrigued by a picture of a portrait of Richard III, a likeness with which he is unfamiliar. Grant is puzzled that someone with such a sensitive face could have been such a monster as to murder his two nephews in cold blood. So, our intrepid Inspector decides that he will reconsider the evidence upon which such a dastardly assumption has been based. With the help of an American researcher doing the necessary legwork, Grant compiles enough archival historical fact that incrementally helps him formulate a new theory as to who actually may have murdered the princes in the tower.This analysis and reformulation is done as though it were being argued to a jury. Indeed, so persuasive is Inspector Grant through the application of some insightful deductive reasoning and clever dialogue that the reader comes away thinking that Grant has solved one of the most intriguing historical mysteries of all time. This is certainly an unusual book conceptually but one that succeeds brilliantly. It should appeal to those readers who enjoy having a mystery unraveled, as well as to those who harbor a love of English history.Derek Jacobi gives a lively and spirited reading. He positively shines when reading the role of Detective Grant and gives a most persuasive characterization. It almost more a performance than a reading. The only slight problem is that when incorporating the role of the American researcher into the reading, his American accent falters a bit. Despite this small issue, however, his reading of this brilliant work is one of the most engaging that I have ever heard in an audio book. Bravo!"},{"Title":"The Daughter of Time","review":"I was given this book by a friend who thought my one-eyed, anti- Richard III attitude was lacking in factual conviction. After having read this wonderfully well written book, I realised the dangers of basing ones opinions on facts that have been written by Victors. I am now more inclined to believe that while Richard III may have had a little wickedness in him, Henry VII would have had a lot more to answer to when he reached St Peter and the Pearly Gates. I thoroughly recommend 'The Daughter of Time'. It is a thought provoking read and makes you realise that you have to approach the 'facts' with a certain amount of sceptism. This book has made me a better historian. It provided me with a valuable lesson right from the start. Josephine Tey is a wonderful writer and I credit her as one of the two people who provided me with the inspiration and impetus to further my studies in history."},{"Title":"The Daughter of Time","review":"The most fascinating thing about this very unusual mystery is its approach to mystery, motive, human nature...and most of all, its complete lack of new evidence. I'm a big fan of genre-busting, and am impressed that this book held my attention so well when the searchers found no new evidence, used no forensic evidence, had no bodies, and in fact (in the main character's case) almost never left the room.Tey does well with dialogue and characterization, and has an intriguingly skeptical view of history (and historians). The weakest parts of this book come when she tries to manufacture excitement; the intellectual thrill of discovering connections -- and unraveling false ones -- was enough to keep my interest, but I found myself unimpressed by her attempts to write visceral aHA!s into the scenes. It makes a better diatribe or historical essay than novel. I did enjoy the way in which Grant and Carradine look at motive and multiple sources and try to see if the entire puzzle fits together. It may not be scientific or conclusive, but it sure is convincing...but (having been inspired by the book's detectives) I'm on my way to find modern anti-Ricardians to see if Tey was just shooting at the easy marks...In the interest of full disclosure, I have taught Shakespeare's _Richard III_ in a high school before, and have studied the historical context of Richard III's rise and fall. I can imagine this book could be tedious reading for someone who hasn't studied British history, but if you're interested in the topic and the concept of mystery and/or history, I think you will enjoy this book. I found this book a thought-provoking exercise into the nature of subjectivity and objectivity, and liked it for that."},{"Title":"The Daughter of Time","review":"I was delighted to read this book. Having been a college history major and a person trained in the law, it had a special appeal. It is a great treat to see a commonly held belief about history proven to be wrong. Yes, there were conspiracies and cover-ups in medieval times, as well as political intrigue. It is like Game of Thrones unfolding, and peeling away the layers of history and falsehood to find the truth.I give my thanks to the trusts and estates lawyer who recommended this book to me. Thanks, Patti. I enjoyed the book."},{"Title":"The Daughter of Time","review":"Recently, I received a copy of the book The Daughter of Time by Josephine Tey. My son bought it (from an amazon seller) for me for my birthday. I'd heard of the book before, but never read it. It's fiction, and is about a modern day British detective (well, 1950s \\"modern\\" because that's when the book originally was written). This detective is laid up in a hospital after an accident and he, together with a research assistant who is a new acquaintance of his, have fun delving into the lies & conspiracies connected to the life & death of King Richard III. The Tey book is wonderful and quite entertaining!When I started reading the book, I found I liked it a lot and thought I'd read a bit more of it on the following day. However, when I turned on my computer the next morning and looked at the news ... Lo & Behold, the morning news reported that the remains of Richard III were uncovered under a parking lot in England and just been positively identified. It just seemed uncanny - Richard III had been buried for about 500 years, and then news regarding his remains is announced right when I start reading the book. What excellent timing!I finished the Tey book that same day - and I highly recommend it!"},{"Title":"The Daughter of Time","review":"I picked this novel up on a whim, read it, and actually ended up sending to British booksellers (this was in the mid 70's - no internet or Amazon)to obtain material related to the historical resources available at the time, and actually ended up reading the Lysle Letters. She is right on:history is written by the victors, and in the case where skulduggery and unenlightened self-interest rule, the results can be pretty stupid. Shaksepeare was a spin-doctor with no good intentions, and Richard was actually the only person in the English Upper echelons who really and actually HAD absolutely no reason to want the princes dead.Fabulous book!"},{"Title":"The Daughter of Time","review":"Prolific and acclaimed British mystery writer Josephine Tey, author of the classicMan in the Queue, presents her long time character Inspector Alan Grant laid up with a broken leg for a while. True to character, Grant cannot stand not having a mystery to occupy his mind, and a chance encounter with a picture of Richard III leads him to become intrigued with the famous mystery of the death of the two Princes in the tower. The good news is that you do not need to be a history buff to appreciate this mystery, but you may become one along the way. Meet Richard III and and Henry VII, and learn about he Princes while staying with Grant in the modern world as he attempts to solve a centuries old mystery. Tey is a prolific mystery writer and Inspector Alan Grant is a fascinating detective. Tey stays with historical fact, when known, and consults modern historians when speculating. This classic belongs on every mystery lovers bookshelf, and would be a great gift for history buffs, most of whom are well aware of the historical mystery a the heart of this book. I reread it myself every few years."},{"Title":"The Daughter of Time","review":"The Daughter of Time is a strange little book. The writing was rather stilted and hard to wade through. I'm not sure if this is because the book was written in an earlier era and uses a lot of British terms and vocabulary that I, as an American reader, am not familiar with. In any case, the writing had me skimming over some sections that just got too bogged down.Also, I am no expert of English history. I do not feel at all qualified to comment on the historical accuracy of Tey's findings. However, I do believe that history is told through the eyes of the winners. To me, Tey postulates that what \\"actually\\" happened may be markedly different from the way the incident is captured in history. This I do believe is an essential and valid point. I find the book raises the question for me about blind acceptance of what I read as historical fact. These facts may often not reflect what happened. This is part of historical reporting, but it is something that is rarely acknowledged or accepted. Tey has lifted the issue and madce it real."},{"Title":"The Daughter of Time","review":"The picture of Richard III on the cover of this book hints at the content; unless you are deeply into Francis Bacon (or possibly Galileo, through Bertolt Brecht), the title does not. The Daughter of Time is Truth, and the book offers a radically different kind of detective novel. Alan Grant, a Scotland Yard sleuth established as a character in some of Josephene Tey's earlier novels, is laid-up in hospital and keeps boredom at bay by searching for the truth about Richard III. It seems to Grant, and we can verify this for ourselves, that the picture of Richard just doesn't look like the scheming, grasping, murderous character traditionally presented to us, not least by Shakespeare.If the Princes in the Tower went missing, presumably murdered, whilst under Richard's protection, how was it that their mother and sisters remained on apparently good terms with Richard? Were the Princes in fact still alive when Richard was killed on Bosworth Field and Henry VII succeeded to the throne? If they were, what then became of them? If murdered at the behest of either Richard or Henry, why didn't they say the boys had died of fever and bury them publicly, so as to avoid challenges to the throne in the name of the young Edward V?We are unlikely now to establish definitive answers to these and other intriguing questions, but Alan Grant's asking of them and unearthing of the tangled story behind them makes a fascinating read - except perhaps for professional historians, who might be irritated by some unflattering generalizations made about themselves and by the ducking of a couple of inconvenient facts. But, hey, this is only a story, and it could well inspire the budding of a new young historian, or initiate an absorbing new hobby for someone a little older. Or simply be enjoyed as a detective novel with a difference, one that is much faster-paced than you might expect of an investigation of events that occurred more than 500 years ago and that is conducted entirely from a hospital bed."},{"Title":"The Daughter of Time","review":"I've read this book twice, and I remember that the first time I read it, I was awed by the premise: that a Scotland Yard investigator, laid up in a hospital bed with a broken leg, sets about to \\"solve\\" a historical mystery that occurred some 500 years earlier: the murder (most likely) of the Princes in the Tower. The title of the novel is based on the saying, \\"Truth is the daughter of time,\\" meaning, in this case, that what we're told is true depends on what time we're living in. It's another way of saying that history is written by the victors, not the victims.Both times I read this book, I was wrapped up in Alan Grant's reasoning and discoveries about whether the princes were murdered; if so, by whom; whether Richard III committed the murders, called for them, abetted the murderer, and so on. You would think that a book in which the detective is bed-bound would be dull, but this book is not dull by any means. The discoveries and conclusions are interesting and exciting.But both times I read this book, I was also bothered by the detective's premise: he sees a portrait of Richard III and concludes from the portrait that a man who looks like that could not be a murderer. With this conclusion in mind, Grant proceeds to find evidence that supports his conclusion. Putting the conclusion first, then finding facts to \\"fit\\" it is bad research and bad detection. So, although I love this book, I have never been entirely convinced that what Grant concludes is the truth. I do, however, recommend this book to anybody looking for an unusual and good mystery story."},{"Title":"The Daughter of Time","review":"I have always loved this book and bought this to give to a brother in law who only knew Richard III from the Shakespeare play. In my opinion Tey proves Richard has been maligned for centuries by Tudor historians and others using them as sources. I feel this is a must read for anyone interested in Richard III."},{"Title":"The Daughter of Time","review":"Having read both Sharon Kay Penman's excellent &quot;The Sunne in Splendour&quot; and Alison Weir's abysmal &quot;The Princes in the Tower&quot;, I decided to try something a little different and go for this book. While I agree with some other reviewers that the plot may be a little thin, and in places it seems almost like Ms. Tey is just giving evidence instead of telling an actual story, I didn't mind so much. It was a quick read, but a very good one, and I particularly enjoy her writing style.Since I flatter myself that I am pretty familiar with most of the Richard evidence, I was pleased to find that there were a few things in this book I hadn't read/heard before. All in all, I thought this was a fun book, not at all boring. Of course, since I agree with her conclusion (and found myself believing in Richard's innocence even more after reading Ms. Weir's poorly researched book of supposition) it was bound to be a lot of fun for me.If you are interested in the Richard mystery, give this one a try!"},{"Title":"The Daughter of Time","review":"I, too, love this book. It's a wonderful introduction to the intricacies of English royalty of the period, and prompted me to search out Thomas B. Costain's wonderful series that begins with &quot;The Conquering Family.&quot;Tey's book is fun to read and re-read, and I look forward to the passing of a few more years when I can pick it up again."},{"Title":"The Daughter of Time","review":"This hardcover edition of The Daughter of Time is expensive and cheaply done. There are many appalling typos, the most absurd being \\" Henry VIP\\" for Henry VII. It possibly constitutes a copyright violation, with no publisher or publishing date information. The front cover picture is of Edward III, not Richard III. An insult to Josephine Tey's brilliant and well-written book. Read her book, just don't buy this edition!"},{"Title":"The Daughter of Time","review":"Heard this book recommended on radio 4 and was intrigued enough to buy it. If ever a case was made for questioning what you're told and not blithely trusting received wisdom, then this is it! Assuming all the facts presented here are true, and following my own logic I should investigate further, then Richard lll has been grievously wronged for 500 and some years and still is being now, in the face of overwhelmingly convincing evidence that he didn't harm a hair on the heads of any Princes. Even the considerable presence of Elizabeth l seems scant recompense for the underhand doings of her grandfather Henry Vll! Mind you, l'm wondering about her now! A truly enlightening book, thank you Peter Hitchins for your recommendation!"},{"Title":"The Daughter of Time","review":"Patience is a virtue. And you'll need quite a large amount of it if you're to read this book. For the first 50 or so pages, the story is rather slow a majority of the time. True, they do have their interesting bits, but they are short and few. However, after the first 50 or so pages...if you're a history buff, you're in for quite a ride! Ms Tey explores every aspect of Richard III's case for and against him in the murder of his two nephews. Her reccuring theme of the fallibility of evidence and the persecution of innocence is strongly present in this novel. Includes a rather &quot;quirky&quot; ending that the less &quot;straightforward&quot; readers will quite enjoy."},{"Title":"The Daughter of Time","review":"a different approach to what might have happend in the castle when richard III ruled england.you will become your own detective and come to your own conclusions. I looked for more books on richard III ever since josephine tey introduced me to him. Thank you J.T...."},{"Title":"The Daughter of Time","review":"I'm a Ricardian. I don't think Richard did his nephews in. Neither do I think that this book is a classic. It has a rather simple premise, and Tey seems completely set upon raising Richard III to a sort of divine pedestal. The guy had flaws. He was responsible for beheading people, and was a king. He is one of my favorite characters in history, and Tey tries, she does...but it falls flat. Carradine got on my nerves as well. Sorry.If you want an admittedly romanticized (but far more interesting) book about Richard III, I would wholeheartedly suggest &quot;The Sunne in Splendour&quot;. It is a finely crafted novel in which Sharon Kay Penman goes to show you that it is indeed very possible that Richard III was not the brute Will Shakespeare makes him out to be. Penman stays well within the historical boundaries (her reasearch is almost without boundaries)."},{"Title":"The Daughter of Time","review":"I listened to the audio version of this book and was enchanted from the beginnning. Derek Jacobi is engrossing as Detective Grant.I found myself listening and becoming steadily wrapped up in his research as he tried to unravel the mystery of Richard III.My only regret is that it ended. I wanted it to go on for a lot longer."},{"Title":"The Daughter of Time","review":"This book was recommended to me during a family discussion on whether or not Richard III was guilty of killing his two nephews. I expected this book to be a biography, but it is presented in a fiction form of an inspector and a student looking into the mystery of Richard III while the inspector was bedridden. The dialogue in the book is between the inspector and the student, who is doing the research at the British Museum. The student then brings the research information back to the bedridden inspector. There are some good points made in the book which casts doubt on the general history's portrait of Richard III as the evil uncle. Although the book is well written and make interesting points, I cannot help be wonder whether or not the information is fiction because of the way Tey presented the story. Tey shows alternate theories of what may have happened to the Princes in the Tower."},{"Title":"The Daughter of Time","review":"I found the build up more than the result here. The debunking of the legend of Richard III is, as the author herself admits, an old tale, well documented (and ignored) since at least 1850. This version was not a particularly unique or involving tale, in fact often repetitive and frustrating. The reader is advised to start early in the book by making endpage notes of the characters, to avoid getting lost in the litany of who begat whom and which titles go with which earls. I found myself referring back to A Sunne in Spendor by Sharon K Penman for the family tree that she included in a much more readable, believable, involving version of the story.The central character of Fey's story spends the entire novel on his back. The storyline is similarly tied down. His research sheds light on the possible motive on the part of the historical antagonists, but still fails to make a conviction. In the end, it is as if the author spent a lot of time researching something already discovered, and then admits that disappointment but cannot put aside her work. She publishes it, we buy it, and her estate profits.Back to Penman for me. I want a little more humanity in my history."},{"Title":"The Daughter of Time","review":"This book has to be the worst book.... other than Shakespeare.... that i have ever read in my high school career. It goes on and on about a murder that really doesn't matter and the guy doesn't even get out of bed."},{"Title":"The Daughter of Time","review":"Oddly enough I've had Ms Tey's The Daughter of Time in my own library off and on for years, but just never got around to reading it. Usually it got given away whenever I moved. This time I actually took a moment to read the cover introduction and decided to buy it once more, fully resolved to reading it immediately. Once I got into it, I couldn't put it down. The lady justly deserves her reputation as a gifted writer.As the commentator Robert Barnard opines at the beginning of the book, Tey's style is difficult to pigeon hole. I'd read one other book by her (Miss Pym Disposes) and this story was not remotely what I expected. The Daughter of Time (a title taken from an old proverb, \\"Truth is the daughter of time\\") is a wonderful medley of history, mystery, and theatrical. One can easily see the author's grounding in the world of the stage.The entire story takes place in a hospital room and in the imagination of its occupant. The action, if you can call it that, comes through the introduction of information by various other characters who aid the invalid, an injured detective from Scotland Yard, in his attempt to discover the true story of Richard the Third-yes that nasty fellow who murdered his nephews in the Tower of London.....or did he? He pursues the evidence as he would a modern day crime, believing nothing until he can validate it by a primary source. Slowly but surely he builds his case.From the beginning the author has complete control of her reader's attention-I read the entire book in about 2 hours. After creating the image of the hospital room and the ennui of its occupant, she wastes very little verbage on descriptions beyond creating the personalities of the walk on characters. Most of the focus is on solving the puzzle of the murders and the reality of the time in which all the historical figures lived. One almost has the sense of a stage with the main character addressing his audience with his thoughts when alone or his guests when they make appearances. A spotlight may fall on the actions of the past and their participants briefly, then dissolve as the story progresses to the next fact and how it fits into the tale of the young princes and their uncle. This makes it a rapid and enjoyable read. I'd love to see it done as a play. It's set might be very nearly as economical as that for Our Town.A tightly written, well researched work of art. For anyone with an interest in history, mystery and/or the stage, this is the book for you."},{"Title":"The Daughter of Time","review":"This novel is nore of a historical investigation than a murder mystery. The novel starts out with Inspector Alan Grant recovering form a broken leg. While perusing reading materials he is intrigued by England's last Plantagenet, King Richard III. Did he murder or arrange the assasination of his two young nephews? Most of the text which he reads say this is true. He wants to investigate further into the matter. Grant enlists the aid of an American researcher, Brent Carradine.What they find is available to the public. This particular mystery is not so interesting in the conclusion; but how and why they reached their results. The information is available at all public libraries.Miss Tey has apparent sentiments for Richard III. For myself it was refreshing to read such sentiments. In school years we were taught that King Richard was the \\"wicked uncle\\". While studying Shakespeare, there was THAT overdone line beaten like a dead horse (no pun or whatever intended). It was hard to reconcile the historical caricature with the picture on my mother's book jacket of the biography of Richard III. The drawing seemed to be of an ascetic fine featured and calm intellectual. The book invites us to reasearch and draw our own conclusions.This may not be germane to the novel, but I appreciated Josephine Tey's portrayal of the American character. Many British writers characterize Americans as loud and slow witted. Carradine is portrayed as a bright and eager assistant.I read this book in the course of 2 days during my beach vacation. It was time well spent."},{"Title":"The Daughter of Time","review":"&quot;The Daughter of Time&quot; is an excellent look into the reign of Richard III and the controversy surrounding the Princes in the Tower. Ms. Tey presents her analytical analysis under the guise of a modern detective story, but in truth this book is an historical analysis of Richard III, his life and his actions. Ms. Tey's presentation makes this work especially accessible to those who are normally turned off to history. When I read &quot;The Daughter of Time&quot; I was struck by her great charecterisations, and the conversations between Grant and Carradine are excellent. For all of you who are only familiar with Shakespeare's rather diabolical Richard III, this is the book that will cause you to re-assess your opinion of Richard III."},{"Title":"The Daughter of Time","review":"This remarkable book deserves credit for not only being an intriguing story, but also a novel that is able to make the intricacies of history and medieval politics accessible to the reader. Instead of focusing on long and boring lists of sources, Tey goes into the whys of the mystery as well as the whats. Tey clearly challenges the long (and unfairly) established perception of Richard the III by asking one question: Why? Why would Richard have committed the crime? Why is he painted as villainous and grasping when all the evidence shows otherwise? Why did Tudor, who villified Richard mercilessly, never actually accuse Richard of the murder? Tey argues these points and backs them up superbly with evidence rather than hearsay from Tudor historians. She fully explores the motivations of the historians as well as Richard's supposed motives. Tey asks the questions which historians always ignore, such as Why the supposedly ruthless Richard would act with such restraint against proven enemies? These questions are every bit as valid as the traditional arguments, perhaps even more so, because they go into the very heart and nature of the deeds and the people involvedIncidentally, the title comes from the saying: &quot;Truth is the daughter of time.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Daughter of Time","review":"This book, under the guise of being a traditional crime story, unravels one of Britain's biggest mystery: who--if anyone--killed the Princes in the Tower? Shakespeare's play has led people to believe for nearly 400 years that it was King Richard III, perhaps literature's most enduring villain. Josephine Tey has done her homework on this, and the answers will astonish you. I must confess that I am biased, being a member of the Richard III Society; also, I have not checked each of her sources, so I am perhaps being lazy in assuming her facts are accurate. Nonetheless, this book is a perfect antidote if one has seen the superb version of Richard III with Ian McKellan(unashamed plug--I really love that movie!), and you can make up your own mind whether or not old Dickon was the most unfairly villified man in history. Also, being 200 pages, and a real page-turner at that, it is a quiet afternoon's read. Pick it up--I promise you won't be bored!"},{"Title":"The Daughter of Time","review":"This was a fascinating read by Josephine Tey. It is the story of Alan Grant, a policeman with Scotland Yard, who is laid up in the hospital after being injured on the job. A friend brings in a portrait of Richard III and he has a hard time believing that the man in the picture is the horrible, nephew murdering hunchback that he is familiar with. This sparks his interest and to relieve his boredom he takes up the 400+ year old case of Richard III - did he or did he not murder his nephews in the Tower? He and an American researcher working in the British Museum sort through all the evidence they can get and look at the case through a policeman's perspective - considering motives, opportunities, written accounts from the times, looking for breaks in the normal routine of the main players, etc. Grant becomes convinced that, based on the evidence, that Richard did not murder his nephews. In fact, he had absolutely nothing to gain and quite a bit to loose if he did.It should be mentioned that Tey is writing a work of fiction here so I'm sure some things that didn't fit into her story were most likely left out. But that aside, it is an intriguing look at a man who history has made out to be a horrible monster. One of the points Grant realizes (and probably the biggest) is that, basically, history is written by the victors. Anything that might make them, the victors, look bad is going to be changed and anything that can discredit the vanquished will be trumped up as much as possible.Some of the evidence/points that Grant comes across:1. The accepted history of Richard III was written by Thomas More who was about 8 when Richard was killed AND he was writing for a Tudor King. He certainly wasn't going to publish anything that would make Henry VIII's father look bad. Also, a lot of his information apparently came from a certain John Morton, who hated Richard. (It should be noted that Shakespeare used More's account of Richard's life when writing his play Richard III, which most people today base their idea of Richard on.)2. Richard had declared all of Edward's children illegitimate but there were still several heirs in line ahead of him and they continued to live happy lives during his reign. No reason to do away with just two of the heirs between him and the throne and leave all the others.3. When Henry VII was having all of Richard's crimes laid out never once was the murder of the Princes mentioned. He wasn't even accused of it.4. After Richard took the throne, Elizabeth Woodville came out of sanctuary, her daughters went to Richard's court, and she wrote to one of her Grey sons in France to come home because Richard would be kind to him. Would she have done this if she thought Richard killed her sons?5. Henry VII, to bolster his claim to the throne after killing Richard, married Elizabeth of York, the sister of the Princes in the Tower. To make her claim to the throne valid, he had to make her (and ALL her siblings) legitimate. Once he did that, her brother was the rightful King again.These are just a few of the points Grant considers when he finally comes to his verdict at the end. Some of the information Tey puts into her story certainly will make you think about what you accept as history, especially in a case such as Richard's. I do wish the story had been longer and more detail given about some of the evidence presented but I would recommend this book to anyone who is interested in Richard III."},{"Title":"The Daughter of Time","review":"In reading the negative reviews here it is clear that there is a great deal of disregard for the facts those same reviewers seem so determined to champion. You will notice that The Daughter of Time is classified as fiction because that is what Tey intended. To criticize its lack of historical veracity is to require that all fiction adhere to some historical yardstick of verifiable fact. Leaving aside the impossibility of \\"verifying\\" history before allowing anyone to write stories about it, restricting literature to such ridiculous standards misses the very joy of creation--and disqualifies virtually all fiction ever written.Those who criticize Tey for disregarding Alison Weir's stellar research might benefit from this bit of research: Weir was born in 1951, the year The Daughter of Time was published. Moreover, if I were to criticize Weir's characters and events as implausible, I would rightly be ridiculed for attempting to review her work as fiction instead of scholarship. How foolish would that be?Having said this, I must admit this is probably my least favorite of Tey's novels. Once was enough. The others I can consume again and again, discovering fresh nuance and subtlety with each read. The Singing Sands and Brat Farrar are special favorites. The best thing about her small collection of mysteries is that each tells a unique story that transcends the genre's typical formulas. Nothing pleases the lover of mysteries more than the unexpected.Tey wrote fiction, not history. The sloppy, reckless comments posted here reflect only on those who write them, but those critics should note that Tey still has them talking more than half a century after her death. Unless they consider their writing a bit more carefully, one doubts anyone will be reading them next month."},{"Title":"The Daughter of Time","review":"A seminal work in British mystery writing -- and an eye-opening look at the murders of the Princes in the Tower.

You haven't read deeply into the British mystery genre until you've read this one.

Even when he is flat on his back, convalescing in a hospital bed, staring at the ceiling and desperate for something to occupy his mind and his time.To amuse him, a friend brings him prints of portraits from the National Gallery -- men, women, and children -- since Grant has a reputation for being able to read a person's character in his face. Grant is successful in distinguishing offenders from victims, until he reaches the last portrait. A judge? A soldier? A prince? he wonders. The name on the back of the print: Richard the Third.Grant refuses to believe that the man's face can so belie his reputation as a murderer. And so, still on his back in bed, Grant becomes determined to find out the truth about Richard the Third for himself. With the help of those around him (characters who are also intriguing in their own right), he assembles information from historical documents to help him decide the 'case.'It is remarkable enough for Tey to have put together the evidence she assembles for Richard the Third's case. Her research, logic, and common sense are impeccable. But to present that case in the hospital -- where the quiet, white, solemn setting is in stark contrast to the story of compassion, courage, suffering and betrayal that Grant's investigation reveals -- is inspired. Tey literally resurrects Richard and his story. Admiration, pity, and outrage are aroused in the reader for a man who has been dead for centuries.And Grant, in his meticulous and painstakingly logical way, arrives at a conclusion that you are sure must close the book on the question of Richard's innocence forever.All this (not to mention the subtle commentary on what is truth) in just over 200 pages. A book worth reading and re-reading."},{"Title":"The Daughter of Time","review":"In this 1951 English detective novel, Inspector Alan Grant is laid up in the hospital for a long time to come, courtesy of injuries sustained in pursuit of a suspect, including a broken leg. He is bored beyond belief. Gal pal Marta, a stage actress, decides to entertain him. Knowing his gift as a detective is to read faces, she gets a curator friend to pull prints of portraits in the Victoria and Albert museum, portraits of historically controversial personages. The one that catches his eye is rather benign, and thus he is quite surprised to learn it is that of the real life English monster who stalks children's textbooks and Shakespeare's drama, Richard III. Not a hunchback in sight.Richard is notoriously pinned for the death of his nephews, two of the children of his predecessor on the throne, Edward IV. Richard is credited with taking the last of the Plantegenet line, and thus the medieval period of the English monarchy, down with him in 1485 on the battlefield at Bosworth, which also effectively concluded the messy Wars of the Roses and left the country open for the arrival of Henry (VII) Tudor from France to usher in what the sweeping generalists call the modern era. With the aid of a young American scholar looking for a cause, Grant applies police logic in determining Richard's guilt and whodunit. It is no longer a secret that he exonerates Richard, but what continues to dog Tey long after her death (shortly after this was published) is who she then points the finger at. People, even grumbling historians who don't like the fact that a nonprofessional got deep into their territory, either are with her or against her. No one feels indifferent.It's not just the information that's good about this book. Tey managed to build the thrill of the research ride into a very well-written book, with high style and great wit. She sorts out a very complicated drama with a huge cast of players with ease. She says a lot about the nature of truth (which, by the way, is \\"the daughter of time\\" of an ancient Roman proverb and the source of her title), the political nature of reporting and history and about being human."},{"Title":"The Daughter of Time","review":"Readers of history know that history is never quite what it seems - the old adage about it being written by the winners often applies, and such is the case in The Daughter of Time. I read this classic about ten years ago when the story was new to me, and remember feeling quite confused by the large cast of late medieval characters. When I came across this audio version, I had to give it a listen. Derek Jacobi's rendition is delightful, breathing life into what can read as mere factual prose. His rendition of the young American researcher reminded me of Jimmy Cagney, but this simply added some levity to an engrossing tale. I'm convinced - now if YOU want to know whether Richard III was a deformed monster or a maligned monarch, give this entertaining and informative performance of Tey's well-respected investigation try. It's stood the test of time."},{"Title":"The Daughter of Time","review":"Tey's examination of Richard III centers around the fictional story of a Scotland Yard inspector convalescing in a hospital and bored beyond measure. When a friend brings him prints of faces to study, one captures his eye. He forms a sympathy for the man behind the face, who turns out, to the inspector's surprise, to be the well-known evil king Richard III. The mystery that centers around the picture is one of the most classic in all history: did Richard III really murder his nephews, the Princes in the Tower? Tey shows that although the crime has been traditionally laid at Richard III's door, there are enough anomalies to create serious doubt about his guilt. She also raises questions about other possible suspects in the murder of the boys. Richard III's story is scandalous, exciting, and unbelievably sad at times, and while the book has little action, the suspense Tey creates is masterful. She also manages to give the reader a feel for that mysterious, sympathetic face--one comes to know it, even if one has never seen it."},{"Title":"The Daughter of Time","review":"This book is largely interesting, to me, because of its perspective on historians. Being married to one, it is fascinating to look at how histories change over time. Our past is fluid, shifting with political tides. A given &quot;fact&quot; about history is always suspect, there will almost always be equally suspect sources that say otherwise.This book has little to offer those craving action; the protagonist is stuck in a hospital bed, pre-television. So he's stuck reading bad novels until someone brings him interesting portraints to look at. When nobody can identify Richard III's portrait as that of a cold-blooded murderer, he becomes obsessed as could only someone with a lot of time on his hands (or a graduate degree to earn). Eventually, he begins to collaborate with a graduate student who does the legwork involved in the research to find the truth behind Richard III. The satisfying denouement: somebody promises to write a book.This may not be everybody's idea of an exciting book, but I would imagine that if the attitudes of the general public towards Richard were represented by characters in the novel, the impact of reading this when it first came out would have been shocking. It's a shame that Robert Barnard didn't discuss this to any length in his introduction, instead apologizing for Tey's personal and political biases."},{"Title":"The Daughter of Time","review":"I stumbled upon this book by accident and it turned out to be the best thing I have read for months. I knew little about the princes in the Tower before reading this book, but after the first few pages I was hooked. The characters were well drawn and plausable and it was interesting to examine the likely thoughts and feelings of some of the more obscure characters surrounding Richard III and Henry VII, especially the women.This book works as a mystery story and as a history book and I will certainly read it again."},{"Title":"The Daughter of Time","review":"I discovered this book as a history major in college sometime in the late 50s. I've just ordered it in library binding so I'll always have a copy (I don't lend hardbacks!) and also in paperback so I'll have a copy to lend/give. The book should be required reading for every high school student or at least for every college history major. A great lesson in the uses and misuses of historical fact by historians and their employers. And this from one of those historians! All should know as well that this book resulted in the establishment of an international society (fan club?) for researchers/defenders of Richard III."},{"Title":"The Daughter of Time","review":"As a novel, this book is rather lame: although the characters are delightful and the historical mystery it addresses is intriguing, the plot (such as it is) is pretty perfunctory. On the other hand, Tey's approach -- addressing the question of Richard III's guilt from the detective's perspective -- is refreshing, and some of the points she makes (e.g., the use of rumor and disinformation by Richard's opposition) have never been disproved. Subsequent research seems to show that the Princes were indeed murdered during Richard III's reign, although whether he was personally responsible for ordering their deaths is, to my mind, still an open question. But it's equally clear that the Tudor picture of him as a deformed monster (perpetuated by Shakespeare) was a gross exaggeration. And, as Tey points out, his successor Henry VII methodically committed even more heinous atrocities in his effort to secure the throne for his heirs.Although it's possible to pick holes in some of Tey's arguments, she does make important points: (1) Just because something is in the history books doesn't mean it happened that way -- or even happened at all; (2) People behave like people, not like characters in a morality play; and (3) If a historian depicts people in terms of Good Guys and Bad Guys, the obvious conclusion is &quot;ulterior motive&quot;! In this era when so much of what passes for &quot;news&quot; is propaganda, I think the book is still very much worth reading. (I first read it over 30 years ago, and still find myself muttering &quot;Tonypandy!&quot; on occasion ... )"},{"Title":"The Daughter of Time","review":"The mystery of the two small nephews of Richard III of England, supposedly murdered on his orders, has become the stuff of British history. Richard has come down to us as an evil monarch, most notably through Shakespeare's eponymous drama and the writings of Thomas More. But Shakespeare wrote his play based on More's book, and More was hardly a reliable eyewitness to events, being only five years old when they happened. In this highly original novel, Josephine Tey explores the mystery of whodunit from the point of view of a fictional detective, Alan Grant, laid up from a bad fall and bored out of his gourd; Grant tackles the problem from the cui bono standpoint, namely, who benefitted most from the young princes' murder? It surely wasn't Richard, who probably had more to lose than to gain from their deaths; but it did benefit the one whom Tey strongly suspects did have the princes put out of the way, one who had no legitimate claim to the crown at all. Grant and his young American research associate, Brent Carradine, work out the puzzle step by step, coming to a conclusion that satisfies them both. Whether or not it will satisfy the reader will depend on if the reader can let go of some preconceptions that have become engraved in stone. Grant asks himself, can 400,000 history books be wrong? They probably can, given that history is written by the winners, and Richard III ended his days as one of history's major losers. If Richard was indeed innocent, then whoever is guilty of having the princes murdered had everything to gain from traducing Richard's reputation to secure his own place in history and on the British throne. Tey's book is a well-written, engaging detective novel shedding light in some of the darker corners of the history of the kings of Britain."},{"Title":"The Daughter of Time","review":"Inspector Grant of Scotland Yard is injured and laid up .... and bored out of his mind. A friend knows he is interested in faces and brings him a pile of portraits, one of which triggers his interest in the reputed murder of the Little Princes by their uncle Richard, the last Plantagenet to sit on the throne of England. Faced with a disparity between his perception of the man and his reported actions, Grant finds himself compelled to investigate the murders, albeit from a hospital bed four hundred years away.I had heard about this book for years and finally got round to reading it. I am so glad I did. It is a fun armchair mystery about a fascinating subject, Tey introduces enough refutory information to make you want to learn more about Richard III, and all of the characters -- from protagonist Grant to affable walk-ons -- are vivid and memorable.A real pleasure to read."},{"Title":"The Daughter of Time","review":"I first read this book 25 years ago and after re-reading it recently, I realize that the view of history as put forth by &quot;Daughter of Time&quot;, is the view I have carried with me for the last 25 years. After reading the above reviews, I wanted to put my 2 cents in and say that this is the BEST of the Tey books. It is a mystery for history lovers and leaves an impression that other &quot;light reading&quot; does not. Josephine Tey is unfortunately gone from us, but this book remains a True Classic."},{"Title":"The Daughter of Time","review":"It doesn't matter if you love mysteries or hate them, you simply must read The Daughter of Time. This is a brilliantly written novel calling into question the legend of Richard III of England as fabricated by his enemies - a hunchback, a killer of innocents and an incarnation of evil. Thoroughly researched and impeccably written, it provides not only a refresher course in English history, but in how all history is created."},{"Title":"The Daughter of Time","review":"The Daughter of Time by Josephine TeyAlan Grant is in the hospital with a broken leg and concussed spine; he fell through a trap door when chasing a crook. Bored, he asked for some books and prints. One of those prints has the portrait of Richard III. one of the greatest villains in English history according to the legends. Are histories written by the winners to justify their actions? Grant develops an interest in English history in general and the time of Richard III. His Parliament was the most liberal and progressive on record; why was he such a villain? In Chapter 3 it says that Tyrrell was hanged for smothering the Two Princes after being found guilty and confessing. That should pretty much solve the crime.Thomas More's \\"History of Richard III\\" was based on hearsay (Chapter 7). More got his story from John Morton, a bitter enemy of Richard III. Richard III's contemporaries did not mention the murder of the Two Princes, not did Henry VII in his Bill of Attainder after Richard III's death. The conclusion must be that the Two Princes were still alive! In Chapter 8 Elizabeth Mackintosh misrepresents the Boston Massacre, so I question her story about Tonypandy. [The Boston Massacre was real. The troops who shot into an unarmed crowd were tried for murder, and acquitted.] The conversations between Grant and Carradine are used to explain late 15th century history. The Bishop of Bath told of an early marriage of Edward IV that would disinherit Edward's children, the Two Princes and their sister Elizabeth (future wife of Henry VII). Richard III's mistake was to pardon Lord Stanley and Bishop Morton (Chapter 10). Perhaps Richard III was too easy-going with his enemies?Chapter 11 tells about two Scottish women martyrs in a legend that has never been verified. Why did Henry VII order the destruction of Titulus Regius without it being read by Parliament? Why did nobody speak then about the death of the Two Princes, if it did happen then? The fact that the murder of the Two Princes was never mentioned while Richard III was alive must mean they were still alive. Grant explained who benefitted from their death (Chapter 13). Sir James Tyrrell was well-rewarded by Henry VII until a falling-out in 1502 (Chapter 14). Then he was captured and beheaded without a trial! The story of a confession came later. Those who had prospered under Richard III died when Henry VII took power. [The story about Richard III's \\"warm heartedness\\" reminds me of Machiavelli's advice that it is better to be feared than loved.]Henry VII was the first English king to have a bodyguard (Chapter 15). They tell of the events of 1486, when Sir James Tyrrell received a general pardon in June, then a second in July. Henry VII invented the Star Chamber, the classic example of tyranny. Chapter 16 summarizes the known facts. Grant finds Richard III innocent of murdering the Two Princes (who were obstacles to Henry Tudor). There is a surprise in Chapter 17. Ever since the Stuarts they knew that Richard III was innocent! Horace Walpole wrote about this in the eighteenth century. So why has the vicious legend kept going? Blame William Shakespeare and his play. Just as Hollywood created a \\"Wild West\\" of Cowboys and Indians to hide and obscure the real history of the late 19th century America. Grant explains why the mystery about the deaths suggests Henry VII's guilt.I wonder why there was no print of Henry VII here? Richard III has \\"quite a nice face, isn't it?\\" Can you judge a person by their looks? It was the policy of Henry VII to eliminate all rivals to the throne, such as the heirs of York, but few details are given here."},{"Title":"The Daughter of Time","review":"What happened to Richard III's nephews? Josephine Tey takes a look at the tales of Richard, his nephews, and what happened at the Tower of London. Starting with the Richard of Shakespeare and Thomas More, Tey, (through her bed-ridden detective Grant) dissects the stories of Richard III and finds a few problems with the Richard III most people are familiar with. Whether this revisionist view of Richard stands up to scrutiny is up to those with more background in this area than me, but I thoroughly enjoyed Tey's portrayal of the search for truth in the face of legend."},{"Title":"The Daughter of Time","review":"I own this book in both audio and print form. The audio version (unabridged) is read by Royal Shakespeare Company alumnus Derek Jacobi. Anyway ... this book does a marvelous job of debunking some of the common myths about Richard III. Tey's fictional detective Grant uses actual historical reference material to come to his own determinations about Richard III and the &quot;princes in the tower.&quot; For a dedicated Ricardian such as myself, it's nice to see Richard portrayed in a different light. He was very popular in life, and Tudor historians were the ones who painted him as a deformed villain."},{"Title":"The Daughter of Time","review":"This is one of the great books of all time, but don't buy it right now on Kindle.

Loyaulte Me Lie"},{"Title":"The Daughter of Time","review":"Shakespeare trashed the reputation of Richard III, and his fictional construct, a hunchbacked sadist, guilty of regicide, infanticide and who knows what else, is the image of the king that's come down thru time. Josephine Tey crafted a fictional work that takes on the trappings of a mystery, as her protagonist, a Scotland Yard inspector recovering after a recent hospital stay, decides to solve the case of whether the 15th century Richard III truly murdered his young nephews in the Tower of London. As we tag along with this detective while he investigates the facts surrounding an apparent five-hundred-year-old double child murder, we vicariously share the delight he feels as his enlightenment reveals England's most vilified monarch to be less a cruel usurping tyrant, than a victim of bad press spread against him by the Tudors, the dynasty who defeated Richard's Yorkist forces and seized the English throne. If anything, we are left feeling it was Henry VII and not Richard III who was the true tyrant and illegitimate king. By the end of this novel, not only is it clear that Richard almost certainly did not kill his brother's children, but that nearly everything Shakespeare wrote about him, from his being a hunchback, to his sadism, was a lie.The Daughter of Time (I assume everyone knows how that title came into being) is at once a delightful character study, a first-class historical research project, and a mystery. It is the kind of book that is a true delight to read and it has the added virtue of making a valid statement on the notion that nothing is so slippery and as what we think we know as good old fashioned fact."},{"Title":"The Daughter of Time","review":"(No spoilers.) There's no baffling factor about this academic mystery; the armchair investigation just unfolds without suspense. I am not familiar with English history and was initially overwhelmed with the historical characters and royal lineage mentioned. It's also hard to be drawn in by the discussion manner of the book, especially regarding characters who had lived hundreds of years ago and whose ends are foreknown. Perhaps The New York Times' accolade that this is \\"one of the best mysteries of all time\\" is lauding the author's effort in setting forth her case with some insightful points and logical deduction. But if one is looking for thrills and to be astounded by a mystery, this is not the book I would recommend."},{"Title":"The Daughter of Time","review":"Today, we type mysteries as &quot;genre&quot; writing, and today, it would be just that, &quot;genre,&quot; with no worth beyond entertainment value. When Tey wrote, the idea was to write from your heart, to tell a good story, but one which also meant something to you, and which might perhaps broaden the experience and understanding of others. This is a unique mystery, and a teaching aid bar none for history teachers across the country. Besides that, it's what the Brits call a ripping good read.

Priding himself on being able to determine a person's nature based strictly upon his appearance, Grant becomes fascinated with a postcard portrait of Richard III who seems to him to be a kind and gentle man unlikely to have committed such a horrendous crime as the murder of his two young nephews.As the novel unfolds, Grant is aided by several friends and an American-born researcher in laying out the case that Richard may have been innocent of the crimes with which he is now so closely associated. Is Richard's heinous reputation based not in truth, but rather in Tudor propaganda that has grown and twisted over time?Combining elements of both mystery and history,The Daughter of Timeis a beautifully written suspense-filled novel which serves to hold the reader's attention from beginning to end.

In Josephine Tey's 1950s novel, The Daughter of Time, truth is that which Scotland Yard inspector, Alan Grant, has often searched after and found in the faces of criminals. Now he's laid up in hospital with an injury, and thoroughly bored. Friends try to cheer him with images of famous criminals, but it's the face of King Richard III that intrigues him, a man who looks more like he belongs on the bench than in the dock. Did Richard really kill the princes in the tower, as English history books have said, or has time made a mockery of truth?Our book group chose this novel to fit the classic and mystery genres, both of which it does well. I was surprised how easily it read and how quickly it absorbed my interest; the dialog is delightfully real, well-accented, diverse and amusing; the characters are fun; the tone is an intriguing mixture of erudite and down-to-earth; and the history lessons are spot-on. By the end of the book I'm thinking I might learn to treat history with the same sort of doubt as newspaper accounts, and perhaps that's no bad thing.Add to this the fact that I've seen that picture of King Richard III and thought, as does the inspector, that he appears quite a pleasing character, and you'll know why this book was so hard to put down. I enjoyed the author's scorn for \\"boring\\" history, her delight in seeking contemporary corroboration, and her amusing comments on books in general. But most of all I enjoyed a really good read, with a really neat, absorbing mystery at its core.Disclosure: I bought this to read with the book group then missed the meeting.

Based on that interest and the reviews, I decided to give Josephine Tey's Daughter of Time a try, despite the fact that I don't typically read mystery books.I enjoyed reading the book and found the discussion of King Richard III interesting, and the eventual arguments for his innocence or guilt convincing (don't want to spoil the end result). However, I believe the narrative would be difficult to follow and to fully appreciate without a knowledge of Richard III and of the major players. The people aren't introduced fully enough, and a lot of names get thrown into play.I also have to say that I did not enjoy the framework of the police inspector in the hospital reflecting on the case. I especially didn't like the interactions with the nurses, whom the inspector refers to as The Midget and The Amazon, or his actress friend. Those interactions were more peripheral to the Richard III mystery and seemed to detract more than anything. I just didn't care for the style. I wouldn't have enjoyed this book if I hadn't had a sharp interest in Richard III.Of course, this is a recurring character's of Tey's, and if you're a fan of her other books, then there's probably no reason you wouldn't enjoy this one as well.

This book is an excellent companion-read to Thomas More's \\"History of Richard III\\", puts a new term into my working vocabulary (\\"Tonypandy\\"), and shows Thomas More to have more(pun intended) of an interest in his future employment under Henry VII than he did of his life under Henry VIII.

Words are listed alphabetically, rather than grouped by root, with cross-references to other words from the same root (no more trying to figure out a noun's putative &quot;verbal root&quot;). Akkadian tends to dominate the etymological information, rather than Arabic), along with Ugaritic. Glosses tend to be traditional, although references within the articles and the extensive supplementary bibliography (84 pages; alphabetically by author) allow you to find narrative lexical discussions. The Aramaic section is outstanding, with citations ranging far beyond biblical Aramaic. Although some might be tempted to begin with an &quot;intermediate&quot; lexicon such as Holladay, KBL's layout, clarity, and wealth of information makes this appropriate for both beginning students, pastors, teachers, and other scholars."},{"Title":"The Hebrew and Aramaic Lexicon of the Old Testament (Sinica Leidensia,) (vols 1-5)","review":"This lexicon should be in the library of anyone seeking to understand the deeper meanings of Hebrew words in Tanach.

The 2-volume unabridged study edition is affordable and is more space efficient on the shelf. Buy this one with confidence."},{"Title":"The Hebrew and Aramaic Lexicon of the Old Testament (Sinica Leidensia,) (vols 1-5)","review":"The printed 5 volume set provides a fine supplementary lexicon for all students of the Biblical Hebrew and Aramaic. The volumes are finely bound, printed on acid-free paper (though not ANSI certified). Each volume is smyth sewn.Much more asthetic than using a computer screen, the printed version allows you to view all 5 volumes at the same time, even without electricity! Though it cannot compare with the search power of the CD version. The main text is in a two column format and all of the fonts are easy to read.These volumes will become the standard Hebrew Bible lexicon. Unfortunately! However they should be supplemented with other works because:(1) They do not show all of the needed etymologies, many entries display no etymological data. (Ernest Klein's work is recommended here). The data from North/West Semitics could be expanded, it is lacking in many entries. Hittite data seems deficient as well as some Sumerian data -- let's face it, they are early influences on the Semitic languages. The Koehler-Baum. work only skims the surface when it comes to etymologies.(2) Many important works by evangelical scholars (such as S. P. Tregelles, Gleason, Archer, Kyle Yates, E. Young, Robert Dick Wilson, et al) were not even utilized. Too much emphasis was given to the popular works done by secular scholars.(3) Ugaritic, Phoenician, Arabic and other fonts (scripts) are simply transliterated. They should have been printed out in their original script. Transliteration tables could have also been included for the scholars who are not familiar with these languages, but accuracy can be jeopardized when the original scripts are just transliterated, and it takes time and effort to &quot;recompose&quot; them. Perhaps they were transliterated so that the digital search engines could be simplified. Poor trade off!(4) Some important definitions are missing for some entries! Thus other lexicons are needed. For example: sh-r-Ha (shin, resh, he) in volume 4, pages 1652f does not show the meaning as &quot;to shine&quot; (from a possible Arabic root) nor as &quot;chains&quot; or &quot;bracelets&quot; as in Isaiah 3:19.(5) Textual variations are often not listed, and the Qumran literature and data could have been better utilized.(6) Foreign word indexes could have been supplied, and an index of Biblical passages could have been added. Several hands worked on the 5 volumes, and a variety of abbreviations are used for the Biblical books, making Biblical book cross references difficult even on the CD version.All in all, a very useful addition. The price is quite high and the folks at Brill often ask too much for their publications. The work NEEDS to be supplemented, and some entries are woefully deficient -- giving only a partial definition. Coupled with the poor etymological data -- this is not acceptable. Gary S.

Wells, Stephen Crane, D.H. Lawrence, John Galsworthy, ... Theodore Dreiser, Algernon Charles Swinburne","review":"A fine idea - write a memoir comprised of short essays on the many great authors you knew - suggested by Ford's editor. In the letter to his editor that serves as a preface, Ford says, humorously, that he was \\"ordered\\" to write this book, and sometimes it feel like that was the case. Each \\"portrait\\" is roughly 20 pages, but Ford gives us very few brush strokes in these portraits. In his remembrance of Stephen Crane, he only gives us two or three glimpses of Crane, and each of these is short on detail. For D.H. Lawrence he does much better, and we're treated to an intriguing look at Lorenzo at the start of his career, when he was a writer on the make, with big ideas about making lots of dough and living the high life. And for Henry James, Ford is very good, and very funny, at showing James talking to Ford's housemaid, in much the same circuitous style of his later, maddening novels. But on Joseph Conrad, we do not get any memoir, even though Ford collaborated with Conrad on several books. Perhaps this is because Ford wrote, earlier, a complete book on Conrad and didn't want to duplicate any material. What he gives us instead is a wandering, critical evaluation of Conrad. Ford's critical insights are always interesting; he does a superb job analyzing the first two sentences of DHL's first short story, which was submitted to Ford by a friend of Lawrence's. On Turgenev, he is simply boring. Overall, we do not get portraits, so much as \\"appreciations.\\" While these were interesting enough to get me to start re-reading some James, I am going elsewhere to get my portraits."},{"Title":"The Missionary's Position","review":"The Missionary's Position by Gary Buslik. Sunny Books, New York, NY. 1999. 300 pp. $12.95 trade paper.The author claims to have gotten the inspiration for writing his humorous novel The Missionary's Position from being hit on the head with a coconut while vacationing on a Caribbean island. Set on two fictional Caribbean-like islands named Snow and St. Ursula, the novel follows the adventures--misadventures--of a zany cast of characters including the director of a local historical society, Philip Doyle; the fantastically wealthy Roberta Gibbleman and her mischievous daughter Wendy; and the comical despot Austin Sewer. The foil for setting these and related characters scheming and vying with one another is the competition between Doyle and Sewer to make their respective islands of Snow and St. Ursula the leading tourist attraction. A travel writer turning to fiction with this novel, Buslik hits just the right note in humorously portraying the carefree, gay ambience of a Caribbean island vacation spot and the casual, insouciant, dreamy but feckless behavior of its inhabitants. Page after page his writing is fresh and light-spirited--making The Missionary's Position ideal summer beach or travel-cruise reading.Henry Berry, Book Reviewer Editor/Publisher, The Small Press Book Review"},{"Title":"The Missionary's Position","review":"I liked idea of suspense story book set in Caribbean but plot is a bit thin and there are a lot of improbable scenes like selling your own baby, extremely rich and spoiled daughter has dozens of lovers, stretched limos on tiny island...There are more interesting stuff in some history books about real Caribbean islands."},{"Title":"The Missionary's Position","review":"Combines amazing literary skill with an outlandish, sneaky sense of humor which will have you laughing out loud.

I am buying this book for a friend of mine who is heading for Barbados."},{"Title":"The Missionary's Position","review":"Not usually a binge reader, I devoured this entertaining book in a little over a weekend, unable (or just unwilling) to put it down. I simply did not want to leave the island of Snow. The characters are definitely quirky, but Buslik keeps them believable, and consistent with themselves. The writing itself is smooth, with an intelligence and cleverness that never struck me as arrogant or clever for clever's sake (and actually managed to make me chuckle out loud at times, which I don't often do when reading). I've never been to the Caribbean, but suspect the details offered of the setting will please those who have. It has certainly made me want to plan a trip. I cannot figure out a way to discuss the plot without giving something away, but it definitely kept moving and held my interest and attention throughout. Lost me only briefly at one point (in terms of believability), but pulled me right back in very quickly.

Buslik demonstrates a skillful hand while illustrating the foibles and comic situations in this engaging story. I laughed often while reading the dialogue between the despot Sewer and the Gibbleman brat. Buslik has a terrific knack for writing dialogue and should write this book's script if it should come to bear Hollywood fruit. Read this book and have a great time, it's so much better than the majority of so-called Hollywood entertainment now playing.

Written in a modern, upbeat, non-metaphysical style, Mr. Doyle says what needs to be said without any gingerbread. The exercises are simple and incredibly enlightening.I passed this book around my circle of colleagues, and most said something to the effect of &quot;I wish I were teaching THIS! It's about how to deal with oneself in the real world, which we all need to know before tackling chemistry or English or sports.&quot;I've read all the texts and taught many, both good and not-so-good, and Mr. Doyle's &quot;little&quot; book is the best."},{"Title":"Before You Think Another Thought: The Mechanics of Thought","review":"In Before You Think Another Thought, Bruce I. Doyle III, writes that &quot;thoughts and beliefs are the basic elements of all creation. They exist as tiny waves of energy called thoughtforms, whose sole purpose is to carry out the intent of the thinker.&quot; He further explains that the lives we live, whether happy or miserable, are the direct result of what we think.Doyle uses real-life situations to show how our underlying &quot;core&quot; beliefs are developed, and how thoughtforms are created that support those beliefs. The thoughts and beliefs lead to feelings, which then lead to reactions. Those reactions determine our life's experience, leading Doyle to maintain that &quot;beliefs determine experience.&quot;He says &quot;the good news is that with the recognition that you are creating your own life, you can start taking charge--as the designer of your life, no longer a victim of life's random circumstances. You become self-responsible.&quot; He explains how developing a positive attitude can change beliefs, and thus change experiences. He offers suggestions for developing positive attitudes so as to get whatever it is that you want from life.He adds that we can't avoid unpleasant feelings, but we can experience them, and then move on. They don't have to hold us back unless we think they do. He also says that we need to be patient, as &quot;everything in your life will [not] change miraculously overnight.&quot;The appendix includes exercises for recognizing and removing your limiting beliefs and thoughtforms.Doyle says that &quot;every one of our thoughts is a thread in the fabric of what we experience in our lives. And each one of us weaves our own cloth.&quot; In Before You Think Another Thought, he offers readers &quot;new insights into achieving the life you deserve&quot; by teaching them how to transform their negative thoughts and beliefs into positive life experiences."},{"Title":"Before You Think Another Thought: The Mechanics of Thought","review":"This book is the most exciting and refreshing eye opener for me in 10 years. Some people say you have to see it before you believe it. I know that the way the universe and real life works is that you must first believe and visualize positive thoughts in order to see them created. This is the first step for people seeking to end hopelessness and self-pity. Don't overemphasize the negative elements of your life. Give more weight to positive and simple pleasures of life. This book would make an excellent gift to graduating seniors."},{"Title":"Before You Think Another Thought: The Mechanics of Thought","review":"Before You Think Another Thought: An Illustrated Guide to Understanding How Your Thoughts and Beliefs Create Your Lifeby Bruce DoyleBefore I go into the review proper, let me ask one question?Have any readers watched the award-winning movie, 'What the Bleep Do We Know!? Down the Rabbit Hole', starring Marlee Matlin & directed by William Arntz?It's part documentary, part story, & part visual effects & animations. but mind-blowing! In many respects, it's also controversial! It plunges the viewer into a world where quantum uncertainty is demonstrated - where neurological processes, & perceptual shifts are engaged & lived by its protagonist (Amanda, played by Marlee Matlin, a very fine actress) - where everything is alive, & reality is changed by every thought. Watch it, with an open mind, if you haven't done so.From this movie, I come to know about the work of Dr Joe Dispenza, one of fourteen scientists, researchers & thinkers featured in the movie.According to Dr Dispenza, \\"quantum science tells us an observer directly affects the nature of reality. Electrons behave like waves of probability until an observer looks for their position; then, they demonstrate characteristics of particles, i.e., solid matter. If observation - putting conscious attention on any one thing - can affect the material world, then by mastering that ability, can we have greater control over our future?Neuroscience is showing us how thoughts shape reality. The brain's one hundred billion neurons connect in diverse combinations called neural networks. When we welcome new thoughts and experiences, our neurons respond by wiring together, a learning process termed neural plasticity. Through concentration and repetition of thoughts, neural circuits become \\"hard wired.\\"Are we basing our thoughts on what we've already wired in our memory, restricting the level of mind with which we view reality? Is our familiar environment monopolizing our thoughts, producing only routine experiences? As observers within the quantum field of potentials, perhaps we are only limited by our knowledge and observation skills. If by developing these abilities we can rewire our brain, we should produce tangible changes in our life.\\"Dr Dispenza has also made this amazing observation:\\"Most people are distracted by the external world, so they don't use the frontal lobe properly. Everything in our environment in constantly feeding the brain information. Our senses are what allow us to interprete reality. As long as we believe the external world is more real than the internal, we'll always be using the same brain circuits to process information. The moment we accept that our internal world affects our external world, then we must begin to use our frontal lobe.\\" Wow!Why am I writing all about these observations in this review & what's the connection?Well, I have come to realise that this wonderful book by Bruce Doyle, which I have read in the mid-nineties, provides useful tools & strategies to help readers to rewire their brains & bring tangible changes to their lives.I like this book because it reinforces the fact that we have the power to choose our internal world, - & at the same time, the power to discreate it, if it's disempowering. Personal breakthoughs come from changing our internal world. The book is also very well written. It's crisp, succinct & yet illuminating! Best of all, the author offers some positive suggestions & simple exercises. I strongly recommend anyone who wants to take full charge of his/her own life to read it."},{"Title":"Before You Think Another Thought: The Mechanics of Thought","review":"This book is for those who truly want to take RESPONSIBILITY for their lives. So that means, one does not just read the book once and put it on the shelf to collect dust. This little guide is full of information and tools which one constantly needs to refer to and use on a regular basis. When I feel &quot;stuck&quot;, I ask myself &quot;what am I doing to create what is occuring at this point in time?&quot; Sometimes I have to refer to a certain chapter in the book and, combined with some introspection and self-discovery, I usually find my answer and move forward! Since reading this book, I have become increasingly aware of my 'limiting' thoughts (when they occur) and now have the tools to eliminate them!

In fact the author cautions against trying to make massive changes in your life. Rather giving the sound advice of taking small steps and making one change at a time.These concepts are not new.

If we choose to change them, and replace them with an empowering belief, our lives will begin to change.Mr. Doyle has included many great illustrations & examples to help the reader better grasp the ideas he presents, and has also included an appendix that includes several tools for identifying, exploring and changing our limited underlying beliefs.Overall, I found this to be an interesting, easy to read book with far reaching implications.

Now, along comes a long overdue biography, and what a volume. The timing couldn't be more right, as the US has finally put to rest most of the putrid disco backlash. In the stores are not only decent compilations of the disco music but also books like this one that reflect the reality of the subculture. Not the bandwagon that pop radio jumped on, not the Arthur-Murray style competitions, not the faux-glamour suburban nightclubs, but the real deal. Sylvester was both artist and participant in the disco culture-- singer, performance artist, club dancer. The author of this book captures Sylvester in all his complexity and drives home the important part he played in the subculture that was disco.Gamson is an academic, which means that he has been thorough in locating good sources of information. He seemed to have access to so many of the important persons and institutions that played a part in Sylvester's life. He is able to provide a well-rounded depiction of the man's personality, warts and all. He does a good job laying out the formative experiences in this colorful life, be it a mother who role-modeled an imperious love of fashion but later derided a child who followed her example, or a church community that would exploit Sylvester's temperament but denounce him for acts its other members could get away with if they kept hypocritically silent. Sylvester's complicated relationship to the gay community of 70s San Francisco is fascinating. The author does a great job bringing all the early elements around in the end of the book, showing how lasting the formative events are and how much a person can fill in the voids during adulthood.Gamson is more than an academic, however. He is also an entertaining writer and he takes in this book a great tone that fits his subject. He doesn't shy away from any aspects of the life he is depicting. The sex, the slang, the drugs, the erratic behavior, the fun, the bonds, and the subculture's differing values all sparkle like one of Sylvester's jackets. There is no stuffy ivory-tower writing here. Gamson can be as breezy in tone as Sylvester, but he doesn't pander. In fact, among the disco-oriented books that have come out over the last six years, this volume is as well-produced as that other benchmark of writing, *Last Night A DJ Saved My Life*.The 60s teen drag scene, the 1970-era Cockettes, the rock-and-blues recording phase, the disco about which Sylvester had conflicted feelings; then the Hi NRG and activism phases-- all of these are given sharp observation and each makes for vibrant reading material. Gamson covers nearly all the bases, including the way the drag-loving Sylvester was an open mark for a defrauding imposter. It was great to learn how the disco albums came about, and what the exact roles of the band, producers, and record-label suits were. The only omission I found was Sylvester's collaboration with jazzist Herbie Hancock in the 1981 album Magic Windows. Otherwise, Gamson covered all the personal, community, and musical bases.This was great reading for someone like me, familiar with both Sylvester and the 70s; I think the book would appeal to anyone with an open mind who is interested in a character who will swim against the current if he is so created."},{"Title":"The Fabulous Sylvester: The Legend, the Music, the Seventies in San Francisco","review":"When I read author Joshua Gamson's bio blurb, I feared that THE FABULOUS SYLVESTER was going to be a mundane recounting of an outsized life. I had no reason to worry, as Gamson's writing is easily as rollicking as Sylvester's life. Ultimately the author pays the greatest tribute to his subject by not only capturing the man and his incarnations, but by doing so in a way that is as entertaining as a Sylvester concert must have been.Gamson is able to put Sylvester's life into the context of the times, (and while doing so, we see a vivid portrait of Los Angeles and San Francisco, the rise of gay culture and the shattering reality of AIDS) and that life was a breathing metaphor for the real heartbeat of San Francisco and the gay dance culture that would be coopted by middle American pop. He is able to convey the drug-affected recollections of some of his interviewees by subtly warning the reader of the time and chemical infected haze through which their recollections were culled without insulting his subjects, he is able to recreate scenes with color and humor, and achieves something nearly impossible in biography...his work is more cinema than written word.The bottom line of this read is that Sylvester is given the historical credit he is due. He was androgynous before Bowie, and out-discoed Donna Summer. He had the courage to be true to himself in a culture that wasn't ready for him, he understood some audiences who didn't understand him in return. His life force was enormous, he was greatly flawed, but as with all true divas, being fabulous trumps everything else.Sylvester, and this book, are indeed, fabulous."},{"Title":"The Fabulous Sylvester: The Legend, the Music, the Seventies in San Francisco","review":"A great fast read. I loved the book. It's a good look at the San Francisco Music BIZ. And what was going on in San Francisco at the time when DISCO hit big. I lived it and almost all of it is true. Joshua Gamson did a wonderful job. Buy this book! John Hedges"},{"Title":"The Fabulous Sylvester: The Legend, the Music, the Seventies in San Francisco","review":"This is an incredibly layered yet elegantly beautiful book. Sylvester's life is unwrapped before the reader's eyes. It reads at once like a loving biography of a friend lost and social history of a community still grappling with who and what we are. The author gracefully enmeshes Sylvester's glamour with the electricity of a generation on acid and the sadness of an era lost to AIDS and Reagan. I found myself reveling in all the creative fierceness that consumed Sylvester. The Fabulous Sylvester brilliantly examines the productive power of fame and, in doing so, offers us an inspiring glimpse of how truly revolutionary queering gender can be."},{"Title":"The Fabulous Sylvester: The Legend, the Music, the Seventies in San Francisco","review":"I knew Sylvester, and when this book came out, I couldn't get my hands on it fast enough. And was it ever worth it! The writer portrays this man as the force of nature he was, hugely talented, original, completely comfortable with himself, a performer par excellence with a voice almost unearthly in its range and power. The author tells it as it was, without sentiment, gush or embellishment, and manages to convey Sylvester's self-confidence, conviction, self-awareness, generosity, tremendous sweetness and extraordinary talent without hype and with acute accuracy. There was only one Sylvester; he was unforgettable to everyone who knew him, and now, thanks to Joshua Gamson, those who never knew him will have a chance to experience a genuine original and a natural star. (And up until Sylvester, I loathed disco - he turned that whole thing around and made it gospel music.) Thank you, Mr., Gamson - you did a great job! Sylvester would be thrilled."},{"Title":"The Fabulous Sylvester: The Legend, the Music, the Seventies in San Francisco","review":"Sylvester was \`bigger' than fabulous and Joshua Gamson's bio reveals the truth behind the incredibly talented singer. Gamson's biography of the unusual and lovable talent rings true and is consistently level headed without drama. There was plenty of that in Sylvester's life alone! It's amazing that it took this story so long to be told, but it is a great one about the golden gay mecca before it turned into the gay refugee camp. Sylvester is accurately portrayed as the virtual overnight sensation \\"queen of disco\\". He is shown as having had a heart of gold and the simple determination of being who he was - a great icon without regrets. Gamson should be commended for writing a long-awaited biography that is fair and balanced, representing a time that started with such great innocence and fun. It is worth mentioning that Rolling Stone magazine reviewed Sylvester's first album and stated, \\"if you have to listen to disco, it doesn't get better than this\\". No kidding."},{"Title":"The Fabulous Sylvester: The Legend, the Music, the Seventies in San Francisco","review":"Magic happens where reality and fantasy overlap. It's a space that dance music star Sylvester effortlessly occupied during the outrageous and flamboyant club scene of the mid-70s to early 80s, when those lines were happily blurred on a nightly basis.Gamson does an excellent job of showing Sylvester's \`six-degrees of separation' influence - he worked with emerging stars like Bette Midler, Patti LaBelle, The Weather Girls (\\"It's Raining Men\\"), American Idol judge Randy Jackson and Patrick Cowley (Megatone Records).By focusing mainly on Sylvester, Gamson gives the reader an inside look and feel of the gay club scene that was a mix of Broadway and Bowery Row. Sylvester epitomized that drama and contrast with his falsetto voice but powerful vocals and androgynous but commanding stage presence. He created a propulsive musical genre (\\"Do Ya Wanna Funk?\\" \\"You Make Me Feel\\") that defined the era's manic, raw and pulsating energy.AIDS turned the party lethal, killing off both his audience and the mood for high energy music. Soon, Sylvester, along with hundreds of others in the arts and entertainment community, was dead. There are lots of devil-may-care musicians whose audiences escape through their lives and music, but there will probably never again be a time when the audience and the artist were so intimately in synch, both feeling and living the beat."},{"Title":"The Fabulous Sylvester: The Legend, the Music, the Seventies in San Francisco","review":"I enjoyed this book so much that I read it twice,then a year later, read it again!!---FANTASTIC!!It captures the times, the people, places and things thatmade Sylvester, San Francisco, that music and that erasuch a golden & magical time!I love the stories of the young Sylvester growing up inSouth Central L.A. in the 50's and 60's, FLAMING THE CHILDREN!!Giving them fabulousness and outrageousness at every turn,from his soul-stirring falsetto rendition of the black gospelclassic \\"Never Grow Old\\", to the rawkus \\"DISQUOTAYS\\", a rag-taggang of young black drag queens that he hung out with, to theoff-the-charts outfits that must've stopped traffic inthe hood big time! (LOL!!)It was evident to all who knew him even then, that thispretty black child with the high voice was way differentand way way special!! (-:Some didn't know how to take Sylvester or even know what todo with him, yet he pressed on!---Carving out his own spacewithin the harsh realities of ghetto life as best he could.Sylvester was a true pioneer in every way!He didn't see race, gender, the expectations of others,the taunts of hateful & ignorant people, etc.,as obstacles or boundaries he needed to respect.He was a true original!--Uncut, undiluted, young, black,gay, gifted, stylish, full of charm and ambition,with the soul of a torch singer or a blues shouterinfused by a rock-n-roll rebel spirit and soul singer's chops!What a combination!I myself can attest to Sylvester's impact, as both a fanand as young gay black kid who was coming of age and intoself-awareness at the very time that his star was reaching it's zenith!I had just started partying and experimenting sexually bythe age of 14 in 1978 when \\"Dance (Disco Heat)\\" and\\"You Make Me Feel (Mighty Real!)\\" burst onto the music charts,in the clubs and in house parties across the countryand eventually, the world!I couldn't yet get into the disco clubs, but oh boy!--I could sure get into house parties!I was hanging out with people who were 5 to 10 yrs olderthan me and I was learning MANY INTERESTING THINGS!! &lt;G>Of course, back then you had \\"FAIRY GODMUTHAZ\\", older gayswho would take us young \\"up & comings\\" under their chiffon wingsand school us on the do's and don't's of gay life, sex & survivalin the late 70's and early 80's!!PRE-AIDS and in the last writhing throws of the SEXUAL REVOLUTION,it was a great time to be alive!I grew up in the south during this time, which already hadit's issues with race and sexuality, so the gay world of that time,on that end of the country, was still very underground,hypocritcal and always hush-hush!!There were a lot of secret stares, codes, slangs, etc.to let those who needed to know, what you wanted them to know.But though it was very repressed and subterfuge,MAN, DID WE HAVE SOME FUN TIMES IN OUR LITTLE NETHERWORLD!!And yes, as is now, back then, straight men did ventureinto our world quite frequently!!Anywayz, enter THE FABULOUS SYLVESTER from the legendaryand exotically far reaches of a city they called\\"the gay shangri-la\\"...aka SAN FRANCISCO!!It was the summer of 1978, and here was this strong,proud, black, beautiful, talented, androgynous gay mantelling us, by the very nature of his exsistence,that it was not only alright to be what you were outin full view of the world, but it was also our dutyto be FABULOUS & JOYOUS!!

(LOL!!--we were too much!)We pooled our allowances, our summer jobs, etc. toobtain tickets through an older bisexual cousin of minewho lived down in Atlanta at the time, who also arrangedthe fake ID's as well.Keep in mind, I had just turned 15, one freind was 16and the other was 18...none of our parents even knewwe were gay, and there was no way in the hellthat they would've sanctioned us (under-aged)going all that way to Atlanta...and to see thisgender-inspecific weirdo named SYLVESTER!!(Boy George and Ru Paul were still a ways off yet!)So me and my freinds, being rife with teenaged angst,secretiveness and resourcefulness, concoct the half-bakedscheme to hitchhike from Greenville to Atlanta with dufflebags in tow filled with our outfits, toiletries, etc.,use our fake ID's to get into the club and party withSylvester & Two Tons O' Fun into the wee hours,get my older bi cousin to rent us a hotel room in Atlanta,have us a slam bang good time with some local fellazovernight and then hitch it back to Greenville by Sundayevening before 5 pm!! (LMAO!!)Anywayz, long story short, as is with all half-cockedand scantily thought out teenaged schemes, we did pull it off,got in the club and got down with Sylvester, got high,got the boys, got the hotel room, etc.But what we didn't bargain on was our mothers not being bornyesterday and the loose lips of the jealous young queenswho wished they had the balls to pull off what we did!(We got ratted out big time!)We also had a hell of a time trying to hitch it backfrom Atlanta to Greenville on a Sunday morning, and afterour mothers up in SC found out what we had done,they got in a car and headed for us like heat-seeking/search & destroy SCUD missles with fire in their eyes!Man, did we get our teenage closeted gay behinds handed to us!My older cousin caught it too from my uncle in Atlantafor his hand in our scheme, and we didn't even havetime to put concealer on over the many \\"hickies\\" on ournecks and chests from our Atlanta frollick in the hotelfrom the night before! Boy, it was a mess!We wound up being forced out of the closet to our mothers(which was then a horror to them!)We were all immediately grounded for a month to our respectiveresidences, were banned from socializing with each other,(which we still would sneak and hang out!)and we all gotthe butt whippings of our young lives!(Yes, parents still whipped butt back in those days!)BUT OH MAN!--We didn't care!It was well worth it, because we got to see THE GODDESS,THE DISCO DIVA...SYLVESTER, live and upclose!! (LOL!!)Now, here I sit...a 44 yr old, well-traveled, successful,proud and fortunate gay black man who has had my fun,relished the memories of those far away magical days,and if there is any bittersweetness to the story,it's that I have outlived not only my two freinds fromthat teenaged excursion, but Sylvester and about 30 morefreinds and acquaintances from the late 70'sto the mid 90's...all lost to the scourge of AIDS.As we grow older, we reflect and long for things thatwere familiar to our particular generation as things arebeing torn down, people die or move, and the world ofour past is erased. This wonderful book, along withSylvester's music playing in the background as I wasreading it, brought all the magic back for awhile!This book would make an excellent movie and I hope someonewill make it happen someday in the near future.In the meantime, enjoy the book folks!R.I.P.

It went way beyond my expectations on a couple of different levels. It is a beautifully written biography of Sylvester as an individual but it was also the best description of San Francisco gay life of the late 60's through early 80's that I have ever read. As one that was gay and lived in San Francisco during this time period, this book was especialy poignant. There are so few people I know that were gay and lived in SF during this time period that survived AIDS. Most are dead. This book documents memories that would otherwise be lost. For many years when I thought about the Palace theater and the Cockettes and Sylvester singing witht the Pointer Sisters doing backup, it almost felt like it had all been just a dream. I have often tried to find others that were there that first night Sylvester sang with the hot band at the Palace. Was it real? This book confirmed for me that yes, it was real. I loved seeing the names of bars and clubs like The City, Caberet, The Shed, The Palms, etc, remembered by someone else and put on paper and made real for all time. I loved remembering the gay parades and the shows at the Galleria. Wow. We really did have fun. The last chapter was very difficult to read through the tears and sobs. I had to stop several times and dry my eyes before I could continue. I was sad for Sylvester. I was sad for so many that had died. I was sad for the end of such an incredible, amazing, FABULOUS era. This book is just wonderful for all those things and I am thankful for it."},{"Title":"The Fabulous Sylvester: The Legend, the Music, the Seventies in San Francisco","review":"Joshua Gamson took the reader on a magical journey of Sylvester's glitter world of music, sex, and drugs with the abandonment that was the time of the 70's. Sadly, there was no gold at the end of the rainbow and we, like Sylvester, saw the decline with terrible retribution.I highly recommend this book; it's a quick read and you won't be able to put it down."},{"Title":"The Fabulous Sylvester: The Legend, the Music, the Seventies in San Francisco","review":"I had read this book about two years ago, then I had the opportunity to meet Sylvester's sister BJ who is mentioned throughout the book. It re-opened my interest is such an amazing life. What I enjoyed most and related to was a message that Sylvester tried to send tot he gay community. STOP HATING inside your own world. The INTRA-Discriminantion of hyper masculine gays versus feminine gays was rampant in San Francisco and is still very rampant today.There are enough straight people hating on gays, stop doing it to ourselves. We are different. Embrace each other for that uniqueness. If I wanna wear a skirt & make-up on Monday and a suit & beard on Tuesday, ...Ain't Nobody Business if I do!"},{"Title":"The Fabulous Sylvester: The Legend, the Music, the Seventies in San Francisco","review":"I've learned many things reading The Fabulous Sylvester, among them the importance of looking one's best, of expressing oneself and never, ever to get between a 200 pound drag queen and his jewelries. You can mock his falsetto and diss his music but just try to steal his jewelries and the fabulous Sylvester will mess you up. And that is just one of the many reasons why after reading this book I wish Sylvester were still with us. We can always use more well-put-together dance music, for one thing, and we're perpetually in dire need of entertainers who don't take themselves too seriously. Also I'd like to just hang out with Sylvester for a day - because if this book is any indication, Sylvester WAS the party. I can't remember the last time I read a biography of an entertainer and ended up liking the subject even more.There's nothing dismissive about calling this story of a boy from South Central who moved to San Francisco and became the First Lady of the Castro a true fairytale. Sylvester dreamed of a world where he could be who he was on his own terms and he sprinkled magic dust on himself and made it happen. Whether hanging out with the drugged out misfits known as the Cockettes or working it on the Merv Griffin Show, Sylvester didn't compromise and he didn't phone it in either.Author Joshua Gamson uses Sylvester's life story to tell the broader story of gay liberation in the 1970s. If that sounds like a downer consider that Gamson at one point contends that San Francisco was to gays what Israel was to Jews \\"only with fewer wars and more parties.\\" Gamson nearly always finds just the right balance between telling Sylvester's mostly joyous story and the realities of being gay in America in the 1970s. Even Sylvester's ultimate tragic death from AIDs ends up being a story of staying true to oneself.This is a fun, smart book. If you read it, as I did, after reading the great punk history \\"Please Kill Me\\" you'll find yourself thinking that the Punks may have had all the best lines but the Disco Queens had all the fun."},{"Title":"The Fabulous Sylvester: The Legend, the Music, the Seventies in San Francisco","review":"This book is by far the best book I have read this year. I travel alot so I read about 1 to 2 books a week. The Fabulous Sylvester is absolutely fabulous. This book made me Cry, made me Laugh, made me Sing, made me Rejoice, and made me Remember. If you were there in days of disco weather the early, middle or last days of it, take a stroll down memory lane with Gamson's accurate discription of the Garage. And although I learned alot about Sylvester I did not know, this book is a great tribute to the Disco era, as well as the Fabulous Sylvester himself. Like I said YOU WOULD ONLY WANT TO.

I did not want it to end! I did not know much about Sylvester before I read it but felt like I lost an old friend by the time I finished. Naturally, I had cut the rug to his songs as a young teen and saw his wild costumes as well. However, this book covers his childhood, his struggle to make it big and of course the sad ending that came too soon."},{"Title":"The Fabulous Sylvester: The Legend, the Music, the Seventies in San Francisco","review":"What a thoroughly entertaining book this was.

The laughs were more than the tears"},{"Title":"The Fabulous Sylvester: The Legend, the Music, the Seventies in San Francisco","review":"This was a wonderful, wonderful read. I was truly captivated by this book. I was so happy to find that someone actually took time to dig into the legend of Sylvester beyond his tragic demise. I know for me, my first memory of him was reading about his death in Jet when I was about 9 or so. But when I got older and got to hear some of his music and learn about how he really represented for those of us who are a bit different, I was amazed. This book is surprisingly light and fun, taking you through San Francisco in the 70s and the rise of Sylvester's career. There are parts of it that paint really vivid pictures and will make you laugh out loud, particularly his relationship with The Weather Girls, Izora Armstead and Martha Wash. The author talks to a wide range of sources, from background singers, to Fantasy Records execs, to San Franciscans. This book treats Sylvester with great respect and is worthy of multiple reads. I think if I could change one thing, I would like there to be more focus on his music - beyond Step II, not much is really mentioned about the ins and outs of the recording of his albums. But that's a small thing. Like I said, this book is a wonderful, wonderful read."},{"Title":"The Fabulous Sylvester: The Legend, the Music, the Seventies in San Francisco","review":"Props out to Josh for writing such a wonderful book about the legendary Sylvester.

I have been waiting for this book to arrive for years and, finally, here it is!I was hooked by the opening chapter which tells the story of a young boy named Tiki Lofton who sneaks out of his bedroom window at night and over to a friend's apartment where, in 1960's South Central, with the help of a young Sylvester, he transforms himself into a \\"Disquotay.\\" The Disquotays were a group of boys who liked to dress up as sophisticated ladies. And Sylvester, or Dooni as he was known then, was in charge of the wigs.\\"The first Disquotay bash that Tiki went to was over on 120th and Athens, at Etta James's house, sometime around 1965. Etta, who would later be inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame (largely on the strength of her 1961 hit \\"At Last\\") and the Betty Ford Center (largely on the strength of her smack addiction), was already a recording star and a friend to many local Los Angeles drag queens . . . The house, with its swimming pool and fireplace, had stunned her. Women, drag queens, and guys, all sending joyful noises in Tiki's direction; the music had been jumping; Walter Jackson's version of \\"Lee Cross,\\" Jr. Walker & the All Stars' \\"Shotgun,\\" \\"Nowhere to Run\\" by Martha and the Vandellas, Fontella Bass singing \\"Rescue Me.\\" Gay kids all perched on gigantic speakers, singing and carrying on . . . Tiki had said to herself. \\"This -- honey, where is this world?\\" Within months, she would be a full-fledged Disquotay, made-up, bewigged, bejeweled.\\"Joshua Gamsom recreates this world vividly in that first chapter. Simultaneously, he introduces us to the members of Sylvester's family. His beautiful and beloved mother and grandmother. His twin sisters, Dette and Dean. The quotes are full of heart and expertly placed and the story unfolds like a fine silk fan. I can't help but think that Sylvester would be very pleased to read this biography.I had the honor of meeting with Sylvester to discuss a project a few years before his death. It was mid-afternoon and he was sewing sequins on something, which was his favorite pasttime. He was always sewing, a talent he picked up from the women who raised him. He walked over to the turntable and put on Patti LaBelle's \\"If Only You Knew\\" and said he was dedicating the song at his One-Night-Only concert the following night to his fans and supporters in San Francisco, the city in which he always felt most at home. That night, with Martha Wash at his side, they performed that song together, bouncing their voices off each other inside the Castro Theater. Those two powerful voices, the acoustics of the Castro Theater, and the magical spell he wove with Patti LaBelle's song was something to behold.That Sylvester could hold his own with the amazing Martha Wash is a testament to the power of his falsetto. He didn't have a thin, reedy falsetto. His was full-bodied, gravelly even, and very much in evidence on one of his biggest hits, \\"Do You Wanna Funk.\\"\\"So when I tell you, that you're really something, baby, will you stay, or will you go away.\\"Joshua Gamson captures the essence of Sylvester's personality, the diva fits as well as the immense kindness and sensitivity, and wraps it all together into an highly readable book that I wholeheartedly suggest you pick up. Although some have faulted him for not having an encyclopedic knowledge of music, Gamson lets experts like Joel Selvin provide insightful commentary.It is my hope that someone has optioned the book for a movie and we can expect to see this wild individual portrayed in all his glory.John Waters wraps up \\"The Fabulous Sylvester\\" pretty well in his cover blurb: \\"A well-written, touching, dignified biography of a gay black diva who never really fit into any minority but managed to achieve his dreams of stardom. Now that's what I call a man.\\"Five Stars. Great Read."},{"Title":"The Fabulous Sylvester: The Legend, the Music, the Seventies in San Francisco","review":"Man, was this a great read! Sylvester truly was more than a he or a she. Sylvester was Sylvester and this book makes it a point to stress it while documenting his short life. His life, intertwined with the Cockettes, the Disquotays, and his work with Martha and Izora (Two Tons of Fun, The Weathergirls, C+C Music Factory, Black Box, etc.) reflect the depth and response to the radical social changes taking place in America. Sylvester's life and times are true inspiration to those seeking to institute radical personal change.I was much too young to enjoy the true disco days, but I remember listening to 7\\" records of \\"Dance (Disco Heat)\\" and \\"You Make Me Feel (Mighty Real)\\" as a youth. In any case, I wish more of Sylvester's life and work were available, especially his rock and roll days. This book and the existing recordings will have to suffice."},{"Title":"The Fabulous Sylvester: The Legend, the Music, the Seventies in San Francisco","review":"I am still reading the book and have been quite pleased with all the details of Mr Sylvester James Jr. Life, I am sure when a read the final pages it will be as smashing as the life he lived!!

Read it because it's so well written. The narrative just flows, and before you know it you've absorbed some pretty important concepts.Erikson addresses nothing less than the role of psychology in the world, and the role of childhood in our social worlds. It's a combination of the clinical, the social, and the developmental, a combination of psychology and history. Case studies are presented and large themes are addressed.&quot;...we are also forced to recognize a universal blind spot in the makers and interpreters of history,&quot; writes Erikson, &quot;... they ignore the fateful function of childhood in the fabric of society&quot; (p. 404).Whether or not you agree with all Erikson says, you will find it food for thought."},{"Title":"Childhood and Society","review":"This book published in 1950 was Erikson's breakthrough book, the first one by which he became known to a wide popular audience. Certain of the ideas formulated in this book have become part of the language of our general culture, most notably the concept of 'identity- crisis'.At the heart of the theoretical framework of this work is Erikson's conception of eight- stages of life.The first of these stages he calls the 'oral- sensory'.It involves the conflict between basic trust and mistrust.The second is called the muscular- anal involving the confluct between Autonomy and Shame and Doubt.The third is the Locomotor Genital involving the conflict between Initiative and Guilt.The fourth is the Latent involving the conflict between Industry and Inferiority.The fifth is Adolescence where the Identity- Crisis comes into play at a time of Role- confusion.The sixth is Young Adulthood in which Intimacy is in conflict with Isolation.The seventh is Adulthood where Generativity conflicts with Stagnation.The final is 'Maturity' or \\"Old Age' where Despair threatens Ego Integrity.In this work Erikson brings case - history, comparitive anthropological data in showing how the human personality is transformed during the person's lifetime also through its encounters with Society . A pioneering work of great importance."},{"Title":"Childhood and Society","review":"Mr. Erikson wrote a thought-provoking book, but it is certainly a product of his times. Such notions as homosexuality being deviant (his word, not mine) behavior and was more of a symptom of a psychologically damaged individual has not held up to present scientific evidence. Overall, the book is a fascinating dissection of childhood development and how it possibly manifests itself in adulthood. But reading this material wasn't exactly a cake walk. I doubt many casual readers could wade through Mr. Erikson's book without developing MEGO (My Eyes Glaze Over) Syndrome. For what it's worth, I enjoyed most of it."},{"Title":"Childhood and Society","review":"An Uber-Classic--Required reading for anyone in psychology.

Best days of my life are with a trout stream, rod and this book."},{"Title":"The compleat angler: Or, The contemplative man's recreation (Little library)","review":"Three hundred fifty years ago Izaak Walton wrote of the curious blend of inner peace and giddy excitement which the amateur naturalist finds at streamside. He invites us to stroll with him through the countryside, discussing the mythology, superstition, and the science of England's aquatic fauna. It is an unrushed journey, though we often arise at sunrise, and the author introduces us to many of the local inhabitants. Indeed, if our fishing is successful, we might exchange our catch for the song of a pretty milkmaid. The Compleat Angler is a brief book, and Walton's intent is to hook the reader, and encourage him to try fishing for himself: \\"I do not undertake to say all that is known...but I undertake to acquaint the Reader with many things that are not usually known to every Angler; and I shall leave gleanings and observations enough to be made out of the experience that all that love and practise this recreation, to which I shall encourage them.\\" Interestingly, Walton starts off on the defensive, since the fisherman's passion was even then caricatured. By the end the reader has joined the \\"Brotherhood of the Angle,\\" making artificial flies and enjoying the poetry of fishing: \\"The jealous Trout, that low did lie, Rose at a well-dissembled fly.\\" To the modern ear Walton's literal belief in naturalists' old wives tales may seem humorously anachronistic, and it comprises a remarkably large part of his affection for his subject. We are also frequently reminded of the book's timeline with comments such as \\"...the Royal Society have found and published lately that there be thirty and three kinds of Spiders,\\" while we now know that there are thirty thousand species of Arachnids. And the Brotherhood of the Angle is a genuine fraternity to Walton, \\"...I love all Anglers, they be such honest, civil, quiet men.\\" The prospective reader must also be disabused of the misconception that Walton was a purist for artificial lures; he strongly recommends worms, minnows, and live flies. In Walton's watery world there is no dry humor, only fresh. Following his description of the twelve most effective artificial flies he says, \\"Thus you have a jury of flies likely to betray and condem all the Trouts in the river.\\" And here he compares the beautiful coloration of a living trout to...well, you'll see: \\"Their bodies [are] adorned with such red spots, and...with black or blackish spots, as give them such an addition of natural beauty as, I think, was never given to any woman by the artificial paint or patches in which they so much pride themselves in this age.\\" At the risk of taking some of the surprise out of the book, I here present a sample of Walton's fishing secrets: \\"Take the stinking oil drawn out of Polypody of the oak by a retort, mixed with turpentine and hive-honey, and anoint your bait therewith, and it will doubtless draw the fish to it.\\" I would guess that Walton wasn't much of a cook, however, and I do not recommend his recipe for eel (partially skinning it, packing the viceral cavity with nutmeg and anchovy, cutting off the head, slipping the skin back over the body, and sewing it together where the head formerly was, then barbecuing it on skewers). Walton's affection for fish and fishing extends beyond the aquatic nobility of trout and salmon, to the often ignored commoners: gudgeons, sprats, bleaks, herns, tench, roach, umber, loach, and sticklebag. And as for the importance of fishing in Walton's world: \\"I envy not him that eats better meat than I do, nor him that is richer, or that wears better clothes than I do; I envy nobody but him, and him only, that catches more fish than I do.\\""},{"Title":"The compleat angler: Or, The contemplative man's recreation (Little library)","review":"If you don't know about this famous book by the inimitable Walton, you have a lot to look forward to. Purporting to be an account of a 5-day fishing idyll (when gentlemen were gentle men, and the English countryside was at once bountiful and near to hand), it is in fact a deeply engaging nostalgia trip into a never-never land of pastoral bliss -- an enduring cult classic having no exact parallel in world literature.To say \\"evocative of simpler, happier times\\" is to barely hint at the near-mystical fragrance of this enchanting volume. Three high-spirited protagonists (\\"Piscator\\", \\"Venator\\", and \\"Auceps\\"), devoted to three rival outdoor avocations (fishing, hunting, and falconing, respectively), meet on a \\"fine, fresh May morning\\"; ramble across the countryside in search of lively fishing and hearty times; sing, banter, and versify; recount ancient wisdom (of often dubious validity) regarding the habits and temper of over a dozen local fish species; and encounter a classic sampling of innkeepers, milkmaids, gypsies, and various other idealized rural types. This is a refuge book for quiet evenings, one of those unaccountably transporting narratives of which no charmed reader has ever wanted to reach the end.Some history: stolen in parts from precedents written as far back as 1450, Walton's work is nearly as early as it could be and still be readable without a line-by-line explanatory gloss (\\"compleat\\" is about as arcane as it gets). First published in 1653, there have been well over 100 editions in print. Some of the earlier ones contain Lang's sensitive and informative 28-page introduction to the author's life, the structure of the work, and its publishing history. Noteworthy are the 80+ illustrations produced by Sullivan (again, available in some of the older editions and their reprints), which are unselfconsciously exquisite: naively rendered country scenes and character sketches; finely wrought studies of dry flies and of the various species of fish mentioned in the book; and ornately framed images of famous fishermen \\"taken\\" from the evidently superb engraved portraits of Major's 1824 edition.The author was a minor legend in his own time. Held in the highest regard by all who knew him, this \\"excellent old man\\" suffered many tragedies throughout his long life (from the public murder of his beloved king to various family deaths and personal debilities), but he never lost his rare sweetness of temper. He wrote numerous other treatises, but \\"The Compleat Angler\\" early on rendered him a literary immortal."},{"Title":"The compleat angler: Or, The contemplative man's recreation (Little library)","review":"I'm flyfisher in Korea. I think there is no necessity for talking about this book. Because this is so famous book to fishermans, as you know. Specially, this paperback edition is good for your wallet, with no omission. In a word, Full content, Good price!"},{"Title":"The compleat angler: Or, The contemplative man's recreation (Little library)","review":"I have had this book beside me for more than 20 years, not for its guidance about fishing (though this is pleasant), but for the simple, unaffected but eloquent beauty of its 17th century prose. A lovely, idealized, Arcadian sort of England comes to life, and it is a very nice place in which to dip your mind a while."},{"Title":"The compleat angler: Or, The contemplative man's recreation (Little library)","review":"This is surely one of the earliest books available to the modern angler. But it's worth distinguishing 'anglers' from 'fishermen'. I take 'anglers' to be people who go after fish for fun or sport or pleasure and 'fishermen' to be people who go after fish for work.The first thing to be said about Izaak Walton's book, is that it is a play followed by a text book. The second thing, is that it's in a foreign language even to the English, because it was first published in 1653 when the author was 60. A ripe old age in England in those days.Walton was essentially a biographer. He got paid for it - often commissioned as a good artist might. He wrote 'The Life of Donne' - a poet who even I've heard of. He's alleged to have been a prosperous merchant, but it doesn't really matter. Great angling writers like Richard Walker were engineers. Old school writers like George Skues, were public school educated solicitors in London practices who took the train to the chalk streams of Winchester in Hampshire at weekends, tying flies as they went.The play concerns three people who meet by chance and get into conversation about their interests. They're travelling at a walk, and so they lighten their journey with convoluted conversation. Before long, it develops into a bit of a competition. Walton is the angler (Piscator). Another gentleman is keen on falconry (Venator) and yet another is keen on hunting (Auceps).If you tire of 17th century banter, skip forward to the chapters on each particular species of fish, which will ring true immediately. To me it's a revelation that these friendly old fish will still fall for the same tricks as Walton was playing on their ancestors over 350 years ago."},{"Title":"The compleat angler: Or, The contemplative man's recreation (Little library)","review":"This book is to fishing as military music is to music. True, THE COMPLEAT ANGLER does discuss the various aspects then current in England, but any focus on fishing was secondary to giving a combination of practical advice, pastoral fantasy, and good-humored piety. The book is a dialogue with 3 speakers: Piscator (the angler), Venator (the hunter), and Aucer (the falconer). Frequently, Walton abandons the dialogue and simply presents Piscator giving some very long instructional speeches on a plethora of topics ranging from angling to cooking to just about anything else under the sun. Walton is not bashful about inserting poetry of Raleigh, Donne, Drayton, Herbert, and many others. Piscator is not simply the champion of angling; he is pious, a moralizer, a gourmand, a singer, and above all, a lover of the lovely British countryside. Further, he is unflaggingly polite and upbeat. His duty to God is never more than one sentence from his tongue. He drops quotes from the Bible the way a Vegas gambler drops chips at the blackjack table. Since Piscator was so clearly drawn as the prototypical Englishman, it is no surprise that all Englishman saw in him more than a bit of themselves and correspondingly loved him. Non-English readers are often puzzled as to why he was so widely read. First, even non-fishermen can share in the joy with which he expounds the mysteries of angling. Next, he is a genuine lover of country sights and sounds. Finally, he embodies the temperamental qualities on which the English place such huge store: he is kindly, tolerant, patient, one who interferes with nobody and asks nothing better than to be allowed to enjoy his hobby in peace. His style of writing includes a fondness for writing a balanced, parallel sentence with much frolicsome humor. THE COMPLEAT ANGLER is a work full of digressions and a fondness for the fabulous natural history derived from Pliny the Elder, so much so that we might wonder whether so credulous a man could be a trustworthy biographer. Yet, it is this unsophisticated and uncritical inclusiveness of vast masses of unrelated and unverified data that constitutes one of its great charms."},{"Title":"The compleat angler: Or, The contemplative man's recreation (Little library)","review":"The Complete Angler - Izaak Walton and Chalres CottonThis book deserves a place in a collection of great angling books, such as those of John Geirach, Henry Middleton and Scott Waldie. It is really two books and an odd sort of middle section on property rights and fishing (funny how some issues have not changed much since the late 17th century). It has some wonderful discourses on not just fishing but the lifestyle and philosophy of fishing. There are some sections and descriptions that can be tedious but they minor compared to the overall wonderful dialogue of the majority of the book.The first section is written by Izaak Walton and, to me, was Canterbury Tales-esque, is it's older English language (which is entertainingly preserved) and its format. Three travelers - a fisherman (angler), hunter and falconer meet. In the course of discussing the merits of their activities the angler convinces the hunter to come along fishing with him (after seeing a hunt with hounds). Over the course of a few days on the rivers of England, the angler turns the hunter to the quiet joys of angling. He goes through the fish in England and all the baits and methods of fishing for them as well as how to prepare each of them. I had never through of carp of chubs and fish to eat, but after some of the descriptions in this book, I may have to give the a second look someday. The first book is as much of a celebration of the social and contemplative nature of angling as it is descriptions and methods of fishing. Interspersed are encounters with the local farmers, milker and inn-keepers as well as the talking over of the days activities among friends. But the highlight of this first section, and in my opinion the entire book, is the parting words of the angler to the hunter of how angling is a life philosophy that departs sharply from the hustle and bustle of the capitalist life. The first book is replete with references to early Christianity and its admonitions against looking to wealth for happiness.There is an odd middle section about property rights and fishing which serves as a rather odd bridge to Charles Cotton's section. This book focuses on fishing for trout and graylings in a small section of England. If found the wordy descriptions of the flies by month to be tedious and the lack of philosophical discussion of fishing to be a little disappointing of an end."},{"Title":"The compleat angler: Or, The contemplative man's recreation (Little library)","review":"Five days of fishing along the river Lea which joins the Thames near London is the background on which the cheerful narrative of The Compleat Angler is laid. The splendid civil conversation of Latin named Piscator, Venator, Auceps, Viator, and Piscator Junior is a joy to hear. Shakespeare was just publishing his first work when Izaak Walton was born in 1593 in Stafford. Walton retired in his early fifties and traveled about rural England visiting friends, fishing, and writing in his easy-going fashion. After publication of The Compleat Angler in 1653 he continued to add to it in his leisurely way for the next quarter century. Samuel Johnson praised the book in the eighteenth century and later Charles Lamb recommended The Compleat Angler to Samuel Taylor Coleridge. 'It breathes the very spirit of innocence, purity, and simplicity of heart,' he noted. 'It would sweeten a man's temper at any time to read it; it would Christianise every angry, discordant passion; pray make yourself acquainted with it.'The Compleat Angler is a true classic of English literature that owes it's esteem not to advice about fishing but to Izaak Walton's pre-occupations and exquisite manner. Subtitled The Contemplative Man's Recreation the pages glow with delight in the hills and dales, woods and streams of the beloved countryside. Walton conveys a message of meek thankful fellowship and peace to all \\"honest, civil, quiet men\\". 'The Compleat Angler is not about how to fish but about how to be,' said novelist Thomas McGuane. 'Walton spoke of an amiable mortality and rightness on the earth that has been envied by his readers for three hundred years.'"},{"Title":"The compleat angler: Or, The contemplative man's recreation (Little library)","review":"Whilst this edition/reprint includes the Charles Cotton supplement, the print quality is abominable.

I must stay this one, that I just bought for my son for his 8th birthday, has been the biggest disappointment in a sticker book that I can remember. Why? Because for a sticker book to be fun for a child, the stickers need to be totally cut away from the border paper so that the child isn't ripping them in half trying to get them off the page. This book's stickers are not die cut properly, and so after he ripped a few stickers, I had to cut around each of them to separate them from the border so he could use them. No fun for him, having ripped his first stickers, no fun for mom to have to cut out each sticker!! The book itself is big with lovely backround pictures to place the stickers on, but I rate it only 2 stars because the sticker quality must be there for a sticker book to be good for the child. Also, I found the stickers to be a bit \\"thin\\"...for supposedly being a \\"reusable\\" sticker book (and we have rarely found in our vast sticker book experience that stickers actually are \\"reusable\\")and the stick isn't as strong as I would like to see. A sticker on the first stick should not be curling up on the edges.I would recommend that this company put this book out in a new form. Long ago, I used to be able to buy my oldest daughter sticker books with vinyl stickers (like colorforms) that were great and lasted a long time and actually were reusable. And vinyl stickers are 100% more durable than paper stickers...so much thicker, hence no ripping! If this Thomas book had vinyl stickers, it would be so nice! So sadly, we wasted $7 on a book he will be able to use only once, and due to the thin, not-so-very-sticky stickers, the finished result isn't even very attractive at that. So I do not recommend it."},{"Title":"Keeping Track of Thomas (Thomas & Friends) (Reusable Sticker Book)","review":"This was very disappointing, we bought the Bob the Builder version for our 2 year old, and he had the same problems as the previous reviewer with stickers ripping. The reusability factor was also not there, after a 2 year old pulling them off and trying to reapply them just the first time, they were curling up at all the edges and not staying sticky. The other problem with this book is that the pages are non-contiguous posters, which means for him to use them as whole pictures, without pulling out 3 staples and then losing posters and stickers.

Jesse Stuart wonderfully depicted his life as a school teacher. Somewhat near the beginning of the book, the written meaning of the title is revealed when Stuart is singing a song containing the words. The thread that runs so true is play, which is emphasized throughout the book. Yet, there is a more meaningful lesson taught. Contextually, it is evident that the thread is also the teaching profession itself. Stuart's thread would most likely be the country life. After being a successful teacher and administrator, traveling abroad, and numerous other ventures, he returns to his Kentucky home and farms sheep. This is fantastic for almost any audience, students, teachers, and those who were once either or both. It is filled with unbelievable experiences from Stuart physically fighting his students to him being shot at for dating a particular lady. In the case of good fiction, you must remind yourself that the events didn't actually happen. In reading this book, I learned that with the most interesting non-fiction, you must realize that the events actually did occur."},{"Title":"The Thread That Runs So True","review":"This is the best book I have read about teaching. It is inspirational as well as entertaining. . Jesse Stuart knew how to teach children in such a way that they wanted to learn. His approach to education was one of making learning practical as well as fun. He also instilled in them a pride for themselves and for their school. The Thread That Runs So True should be required reading for every teacher education program in the United States."},{"Title":"The Thread That Runs So True","review":"I first read this book when I was in the ninth grade, and it, more than any other book I ever read, inspired me to become a teacher. This book has (I believe) been in print without interruption since it was originally published in the 1940s. I myself have bought so many copies that I have lost count, replacing copies borrowed by students and never returned. Although the world that Stuart wrote about, rural Kentucky in the 1920s and 1930s, has pretty much vanished, the book, in its passion for the good of education, in its compassion for both students and teachers, feels utterly contemporary. The stories of Stuart's experiences as teacher and administrator speak to our needs, even though most of us will never have to ride horseback to school or beat a student senseless to earn classroom control or be beaten ourselves by ignorant opponents of out views. But in our different world it is good to be reminded of the power of the teacher-student bond, a bond that will not soon be eliminated by distance education. Teachers who know how to make a class come alive, how to bring learning to life, are as important today as they were sixty years ago, or indeed 600. Inspirational, insightful, theoretical, this book is all, but it has also one more virtue: the prose is a bit breathy, but Stuart really knew how to tell a story!"},{"Title":"The Thread That Runs So True","review":"The thread That Runs So True autobiographical story is a personal writing about his teaching career. He narrates a several experiences regarding his teaching and how he had to face difficult situation to remain teaching at school with success. However, he persevered and got success with his students. His students demonstrated interest and enjoyed learning as a consequence of his method of teaching with new ideas, trying to get interest and attention from his students. I enjoyed the way he narrates his experiences with tender feelings towards his students and courage to confront different situations as a teacher in the mountain region of Kentucky. I believe The Thread that Runs so True is a great example to follow for teachers and works as an inspiration for them in order to obtain the same results as Jesse Stuart"},{"Title":"The Thread That Runs So True","review":"I am so blessed to have been given a first edition signed by the author copy of this book. I had read the paperback previously and enjoyed it so much. As a teacher, I felt it was written just for me. I have purchased several copies as gifts for teacher friends as well as for two of my own children who are teachers. The women who gave me the first edition are elderly school-teachers who knew Jesse Stuart personally and have no children with whom to leave the book. I count this book as one of my greatest treasures. Thank you, ladies. He was an inspiration to future generations of teachers and I have quoted him many times. I plan to give several copies as Christmas gifts this year to friends, family, and team-mates."},{"Title":"The Thread That Runs So True","review":"I first read Jesse Stuart 30 years ago in high school. I remember giving an oral book report to my English teacher and expressing surprise that rural Kentucky teachers continued to teach even when they were not receiving their pay. I remember my teacher telling me-- in all sincerity-- that she would do the same thing. Wow. I never looked at teaching the same way again!The only reason I give this book 4 instead of 5 stars is that I wish Stuart had delved more deeply into the characters in the beginning of the book. There was certainly enough material there for an entire book by itself-- then Stuart could have used his years as a high school principal for a second book."},{"Title":"The Thread That Runs So True","review":"I read this book while preparing to do the play based from it, and I must say that it is an amazing piece of literature..... each student in the book is so lifelike that when it came time for my friend and I to play the parts of Guy Hawkins and Vaida Conway, we knew just what to do. It is a heartwarming tale....... Jesse has so many experiences with so many people in the book that it makes the story easy to follw and believable..... I would recommend this book to anyone!"},{"Title":"The Thread That Runs So True","review":"This fellow worked very hard to become the wonderful person he was. The effort to do what he loved was, ultimately, overwhelming. He was a school teacher who became a sheep farmer and an author.I really liked his growth through all the trials and tribulations of life in the Kentucky hills as a school teacher. He shows how dedication to an ideal, with a bit of imagination, can create a quality that was missing. Mr. Stuart truly loved teaching. His greatest success was in helping others learn and come to love the profession as he did. He has written a paean to the teaching profession and you feel proud for him and all teachers to be able to do what they can do for so little renumeration, and, sometimes, outright hostility.This is a sad story because the teachers he works with are lured away from where they grew up and are needed, to teach in other districts where teaching is valued a bit higher. Mr. Stuart, himself, quit school teaching to become a sheep farmer and writer because he could not foresee being able to raise a family on the earnings of a schoolteacher and writer. But this was in 1920's and 1930's Kentucky where the teacher's motto was, &#8220;Thank God for Arkansas,&#8221; the only state with standards below Kentucky's.Here is a thought, at one point in his story, he and his teachers were not getting paid, but still teaching and all. He mentions that he was not expecting this, but was pleasantly surprised when he saw it happen. I suppose this was in 1929 or so. But my question is, would our teachers of today do that? I know that the system and society of today make it highly unlikely for it to happen at all, but still the notion does present a quandary, since teachers today are not farmers or gardeners able to provide for themselves, as those in the old days were."},{"Title":"The Thread That Runs So True","review":"At first when I looked at The Thread That Runs So True by Jesse Stuart, I thought it was going to be boring. After I read the preface,I had a much better view of the book. The way he uses experiences from his own life truly opened my eyes. The way he wrote the book was good because he starts from the beginning of his teaching career and includes details one after another and didn't leave me hanging or wondering. It is very clear that if teachers took some time to read this book then maybe the teachers who are stuck on one thought and who are close minded might change. Then perhaps classrooms would run better and the children would learn more.Although every part of a teacher's life clearly doesn't have anything to do with what they do or how they act in their classrooms, this book gives a true glimpse into what teachers really go through and what their lives are like.I give \\"The Thread That Runs So True\\" 4 stars because I thought that Stuart could have given a more satisfying ending with all the work he accomplished as a teacher."},{"Title":"The Thread That Runs So True","review":"I cannot remember where I picked this book up at ... probably at a library fund-raiser sale. I went to the Smokies for a week-long vacation and was scouring through the bookcases for something to read when I happened on this one. I picked it solely for the fact that it was about a teacher teaching in rural Kentucky and since I was going to be in the hills, I would read this for the week.It was the best impulsive reading I have done in quite some time. This book is an eye-opener and I am constantly checking back to the copyright page to see what year it was published because unfortunately, some of the issues that Mr. Stuart faced in his day are still running true today.Stuart writes passionately of why he became a teacher and he shared memorable tidbits that still resonates with me; such as the time when he had his class measure a farmer's plot of land to ensure that the farmer would stop getting ripped off because he didn't know his mathematics. There was the story of the bully who beat up his sister and he was prepared to take on the biggest bully of the valley only to gain a life-long friend and student. There was the story of kids traisping through the frost barefoot because their yearly allotment of shoes haven't come in yet and the kids wanted to come to school.There are places in this memoir where I felt that he was bragging a little too hard but it was quickly forgiven once he admits to his short-comings. He writes of lugging books over the mountaintops for his students who were starving for books of any nature so they could educate themselves even more. He writes of being a principal and a superintendent, having to fight the trustees. He writes of ideas that he has on education and how it could be improved. He writes of his students and their successes.I have toyed with the idea of going back to school and be a teacher ... and this book is definitely a good inspiration to consider it. Stuart was frank with the issues that teachers faced back in the 30s-40s and he was frank about what he believed that education should be even though administrators (who are so far removed from the realities of teaching that they have no clue on what students face nowadays) would ignore his suggestions. Teachers should be rewarded with a good salary and retirement plans and most importantly, respect from the students and parents alike. (Yes, I am aware that there are bad teachers out there but I do believe that a lot of teachers get a really bad rap because people didn't agree with their teaching methods.)This book is incredibly insightful and so well-written that it has been several days since I've finished this book and I cannot wait to share it with others who love education as much as I do.7/19/10"},{"Title":"The Thread That Runs So True","review":"I first became aware of Jessee Stuart in the 5th grade. My teacher, Ms. Gray, had gone to college with him and always assigned one of his books as required reading in her class. I always loved and very much respected Ms. Gray because she always found the good in something that I said or did in class. She was old when I knew her, had never married, but had her family - her classroom children.She assigned this book. I read it, thought about it, and even felt at the time that it was a book that would be influentual in my life, I just didn't know how. I grew up and became a successful businessman, and in my 57th year re-read this book. I then remembered again why I had always loved it. My eyes are older and wiser now, yes some of their sparkle is gone, but I guess I can say this book brings some of the sparkle back. When we all live in the lap of luxury, our children have way to much and we all are way to spoiled, stop for a moment and read about a time in our very recent past when many children had to fight to get an education. When many educators had to fight to just get the opportunity to be an educator in order to do what they were called to do. The message here is very simple, so simple in fact that it is timeless and as relevant today as when this book was written. It only takes one person, just one, to change your life and set you on a course that may be for life-long. We have all had these people in our life even if we knew we did or not. We have. Here is a simple man who changed the course of many lives, I believe he changed the life of my 5th grade teacher Ms. Gray, I know he changed mine. Do you children a favor, require they read this. Go one step further, you read it with them or to them."},{"Title":"The Thread That Runs So True","review":"I can't understand how anyone wouldn't like this book. Great writer, great story. I have passed this book around more than a few times to teachers I know and they all love it. Most buy a copy for themselves. Any critic can pick at this or that, but this is a good and fun book to read that I recommend to all readers."},{"Title":"The Thread That Runs So True","review":"This was the book I read in high school that made me want to be a teacher. Jesse Stuart's experiences as a young Kentucky teacher in the hill country are classic.His writing is sincere and full of the love of education. Both of his parents were good hard-working people who could barely read.Only a true writer could have conveyed the sense of adventure, the wonder, and above all, the sense of accomplishment that inspiring young minds gives to the true teacher."},{"Title":"The Thread That Runs So True","review":"The book The Thread That Runs So True by Jesse Stuart was a good book. At the first glance, it looked pretty boring, but after reading it I was glad I did. It is about his life as a teacher at a young age . He teaches students that are older and younger than him. He has a lot of different problems, but in the end he is able to overcome these problems with no problem at all. This book is very interesting and fun to read. It makes you want to read more or never put it down."},{"Title":"The Thread That Runs So True","review":"Twenty-two years ago (in 1986) I was a freshman in high school. My English teacher assigned The Thread That Runs So True as part of our summer reading. I am now a college professor & I thought that it would be fun to reread the book now that I have classes to teach.Stuart's book is powerful. He explains the limited circumstances of his Kentucky pupils in a way that makes you think about the lack of opportunities many Americans face. Stuart will also force you to take off your rose-colored glasses about how wonderful things used to be. He recounts stories of students beating up teachers, indifferent administrators, and students literally walking barefoot in the snow to get to school. The good-old days weren't so great.One of the best aspects of the Thread That Runs So True is that Stuart has tremendous faith in humanity - and in education's ability to improve each of us and our society. He recounts many instances in which students from the most-impoverished families dramatically improved their lives by going to school. Even a cynic will find it difficult not to feel a little inspired by reading this book.In my opinion, the book is not perfect. Stuart's argument that education funding is the panacea to cure society's ills is dated; we now know that money for education is very important, but that money alone does not always promote student achievement. Also, I don't want to give anything away, but I thought that the ending of the book was very unsatisfying.While The Thread That Runs So True has a few drawbacks, it is an inspiring story that will teach you a lot about education early in the 20th Century U.S."},{"Title":"The Thread That Runs So True","review":"One of the best books I have ever read... all teachers should read this book....it makes you realize you are not the only person to every have these thoughts"},{"Title":"The Thread That Runs So True","review":"This was a required reading for my masters. I enjoyed it thoroughly! I could barely put the book down. When typing up my reflection assignment, I went way over the required pages. This book is truly captivating, and that much more interesting to me as that it was written from a teacher's point of view. As a Southern teacher, it made me even more interested. Read this book! You will learn so much about the importance of pragmatic education."},{"Title":"The Thread That Runs So True","review":"Loved this book. People interest in eary american history and the Applichans will enjoy this book."},{"Title":"The Thread That Runs So True","review":"This is an older book but still lively for modern readers. Great book on a great teacher."},{"Title":"The Thread That Runs So True","review":"I was hooked at the first chapter. I had never even heard of this book but bought it at a book sale because it was Scribener's Library edition. There is a purpose for a man's (or woman's life) - to go out and change the world - to find the problems and leave the world better than before. To change one life at a time. How do you teach the children today that they need to wake up to their duty? This man was slaying giants at an early age. Let us teach our children to break out of their Wii cocoons and challenge the world order. Who knows what problems they will solve."},{"Title":"The Thread That Runs So True","review":"I DO happen to have a first edition autographed copy given to me as a gift which I cherish. I have loved this book so much, I could read it yearly. I've had difficulties finding it through the years to give to colleagues and beginning teachers. This book should be required reading for all new teachers. Jesse Stuart was light years ahead of his time. He was a dedicated, committed, and passionate teacher. When the students weren't \\"getting\\" the math lesson, he looked around the room, noticed the Farm Bureau calendar on the wall, took it down and cut out the numbers for the students to have concrete manipulatives. Decades later, publishing companies are selling concrete manipulative for students to learn math. One of the other reviews stated \\"he wasn't a good writer.\\" He was a teacher, writing his story. I am a National Board Certified teacher of writing and I would love to see more teachers write their story."},{"Title":"The Thread That Runs So True","review":"I first bought and read The Thread tht Runs So True when I taught in California because our superintendent recommended it as his favorite book. I understand why - in addition to a fascinating story of Stuart's success in making a living classroom out of an empty building (which I had to do as a first-year fresh-out too), the book explores the motivations, challenges, and victories of teaching, anywhere. I used Stuart's life lessons while I taught, and since. Every teacher deserves to read this book -- for perspective, for purpose, and to see the universality of the teaching and learning experience. Read it!"},{"Title":"The Thread That Runs So True","review":"I am an 8th grader and I read this book for my AR test.I have always wanted to be a teacher and this just inspired me to be one. I like how he tells all of his teaching experences even if they are bad. I recommend any teacher or students that want to be a teacher to read this book."},{"Title":"The Thread That Runs So True","review":"This book and story takes the reader into the world of education at the grass roots rural level. From the one room school house with 20 year old students still mired in the first grade to brilliant students from impoverished backgrounds. A terrific review and account of cultural conditions in the 1930's, from the depression to WWII. A must read for educators/teachers. Many of the methods and means used by the author will shock and surprise today's readers, but this is Kentucky in the 1930's. Imagery depicted is fantastic."},{"Title":"The Thread That Runs So True","review":"When I was in Junior High I found Jesse Stuart's book \\"Hie to the Hunters\\" in the school library. It remains one of the best books I have ever read. Stuart was at the same time a tough man's man and a sensitive poet. His love of the natural beauty of Kentucky and his people shines through in all his writing, as does his toughness, hard work and perseverance. He was born in the hill country of Kentucky to a father who was not literate and a mother who had only completed a few years of grade school, yet he and his brothers and sisters learned the value of education and became school teachers. \\"The Thread That Runs So True\\" is the story of his career in education, beginning when he was a 17-year-old teaching a rural one-room school in the 1920s, through stints as a principal and superintendent of schools, and finally as a farmer, author, and lecturer. \\"The Thread That Runs So True\\", written in 1949, remains probably his best-known book, but parts of it are almost too painful to read. Stuart's first year of teaching was at a country school where his older sister had been badly beaten up and driven from the school by a tough male student. Stuart wrote poignantly of the beautiful and the ugly in this book, and it is very worthwhile reading."},{"Title":"The Thread That Runs So True","review":"I am not one that usualy likes the books teachers require me to read, but this book was great. The story was captivating and fun. The reading was light and I wasn't a fan of the choppy \\"chaptering\\" of the book, but I did enjoy it very much."},{"Title":"The Thread That Runs So True","review":"The Thread That Runs So True is a wonderful collection of stories. Jesse Stuart, the author, weaves these tales together to chronicle his teaching career over a period of twenty years. He begins as a rural teacher in a small, one-room schoolhouse, and eventually becomes Superintendent of the county school system. Stuart incorporates innovative and unique ideas into his teaching that sometimes garner him some intense criticism. However, he perseveres and is highly successful. His students regularly demonstrate outstanding academic achievements, have minimal disciplinary problems, and enjoy their learning. I would recommend this book for anyone working with children who desires those results. I enjoyed the warmth and honesty with which Stuart narrates. I found myself laughing out loud numerous times as I read about his experiences. This book is not a serious study of the methods and techniques of a successful teacher but rather an enjoyable non-fiction account of teaching with countless excellent ideas woven throughout."},{"Title":"The Thread That Runs So True","review":"I gave The Thread that Ran so True by Jesse Stuart a four out of a five because it was a great story and it was based on a real story. The Thread Thats Runs So True was published in 1949. Stuart was able to teach kids from the ages of five to twenty with a few minor set backs. He had some unusual experiences and had some unusual students. They would like to mess with Jesse Stuart because he was the youngest teacher and he went from high school to teaching without collage. This book is rare to find anywhere except for in Kentucky because thats the only place they sell it. I recommend this book to any teacher or parent that had children in school."},{"Title":"The Thread That Runs So True","review":"I grew up in the middle of the lands Stuart speaks about in his books. I knew him and his family well. His sister, who was the one badly beaten in this book, was my second grade teacher. The stories recounted by Stuart here are amazingly true to life. Jesse had some ideas I think turned out to be wrong but at the time they seemed like the way to go. Centralized control of the schools in particular became everything the critics said it would be, a cesspool for children to learn the worst of habits. They learned the same habits Stuart detested so much in Mr. Gallion's School. Consolidation set in motion the machinery that produced a generation of students who learned drugs, cliques, and abuse of their fellow students. Stuart had the best of intentions and his methods worked well for him but only in the setting that he grew to hate. He thought direct control by the parents was a bad thing but it turned out to be the one thing that kept schools in line just as the critics he derided said it would.Still this book shows the caring attitude of the man and his inspirational methods for bringing students into the world of education. I only wish his methods were still in vogue. I wish the old system was still the standard. Yes there were glaring failures in that system but there are even more now.I grew up dis-respecting Stuart for the way he portrayed my home. But that was his world. It just wasn't mine. The generation after Stuart was not set in the backwoods world of Stuarts youth. It was a modern, industrialized area with centralized schools and all the ills that come with them. Now the industry is gone but the centralized schools remain with even less to motivate students to perform well. There will always be the few that excel but Stuart envisioned a world where all students participated with enthusiasm. Unfortunately Stuart helped set in motion the thing that destroyed his dream before it ever really got off the ground.I will always love the idealism of this book. But a dose of realism was badly needed for Stuart and the school system he created."},{"Title":"Saab Aircraft (Archive Photographs)","review":"Although filled with photographs, this book contains no developmental histories of Saab aircrafts, engineers who designed the planes, technical specifications or performances except in passing references. Even the photograps were not particularly valuable, as they contain no cockpit or other interior shots. It's just a hodge-podge collection of pictures, not an useful book for aviation enthusiasts or aircraft modellers."},{"Title":"Viata pe fuga: Roman (Romanian Edition)","review":"The existence in three dimensions - this is how the new novel of Mirela Roznoveanu written in exile could be defined. The world left behind, the new world in which she lives in, and the world within are the levels of this kind of existence. The author has for her character, Angela, a database of projects, none of them connected to temporality. Between life and philosophy, pure thinking and event are laid down the thoughts of a spiritual vision reporting to its own mental, analytic, and redeeming universe.We can imagine Bach's Fugues, where the initial melodic line proves to be continuous depending on renewed themes, and the succession of these elements leads to the image of the complex and perfectly well-organized speech. The author assumes the role of seismograph of her own existence and implicitly of the history. If life is a continuous run between given or assumed labyrinths, then the depth of this reflection - which accompanies the dynamic of the existence - raises this novel on the highest level of the esthetical value.To live in two worlds - mental and sensorial - and not being able to disconnect from this reality, means to integrate through huge tensions and in the heroic hope to dominate them through spirit and knowledge. Life on the Run, is eventually, the outstanding epic performance of what we could call the salvation through exile, or the exile assumed as a process of salvation.Mirela Roznoveanu brings, in the prose of exile, the trauma of separation from place and people and her own sensitive universe. The feminine character of the novel is becoming the author herself, a dense coagulation of situations and convulsions, out of which we can reconstitute both the elements of personal psychohistory and of those transcending the history.Mirela Roznoveanu came to the US in 1991, after she had published several books in Romania, amongst which is the comparative essay on the world novel, \\"The Civilization of the Novel\\", a work in two volumes and the novel \\" Always in the Fall\\". Also poet and outstanding essayist, Mirela Roznoveanu accumulates new dimensions through \\"the American experience\\" in which Life on the Run could be considered a spiritual document and an over lasting one.We can distinguish the remarkable capacity of the author of melting the reality into fiction and to grant the fiction the conflicted impulses and fresh emotions. The two worlds which Angela crosses are reduced to her own \\"I\\", a perfectly well-intuitive epic solution, because this could offer us a value of self -knowledge and implicitly of the historic time.It is impressive in this novel the gallery of characters, essentially particularized, arranged in an orchestra of identities, each character performing on the scene of life -- a falling prelude or a vulnerable rising. Mirela Roznoveanu's heroine is a rebellious person, condemned to the life which avoids the solutions (those solutions which sometimes bring down an existence). As a consequence, she builds herself a \\"personal homeland\\" which she makes sure will raise her at the height of the spiritual and philosophical aspiration, yet, without suggesting the expanding of the interior project.In the context of dissident and anti-totalitarian prose, Life on the Run claims a very important place, holding it from the moment the novel was printed out.The duality of the horror and fascination follows Angela's psychology. The New World is not shocking to her, but it provokes her admiration, which will become fluctuating with polemic fallings so natural for a person eager for harmony and perfection. The world left behind of the communism or of the neocomunism it is given back to Angela as a calvary, in which her fate was both to became a grown up and to not be able to develop. Angela lives with the memory of the darkness she has just come out of and gets into another world, which she likes, just because it is different, \\"the third\\" world does exist only within her soul.Between aberration and apparent normality Angela will choose the second, trying to re-compose her identity, to reformulate it within some parameters which she conquers with wise and infinite hope. The dynamic of life is frequently marked by the possibility to invest the energies in a new hope; we detect a world that does not issue passing cards for a chance, but the chances are real in competition with yourself; we detect the idea of liberty \\"in the exercise\\" which should be responsible and spirited; yet we can see the corruption of the world, which does not care about civilization and meridians.The novel is built on several levels of the most subtle complexity, where the adventure and erotic recitals circulate through the epic system with forceful physiological effects. As a human being, Angela must know everything. As an artist, she does not refuse herself anything because she knows she has all the means to come back always to a well-temperate climate.Running through life or \\"Life on the Run\\" is one of the most unusual and expressive novels of the whole Romanian contemporary literature. A prose dominated by reflection andspiritual tensions, an original way to perceive the world and to commission the representation of the historical reality. The great events of this novel are mostly spiritual, philosophical and essentials ones. And the great prose has always been based on this triangle. \\"Life on the Run\\" is the novel for this end of the millennium...Life on the Run - Preface by Ion TuguiTranslated from Romanian by Lavinia Barbu"},{"Title":"Powerful Sales, Manage Your energy, Achieve Your Goals","review":"Powerful Sales is clear, concise and insightful!

I would highly recommend this book to anyone into both Sci-Fi and Adventure novels."},{"Title":"Chance for the Future","review":"Chance for the Future simply moves. It has action, adventure, elements of surprise, some comedy, and is a good read. I'm an avid science fiction reader and this book held my attention. I think that even those who would never pick up a sci-fi novel (including my wife and daughter) would enjoy this book because the lead character is a strong female. For his first novel, Carhart has done a good job. Take a Chance with Chance for The Future."},{"Title":"Holidays and Anniversaries of the World","review":"This book is huge! It goes through every day of the year, listing holidays around the world inlcuding all religions and nationalities. It lists historical events for that day, famous birthdays, etc.I highly recommend it for anyone who needs some creative ideas on a month-to-month basis other than the standard holidays. It lists those goofie, off-the-wall celebrations: Did you know January 4 (pg.2) is &quot;National Trivia Day?&quot; Or that February (pg. 87-88) is also has &quot;National Pickle Week&quot; (I always thought it was in May!) or &quot;Kraut and Frankfurter Week&quot; or is &quot;National Potato Lover's Month?&quot; And although August (pg. 584) doesn't have any national holidays it does have &quot;National Clown Week&quot; and ironically &quot;National Beauty Queen Week.&quot; LOL Who thinks of this stuff anyway?I bought this as a reference book for ideas for my website. But, teachers, social event supervisors, etc. might find it a great resource for projects also."},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"This well researched and well constructed book pulls together several first hand accounts of the loss of the whaling vessel the Essex. Philbrick has written the seminal treatment of the subject, and it is both readable and very interesting, both for the education it provides about seamanship, navigation and whaling in the 19th century, but also his deft handling of the human tragedy.Perhaps the most ironic element of the story is the fact that the men chose to backtrack towards the coast of South America at a distance of 2500 hundred miles, rather than risk travelling west to the much more accessible Pacific island of Marquesa, because stories of cannibalism so unnerved them. Ultimately, these seamen died becasue of ignorance and prejudice, and is therefore a useful parable for today's reader."},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"book arrived on time and in good condition. would definetly purchase from this merchant again."},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"This was a Great read!

It was a riveting read. This book made the rounds of our friends outside of our book group that love a good story.

So, I'm just passing along his recommendation."},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"IN THE HEART OF THE SEA by Nathaniel Philbrick tells the tragic and amazing story of the Essex, a Nantucket whaler that sank after being rammed by a mammoth sperm whale in the South Pacific in November of 1820.If the story of the whale attack and loss of the ship weren't enough, the harrowing tale of how the crew attempted to make it back to New England through the open sea in nothing more than open whaleboats, while experiencing everything from shark attacks to cannibalism, has to be one of the most gripping and inspiring tales ever recorded.Philbrick is masterful in his treatment of the story from start to finish. Drawing upon journals and writings of survivors--used in their day to inspire Herman Melville's masterpiece, Moby Dick--Philbrick offers a concise historical narrative."},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"This is a very captivating story, well-written and researched. I found the history of the Nantucket whalers to be interesting, but it seems that the ecological impact caused by these men is not examined in detail. I'm not talking of \\"whaling is bad and whalers are evil\\"; I think this has already been examined exhaustively. Rather, the impact that whaling had on many island and ocean ecosystems. I realize that men were not as savvy about the environment and their impact on it in the early 1800s, but surely one thinks they would have realized something was going awry when the Nantucket whaling industry started out around the home island, then the whales there disappeared and they had to venture farther out into the Atlantic; eventually exhausting that supply of whales and having to round the Horn and hunt in the forbidding, and largely unknown, Pacific Ocean.There are two vignettes worth mentioning: One is a stop on the Galapagos Islands, for food and fresh water. They gather up as many Galapagos tortoises as they can find, for use as fresh meat at sea since the creatures supposedly required no food or water for months. Some of these tortoises were decades, possibly a hundred years old, and the men think of nothing of taking them as a quick and easy food supply. Even though they supposedly need no food, some of the men comment on them trying to eat any and everything aboard the ship. All the survivors of these tortoises went down with the ship; some were floating about in the water as the ship went down. Then one crewman, as a prank, starts a fire on the Galapagos island they're on, and pretty much reduces the island to a charred cinder. They watch it burn behind them for days. One wonders what subspecies were rendered extinct in this conflagration. Another example is when the men, after the sinking, wash up on remote Henderson Island. Within weeks, they have eaten every small bird and edible creature on the island, undoubtedly changing the ecosystem forever.The adventure in this book, however, is first-class. The whale sank the Essex roughly halfway between Hawaii and the Galapagos Islands--pretty much as far away from land as anyone could be. I'll never forget the stunned sensation the whalers had when they look from their whaleboats and see their ship going down--and they're literally in the middle of nowhere. What they go through from this point defies human comprehension."},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"just a great book. one of the best i have ever read"},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"I enjoyed reading THE HEART OF THE SEA as a supplement to other great novels based on fictional and non fictional sea disasters, such as MOBY DICK. THE HEART OF THE SEA is a good historical documentation of life of the whaler, and the hazards of the sea. I did not find the author's writing style to be particularly inspirational, rather it was flat with descriptions that did not evoke true passion for the individuals that endured such tragic circumstance. I am going to read ISAAC'S STORM next, as it was mentioned in an earlier review on this site."},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"A thoroughly fascinating read. Makes you realize what true hardship is. However, there is one glaring factual error. Philbrick refers to the 1972 Andes plane crash involving \\"soccer\\" players and leading to cannibalism among the passengers. Sorry, it was rugby players. Only rugby players would eat their own! Other than that this is a highly recommended book."},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"I have to admit I love naval stories, especially ones dealing with New England during the 19th century, so I might be a little bit biased, but this tale is one of the best I've read. It's an incredible true story of a Nantucket whaler that gets sunk by an enraged sperm whale, and the struggle for surival by its crew in the harsh open sea. The author does a masterful job of bringing you right into the boat with these men as they sail for land with primitive navagational tools and try to survive three months at sea with the meager rations they've saved from the Essex before it sunk. The author does a nice job weaving all the different narratives that have been written by the surviving crew members into a cohesive story that gives you many divergent views of the action. I also enjoyed learning some of the intricacies of sailing and whaling that the author brought forth in his book. I would recommend this book to anyone interested in a great read."},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"I was impressed with how Mr. Philbrick was able to share just the right amount of detail. When reading the narrative of the canniblaism I was just about to shout, enough! when he stopped. The book flowed well and was never boring. The explanations of whaling and the culture, both in Nantucket and on ship, were well done. The sadness of wrong decisions and how they can have such a devestating affect on others is something many of us can relate to as we make decisions throughout life. I appreciated the Epilogue, but felt the extensiveness of the Notes were unnecessary. It was already evident that much research had gone into this book. This book is certainly not for everyone. those who are looking for a love story will not find it here. It is a true story about people coping in an extreme situation and what they feel they must resort to."},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"What a great book. It's not amazingly written but the story is so engrossing it doesn't matter. I was completely enthralled the whole way through."},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"I have long known of the Essex being rammed and sunk by a big Sperm Whale, but what I knew included nothing of what the crew went through as they drifted for three months in the Pacific.

It completely transported me back to another time. The historical context was so well established, the prose so well-crafted, and the drama so palpable, that I blew through it in a fraction of the time it normally takes for me to get through a book like this. Terrific!"},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"Heart of the Sea is stunningly well written. The prose is smooth as silk, and I might have read this book in a single evening if I had not found myself stopping periodically to re-read and admire a particularly good sentence or paragraph. If you are a writer, published or aspiring, you will appreciate Philbrick's masterful but simple prose. On a larger level, this is a great story well told. In giving this 5 stars, I find myself regretting the many 5 star reviews I have offered up to very good but not great books. This is a great book. A note on the Kindle edition: the maps in the book do not reproduce well on a small ee-ink screen, but are easy to view on Kindle for Ipad or Kindle for PC."},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"This book has haunted me for years....I asked a friend to read it who passed it on, and that friend passed it on, etc. It is an amazing story of the human spirit and the endurance of the body as well as the soul. Read it- you won't regret it."},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"While countless stories and legends exist of survival and endurance, few are quite as remarkable or recorded as eloquently as the tragedy of the Whaleship Essex. Philbrick has a knack for informing without boring in his analysis of the Nantucket community and the whaling industry; a rare and welcome balance especially considering his ability to provide the most minute intricacies if he wished. At its core, this book is a thrilling story of man vs. nature, endurance, and survival. Philbrick tells it through scholarly eyes and the reader is not unfairly subjected to any bias or supposition especially in regard to hypothetical events.The book is centered around the Whaleship Essex and the tragic fate of her men following the dumbfounding attack of a humongous, eighty-five foot sperm whale, sinking the ship and abandoning her men to lifeboats amid the vast Pacific in the early 19th century. The tale of the men's struggle for subsistence is wrenching and fascinating, inclusive of grueling decisions, exhausting endurance, and dilemmas of morality in the men's resort to cannibalism. This is an enlightening tale that is made available to the uninformed reader due to its expert exposition and gripping story. It is a tale so great as to inspire some of the greatest fiction of our time and will even interest those ignorant of shipping and its history. A well written and interesting book."},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"Once again, truth is stranger that fiction. No one could have, would have made this up. It would be too unbelievable on the silver screen or on the small screen....even in the pages of novel---But this did happen.A whale, being pursued, turning on its pursuers and sinking a whale ship!!! Quite a story in its own right, but the crew's efforts to get home safely make it a gripping read.A book that should not be missed. Not only is it a good story, but an educational revealing look at the whaling industry.After reading this, Moby Dick will seem a lot more real than ever thought or imagined...this was Herman Melville's inspiration."},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"You just can't ask for a more riveting tale of survival at sea, and what it means to go beyond the prescribed limits of perserence and will. A first rate read. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"This book not only tells a terrific (and true) story, it is also superbly written with lucid decriptions and an eloquent narrative. Highly recommended. Can't wait to read Nathaniel Philbrick's other books."},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"In the Heart of the Sea was an extraordinary story about bravery, tragedy, and the heart of a small island off the coast of Massachusetts. Philbrick gives a wonderful description of early 19th-century Nantucket Island, providing a rich context for his recount of the tragedy of the whaleship Essex. Not only is this story one of adventure, and of great sadness, it is a unforgettable piece of history. Philbrick gives in-depth sketches of the men from the whaleship, allowing the readers to feel as if they know these men.Superb story, wonderful writing... will not be forgotten."},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"In the Heart of the Sea brings to life early nineteenth century Nantucket and makes it have an impact in our modern world. Upon first glance, I felt as if there would no way for me to connect to these men of a bygone era, but reading their harrowing tale, and seeing the way in which they reacted to the trying circumstances they were caught in, turned this nonfiction account into a real page turner. Philbrick did a wonderful job of making his book read like a best selling thriller, while at the same time keeping the story in perspective, and showing to the reader how all pervasive it was to those who spent their live's in Nantucket. I would advise anyone about to embark upon a study of Melleville's Moby Dick to read this first so they can gain a true perspective on whaling in Nineteenth century America. The only place where Mr. Philbrick's book may have been lacking is in it's conclusion where I think more could have been said about the psychological ramifications of what happened to the crewman of the whaleship Essex. All in all though, In the Heart of the Sea is a harrowing fast paced tale that is sure to remain in the mind's of all those who read it."},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"One of the few books that has really captivated me, In the Heart of the Sea is a masterful reconstruction of the events surrounding the sinking of the whaleship Essex by a peeved whale in the Pacific late in 1820. It was evidently the first--but certainly not the last--such occurence, and was apparently the inspiration for Melville's Moby Dick. Aside from dealing with the sinking and the frightful ordeal that the crew endured in the months following, the book provides the reader with much interesting information on the whaling industry and Nantucket during this era."},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"This true story takes place in the early to middle 1800's and its location on Nantucket Island and in the middle of nowhere..asea. You learn that looking for whales is a group effort and when one is found, a grueling and dangerous activity to land it. The ship Essex was sunk by a whale and that was the inspiration for writing Moby Dick. It is most interesting reading about the survival of a few and how they eventually made it back to land. A pageturner."},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"The book In The heart Of The Sea by Nathaniel Philbrick is an incredible book that that shows how human endurance is able to push the limits to an extreme. This book is about that whale ship the &#65533;Essex&#65533; and its adventure at sea from Nantucket Island to its crash sight and the rescues of stranded men in the Pacific Ocean off of South America. It is written based on the diary of a young sailor, which he keeps over the course of this long adventure. This story not only tells about this large crew of men that after being rammed by the very same whale they had tried to kill, but it also tells about history at this time, and it is a story of human survival at its hardest in desolated and harsh area of the world. It is an intriguing story that will hook readers from the very begging, and not let them go till they are in the boat. In The Heart Of The Sea is an amazing book, and will no doubt keep the attention of readers of most ages and will be one for those who read it to never forget.ByDylan"},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"I don't give even 4 stars lightly, but this is on the order of absolutely essential reading for anyone with the slightest interest in the sea or history in general. The passages dealing with the unimaginable travails of these souls read with a real, visceral impact.Philbrick does a wondrous job of plotting the tale, expertly editing in excerpts from actual journals of several of the men.One of the very few books that I have immediately flipped back to page one and begun reading a second time. I did not want it to end. Has someone bought the movie rights to this yet? If so, please tell me it's not James Cameron..."},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"Quite apart from being a fine narrative of the tragedy of the the whaleship ESSEX, this book is also remarkable for its literary worth. Mr. Philbrick is a very fine writer. This makes all the difference. In the hands of a man of lesser literary sensibility, it would not have turned out half so well, despite the compelling nature of the story. Aside from the authors of Lily Snow and Lolita, have there really been many American writers in the last thirty or forty years WORTH buying, as opposed to borrowing from a library. High questionable, that!"},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"I have read all the accounts of the Essex demise and this book gives balance to both Owen Chase's account and that of Captain George Pollard. I had a hard time putting this book down. One is amazed of what these men did to survive. I will not give away any details but I assure you, you will be mesmerized. I highly recommend this book to anyone who is looking for a tale with the right mixture of history and adventure. Being a regular of Nantucket for the past 30 years, I was enchanted of the accounts of life on the island in its glory years and life on the high seas. A page turner, you will love this book!"},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"This is a fascinating book about how people cope with adversity. The adversity doesn't begin with the sinking of the Essex after being rammed by a whale. It begins almost as soon as the Essex left port months before. Of course after the sinking the going really got tough and eventually survivors were reduced to cannibalism. Although the book is noted for all of that, the author doesn't get the credit he deserves for his complete depiction of the life and times of the people engaged in the whale industry, the industry itself and the community that they left behind. This study of the New England whaling as personified by the officers and crew of the Essex as well as their families waiting at home, the internal politics of their day to day life and how they dealt not only with the challange of survival after being sunk by a whale but also the challenge of the remainder of their lives is really masterful."},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"If anyone thinks that history is dull, read \\"In the Heart of the Sea\\" by Nathaniel Philbrick. This historian has the gift of relating an historic event as if it were a fictional adventure tale. Of course, the event which is the subject of this book, the last voyage of the whale ship Essex, which left Nantucket, Massachusetts, in 1819 on a planned three-year journey to hunt whales in the Pacific Ocean, is an incredible adventure, replete with an angry whale which rams the Essex and sinks it, the journey of the 20 crew members in three small boats, the amazing rescue of some of them, the cannibalism of the survivors who drew lots to select crew members to execute and then eat. Herman Melville used the true story of the sinking of the Essex by an angry 80' sperm whale, as his inspiration for Moby Dick. Along the way, Philbrick provides fascinating details of early 19th century whaling and life in Nantucket. This book was both exciting and informative."},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"Not enough people have read Moby-Dick, and most people know it has something to do with a white whale and a nut called Ahab - oh yeah, and it starts off something like, \\"Call me Ishmael.\\"All the above information is correct but deceptively vague. The final scene in Herman Melville's Moby-Dick involves the whale ship in the novel, the Pequod, being struck head-on by the giant white sperm whale. Some have question whether a whale would be able to do such a thing. In the Heart of the Sea proves this to be true.In the Heart of the Sea by Nathaniel Philbrick is the story about the tragedy of the whale ship Essex, which served as Melville's research for the climactic final scene in Moby-Dick. In 1819 the Essex set sail on a multiple-year journey around the world in search of whale, specifically sperm whales and their rich and expensive oil. Fifteen months later, in the abyssal depths of the South Pacific, a whale rammed the ship head-on. The hull was crippled and the ship quickly sank; all hands managed to escape on their large whaleboats.Twenty men in three boats were set adrift in the world's largest ocean, with little supplies and diminishing hope. Nevertheless, their captain kept his courage: they debated heading west towards the Pacific islands, but feared cannibalism - gruesome details having been brought back from sailors who had sailed through the islands - instead, they struck out east, heading for South America. So began their harrowing journey of starvation, isolation, and madness.Three months later, two boats were discovered, with only eight of the remaining crew. They were found gaunt and nothing but hanging flesh, the bones of their crew lay in the bottom of the boats, having provided a menial cannibalistic feast for the remaining members.\`Tis a story of grave irony: a hardy crew set sail in opposite direction to that way which cannibals lie, ultimate suffering the same fate as their supposed enemies, reduced to consuming the flesh, skin and bone of their fellow seamen. Nathaniel Philbrick does an excellent job of telling this gruesome story in vivid detail and moving narration.Philbrick's research features newly discovered documents on the fate of the Essex, featuring an account by Thomas Nickerson, who was one of the cabin boys on the Essex, discovered in an attic in New York in 1981.The story is shocking, exciting and enthralling - and at the time the reader must constantly reaffirm to themselves that the events within these pages really took place. Nathaniel Philbrick masters at telling a grand story of the high seas with a different ending that excels in every way.Originally published on May 14th 2001 Alex C.

Melville was inspired to write Moby Dick by the events surrounding the whaleship Essex. The Nantucket-based Essex was stove in by a large sperm whale and sunk. The men crowded into whale boats where they spent the next harrowing and thrilling 93 days in the middle of the Pacific Ocean. This true story is quite simply better than fiction.I was completely impressed by Philbrick's narrative. The writing is superb and the book is well researched."},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"Excellent. Non-fiction. Engaging. A survival story, not merely an adventure.The work explains the whaling industry of the 1800s and what was required of the sailors and their families."},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"I learned about the story of the Essex in researching my family history. Captain George Pollard, Matthew Joy and Owen Coffin are all distant relations. Philbrick does an excellent job taking the reader along on this fateful, dark journey. This is a grim, harrowing story and it's hard to read. However, I came away amazed and respectful of the courage these men demonstrated- especially the young Owen Coffin. I also appreciate Philbrick's sensitivity. When things get pretty dismal, Philbrick relieves the reader by interjecting educational explanations for what is happening and why. This book is a must read for anyone interested in Nantucket history, Moby Dick or inspirational stories of human courage and perseverance. The sea is not for the timid!"},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"This is one of my favorite books of all time. The shocking sinking of the Essex (the inspiration for Moby Dick) is only the beginning of what the author turns into a gut-wrenching tale of a handful of sailors desperately trying to stave off starvation, thirst and madness as they try to make it from the middle of the Pacific back to South America. Philbrick's writing is clear, powerful and incredibly engaging. It's a hard book to both put down and get out of your mind after finishing it."},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"Spell-binding story that is well worth the read. Lots of factual information about the history of the whaling industry and how that whole business worked. Good maps and technical treatment of the story.

I just put it down minutes ago after reading it nonstop for 4 days...and only because I had to go to work! This masterfully crafted account of the events surrounding the Essex disaster brings together the facinating story of an unprecendented natural event, the unthinkable disaster it caused, excruciating journey of survival on open water and salvation in its aftermath, all born of a tiny little island and the titanic industry it produced. That any of these men survived this unthinkable disaster is a treatise to the human spirit and will to live. Add this one to your required reading for the beach bag this summer."},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"Did you know that Melville's Moby Dick was inspired by a true story? In the Heart of the Sea recounts the harrowing experiences of the crew of the Essex, a 238-ton Nantucket whaling ship which was attacked and sunk by a lone, angry sperm whale in the middle of the Pacific Ocean in November, 1820. The survivors went on to sail thousands of miles in the open water for months in search of land or rescue as their starved companions died around them. A truly fascinating story of survival and difficult decisions. Winner of the 2000 National Book Award for non-fiction."},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"This is the precursor to Moby Dick, in which a sperm whale sinks a whaling ship. Then the crew must undertake a 3000-mile+ voyage in whaleboats in the Pacific. A grisly story, but it's packed with seafaring lore as well as scientific information about whales, starvation, thirst, and cannibalism. Very informative about 19th century sailing and whaling. A thoroughly satisfying tape."},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"This incredible account of the whaling ship \\"ESSEX\\" is something you will feel and live as you read it line by line. This horrifying account is beyond my wildest imagination as to what these seamen experienced during this voyage. Exceptionally exciting."},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"I was really surprised at how much I enjoyed this book. It's the true story of the 19th century whaleship that was attacked and sunk by a sperm whale, and the 93-day ordeal of the crew fighting to survive (most didn't) in the three small whaleboats. (And of course, the book \\"Moby-Dick\\" was in part based on this event.)I thought the author did a fantastic job of telling the story, and while doing so injected bits of relevant history and science that helps the reader better understand the story and its context. It got me interested in doing additional reading on the whaling industry. (And who knows. . . maybe I'll be able to visit Nantucket someday!)"},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"One of the best books I've read in a very long time. The author Nathaniel Philbrick does an absolutely superb job narrating the tragic tale of the whaleship Essex; not only does he give you an up close view of the ordeal the stranded sailors went through but he also gives a detailed (and interesting) look into the whaling business as well as life on the island of Nantucket in the late 1800s. From beginning to end I was caught up in the story, it would be a true shame if &quot;In the Heart of the Sea&quot; doesn't become a classic and the story of the Essex's crew becomes lost once more in the mists of time."},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"This account of an epic adventure suffered from what I'd call \`reportage'. As I read this exciting book I found myself longing for the enthralling descriptive power of Patrick O'Brian marvelous prose. So imagine my joy in discovering -The Unknown Shore- by O'Brian! The final part of that book is strikingly similar to - In the Heart of the Sea-. O'Brian's masterful capacity to evoke the verisimilitude of his sailor's plight wonderfully enhanced my memory the Essex book. I was so pleased!"},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"I grew up in New England and have visited Nantucket on many occasions. After reading this book my last visit to the whaling museum gave the whalejaws, the harpoons, the whaleboats and other artifacts new meaning.Whaling was an extraordinarily demanding and dangerous endeavor even when the whales were \\"well-behaved.\\" In this story, we have the drama of the Moby Dick theme coupled with a survival story that is amazing in and of itself.I found the writing excellent and the story well told. If readers have a chance to visit a whaling museum it will give the read a bit of an extra punch."},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"What an extraordinary story! I did not know that the whaleship ESSEX was the basis for &quot;Moby Dick&quot;--it is a tremendous story of human hardship and endurance; no wonder Melville was fascinated (as I was). Philbrick brings his knowledge of Nantucket right to the surface. He does not skimp on the realities of whaling; there is a particularly harrowing section on the inevitable starvation and cannabilism and its crew members. Philbrick's writing makes the men sympathetic and come alive for a modern audience unfamiliar with this story. I know that should I ever visit Nantucket, the local whaling museum is the first place I will see."},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"I can honestly say that I am now obsessed with whales. I knew nothing about the whaleship Essex before reading this book. I didn't even really want to read it in the first place, but I was looking for something to read and this was on my father's bookshelf. It is a captivating story. An amazing example of courage and endurance, that is brought to life by the extensive research Philbrick has spent his time accumulating. I loved the way he intertwined old letters, facts, and historical documents with the storyline to tell the true story of the sinking of this famous ship as it was never told before. A VERY interesting story and a great read!"},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"Nathiel Philbrick's superb In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex, deservedly nominated for the National Book Award, looks at the true story which forms the backdrop for Melville's Moby Dick. On November 20, 1820, in the mid-Pacific, Nantucket whaler Essex was rammed repeatedly by a sperm whale, and sank. Over the next several months, the survivors attempted to sail 4,500 miles in open boats to South America. All did not make it, and at least one willingly became food for the others after lots were cast to decide who would be killed to feed the starving remainder. Philbrick ably describes the work of a whaler, and the backbreaking - - and at times terrifying - - tasks of its crew in harpooning and later processing whales at sea. Drawing on many original sources, particularly journals of several survivors, Philbrick convincingly describes what happened to the unfortunate men of the Essex, and places the reader at sea with them. ."},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"After having visited Nantucket many times for summer vacation, this book lends a great view of the historical island in it's real pretext. Although this is one of the most incredible adventure stories I have read, it is gruesome and tragic. The tragedy of the whaling ship Essex, makes Earnest Shakeltons antartic expedition look like a holiday in Bermuda. This book is not for the faint of heart, but it is none the less a miraculous account of human endurance, survival, and courage of the human spirit. It is astounding the adversity that we, as humans, are capable of overcoming. This book also gives quite a bit of insight into the gory world of 19th century whaling. I won't go into detail."},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"If you are looking for a fast read that is not &quot;fluff,&quot; but intellectual and well-written, then pick up a copy of In the Heart of the Sea. I bought the book based upon its topic and the fact that it had won the Book Award, not based upon any interest in the history of whaling or Nantucket. But I left the book feeling that I had ventured into a little part of the past that I would still care to know more about. It's also a great book to read along with Shackelton's story in the book entitlted South. The two books showcase vastly differing outcomes that resulted from decisions made in the face of tragedy at sea."},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"This is one of the best books Ive ever read.

To miss it would be to be missing one of the best stories ever written."},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"Much to my surprise, it is more than a story of a whale that rams a whaling ship out in the Atlantic Ocean and the trials and tribulations of the surviving crew members.This book contains much background history of Nantucket island, the whaling business during the 1800's, the ships that were used to gather whale oil. and the various islands that were visited by the ships during the hunt for the whales!

It was against another book that we also had little interest in. We had never heard of this book and were not looking toward reading a \\"whaling tale\\". Our following meeting was so exciting because we all LOVED it. We were amazed how much we loved it and that too was so exciting.

This is a great read hard to put down. I recommend reading this story"},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"The story of the Essex is interesting to me, and this book fueled that interest and presented it very nicely.

The brutal irony stays with you: the men fearing a closer island said to contain cannibalistic savages and what takes place on those small boats as they try for the longer distance of mainland South America."},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"I read this book immediately after finishing 'Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage'. I thought it would be very similar story as both stories are about expeditions lost at sea. Boy I was wrong! Whereas Shackleton's is a story of triumph in the bitter cold of Antarctica, this is a story of an incredible tragedy in blistering heat of tropical waters. When I was reading the part of the book where crew is incredibly thirsty and hungry I found myself drinking water repeatedly even though I wasn't thirsty. At that moment I felt very lucky to have water to drink! Also, I didn't know anything about whaling history of the 19th century and Nantucket. This was a good history lesson. I highly recommend reading this book. It is a very tragic and engaging true story. You will be thankful for the food and water on your table that you take for granted every day."},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"Excellent read and excellent story.if done right this would be an awesome film.Getting the period right, the ship of the early 1800s, the whale attach and the story of survival -shown realistically and not exploitvily or gratuitious, the whale attack.this is a story begging to be told on the big screen. It would also make more people aware of this story that is, when first told of it, very hard to believe."},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"Like many other reviewers, I found this story to be completely gripping. Yet, I found myself distracted at many times by what I felt was bias on the part of the author. Written in response to the recent discovery of a journal by the cabin boy, Nickerson, Philbrick relies heavily upon this resource. The journal was written in the end of Nickerson's life, and though he claimed to have perfect recall of the events, Owen Chase's accounting of the tragedy, co-written a year after his returns seems more credible, and was supported by the diary he kept while stranded at sea. Nickerson was also 16 at the time of his first, disastrous voyage, and clearly felt bullied by the strict first mate. As a result, Nickerson often appears biased in his recounting of events, a bias which is clearly picked up by the author as well.Nevertheless, the author paints a revealing picture of what the men were experiencing throughout, examining the psychological implications as well the physical disaster. The realities of New England whaling, and how it affected the communities (particularly Nantucket) provide fascinating background information for the story. The book straddles an awkward line between thrilling novel and non-fiction, and the author is never quite able to settle in the right spot. Caveat emptor- some of the more sensational accounts are presented alongside established facts, and little distinction is made between the two. However, the source material is all published, should you choose to investigate further.Despite my misgivings with the book, I feel it garners four stars for sheer entertainment value. Great vacation read, not ideal source for historical accounting, in my opinion."},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"I finally bought this book after seeing it in a store in Newport a few years ago. I felt that the descriptions of whaling practices and historical accounts of events were well placed and well explained. One example, at one point in the book I was thinking that a simple map of the Essex's route from Nantucket to the Pacific would be a nice reference and then a few pages later there was the map. Also, the portrayal of the story by Philibrick was an excellent account of early whaling and early Nantucket. In my opinion, the story of the Essex tragedy is one that should be much better known.I would highly recommend purchasing this book if you are interested in Whaling history or stories of the sea."},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"I actually haven't had a chance to read it yet but I will say that anything by Nathaniel Philbrick has to be very good. More to the point, \\"In the Heart of the Sea\\" did not win the National Book Award for nothing!"},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"Exciting story of survival that will keep you wanting to read more with each chapter. A very well told true story!"},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"This was a very interesting and gripping story. The real life event that inspired Moby Dick this is a survival tale that should not be missed. These men's story are a must read for any interested in survival or ocean going stories."},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"This is easily one of the best books I've ever read. The author provides all the information while getting to the point. You don't read alot of extra mumbo jumbo to get to the good stuff. It dives right in from the beginning and flows right through to the end. It's quick paced but doesn't leave anything out. Some authors tend to give to much info or spend to much time on certain areas, not here. The story is amazing, the events are incredible, the men involved were truly adventurers of the grandest kind. Even if your not into the subject of whaling, maritime adventure, or world history, you would still probably enjoy this book. 5 stars all the way. I've read nothing but non fiction for 12 years and this is in the top 5 if not top 3 of all that I've read. Buy this book if you like a good read!!"},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"This is one of the best books I have ever read. It is difficult to put down and a shame to see it end. Highly recommend.!"},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"As a nonfiction and disaster buff, of course this book caught my eye. This amazing story of survival was made all the better by Philbrick's skill at story-telling. The book is never dull. And he not only describes the shipwreck, but the whaling business and it's culture in detail. With frequent allusions to other shipwrecks and disasters, this story has only piqued my interest."},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"While a lively education in the history and culture surrounding America's fledgling whaling industry and Nantucket's early 19th century Quaker society, at it's heart this is a harrowing and horrific tale of starvation and survival on seas that are anything but \\"pacific\\". The whaleship Essex, 15 months into an expected journey of three years, is head-butted and sunk by a sperm whale, an unprecedented and bizarre attack that inspired Herman Melville's classic \\"Moby Dick.\\" Left at a point in the Pacific that could not be further from land, the twenty crewmembers board three leaky whaleboats with limited food and freshwater. While south Pacific islands to west are more easily reached via the prevailing winds, Captain George Pollard yields to the officers' fears of cannibalistic natives and makes the ill fated decision to tack easterly for the west coast of South America. Some ninety days of searing sun and pounding gales later, the battered, ulcerated, and skeletal survivors miraculously reach a precarious safety, delirious and gnawing like junkyard dogs on the bones of their recently departed shipmates.There is a natural fascination with tales of survival against incredible odds - an especially macabre fascination when survival is dependant on using fellow your travelers for sustenance. Author Philbrick plays this hand well, resisting sensationalism and treating a sensitive and highly emotional topic with dignity and empathy for both the survivors as well as their victims. In prose that is sparse and authoritative, Philbrick spices his story with topics as far ranging as sperm whale anatomy and the physiology and psychology of starvation and dehydration. He succeeds in capturing that rare combination of historical fact that is educational while at the same time as riveting as the best pop thriller. \\"In the Heart of the Sea\\" is a brutal and bloody tutorial of the industry that was the backbone of the US economy, and the risks and sacrifices made by the men who farmed the floating oil fields of the oceans - and of the women they left behind. In short, a gripping slice of American history well researched and compassionately told - a worthy recipient of a National Book Award that shouldn't be missed."},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"This is a first rate, well crafted work of non-fiction. The author has a gift for putting together a compelling narrative about the unusual ordeal of the whale ship, Essex, which sailed out of Nantucket and was done in on the high seas by an extremely aggressive sperm whale who attacked it. So complete was the damage that the ship sank, its crew of twenty cast adrift upon a seemingly infinite ocean to find their way back home in three small boats. This real life, unheard of attack by a whale was the basis for Herman Melville's classic work of fiction, \\"Moby Dick\\".What the author does is ground what happened to these most unfortunate of men in the historical context of the time. He paints a picture of the milieu in which they lived. Their lives were governed entirely by the whaling industry that was the bread and butter for Nantucket Island, the whaling capital of the world.Drawing upon narratives by some of the survivors, as well as other historical data, he paints in intricate detail what life must have been like for these men. He weaves a tapestry of early nineteenth century life on the island of Nantucket and the preeminence of whaling in the lives of those who lived there, as well as the role of the Quakers. In essence, he brings the men, who were involved in this most notorious of survival at sea stories, to life for the reader.It is a balanced narrative. This was to be the first voyage as Captain for the democratic George Pollard, who was teamed up with a very aggressive and ambitious first mate, Owen Chase. This was later to prove to be a poor combination. Nearly a third of the crew was African-American, which was an interesting twist, arising out of the abolitionist views of the Quakers, whose views were the mainstay of Nantucket. Most of the crew was very young, the cabin boy, Thomas Nickerson, being but fourteen years of age.When the Essex was attacked while on the high seas by a gigantic, aggressive sperm whale and destroyed in the process, the story of the what happened to the crew makes for one of the most engrossing and amazing stories of survival ever to be told. Against the odds, eight of them survived their ordeal, which lasted for months. Dehydration and starvation were to drive them to a new frontier of human behavior. That threshold, however, once crossed, was one that would forever haunt those who survived. Their agonizing journey and foray into anthropophagy is chillingly chronicled.This is a riveting and triumphant book. It is a tale richly told by a masterful storyteller, who is able to make this work of non-fiction come to life for the reader. This is simply a great book."},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"Audio Cassette EditionNathaniel Philbrick leaves no stone unturned in this very tragic and complex, but true account of the wreck and sinking of The Whaleship Essex. Rammed by a huge sperm whale, that from all accounts was a definite attack on the ship, the crew, men who lived and profited by the sea and were the slayers of whales for the precious oil provided, were now the victims as the hunted became the hunter. It is an incredible story of man's will to survive against all odds, that was the inspiration for Melville's \\"Moby Dick\\".Philbrick immediately draws you into, not only the lives of the Essex's crew members, but the entire town of Nantucket, from where the ship sailed,detailing the close-knit families, the women's roles and the daily life in Nantucket. Often revealing some very intimate details. The life on board a whaling ship, the hardships of the journey for both the crew and their families, and the journey itself through the vast ocean are all very much a part of this story.You will feel like you have gone back in time to 1820, and are there with them, as the whale attacks the ship, the men nearly frozen by horror and disbelief, and the beginning of a long, horrifying journey,a fight to stay alive under some of the worst conditions imaginable.For thousands of miles, and many months, I was constantly amazed at their ingenuity, and stamina as they tried to find safety, food and water. Steering clear of islands they thought might be inhabited by cannibals, they later found they had to resort to that themselves. Questions still remain as to the actual circumstances that occurred.A handful of survivors left to tell the story, not all agreeing on some points, but enough so that this tragedy at sea and the men who lost their lives as well as those that survived may be remembered for their bravery. Philbrick delves into all the details, from the people involved, to procedures at sea, and even what became of the survivors through the years.The book is so well written, that it will grab you right away and won't let you go. Sometimes you have to keep in mind that this amazing tale is not an adventure novel.The reading of this audio book is excellent as well. Scott Brick sets the tone and captures the importance,the tragic events, and the emotions involved. This unabridged edition has 7 two-sided tapes, each one running about an hour and a half. Most of the second side of tape 6 and all of tape 7 is devoted to notes, journals and resources, which I found to be quite a big help in pointing out other books I may be interested in reading more about. I found the sound quality of this edition to be very good, with an occasional voice heard in the background(not sure if it was an echo or someone else speaking), that in no way interfered with the reading. Sometimes the reviews for all editions of a book are lumped together on the product page. If you are interested in this audio edition the ISBN, or ASIN(listed on the product details) is 0736655042.A book that will certainly get read again and again. Highly recommended read for anyone, but for those who love tales of the sea...an excellent account of a tragic storyEnjoy the read.....Laurie"},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"A great story of endurance and survival after the loss of the Essex. The book gives a great character insight into the individuals involved , the Nantucket whaling industry and the ends to which some people will stoop to survive, including devouring your own nephew. Interestingly the relative acceptibilty of cannabilism, after the drawing lots was the greatest puzzle. Very interesting tale."},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"This is an NYT bestseller and Nat'l Book Award winner. You'll know the kudos are well deserved after reading. Nathaniel Philbrick does an excellent job in recreating the Nantucket whaling industry, the ship Essex and the terrible tragedy which befell it.It is the best of writing and history when the old becomes new again, the past comes alive, the unknown becomes familiar. Apparently, the story of the Essex was well known in the early 1800s and it may have formed the basis of Melville's epic Moby Dick. Somewhere all that got lost to history but Philbrick gives it a heartbeat again.The research is scrupulous. The narrative flows easily and avoids becoming pedantic, while still imparting rich detail. The book is just the right size for a quick read but the emotion and the gripping scenes of life and death will stay with the reader. The ordeal is palpable and fascinating.If you like this story, I recommend Mutiny on the Globe by Thomas Heffernan, a whale ship story of the same period."},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"An absolute stunner ,beginning with the history of whaling in Nantucket, an island settled by Quakers in the 1600's. Though 1 or 2 other reviewers suggest the meanness of the crew, I would state that, given the horrendous circumstances, all 18 showed a great degree of comraderie. Traveling through the Atlantic and Pacific ocean with a few stops in S. America and the Galapagos, their ship is attacked by sunk an angry whale, who may have sought revenge for the whaler's attacks on his fellow sperm whales. Splitting into 3 groups in small whaling boats, the survivors do everything feasible to stay together and stay alive, though 3 (smart ones) decide to remain on the proverbial desert island. while others continue their awe-inspiring voyage. If cannibalism repels you, as it does us all, here is a situation where this beastliness was actually condoned. All in all, a great book, destined to be a classic!"},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"The Heart of the Sea...A sad but exciting story. One of the best books I've read. Sometimes it was hard to read through the grewsome canibalism the shipwrecked crew had to resort to, the days when they were weaker than a baby at birth, and the despair of being in the middle of the ocean with nothing but salty hardtack bread, some tortoises, and half a pint of water a day. It is an amazing story of loyalty, survival, belief, and strength.Anyone who reads this should be a little over 13 years old. It is graphic, grewsome, and a very mature story for some people who cannot handle torture, canibalism, blood, and tension.This book was very well done and Nat Philbrick did a very good job combining the story from several survivor's journals. He put it together well, and even though there was no dialoge, he gets the story down well. Almost every man on the Essex had a part in the survival of the crew. This event and tradegy is extremely worthy of recognition, especially on Nantucket Island, the homeland of mant men on the Essex. This is an AWESOME story of the men who survived 90 days on the sea."},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"This is an amazing book. Initially, it comes across as sort of a spin-off on books like \\"Into Thin Air\\" and \\"The Perfect Storm\\" -- both of which Mr. Philbrick has acknowledged as inspirations -- but I actually think \\"Into the Heart . . .\\" surpasses both, particularly in the depth of feeling this book inspires. All the elements of a great adventure story are here: life on the high seas, tragedy at sea, cannibalism, rescue after months at sea in small whaling boats, and so on. But the author trascends the obvious, and renders the participants in this tragedy as fully believable, three-dimensional human beings even though the incidents described in thebook took place almost 200 years ago. A couple of seasons ago, NBC TV managed to make a fairly dull documentary based on this book, which may have dissuaded a few potential readers. If so, it's very unfortunate because \\"In the Heart of the Sea\\" is a very, very well-written and very moving story."},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"Nat Philbrick's book created much interest in this fascinating episode in American whaling history. It is a strange and almost impossibly unhappy story, but Mr Philbrick leaves all participants, even those that decided to violate our greatest taboo by eating dead crewmen, with dignity. The book is simply a great read."},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"True life experiences can be even more fantastic than any fiction available. This is certainly the case with In the Heart of the Sea. I am in agreement with the other reviewers who just could not put this book down for a minute. At times this book is fascinating and at times horrifying! This is more than an exciting true-life adventure, it is a great history lesson about the Nantucket culture. What is also really interesting can be found in the epilogue which relates the experience of a sperm whale that had washed ashore. Heartbreaking as it was, it was truly an amazing lesson of the strength of the whalemen on those small ships when modern man took a leap back in time! It also pointed to the amazing, and complicated make-up of the sperm whale, a creature that is to be respected for it's power and grace.On another note, for pure light-reading and for entertainment value only, I recommend reading Savages, by Shirley Conran. It is about several women fighting for survival on an island with cannibal tribes and guerilla warfare. It also depicts survival at sea with some accuracy.Read In the Heart of the Sea for yourself and learn something about the character of the Nantucket whalemen. You certainly won't be disappointed with this book."},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"In the Heart of the Sea author Nathaniel Philbrick has managed to write not only an engrossing account of 19th century maritime tragedy, but he also reminds us of the roots of our culture and its ancient connections. Here we see the hunter gatherer male in archetype, drawing on his reserves of cunning and stamina, eerily reminiscent of his cave dwelling ancestors. Women left for two years at a time, empowered socially, economically and sexually, as only their American daughter's nearly two centuries later will be. Raw American capitalism, with its emphasis on risk and reward, where the wealthy minimize their risk, and human labor is merely a commodity to be managed. Christian faith distorted into a communal ethos, based on mans greed versus the Almighty's creed. A caste system of class, race and birthplace, whose fates conspire to determine those who would live and who would perish. Man's arrogance and abrogation of nature, his sense of dominion and omnipotence overturned by the leviathan he pursues. More than a page turning epic, this book casts long shadows into who we are as an American people. We see our modern age, playing out in many of the themes that echo in the chapters of Philbrick's masterpiece."},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"Like many other reviewers, I couldn't put this one down. This is a gripping tale of survival in the face of terrible circumstances, and also an interesting history lesson on the whaling port of Nantucket. I really felt sorry for the crew lost at sea in those tiny boats, dealing eventually with cannabalism, the very fate they sought to avoid by the Captain's poor navigational decision. As moved as I was by this particular crew's fate, I was even more moved by Philbrick's description of life on a whaling ship. How miserable! And doing that for two years at a time for miserable wages!! When I think my job sucks, I think of those poor sailors trying out a whale on the deck of that small ship in the dark, and I immediately feel better."},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"The first chapter didn't grab me. By the time I finished the second chapter only a &quot;knockdown&quot; could have gotten the book away from me. I read it in a day and then read the notes. Well done, Mr. Philbrick, you brought to life the people of Nantucket who lived as my sea-going ancestors from Maine must have done. You made it so real we could smell the fog, feel the salt and heat, and weep for the decisions made under stress. The weaving of salient facts with the on-going narrative are effortless. This is a never-to-be-forgotten book. Thanks."},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"I'm not a fisherman or do I have much interest in boats, the ocean, etc. My brother-in-law recommended this book and I cannot use enough superlatives to describe what an enjoyable book this is. The historical details are intriguing and the story of the ill-fated whaling voyage is truly riveting. Even though you know how it ends, the story is so engrossing that I read this in a matter of days. Bring it to the beach, I guarantee you will not be disappointed."},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"I am only about 2/3 through this book, but just have to say it is the most rip-roaring adventure book I have ever read! It is full of information about the early 1800s, the whaling industry, the sea, and about whales that I have never known. It is all fascinating! Although I am a girl (ahem!), I am loving every word of this book, as I also loved THE ENDURANCE and INTO THIN AIR and A FIRST RATE TRAGEDY recently, not to mention TARZAN, FRANKENSTEIN, etc. from years back. This book is highly recommended whether you fancy yourself an adventurer (armchair adventurers okay) or not."},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"I can't imagine what I'd do if I was placed in the situation described in this book - adrift at sea and casting lots to see whom would be eaten and whom would be spared, but In The Heart of the Sea does a good job of describing the dire circumstances and letting the individual reader make his or her own judgment as to the necessity of the acts.This book reminded me of two other books that I enjoyed.First, the detail on the ships and the whaling industry reminded me of The Perfect Storm and its detailed discussion of the swordfishing industry. This historical background information In the Heart of the Sea is helpful because it allows the reader to better understand the culture of the industry and the reasons why workers were placed in such appalling straits.The second book that is worth reading is The Custom of the Sea, which came out a few months ago. The Custom of the Sea centers on a shipwreck where three survivors killed and ate a fourth crewmember who was already dying of dehydration. In a breach from ordinary legal tradition, these survivors were tried for murder and Custom of the Sea does a very nice job of presenting the societal questions underlying the murder prosecution. In the Heart of the Sea does not explore these issues in the same depth, but both books are worth reading."},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"Here is all you need to know so as not to spoil the story:1.

It's amazing as many people before can tell you. You will not regret this book. IF you do not like this book you have my personal garuantee that you are a simple and prudish person that has no buisness reading.This book will haunt you."},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"In November 1820 the Nantucket whaleship Essex was attacked by an angry spermwhale, 1,500 miles off the coast of Peru. This is the true story that inspired Melville to write Moby Dick. After the Essex sank, the 20 crew members took to the open seas of the central Pacific in three whale boats. In the Heart of the Sea is a historian's account of the Nantucket whaling industry, the personalities of individuals, the destruction of the Essex and the three-month open-boat journey plagued by thirst, hunger, cannibalism, and bad management decisions. The book reads as smoothly as any novel yet is backed up by the authority of years of research by a historian specializing in Nanctucket Island (off the Cape Cod peninsula in Massachusetts)."},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"If you liked Endurance about explorer Ernest Shackelton, you will LOVE this book too. The added pleasure of this book is the rich lesson in American and Nantucket history and early American culture- both the human history and the wonderful and tragic history of the great sperm whale.

Were there no other books entered in this category?This is my second Nathaniel Philbrick book (Mayflower - being the first), and I was very disappointed with it. I knew that the author likes to throw his opinion as historical fact, but it wasn't as clear in Mayflower as it is in this book. It is obvious that Philbrick is mostly taking a couple of written diaries (as there are only two or three written accounts) and he milks them as much as possible. That would be okay, but the constant references to other shipwrecks and disasters that have no bearing on this one bored the snot out of me. Also, his constant reminder that the Donner party ate themselves (being chronologically after the time of this book) really should not have been included for any reason.Philbrick took a short story and tried desperately to turn it into a longer one. At that he was successful. The expansion of the thought process of the shipwrecked victims made it sound as if the author talked to them and put down all of their thoughts. Since we know that he did not, it was overkill and misplaced in an historical nonfiction book.The number of references to things that had no bearing on the story, reminds me of a high school term paper and you need to have \\"X\\" number of references and therefore you make sure that the people reading it know that you had \\"X\\" number of references.It is an interesting story, but not very well written. The last two chapters are a ramble of things that mean nothing to the storyline."},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"The detail of this book is wonderful. I started off reading this with little sympathy for the Quakers, by the end of the book my feelings had changed a little bit. Good information about all aspects, Quaker life on the island, the business of whaling, and what happens to the human body and soul under such extreme conditions."},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"I enjoyed this book.

The writing pales in comparison to Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage by Alfred Lansing."},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"This book is no doubt an incredibly well researched account of the story behind the Essex. However, it was very dry and I couldn't connect with the people aboard the ship! This made it very hard for me to have any emotions at all while I was reading, and therefore made this book less enjoyable for me! I would only recommend this book to you if you are interested in the story behind the Essex (which, as I said, is very well researched and detailed!) and not in the emotions!"},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"This is a gripping, chilling, interesting, true story of the sinking of the Essex whaleship. I think you can spot some thematic material and symbols waiting to be created from this story in a work of fiction. Herman Meliville did and Philbrick's book makes a good pre-reading to &quot;Moby Dick&quot;.The beginning and the ending I found to be boring and dry. Those sections contain more of the historical backround and afterword.It is a great story of survival and endurance- testing the limits of the human body and psyche. If you liked this book, I recommend the book &quot;Hatchet&quot; which is also a survival story, altough a fictional one. In the Heart of the Sea is much like the sea survival stories of &quot;Jaws&quot; and the &quot;Perfect Storm&quot; so I don't think there is anything special about this book."},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"There were some fascinating facts included in this book for people like myself (non-mariners!) who have never read Moby Dick. The code of \\"drawing lots\\" to see who will sacrifice themselves for the group; the lives of whalers and life in Nantucket during the whaling times; sperm whales as the source of energy (oil!) before the time of oil wells; the description of how a whale is parted out and the pecking order on a whaling ship.However. It took me three tries to read this book; I had nearly given up and the only thing that made me persevere was the book had been loaned to me by a friend and I was loathe to NOT finish reading it. The beginning of the book does not capture one's interest right away...I kept falling asleep. Finally, 2 months later, I finished the book. Let's just say that the book is not of the \\"could not put it down\\" variety, at least for me. But it did impart some interesting knowledge and provide food for thought.There were too many author opinions (regarding discrimination and fates of the blacks aboard the Essex) not to mention all the irrelevant information (the sperm whale that washed up on Nantucket in the late 1990's). That is why I believe it only deserves 2 stars."},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"The title of my review says it all. I've ordered a lot of books from Amazon sellers, so I know how long it takes for a book to arrive. The book was in good enough shape, but it took weeks - weeks - to arrive."},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"I purchased the paperback version instead of the Kindle version because it was $5 less from Amazon. That is the reason for removing one star. I have just started reading the book and appears to be worth the read hence the 4 stars."},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"This may be, with the exception of Doris Kearns Goodwin's equally compelling but more familiar TEAM OF RIVALS, the most moving and thrilling and sagacious nonfiction book I've read. It lacks NOTHING, you are with the whale men all the way, and there is education of whaling itself to boot. I love a book that tells me a thrilling story, all the more exciting for its having actually happened, and teaches me as well. I learned, for example, the great extent to which Nantucket was responsible for the whaling industry in the world. I learned how a whale is \\"taken\\" and reduced to its blubber/oil. I did not cringe any the less for knowing it; far from it, in fact. I felt, as many of the Essex crew began to feel, that what happened to them was, if not divine retribution for wholesale slaughter of an entire species, at least poetic justice. Yet, Philbrick allows his reader their own intelligence to decide. It's an adventure story par excellence, and can be read on that level alone. But what a story! Eclipsed by the Titanic story decades later, this was a marine disaster the likes of which still has the power to show us both the tragedies man brings on himself by attempting to tangle with Nature, and the power and reslience of the human spirit to survive. Altogether, a powerful and highly recommendable read."},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"This is a first rate, well crafted work of non-fiction. The author has a gift for putting together a compelling narrative about the unusual ordeal of the whale ship, Essex, which sailed out of Nantucket and was done in on the high seas by an extremely aggressive sperm whale who attacked it. So complete was the damage that the ship sank, its crew of twenty cast adrift upon a seemingly infinite ocean to find their way back home in three small boats. This real life, unheard of attack by a whale was the basis for Herman Melville's classic work of fiction, \\"Moby Dick\\".What the author does is ground what happened to these most unfortunate of men in the historical context of the time. He paints a picture of the milieu in which they lived. Their lives were governed entirely by the whaling industry that was the bread and butter for Nantucket Island, the whaling capital of the world.Drawing upon narratives by some of the survivors, as well as other historical data, he paints in intricate detail what life must have been like for these men. He weaves a tapestry of early nineteenth century life on the island of Nantucket and the preeminence of whaling in the lives of those who lived there, as well as the role of the Quakers. In essence, he brings the men, who were involved in this most notorious of survival at sea stories, to life for the reader.It is a balanced narrative. This was to be the first voyage as Captain for the democratic George Pollard, who was teamed up with a very aggressive and ambitious first mate, Owen Chase. This was later to prove to be a poor combination. Nearly a third of the crew was African-American, which was an interesting twist, arising out of the abolitionist views of the Quakers, whose views were the mainstay of Nantucket. Most of the crew was very young, the cabin boy, Thomas Nickerson, being but fourteen years of age.When the Essex was attacked while on the high seas by a gigantic, aggressive sperm whale and destroyed in the process, the story of the what happened to the crew makes for one of the most engrossing and amazing stories of survival ever to be told. Against the odds, eight of them survived their ordeal, which lasted for months. Dehydration and starvation were to drive them to a new frontier of human behavior. That threshold, however, once crossed, was one that would forever haunt those who survived. Their agonizing journey and foray into anthropophagy is chillingly chronicled.This is a riveting and triumphant book. It is a tale richly told by a masterful storyteller, who is able to make this work of non-fiction come to life for the reader. This is simply a great book."},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"In 1820 the whaleship Essex of Nantucket, shipping a vacillating captain and a headstrong first mate, was attacked by a sperm whale in the Pacific Ocean. For three months, crewmen survived in open boats, until a handful of survivors finally washed up in Chile. &quot;In the Heart of the Sea&quot; is a fascinating introduction to the nineteenth century whaling industry and a peek at the clannish Quaker community that was Nantucket island.The story of the Essex inspired Herman Melville to write &quot;Moby Dick&quot;, and perhaps the elements that Melville magnified are the most powerful part of the tale - the personalities of the officers. Philbrick carefully explains the social significance attached to being a Nantucketer versus an off-islander as well as the importance of intricate old-family ties in the whaling industry. Set against this context we have Captain Pollard, a courageous if weak commander, and first mate Owen Chase, a daring officer whose command skills improved as he shared the suffering of the men in the small whaleboats - though he was the one to convince Pollard to make the disastrous mistake of sailing eastward in the tiny boats.As much as this is an introduction to whaling and a rousing sea tale, it is a story of contrasting personalities. Men at sea live and die by the quality of their commanders, and in the story of the Essex we see them do just that."},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"Mr. Philbrick has accompished the greatest of acheivements, that being a historical novel which makes you feel as if you, the reader were floating on the sea with the survivors of the whaleship Essex. (Pardon the run-on sentence :-). This is not only a book for all ages, it is one FOR the ages. To say I was overwhelmed and taken aback would be a terrible understatement on my part.This ripping tale of 1800's whaling is a modern masterpiece that in my opinion, should be required reading for all high school students. I do fear however that Hollywood will intervene at a point in the near future and attempt to re-tell this tale. I would suggest any reader captivated by &quot;In the Heart of the Sea&quot; to view a History Channel presentation of History Lost &amp; Found, The Essex. I believe we should not do diservice to the lives of these brave men by putting a Hollywood spin on their story. (Mr Philbrick might disagree as the royalties could prove quite lucrative). Let us leave this history where it belongs, through the pages of a book. In this readers' opinion, this book, in particular is the best place to start your education of the subject. Fabulous, Stunning reading and I will guarantee a &quot;one-sitting&quot; finishing!"},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"Nathanial Philbrick's new book contains a story of high adventure with all the right ingredients of adventure, danger and triumph. It is also a story firmly grounded in reality and the account contains many aspects (such as cannibalism and the thinly concealed social politics) that raise the book above being another page-turner.Coming from England I was familiar with Shackleton's similar experience almost a century later and had thought that that was probably the ultimate adventure at sea but this account far surpasses that. The different social make-up of the Essex's survivors makes the whole adventure very different, and indeed it is used very effectively as a vehicle to examine the structure of the whaling society of the time. The combined stranglehold of class and religion upon the society of the time is well illustrated.Overall, the book is suprisingly short. It packs a lot of detail into its pages but has left me wanting more. It's given me an appetite for reading about the life and times of sailing ships and their crews that I'm sure to follow up."},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"This story of the sinking of the Nantucket whaleship Essex is fascinating on several levels. Rammed by an apparently angry sperm whale, the crew spends months sailing in small whaleboats seeking safe haven. They resort to cannabalism to survive--first eating the dead, but later drawing lots to decide who is to die. Along the way, the author describes life in Nantucket in the early 1800s, how whaleships were organized, the capturing and exploiting of whales, why whaleships took two and three year tours into the Pacific, and why whale oil made ship owners so rich. But in the end, the cannabalism, and the reaction of Nantucket society to it, is the focus of the story. Written in easy-to-read prose, it makes for quick summer reading."},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"I found this book to be a fascinating look at the decisions people make in real life that lead to unintended consequences, or, in this case, to the actual consequences they feared the most. The author's descriptions of the Nantucket life style and insular home situations show how they men managed to hang together in even the direst of circumstances. The descriptions of whaling make this a real true life \\"Moby Dick\\" story. The author puts us in the boat with the whalers and in the end we understand the decisions each man took, whether it was: to abandon the boat for an island, to die of starvation, to draw straws, to eat their fellow humans. The line between what makes a person a human or an animal is explored in an insightful and compassionate way. Well Done, I hope I have written as well about the changes on youth caused by warfare in my own book \\"Rough Enough\\"."},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"This is my second Nathaniel Philbrick book, the first being \\"Mayflower\\" and I believe he is a fantastic storyteller. I could not put this book down and I look forward to his next. Philbrick does his homework with extensive research. He not only entertains, but he educates as well. If the reader is interested in a great story, an outstanding history lesson and total entertainment, this is the book! Would love to see it made into a movie."},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"This is how history should be written! Philbrick's account of the tragedy of the Essex is gripping, vivid, and painstakingly researched. Not only does Philbrick cover the events that led to the sinking of the ship, but he gives you the necessary background on the whaling trade, the epoch, and the personalities of the crew, so the reader can completely understand the context of the event. Philbrick writes with an authority and an ease which will keep you turning the pages far into the night.The story of the Essex was as well known in the 19th century as the Titanic in the 20th. (Melville's famous novel, Moby Dick, was based on the Essex.) Due to a series of mishaps, the Essex found itself in less than perfect condition when it was rammed by a whale in the middle of the Pacific. It was not long before the ship sank, leaving its crew members crowded on two few whaleboats, with scant provisions. What followed was a decision that was mind-boggling in its stupidity. Instead of allowing the crosswinds to take them to the Polynesian Islands, they decided to make their way to Chile. (The crew was afraid of encountering cannibals, which was ironic given the outcome of their voyage.) In spite of their best efforts, the winds eventually blew the boats to Polynesia. Now came their biggest mistake. In true, pig-headed Nantucket fashion, they STILL tried to cross the Pacific, a voyage of several thousand miles. What followed was predictable--they ended up eating one another. By the time they were rescued, the survivors of the Essex made a horrifying sight, \\"their beards caked with blood...sucking on the marrow from the bones of their dead shipmates.\\"Several things stood out from this account. One was the degree to which the whaling trade dominated American life in the mid-18th century. Whale oil was the petroleum of the 19th century, which meant whalers exerted enormous economic influence. Another was the degree to which cannibalism was resorted to after shipwrecks. (It was so common that when sailors were rescued, they felt compelled to make a declaration if they had NOT eaten one another.) The last was the undeniable fact that the enormous whale which sank the Essex didn't accomplish this feat by accident. The whale chose the weakest spot of the ship to ram, then backed up, increased its speed and rammed the boat again. It was very clear that it intended to kill the ship, and that it knew how. One cannot help but be impressed.This is an account that will stay with you. If I were teaching American history, I would make it required reading."},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"I thought this book was great. It is a quick read that keeps you interestd until the end. You feel like you are right there with the men on the boat as you read the hardships they had to endure. The most amazing part of the story is the fact it is true."},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"I happened to see this book at the local library and being a fan of Herman Melville's \\"Moby Dick\\", I picked it up. The tragic fate of the whaleship Essex and it's crew was the inspiration for 'Moby Dick\\" and I was riveted by the account here from beginning till the end.Author Nathaniel Philbrick [who also wrote \\"Mayflower\\"] brings this historical account to life, portraying a bygone era where whaling was an important industry and paints a vivid portrait of the lives of whalers. The account basically focuses on the years 1819-1821 and tells the story of the whaling ship, Essex, which was based on Nantucket Island. Though perceived to be a lucky ship, the Essex suffered a tragic fate when it was rammed and sunk by a raging giant sperm whale. To read this after reading \\"Moby Dick\\" made me truly appreciate the perils suffered by the crew of the whaling ship. In essence, this is not just a historical account but also a tale of desperation and survival. The author writes with an assured hand and chronicles the survival tactics employed with such graphic detail and imagery. The mass starvation and acts of cannibalism resorted to by desperate men makes for an excruciating and unforgettable read. Anyone who has ever wondered about the inspiration for Herman Melville's story of Moby Dick should read this."},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"The Essex was a whaling ship that was attacked and sunk by a sperm whale in the middle of the Pacific Ocean. Accounts of this tragedy inspired Herman Melville to write Moby Dick. The story of the voyage, sinking and , struggle for survival of the crew is deftly handled and well told by Nathaniel Philbrick. He has written a book with broad appeal by infusing the story with just the right amount of historical and social background not to distract from the narrative of what was a truly harrowing survival tale.Very well done."},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"Well, once I started, I couldn't put it down. My word. It was pretty grisly in parts, but really compelling. The author did a great job of following all the survivors, mapping out where the were (3 were on an island, and of the 3 boats, 2 were rescued--after some people died), and it was very easy to read. I also liked the author's comments on leadership and so forth. Recommended w/ the caveat that there are some descriptions about sad animal stories + lots o' cannibalism. (I didn't know if it was really necessary to describe what it's like to eat someone who has starved to death, but then the author is also a scholar and why would he lighten up in this area?)"},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"I heard this story on audio tapes when hospitalized.

This is a fictionalized account of a historical maritime event which took place in 1820. Starting in Nantucket Island, the whaling capital of the world, the story recounts the happenings of a whale-ship commanded by Captain George Pollard Jnr up until the ship was rammed by a 85 foot long sperm whale in the Western Pacific. The surviving men sailed 4500 nautical miles south-east to be saved by other ships on the Chilean coast. They spent a total of 93 days with little fresh water and dried bread in the baking sun of the Equator. Reduced to cannibalism, the book charts their slow and inevitable decline into madness and eventual death; of the twenty two men who set out originally only 5 returned home.In its time this story captured the imagination of millions, the vicious and revengeful spirit of the whale wrecking havoc on its persecutors, and driving them to wander the desolation of the burning waves of the ocean. This was the account which inspired the \`Moby Dick' of Herman Melville, and numerous poems and epics. The extraordinary thing I found out was that the Nantucket whalers were all Quakers, usually a people much committed to peace and ideals of harmony, once they set sail their demeanor became that of bloodthirsty and savage hunters... eager for killing!Philbrick presents and amazing and accurate portrait of the American society barely 30 years after the revolution. Nantucket itself was a harbor for runaway slaves seeking employment, and were to all records of the time accorded due respect and dignity. However the native Wampanoags gradually diminished in numbers over the years. It is difficult to objectively view past historical events such as these, without resorting to modern systems of morals and ethics. Certainly it is absolutely horrifying that our ancestors very nearly exterminated an entire species of (magnificent) creature, their motive was purely the accumulation of wealth, and in the final analysis one wonders what it was all about; the average life a sailor was absolutely miserable, hard in aspects which are well beyond our appreciation and the ultimate rewards merely dust blowing in the wind.This book certainly gives some food for thought, and I highly recommend it to anyone with a slight interest in history, touching as it does on an active part of the industrial revolution occurring throughout the world at that time. Perhaps the most fascinating aspect of this book is the investigation of human psychology when placed within an extreme survival context, an environment which lends itself to the most bizarre and barely imaginable actions. And for those who tend thoughts of hunger and thirst, I ask them to read this book first and then complain!"},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"This book is a wonderfully written true tale of the disaster of the whaleship Essex. This crew of Nantucketers and off-islanders endured the most horrible adventure at sea. An enourmous Sperm Whale rams the boat and sends these men into a 90-day whirlwind of starvation, dehydration, delusion, despair, insanity, death, and eventual recovery. The way Nathaniel Philbrick depicts every aspect of their hellish journey puts you at the helm. I highly recommend this book for those who want to know what REALLY happened to the crew of the whaleship Essex back in the early 19th century, and how Melville was inspired to write his famous novel \\"Moby Dick\\"."},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"WOW -- what a journey. This is much more than a true story of a nasty encounter with a mad whale. It is the story of life; the unexpected encounters, the nature of alternative responses, the internal dissentions, the struggle for power, and all that we endure in life.

I think I read the last 1/3 of it without putting it down.Highly recommended. You will learn a lot about whaling and Nantucket, both of which I surprisingly found captivating."},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"A very good story, but as the whalers were slaughtering every whale in sight and dragging the giant Galapagos turtles into their mess halls for dinner, I was cheering for the whales."},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"The tragic story of the Whaler &quot;Essex&quot; supposedly inspired Mellville to Pen &quot;Moby Dick&quot;, though I'd suspect that the tales of the crew of Essex only rose above a well founded lore of a precarious trade. In &quot;Heart&quot;, we are told not only of the Essex, but also of the contemporary whaling industry. Centered in Northeast America, about as far from the whaling waters of the Pacific as you can get, the Whalers would sail around Tiera Del Fuego in South America in search of their prey. But author Philbrick also shows us the people, the staunchly pious Quakers who financed the trade and, holding with their abolitionist views, crewed their ships with emancipated slaves. The insecurities of the pious would be a great explanation for why whalers ported so far from their hunting grounds, although the lack of any comparable industrial base in contemporary California (and the inability to transfer there) would be a more practical explanation. Philbrick doesn't really explore that issue. Instead, he shows us the crew of the Essex on the hunt and then, in a sudden reversal, tossed to the sea when a rogue sperm whale rams their ship and sinks it. Not quite the prey, the Essex's crew are now helpless in the middle of an ocean from which they plundered. The sea knows no heroes, but it recognizes acts of cruelty, and even the crews' morality of equality (which will play a role when the nation goes to war against itself 40 years down the line) seems to go down with the ship when the specter of cannibalism arises. Incredibly, this tale - whose ending is ofcourse a foregone conclusion - is an incredible page turner."},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"When I started to read this book, I discovered that it was more than a whaleship's wreck story. It talks about the leadership of one man (Owen Chase) and the weakness of another: Pollard, Jr. I couldn't put it down. The author is extremely precise in all facts and the narrative is well-written. I recommend."},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"This true story of the whaleship Essex caught and held my attention as I read through it as quickly as I could. Even though non-fiction, it reads like an adventurous novel---a much better read than Moby Dick.The author includes the historical context and taps several sources to provide details about the tragedy, as well as the whaling industry.I think this book has what it takes to appeal to all readers. It is insightful, reavealing, entertaining and suspenseful while being entirely unique.My wife and I both read it within a week and highly recommend it."},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"Herman Melville's &quot;Moby Dick&quot; is a novel far more widely praised than read. Those of us who have cracked the covers on this daunting work have more often than not become utterly entranced with its detailed depiction of the whale trade at its apogee. One could not help but wonder how Melville, no mean sailor himself, had managed to create a world as deep as the sea which inspired it.The answer has arrived with Nathaniel Philbrick's &quot;In the Heart of the Sea.&quot; The Nantucket whaleship Essex and the misfortunes which befell it following its encounter with an enraged sperm whale in the trackless Pacific Ocean inspired Melville's timeless novel.Whereas &quot;Moby Dick&quot; reaches its climax with the destruction of the Pequod by the great white whale, the suffering of the men of the Essex begins here, stranded thousands of miles from hospitable land with meager provisions in boats suited only for short jaunts. Their tale of perseverance, survival, and redemption rivals that of the Wedding Guest in Coleridge's &quot;Rime of the Ancient Mariner.&quot;If the recent success of the blockbuster movie &quot;Castaway&quot; has whet your appetite for stories of epic struggle for survival, you will devour &quot;In the Heart of the Sea.&quot;If, on the other hand, you follow the outgoing President's habit of purchasing books because they look nice on the shelf and impress down-on-their-luck former beauty queens, I should point out that the jacket of this book is quite attractive and may suit your tastes as well."},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"I was impressed with how Mr. Philbrick was able to share just the right amount of detail. When reading the narrative of the canniblaism I was just about to shout, enough! when he stopped. The book flowed well and was never boring. The explanations of whaling and the culture, both in Nantucket and on ship, were well done. The sadness of wrong decisions and how they can have such a devestating affect on others is something many of us can relate to as we make decisions throughout life. I appreciated the Epilogue, but felt the extensiveness of the Notes were unnecessary. It was already evident that much research had gone into this book. This book is certainly not for everyone. those who are looking for a love story will not find it here. It is a true story about people coping in an extreme situation and what they feel they must resort to."},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"Don't see how anyone wouldn't give this book 5 stars.

This story in the 1800s was an inspiration for Melville to write Moby Dick. I think he (Philbrick) does a great job of finding the right balance of historical perspective, biography of those involved, technical aspects of the whaling business, and the human interst of the tale itself. It is an enlightening read which becomes a real page turner. I read this book and Da Vinci Code in the same summer. This book is better. It is far more interesting and held my interest and never let go which could in par be because I find tales of real life to be always more inspiring/interesting than fiction."},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"I love this vein of books.

Early in the Islands history the Island was supposed to be a place to herd Livestock. Every year whales came to there Island because it was were they naturally migrated. So a man decide to hunt these whales. The whales he hunted were Right Whales. The whale was called this because it had good oil so this is how the Island became a whaling Island. Then one day a whaling ship killed a Sperm Whale. This whale had more and better oil so the Island started to hunt these whales. The journeys the whalers took to hunt these whales first lasted from 6-9 months then they lasted from 3-4 years. The whaleship Essex had a crew of about 20-25. This ship traveled from Nantucket which is off the coast of Boston, Massachusetts to down and around South America up past the Galapagos Islands. Then about a 1000 miles of the coast of the Galapagos Islands the ship was rammed by a Sperm Whale. This is the first recorded case of a whale ramming a ship. All the men got off the boat and onto the lifeboats. They had a long and tough journey to get to South America. A few men die but the rest of them make it South America alive. The people that died on the way to South America were eaten by the other crew members in order to survive the Journey.After you read a the summary of the book that I wrote you should want to read it. I wanted to read it because it was a exciting adventure book. I like most people love great adventure stories. So if you like exciting stories you should read this one."},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. I couldn't put it down. It is an intense thrill by thrill account of a harrowing 90 day ride and for those who survived, an epic event they would likely want to have left out at sea. Well worth your time."},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"Being the ardent land lover that I am, I tended to stay away from books of the nautical variety until the day I picked up Nathaniel Philbrick's gem In the Heart of the Sea. I can say without any hesitation this is one of the best nonfiction books I have read, period.In the Heart of the Sea relates the story of the ill-fated voyage of the whaleship Essex and the tragic survival story of it's crew. On November the 20th 1820, an 84 foot whale sunk the 238 ton whaleship nearly 3,000 miles off the coast of South America. The crew than floundered about the endless expanse of the Pacific for 93 days in leaky whaleboats with little food and water, plagued by high seas, dehydration, starvation and were soon forced into cannibalism. The tragedy of the Essex is one of the most dramatic ever to unfold on the high seas. This is the very stuff that inspired Herman Melville's famed Moby Dick.The book starts out introducing us to the times and culture of the ships home port of Nantucket, the whaling capital of the world. Immersing us in it's history, Philbrick details how a small island off the coast of Massachusetts became the most active and dominant whale port in the world and puts us into context with the rest of the story. As a land lover, I knew nothing of the ranks of seamen, the trappings of a whaleship or the rituals and traditions associated with the preparations and sailing of a whaleship but I never found myself lost on the deck of the ship. Philbrick deftly manages to include all the necessary details in order to place me right on there with the crewmen, without drowning me in nautical lingo or unnecessary detail.From the moment the Essex's set sail to the moment it sank, you are drawn into life onboard the whaleship. With fascinating and sometimes grisly detail, Philbrick pulls the reader in as the crew faces sudden squalls and mountainously high seas as they make their way from the east coast of the United States to the whale rich waters of the deep South Pacific. Along the way, the story is related to us less like a historic text and more like good fiction. We get to know the crew of the Essex; their personalities, histories, hopes, fears and everything in between. You are even guided step by step through the grisly process of extracting the oil from the captured sperm whales.For 93 days, the crew of the Essex floundered on the high seas. With little food, water or equipment, the crew journeyed for 4,500 nautical miles all the while suffering from the effects of dehydration, starvation and even the withdrawal effects of tobacco. The crew make tremendous efforts while battling high seas, storms and even sharks. The author even includes some interesting and useful details on the physiological and psychological effects of starvation and dehydration. The crew also had to face the terrifying fact that any one of their boats may be lost in a storm. All three of the boats concluded that if one of the boats was lost, the others would just keep going for fear of fruitlessly wasting time in a search effort. The situation these men faced was desperate.Philbrick does not shy away from the gruesome details of the crews subsequent fall to cannibalism. You can't help but be physically taken aback as you read the account of how the crew drew lots to see whom would be shot and consumed; the Captain himself eventually had to eat his own cousin. However, the author notes that while this act was taboo, it was hardly the first time this occurred around the time period. He briefly delves into other accounts of nautical cannibalism and is quick to point out the \`unspoken' rule of survival on the high seas.Upon ending the book, the author relates to us the stories of the survivors. Their recovery, what they did after the rescue and how they were greeted by the rest of society. I found this of particular interest, many of the survivors chose to return to the sea, even after the terrible ordeal.The book also includes many useful and interesting pictures midway through the book. Pictures of the various people such as the First Mate and Captain and others are given. Drawings and diagrams of the whaling ships are a great addition, and of course pictures of sperm whales are included also.No one is more qualified to relate this story than Nathaniel Philbrick. The book is exhaustively researched, look no further than the 69 pages of notes at the end of the book. He is a research fellow at the Nantucket Historical Association and currently is residing on the island. He relies heavily on the first hand accounts of the first mate Owen Chase, and the newly discovered journal of the cabin boy Thomas Nickerson, as well as secondary letters from the time period and the island historian of the time, Obed Macy. Philbrick manages to recreate the tragedy of the Essex in an easy to read manner. My only qualm with the book is that at some points the narrative can be somewhat dry. But this may very from reader to reader and hardly overshadows the rest of the book. In the Heart of the Sea delivers it all, an epic story of survival, tragic ending and good writing. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"In 1819, the Nantucket based whale ship Essex set off on a two year journey, around Cape Horn and into the whale rich waters of the South Pacific. With a new captain, first mate and many green sailors, the trip suffered from several minor setbacks (not unusual in the trade), before the Essex was sunk in the first documented case of a ship being attacked by a sperm whale, estimated to be an 85 foot monster.Relegated to whale boats, not suited for long trips on the open ocean, and hampered by trade winds which prevented steering a direct course for South America, the survivors spent three months in their whale boats, suffering through unimaginable bouts with starvation, dehydration, weather and ultimately cannibalism.This work paints a fascinating picture of the people and the culture of Nantucket and the whaling community, the Essex in particular. It is educational and instructive in both the customs of the era and the trade, as well as the psychology involved in disaster response and leadership. I have read numerous accounts of extreme exploration and the privations associated therewith and this treatment is very good in that genre. There are two very good maps and several photos and illustrations which assist the reader in following the narrative.The book is very short, at 230 pages with additional notes and reference material. My only quibble is that the endnotes are not associated with the primary text. A reader will finish the entire book, before even discovering that there are, in fact, notes associated with the text. Being able to read the notes in conjunction with the text would have been instructive."},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"Marvelous story of an epic struggle of men against the sea. Stove by a whale, the Essex collapsed and sank. Every party in the crew, their actions and fates are discussed. The society of their Nantucket home, the impact of it on the tragedy and of the tragedy on the community are discussed thoroughly.What a great book. I recommend it."},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"one of the best books I've read in years - and has made me go back to read more like this. The story is both engaging and accurate. Would recommend to anyone."},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"This was a great book and a great history of New England and Nantucket whaling- written with the enthusiasm and excitement of a novel but with the facts of the true occurrances about the whaleships."},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"I seem to be quite partial to sea stories and this one is a real winner. Philbrick knows how to write!I will leave the finer details to the other reviews written!"},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"First, let me dispatch any brooding reader from his or her fence-sitting about whether this book is worth the purchase price and time needed to read it through: it's all that and more, and more still. You will find yourself so drawn into this narrative that I suspect you will be overwhelmed, as I was, by an intense desire to have plentiful stores of water and food nearby while you read it.With one exception, I have never before read a work of historical nonfiction which held my interest like In the Heart of the Sea (the exception was Jeff Shaara's The Glorious Cause). You will repeatedly find yourself on the verge of total astonishment at the plight these men endured. Philbrick builds a mood of unrelenting gloom and horror and the book ends up reading more like a Stephen King novel than a history book. I feel totally comfortable recommending this book on the merits of the writing quality alone, because the writing is exceptional.So many new history books attempt to modernize the standard historical monograph by giving their books narrative structures, but in so doing, the writers end up taking something important and objective away from the reading experience. Philbrick doesn't do this, and I think he succeeds with his narrative precisely because he has two first-hand accounts of the disaster and because of the sensation this story caused and the flurry of press and ancillary writing generated regarding the Essex at the time. Of course, the existence of a talisman like Moby Dick certainly helped, as was Philbrick's oft-mentioned research into other whaling and sea disasters, most notably Captain Bligh and his troubles with The Bounty. It all comes together to give Philbrick's narrative weaving and artistic license an air of truth and detached journalistic reality, as though Philbrick himself had been present with the Essex survivors.Appertaining to its value as historical scholarship, In the Heart of the Sea seems to be as rigorously vetted and researched as anyone could expect given the limited information and catatonic delirium which, at nearly all points along the voyage, must have gripped the Chase and Nickerson, the two principle sources of information. In addition to his account of the doomed Essex voyage, Philbrick introduces readers to the unusual economy and personality of Nantucket. As a Folger descendant (the family name is mentioned several times in the book, and indeed, one of the owners of the Essex was named Folger), the geneological value of this brief adumbration about the town is fascinating. Furthermore, at the end of the book, the reader is greeted by what I perceive to be the most lucid, readable notes section that I have ever encountered before in any book and, as a result, this section stands as a useful tool and free bonus to the interested reader.I am quite hesitant to offer and critical remarks of this book at all, for fear someone reading this review might notice only that I had a criticism at all and would, without reading any details, forego purchase. My only criticism of the book is Philbrick's repeated injection of contemporary survival psychology. This was at times helpful, but I usually found these instances distracted me from the darkness and terror Philbrick had so carefully and successfully drawn me into. I wished he would have simply left the reader to commiserate with the Essex crew instead of, by including this running psychological commentary, being tacitly reminded that this was only a book. Again, not an issue at all. Buy the book.Thank you."},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"Philbrick's 238 page introduction to the history of Nantucket, its emergence as a global whaling center, and the perilous adventure of the whale ship Essex in 1820 is gripping. Readers will fly through this history, and perhaps want more. If so, Philbrick virtually implores us to continue our whaling studies by picking up Melville's classic, Moby-Dick. It seems Melville found his fiction (either directly or by way of Ralph Waldo Emerson) in the gritty realism of the Essex voyage. An 85-foot sperm whale (The Leviathan!) strikes the Essex in the middle of the Pacific Ocean. Eighteen sailors find themselves in a precarious position.Shackleton's epic tale of heroic survival is echoed here, too. Once the Essex founders, three small whaleboats jury rigged with canvas sails struggle across thousands of miles of ocean. The actions of stout-hearted men come under close scrutiny: A captain who is perhaps too egalitarian, a first mate who is a tad ambitious, a crew that is xenophobic if not racist. Are they? Philbrick lets his readers decide. Heroism, cannibalism, stoicism...the author puts it all on thrilling display in a day-to-day account of the self-rescue.Beyond the sailing saga, the book offers up a vivid portrait of island life on Nantucket, its industry, its social structure and religious affiliations. Charts, old photographs, and comprehensive end-notes provide surrounding detail and explanation that enhance the book, but might have bogged down the narrative. Good thing. We're left racing against time and hunger!"},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book about the tragedy of the whaleship essex. The beginning of the book puts you in the context of the whaling industry of Nantucket in the early 19th century. Over-\\"fishing\\" had already forced the whaleships to travel from Nantucket all the way to the Pacific Ocean to look for abundant whales. On one voyage, the Essex was rammed by a huge sperm whale and sank. The ensuing tale of the castaways voyage in small whaleboats from the middle of the pacific ocean to the coast of latin america is tragic and gruesome.The tale is very interesting and informative however and also well written. It was a nice touch that the author devoted a significant part of the book to the lives of the survivors after the tragedy."},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"On the one hand, you think to yourself, why would I voluntarily subject myself to reading about nineteenth century sailors, stranded at sea, thousands of miles from S. America, resorting to cannibalism? On the other hand, once you start this well-researched and beautifully written book, you cannot put it down. It teaches, not only of the whale trade, Nantucket, and life at sea, but about human nature and (even) race relations on a Nantucket whale ship. Philbrick should be congratulated for magnifying a tiny piece of forgotten history."},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"This book presents a human tragedy of lost lives, on the one hand, and a tale of indomitable spirit and courage on the other. Even so, Nathaniel Philbrick avoids the temptation to idolize the survivors. If anything, he underscores the role of simple luck in their good fortune, and even deals with how poorly some of them handled all the aftermath and the guilt associated with resorting to cannibalism. In this respect, it becomes easy for the reader to imagine himself or herself as one of the personna in this gripping tale. That is a real strength of this book; it explores human survival by keeping the narrative on a human level. This makes the story very accessible, and a quick read.Philbrick enhances the story with just enough background information on such topics as the subculture of Nantucket Island, 17th Century whaling practices, the gruesomeness of the hunt, navigational science, and the process of malnourishment and starvation. While I did not find this book as emotionally gripping as Krakauer's &quot;Into Thin Air&quot; or O'Nan's &quot;The Circus Fire,&quot; I still found it a very worthwhile read. Philbrick's description of whaling, and how this incident inspired Melville to write &quot;Moby Dick,&quot; has indeed piqued my curiosity about that great classic, which I have not read since high school. I strongly suspect that, after &quot;In the Heart of the Sea,&quot; &quot;Moby Dick&quot; will be read with a whole new level of appreciation, as well as comprehension. &quot;In the Heart of the Sea&quot; is a great book about the fragility of human life, and the dangers of confronting nature with arrogance, and in that way, is a kindred spirit with Melville's classic. But even read alone, it's terrific."},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"Philbrick's book is \\"off the charts\\" excellent. Admittedly I was a bit skeptical when I started the book. How could it possibly compete with Owen Chase's incredible and brief \\"Narrative of the Wreck of the Whaleship Essex\\"? But it did and then some. It put some meat on the bones (pardon the pun) of the sinking of the whale ship Essex. It also provided a more holistic view of the voyage preceding the incident and its aftermath, the whaling industry and Nantucket itself. The Quaker influence on the Nanctucket whaling trade is an intriguing story in itself. This is a simply wonderful and well-written book. From the first chapter the reader gets the feeling of being swept up into a developing catastrophe. I only wish I still had this book yet to read. No wonder this story inspired one of the greatest American novels ever written; Moby Dick.While the book pulls much of its primary source material from Chase's incredible account, it also gets primary source material from elsewhere. For example from Thomas Nickerson, the ship's cabin boy at the time, whose \\"meandering account\\" ended up being found in an attic in New York in 1960. This and other accounts (take a look at the bibliography) make this a completely well rounded view of the Essex's sinking and what it must have been like to live through the horrific days that followed.You will not walk away from this book without asking yourself what you would have done under the same circumstances. I found that to be chilling. You'll know what I mean. Facing that fact makes the book both impossible to put down and difficult to get through at the same time. Perhaps it would be an illustrative business school case or leadership critique. Let me count the possibilities. But I digress.Here you will learn about the voyage of the Whaleship Essex. You will hear about the whale and its attack. And finally, as a result of that whale, the sinking. What follows the sinking is for you to read in the quiet of night. It warrants no further comment except the likely outcome for you that you will not be able to put the book down. And you will not sleep."},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"You are going to like this book. Philbrick has taken a fascinating event in nautical history, the ramming of a whaling ship by an enraged sperm whale (the real life inspiration for Melville's Moby Dick), and written a gripping, informative book about whaling, Nantucket, prejudice, desperation, courage, weakness, redemption, survival and shame. For those of you thinking this is nothing more than exerpts of a diary of men in tiny whale boats, guess again.Not content with merely telling the story of the wreck and the struggles for survival by the crew, Philbrick gives us a glimpse of Nantucket in the late 18th and early 19th centuries, provides some useful information about the island's religious customs (the Quaker Society of Friends dominated life on the Island), and describes what life was like for a sailor on a boat such as the Essex. We know from reading this book where they slept on board, what they ate, how they were disciplined, how they killed and processed whales, and how much money the captain and crew stood to make from a typical voyage. We also learn how whalers from Nantucket were seen as superior to those from the mainland such as Bedford or Boston, and how African American sailors were frequently afforded the short end of the stick when it came to shares of the profits, accomodations, etc.Ultimately, though, this is a story about the wreck and about survival, with some fascinating subplots. You will cringe as you read about Capt. Pollard and his crisis as he must make difficult choices which jeapordize the life of his own relative, Owen Coffin, who he had promised to protect. Philbrick explores the ironic fear of cannabalism that drove the Essex sailors to avoid relatively close South Pacific islands after the wreck, in favor of a very risky and lengthy trip to South America. He tells us of the difficulties in steering a whale boat, and describes the trade winds which drove the men away from their target.All in all this is a gripping read. It is written with compassion and with attention to detail; the author has done his research, as 50 pages of Notes would indicate. I was particularly impressed with the passages of the book relating to the aftermath of the Essex disaster, as he followed the careers of the survivors, and pointed out that at least one crew member even sailed with Captain Pollard again. He borrowed from the journals of two survivors, the first mate and a cabin boy, whose accounts of the disaster sometimes digress. He also drew interesting parallels with the open boat plight of Capt. Bligh, of Mutiny on the Bounty fame. After reading the book, I was so enthralled I read the 50 pages of notes to avoid putting it down. Pick up this book if you are at all interested in sailing, whaling, nautical history, or true-life survival stories under the harshest of conditions. You will not be disappointed."},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"The Penguin Audiobook edition of Nathaniel Philbrick's &lt;In the Heart of the Sea: the Tragedy of Whaleship Essex&gt; (an authorized abridgment) is one of the more fascinating and harrowing tales I have heard in recent years. In fact, not since hearing the recording of &quot;The Professor and the Madman&quot; have I actually looked forward to my next session at my tape player.Briefly, the book falls into four major sections. There is a marvelous retelling of the rise to power and the customs of those who lived on Nantucket in the 1820s, including such all too human accounts of how the wives had to resort to opium and &quot;he's-at-homes&quot; during the long absences of their husbands. Then comes the events on the whaleship Essex up to its sinking by the 85 foot sperm whale that inspired Melville's Moby Dick. The third part, which many might find very difficult to bear, is how a mere handful of the crew managed to survive for about 3 months at sea. Finally, we hear about the consequences of the ordeal to the survivors and the degeneration of Nantucket into a tourist trap.The familiar actor Edward Herrmann reads the text with an almost clinical objectivity, a very good idea in that it makes the third section easier to hear. All in all, this is a classic example of reality being stranger than fiction and of the almost mythic drive that keeps some people alive under the most adverse circumstances. I should mention that the inclusion of scientific research into the narrative is most helpful and adds greatly to our understanding of what those men went through.A highly recommended listen...but be prepared for that third section!"},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"To use an old-fashioned phrase, this is &quot;a ripping yarn&quot;! I plowed through this book in just 3 days and if it hadn't been for work and chores that couldn't wait I would have finished in 2. Mr. Philbrick has a great gift for telling a story. Not only that, the layout of the book was wonderfully conceived. The author gives you some background on Nantucket and explains that although a large part of the population were peaceloving Quakers, that didn't stop them from hunting whales with a vengeance. Mr. Philbrick mentions that everyone on the island, women and small children included, would use seafaring and whaling expressions in their everyday speech, and the youngsters would even go around trying to &quot;harpoon&quot; things as part of their play. Mr. Philbrick gives you great descriptions of the men and the ships and the sea. He includes fascinating bits of information concerning human nutritional needs (at one point in the story the men were down to trying to survive on about 350 calories per day) and also the psychological as well as the physical effects of starvation. Mr. Philbrick explains that right after the &quot;Essex&quot; was sunk the captain of the ship, George Pollard, had to make a decision about which direction the survivors should go. They could have gone west towards the islands near Tahiti. The tradewinds from the east would blow them in that direction anyway, and the islands were not that far. They could have reached them in about a week. But the men had heard rumors of cannibals living on some of these islands, so they decided to go east, towards the coast of South America. This was a much more difficult journey. It meant going south until they were away from the tradewinds blowing from the east and only then being able to turn towards the coast of Chile. Because of the roundabout route this trip would take 3 months and make them cover over 4,000 miles! Another interesting aspect of the tale that Mr. Philbrick covers is that 6 of the 20 sailors were blacks, and that 5 of these 6 men were the first to die. This might seem very suspicious at first but Mr. Philbrick explains that due to a generally poorer diet before the &quot;Essex&quot; even left Nantucket these men were at an immediate disadvantage. The author also states that studies have shown that black people generally have less fat stored in their bodies than white people, and this factor would have also made a difference as once your body runs out of fat to burn it will start to use up muscle. Captain Pollard, who was short and stocky and who was older than most of the crew, and who therefore had more fat stored and also a slower metabolism, would seem a good candidate for survival- and, indeed, he did live to tell his tale of the disaster! In the epilogue Mr. Philbrick mentions that a few months after getting back to Nantucket Captain Pollard was given command of another whaling ship. On his first trip out he was in the Pacific and hit a coral reef and this ship sunk as well! Fortunately for Pollard and his crew, they had been sailing close by another whaler and were picked up the next day. The captain rightly surmised that he would be perceived as being &quot;jinxed&quot; and would not be given another command..."},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"I just finished reading &quot;In the Heart of the Sea&quot; yesterday. Once I started it I kept reading. Mr. Philbrick knows his subject very well. He communicates the story and does not overwhelm you with facts which can be a trapdoor set for an author with extensive an understanding of his subject.Mr. Philbrick presents additional material e.g. cannibalism that fits in well and does not distract the reader from the story. It is a tremendous story of survival. You find yourself watching how decisions were made and who made them, what survivors chose to do in certain circumstances, how race played a role, etc. Life was hard in the whaling industry of the last century. This book provides one with an education in addition to being an incredible story of survival.I would like to read this book again.

Philbrick's writing style is so vivid and detailed you almost feel yourself walking the streets of Nantucket and sailing on a whaling ship. Philibrick really did his homework on this book as every detail of the adventure has been researched and verified for accuracy. Some might find it a little too detailed (the notes at the end were a but much for me) but the story was so interesting I found myself wanting to know as much as possible about every facet of this gripping tale. A must read if you like adventure stories."},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"Subtitled &quot;The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex&quot; and publishedin 2000 to critical acclaim, this true story was written by NathanielPhilbrick, a leading authority on the history of Nantucket. Carefullyresearched, and extremely well written, this early 19th centuryincident has been brought to life with exquisite descriptions. Notonly does Philbrick tell the long sad tale of the Essex's tragicsinking in 1820 and the sufferings of the few survivors who wereforced to resort to cannibalism in order to stay alive, it is alsothe story of the whaling industry, the social and religious communityof Nantucket, and the influence this incident had on Herman Melvillein the writing of Moby Dick some 20 years after theevent.Originally, it was thought that the diary of the first mate,Owen Chase, told the whole story. But in the 1980s, another documentwas found which was written by the cabin boy many years later and shedeven more light on what actually transpired. Interwoven in this storyare the details which make this book come alive.With the eye of anovelist, the reader is brought to the town of Nantucket, watching theship make ready for its voyage, and making comments about the greencrew as they struggle to make a good impression as they raise theirsails. We meet the young boys as well as the seasoned crewmen andfeel their seasickness as the captain orders them to climb the masts.We feel the conflict in authority between the captain and the firstmate. We see the racial and religious hierarchy and the role of theAfrican American crewmen. Our muscles twitch as we read about thehard work on ship; our hearts race with a sense of adventure at thehunting and harpooning the whale; our nostrils crinkle as we readabout the process of killing, dismembering and extracting the valuableoil.And then we are thrown into tragedy when a whale attacks theship and the twenty men are set adrift in small boats with fewprovisions. We cringe as we learn all the details about thebiological effects that depravation from food and water have on ahuman body. We get to know the crew as individuals and understand thehard choices they had to make. And then we see the rescue and wefollow the few survivors for the rest of their lives.We also followthe voyage on the well drawn maps and scrutinize the photographs ofsome of the men, ships and woodcuts depicting the event. Then we readabout what happens when a whale dies on a Nantucket beach in 1994 andfind out how difficult it was to dispose of its remains.After allof this, we are forever changed. We have a greater appreciation forthis small bit of American history and we are even more thankful forthe ease in which food is available to us.Just as &quot;MobyDick&quot; has stood the test of time as a picture of the whalingindustry as well as a literary gem, &quot;In the Heart of theSea&quot; is destined to become THE authoritative book on the subject.Mr. Philbrick has done the world a favor by bringing this fascinatingsubject to light. I applaud his work and thank him for it. Highlyrecommended."},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"As in Junger's &quot;The Perfect Storm&quot; and Shackleton's &quot;Endurance,&quot; I knew the ending of this story before reading the first page. I wondered, Should I should spend time learning the details of the disaster or go on to another book?Twenty pages into the story, Philbrick's easy, yet authoritative narrative convinced me to continue. Well-researched and never ponderous, &quot;In the Heart of the Sea&quot; tells the tale of the whaleship Essex and the crew's struggle for survival after a sperm whale rams and sinks their vessel. The build up to the sinking is fascinating. With early nineteenth century details of life in Nantucket and the motivations of individual sailors, Philbrick caused me to care that much deeper as the crew set off over open ocean in hopes of survival. The sheer immensity of the Pacific looms over the account; the crew's joint effort to prevail is incredible under the circumstances.Although the dilemma of cannibalization waits till the last quarter of the book to rear its head, the emotions and lead up to that fateful--and lifesaving (for some)--decision are done with masterful care. Philbrick justifies the crew's actions with the history of seafaring survivors. The details are horrific, but the humanity of these men manages to shine through, in part, through Philbrick's attention to the survivors' following years and destinies.With a wealth of information in the notes at the back of the book, &quot;In the Heart of the Sea&quot; stands as a modern masterpiece, reminding us of the anguish that has helped shaped our nation, while also warning us of the dangers of abusing our natural resources. If history is an ocean, Philbrick takes us to the heart of it."},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"The heart of the sea is a griping and page turning book. There are tons of stories about ships lost at sea. This is the first book that I have read that went in to so much detail of what happened. In the begin is not as good the history of Nantucket is not something I wanted to read. But I do have to admit that the way Nathaniel philbrick described the little close nit town was very descriptive. He made it seem like you were looking a photo of it. The book did give me some incite into how it was back then. How life was on the ship not seeing your family for years. After you get through the first couple of chapters the book starts to pick up. It is like you are reliving the whole experience of the sinking of the Essex. I would not recommend this book for animal lovers, being one my self reading what they do to the whales and other animals just to survive made me sick. But over all it is a fairly good story."},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"I know I'm asking for it on the chin, especially since this book won the &quot;National Book Award&quot; for non-fiction,.....BUT!!!When are we going to get out of the pop-disaster-book trend? And the people falling all over themselves: Wall Street Journal, New York Times, am I **that** critical that I can't let this one go? I think we need a new category for books such as this, &quot;Into Thin Air&quot;, &quot;The Perfect Storm&quot;, and the others: maybe &quot;tragi-stry&quot; or &quot;disasti-doc&quot;, in the same spirit as film's &quot;docu-drama&quot;. The very first sentence, &quot;Like a giant bird of prey, the whaleship moved lazily up the western coast of South America, zigging and zagging across a living sea of oil&quot;, lets you know what kind of book you have. Any competent historian would have written &quot;The whaleship 'Dauphin', sailing from Nantucket and heading for the whaling grounds of the Western Pacific, tacked not far from St. Mary's Island on Chile's southern coast&quot;. This isn't &quot;history&quot;, it's &quot;*popular* history&quot; - anecdotes and extrapolations, peoples' thoughts and motives expressed as if the author knew exactly what transpired. Vivid descriptions that can only be woven out of conjecture, best-guesses, and &quot;sounds good&quot;. Oh, I know, it IS an engaging tale, one well-documented in several primary resources and hundreds of secondary histories and fictional knock-offs (&quot;Moby Dick&quot; and Poe's &quot;Arthur Gordon Pym&quot; being two of the most notable). But why does the author (in the preface) seem to have to justify himself by naming his father as &quot;a professor of English...and the author of several books about American sea fiction&quot; and in the very next sentence describe his uncle as &quot;winner of the Wallace Stevens Poerty Prize in 1958&quot;? Does that have a bearing on the re-telling of THIS story? Or is it to set the mood for a good yarn, arrrr, a tale of the ol' salty sea, told the way ye like 'em, with shipwrecks and cannibals, desert islands and lightning-wracked storms?It's obvious that Philbrick wants to make MORE out of the story than those other versions. He not only shows his discontent with the main primary resource (First Mate Owen Chase's account) by comparing it with a recently (1960) discovered second version by the ship's cabin boy, he feels obligated to second-guess Chase on several crucial actions throughout the ordeal, always to Chase's denigration. As an example, the &quot;knockdown&quot; episode of Chapter 2 creates pages of arguement and reversals of decision that Philbrick quite simply extrapolates - we can't know that the ship's mood &quot;sank into one of gloom&quot;, or that the captain &quot;stared at the splintered mess&quot;. Nice writing - conjectural history. That's not enough - he wants to throw in &quot;issues of class, race, leadership, and man's relationship to nature&quot;. For that reason, to Philbrick, Sir Ernest Shackleton's epic tale of survival simply will not DO. According to Philbrick, &quot;Shackleton and his men...put themselves in harm's way then had the luck to live out an Edwardian fantasy of male camaraderie and herism...&quot;. Too bad - no issues of class and race to exploit and hyperbolate there. Writing that the ship's crew was &quot;more than a half dozen men&quot; short sounds far more portentious than simply stating &quot;the usual crew of 21 needed 7 more&quot;.The UK Amazon editor wrote, &quot;By any standard, 50 pages of footnotes impress, though he wears his learning lightly.&quot; He'd better check again: I have 39 pages of NOTES, not FOOTNOTES. These notes are highly anecdotal and subjective in themselves. Philbrick isn't wearing his learning lightly, he's heavily leaning on personal stories and superficial gleanings from dozens of sources.Maybe the MOST telling line is the one where Philbrick writes, &quot;Yet, despite the circus (some have called it a theme park) that is modern Nantucket, the story of the 'Essex' is too troubling, too complex to fit comfortably into a chamber of commerce brochure.&quot; Well, since Mr. Philbrick makes his residence in the midst of that circus, he has apparently taken upon himself the role of barker for the &quot;Essex' tragedy, writing that &quot;too complex&quot; brochure into more of a novel than a history and no doubt making a few bucks in the process.It makes a great &quot;beach read&quot;, but I'd rather have Poe's &quot;Pym&quot; and Shackleton's &quot;South&quot; any day. For that matter, seek out William Hope Hodgson's &quot;Boats of the Glen Carrig&quot; if it's a great shipwreck yarn ye be seeking. If it's HISTORY, Philbrick himself will tell you to read Heffernan's &quot;Stove by a Whale&quot;."},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"I was intrigued, horrified, and was ashamed for humanity in reading this book. It was well worth the read. I was cheering for the whales and actually felt good when the whale attacked and sank the ship!! Thank heavens for the environmental movement. It is overwhelmingly sad that so many tortoises and whales met their end during those days. Quite interesting, however, that we killed so many more whales in the 1900's than they did in that (and previous centuries) because of improved technology!The environmental movement has helped tremendously to save these great mammals, though I recently read that Japan is going to be killing whales again! And they are voracious eaters of creatures from the sea.

The book is filled with detail of the day-to-day travails of the seaman &amp; officers, and interesting speculation about the relationships between major players in the drama. The book would be of particular interest to people intoxicated with the sea &amp; sailing, since there is plenty of information about how sailing &amp; navigation was done (right &amp; wrong by this group) in the early nineteenth century. Where I found the book to be weak is in the general history, the context in which all this occurred. I prefer a book that uses an incident like this as a centerpiece to elucidate the social, political, economic, cultural situation of the day. Philbrick does this, in places, particularly in the first few chapters, but then the book degenerates, or better said, narrows its view to the Essex voyage itself, abandoning the historical context. The book would have been much much longer &amp; less focused had it taken the approach I suggest ... but it is nevertheless the approach I prefer. That is why I gave it a 3."},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"This is not a bad book, but it is weighed down a bit by the numerous facts.

I can buy the REAL book for about the same price brand-new in most cases, and substantially cheaper if I buy a used copy.

I couldn't put it down. I had a special interest in that my great-great-grandfather was a whaling captain (&quot;Master&quot;), and traveled those waters with my great-grandfather as a toddler on board. My one criticism of the author's perspective is what he didn't critique - cannibalism! I know it is easy to point fingers when I was not there, starving and dying of thirst, but the author went too far in the other direction and became their justifiers, based on the accounts of two survivors who chose to eat their friends. Why was there not a serious discussion about chosing to die with dignity rather than deify life at the cost of eating and drinking your friends? Perhaps the men who died earlier did hold to this. Why was that not a significant part of this work?Nevertheless, thank you Nate Philbrick for a book that should be made into a movie, with some of this balance."},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"My boyfriend and I were on an 8 hour car trip and I had picked up this book out of curiosity.

Most of them die. It's a famous story, having inspired Herman Melville's Moby-Dick. Nathaniel Philbrick relates the events of the ill-fated voyage through the accounts of some of its survivors.Hindsight is 20-20, and it seems easy to see how much of this disaster could have been averted. Culture, personalities, and dumb luck dictated otherwise, and the Essex story is truly a tragedy.Although it's hard to read of the unrelenting sufferings of the men in their boats and what happens physically and psychologically on the way to death of thirst or starvation, this book adds a lot of information about 19th century Nantucket culture and the whaling world of the time. It also tells the stories of the survivors' lives after the tragedy, such as they are known. All in all, it's a very interesting read, highly recommended.The (unabridged -- never skimp!) audiocassette version is well-narrated, a recommended alternative to sitting down with the work in print. However, if you're in it for historical research, you'll probably want access to the footnotes/citations on paper."},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"Wanting to take something to read at the beach while on vacation, I literally stumbled across this book at the book store. After reading the back cover and glancing through the pages, I decided to give it a shot. I'm very glad that I did. Philbrick tells the tragic story of the whaleship Essex, sunk by a whale in the 19th century. He starts off the story with the background of the whaling industry that transformed Nantucket into the whaling capital of the world. And then it's on to the Essex's travels. Explaining in great detail what a crewman on a whaleship goes through when capturing and harvesting a whale gives you a greater appreciation for their efforts. These trips lasted years. Philbrick explains what problems whaleships can encounter while out at sea. It's only when the ship is attacked by a whale that the story really picks up the pace. Until then it was an interesting reading on their trials and tribulations, but sometimes it felt like I was reading a history book. When the men are alone on the water in their smaller whaleships, and the struggles with the sea, food and monotony take center stage, the book is hard to put down. Everything they went through, from misguided information, boats they couldn't steer, some stealing food to ultimately having to rely on the dead for nourishment, it's hard to believe anyone survived. It's at this point you wish Philbrick could get even more information into his narrative - you want to know everything that happened on their journey. His style is very easy reading. He fills in the story with background information where appropriate, letting the reader know what went wrong and why. What a different course of events would of happened if they decided on a different course. By the time you finish the story, you feel overwhelmed at their struggles. It makes your own problems seem insignificant. This book shows what we are capable of enduring when put to the task."},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"This is a well-planned, well-written, well-edited and engaging book chronicling the 1820 sinking of the whaler Essex in the mid-Pacific, and the subsequent 4500-mile survival voyage of some of its crew in three small whaleboats. The maps of the Pacific and route of the ship/boats were very helpful in following the narrative, as were the diagrams of the ship and its rigging, and the notes and index. Philbrick has figured out that many of his readers don't come to the book with a detailed knowledge of where the Marquesas are in relation to Pitcairn Island, or the relative locations of the fore topsail and forecastle. It would have been even more helpful to have all maps and diagrams at the front of the book (as the Essex sail plan and deck plan are).I appreciate the 238-page length of the book; Philbrick understands that when an author has finished covering the topic, it's OK to stop writing, even if the author hasn't reached the 400-page mark. I also appreciate how he avoids either demonizing or glorifying the characters in the book.Along the way, Philbrick takes us into the history and sociology of related topics such as whaling, whalers, Nantucket, and survival through deprivation, to name a few.Philbrick engaged in exhaustive research, including the existing accounts written by survivors (including an account discovered almost 200 years after the sinking), secondary accounts, and a number of sources on the many topics touched on in the book. Where the accounts differ, this is generally noted by Philbrick, with his evaluation of which account is more believable.The reader should not be dissuaded by the negative review posted by Mark Shanks below.Shanks criticizes Philbrick for using \\"extrapolations.\\" The extrapolations in the book are minimal. A non-fiction author should label extrapolations, but is it a sin to assume that the Essex butchered whales like every other whaler? Shanks may be confused because Philbrick uses accounts from those survivor reports which might be thought the author's extrapolation. For example, the report that the crew &quot;looked at each other with perfect amazement, deprived almost of the power of speech&quot; may sound like an extrapolation, but it's a direct quote from the second mate's account. A few inconsequential extrapolations does not turn this well-researched factual book into a \\"docudrama.\\"Strangely, Shanks simultaneously criticizes Philbrick for \\"heavily leaning on personal stories.\\" How could the Essex survivors _not_ write \\"personal stories\\"? What, after all, is \\"history\\" but significant personal stories in context? Unlike \\"Perfect Storm,\\" the Essex sinking had survivors who put their recollections in writing. Without personal stories, this would be a book on whaling in general, with no mention of the Essex.Shanks admits judging a book by the first sentence of its preface, and claims that &quot;competent historians&quot; must write in stilted and dry prose. If Shanks recoils because Philbrick recounts his father and uncle telling him the Essex story when he was a boy, then Shanks has been too-deeply indoctrinated in the need for a historian to appear \\"detached\\" from a moving account.Shanks categorizes the 40-page source notes at the end as \\"highly anecdotal and subjective.\\" Instead, the reader will find that Philbrick's source notes contain a richly annotated discussion of the original sources, how the secondary sources were used, and suggestions for further reading.If you're looking for a college thesis which is narrowly focused on a minor issue, written in a dry style with five footnotes per paragraph, this is not the book for you. If you're looking for an educational and entertaining book, don't miss this one."},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"Best book I've read in twenty years. Period."},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"The subject matter is so interesting that it would be hard to write a bad book on it, and the author does give a lot of background information on whaling and Nantucket. But I found the explanations about ships, etc., to be spotty - at certain places the author takes the time (and does a good job) of stopping and explaining &quot;how ships work;&quot; at other times, he goes blithely on when further background is really needed. Tacking, for instance, is a very important concept to understand in a story like this, and it's not explained. (Very few books written for the general public about sail-powered sea voyages do, though - I finally learned about it in a really great book, &quot;The Elizabethan World,&quot; by Lacey Smith, in which it is shown how superior tacking ability helped English ships outmaneuver the Spanish.)Philbrick also has a little trouble pacing the book in such a way as to keep the suspense up properly, although the material is naturally suspenseful, of course. Also, at times, the book seems to be improperly edited: the exposition isn't quite logical. Before the wreck, for example, one of the sailors jumps ship, and the author says that this happened at a particularly bad time, since the crew was now dangerously short. But he also says jumping ship was very common. So, was it the captain's fault for not being prepared for such an eventuality? Things like that - you don't quite understand the rationale.I did enjoy the book and would recommend it to anyone interested in the topic (though I didn't read, and can't compare it to, the diary of the first mate, Mr. Chase, that another reviewer has recommended as superior.)If you want to read only one book on shipwreck survival, the best one I've read is &quot;The Wreck of the Medusa&quot; by Alexander McKee."},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"My first introduction to Nathaniel Philbrick was this particular book, IN THE HEART OF THE SEA, which I bought over three years ago and kept it in my \\"to be read soon\\" stack. After hearing the recent reviews of Philbrick's latest, MAYFLOWER, also in my \\"stack,\\" I pulled out IN THE HEART OF THE SEA and decided to read it. To say that I felt idiotic for not reading it sooner would be an understatement.Many authors of factual-based books, regardless genre, don't have the touch to make non-fiction readable. (I noted with a chuckle the high school/college student who reviewed HEART OF THE SEA, and indicated how boring and dry it was...well, it was a class requirement, so of course it is boring and dry.) My opinion is diametrically opposed. There are a few authors that bring non-fiction to life: Roger Lowenstein (in business), Kurt Eichenwald (in business tales), David McCullough (in history), and, of course, the late Stephen Ambrose (in history). Philbrick can now be added to that list. While he doesn't present presumed dialogue like Eichenwald, Philbrick brings the story to life with titillating detail and gusto.HEART OF THE SEA introduces readers to the island of Nantucket in the early 1800s, where whaling was the primary, if not only, industry of any import to the islanders. At that time in history, Nantucket was considered the whaling \\"capital.\\" Philbrick introduces the readers to the customs of whaleships, the ranks of the seamen, and the incredible journeys a typical whaleship made. Each journey, with little variation, took the seamen from their Nantucket familes for periods as long as three years. Upon return, they might only be with their families for a few months before the next voyage. However, given the dire need for oil provided by the sperm whale, and the riches it brought on the open market, this was a standard and fully accepted custom, not only by the seamen, but their families as well.The story within the story provided the basis for one of the great works of literature of all time; Melville's MOBY DICK. Philbrick indicates that Melville was ardent, and somewhat transfixed, by the story of the Essex, and its ulimate plight. Of course, MOBY DICK is a work of fiction, but it is centered in fact...that being the tale of the Essex.IN THE HEART OF THE SEA revolves around the whaleship Essex, which set sail for the last time in 1819 in search of sperm whales. Now, think about this: the whale hunt was to take place in the Pacific. The Essex had to sail from Nantucket (think Boston) in the Atlantic, around Cape Horn (the southern tip of South America), and then back north to the whaling grounds of the Pacific. No wonder these voyages took years! The Essex had a number of \\"events\\" occur before making it to the South Pacific, which, in hindsight, should have given the crew a hint that this, indeed, could be an ill-fated voyage. After having some decent luck in their search for whales on their way to the whaling grounds, an extraordinary and unprecedented event took place while the Essex's latitude was approximately the Equator. The Essex was rammed by an eighty-five foot sperm whale, twice, which sent the 228-ton whaleship to it's death in the Pacific. The crew, numbering 20, took the three available lifeboats, called whaleboats, and began pondering how they were going to survive, literally, in the middle of the Pacific, thousands of miles from any known civilization. While the crew was able to save some food and fresh water prior to the Essex going under, most knew it wasn't enough to make it. Their ultimate journey from the death of the Essex to rescue was filled with hope, dispair, and human behavior none of the seamen thought they'd ever consider or engage in. This journey is heartwrenching and fantastic.Philbrick has put together an incredibly vivid tale bringing to life the tibulations facing each of the seamen of the Essex. Philbrick has given enough, but not too much, information on whaling, sperm whales, 19th century industry, and the culture of a seamen and whaleships to give the reader a firm grasp of the time without becoming inudated with minutiae. IN THE HEART OF THE SEA is an outstanding effort by a very talented author."},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"Amazing account of the whaleship 'Essex' . Also an interesting history of the whaling industry itself. Hard to put this one down, though, so make sure you've got your life caught up before you start reading!"},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"Heart of the Sea is two books in one, Philbrick's straightforward, fast-paced and highly readable narrative of the whaleship Essex, its death from a whale attack, and the resultant harrowing maritime survival tragedy, and the Notes section, where Philbrick cites and expands upon the facts, issues, and concepts touched upon in the main narrative. This second part is a trove of avenues to explore, alone worth the book's purchase price.The main question of the Essex is, \\"Did they get what hey deserved?\\" Did the crew pay the long-overdue price for relentlessly the whale, for the wanton, careless destruction of whole species, for depleting a finite resource with no foresight or thought of conservation? Did nature rear up and finally fight back? The facts and other evidence Philbrick offers clearly lean that way. The irony of the Essex's crew reduced to hollow-eyed animals sucking the marrow from their shipmates' bones after their numerous examples of careless, wanton killing cannot be escaped.Philbrick writes effortlessly, comfortable with virtually all aspects of early 19th century seamanship, whaling, even the demographics and cultural context of the early 19th century American maritime Northeast. He describes Nantucket in detail, and the role its conservative Quakerism played in the whaling industry and in the Essex tragedy itself. The basic story flows quickly, at times almost too quickly, as the central narrative takes only about 170 pages of the book's 302. The other pages set the historical, economic, cultural, and sociological stages, and provide excellent epilogue. I found the fast-moving story frustrating, as I was keen to enjoy in detail the voyage, wreck, and 92-day ordeal at sea. For example, the Essex's struggle for \\"more than a month\\" to round Cape Horn is described in less than two pages, most of this geographic and historical context.Upon reflection, Philbrick's story is constrained by scant available sources for the tale of exactly what happened during the voyage and after. To his credit, he is loathe to blithely create fiction where he has no indication of what truly happened during the voyage and after the wreck. He does make speculations, but they are informed speculations, and he is careful to discuss them with the reader as they are presented. He does not embellish, nor does he fictionalize; he tells the best story he can with the historical information he has at hand. This is noble, honest, and makes for a more compelling book than one in which fiction and truth would be harder to distinguish.The narrative concludes with the survivors' lives after their ordeal, their successes and failures. This almost puts a happy ending on the story. Curious is the fact that many of the survivors were so open about their experiences, and in great detail. Certainly this was an effort at explanation, and through that redemption, but what else lies behind this need? It seems Philbrick's inquisitiveness and research fails a bit here, not exploring the psychology of why men would so freely admit to the greatest of taboos.The Notes section of the book is highly detailed, and shows the depth of research and knowledge Philbrick brings to this work. This is just a sample of things he discusses, things to explore: early 19th century sailing, seamanship, and whaling; sperm whale behavior and anatomy; classic historical instances of disaster and survival cannibalism; \\"gastronomic incest\\" and \\"stomach masturbation;\\" Nantucket wives' use of opium and, uh, male anatomical surrogate devices; Samoan obesity, its relationship to ancient South Pacific exploration, and the advantage of being fat in a starvation situation; World War II starvation studies; \\"modern feral communities;\\" Japanese cannibalism cookbooks, and; the numerous links to \\"Moby Dick.\\" Philbrick evaluates his sources, giving credence to some while dismissing others, providing justification for his conclusions.One is struck while reading the Notes that this second narrative is actually a jumping-off point for any number of adventures. This is a part of the book distinct from the straightforward story of the Essex, and a fascinating place to look for more things to explore, most of them non-fiction. The Notes serve to expand on some of the issues and stories Philbrick touches upon in the main narrative, but wisely has chosen not to burden the story with. The citations of available books and publications are considerable, which could lead the reader in any direction, either fiction or nonfiction, scientific, biographical, historical, sociological, anywhere.The book contains a number of highly useful maps and drawings. There is a detailed diagram of the ship to explain terms. The maps are particularly useful to gain perspective on the immense distances these sailors traveled. There also are 16 glossy black and white plates, with drawings, photographs, documents, and maps illuminating the story.There is a useful ten-page select bibliography. This is a bit redundant, given the Notes portion of the book, but it does provide a number of references and related materials which are not cited directly in the narrative or Notes.At only seven pages, the index is disappointing, not nearly as detailed as it should be. It fails to reference the book adequately, omitting a number of names, places, titles, and ideas. For example, Philbrick makes mention of the 1996 film \\"White Squall\\" and the Piers Paul Read book \\"Alive,\\" yet neither is referenced by title in the index.I note one niggling detail: Philbrick cites Read's \\"Alive\\" (and lists it in his select bibliography) and notes that it is about a Uruguayan \\"soccer\\" team. It was actually a rugby team, not a soccer team. This may be a minor mistake of fact by the author and/or editing team, or it may be that Philbrick has not delved nearly as deeply into his sources as his extensive notes and bibliography otherwise indicate.All in all, this is a highly enjoyable book, first for its smooth and riveting narrative, and second for the unexpected trove of additional paths to explore. Despite my one speculative, marginally negative comment above, I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"Philbrick writes a fascinating account of the struggles of the crew of the whaleship Essex after a disasterous encounter with a sperm whale. He manages to capture the essence of the mindset of the inhabitants of Nantucket, the whaling center of the U.S., which explains many of the actions of the crew. The fight for survival is portrayed with both clarity and emotionalism. Having no previous knowledge of this calamity, I was amazed that at the time it had a similar impact in the 1800's that the Titanic had in the 1900's. It was enlightening that this tragedy served as the inspiration for Melville's, Moby Dick, which I consider to be one of the masterpieces of American literature."},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"This is a first rate, well crafted work of non-fiction.

So complete was the damage that the ship sank, its crew of twenty cast adrift upon a seemingly infinite ocean to find their way back home in three small boats. This real life, unheard of attack by a whale was the basis for Herman Melville's classic work of fiction, \\"Moby Dick\\".What the author does is ground what happened to these most unfortunate of men in the historical context of the time. He paints a picture of the milieu in which they lived. Their lives were governed entirely by the whaling industry that was the bread and butter for Nantucket Island, the whaling capital of the world.Drawing upon narratives by some of the survivors, as well as other historical data, he paints in intricate detail what life must have been like for these men. He weaves a tapestry of early nineteenth century life on the island of Nantucket and the preeminence of whaling in the lives of those who lived there, as well as the role of the Quakers. In essence, he brings the men, who were involved in this most notorious of survival at sea stories, to life for the reader.It is a balanced narrative. This was to be the first voyage as Captain for the democratic George Pollard, who was teamed up with a very aggressive and ambitious first mate, Owen Chase. This was later to prove to be a poor combination. Nearly a third of the crew was African-American, which was an interesting twist, arising out of the abolitionist views of the Quakers, whose views were the mainstay of Nantucket. Most of the crew was very young, the cabin boy, Thomas Nickerson, being but fourteen years of age.When the Essex was attacked while on the high seas by a gigantic, aggressive sperm whale and destroyed in the process, the story of the what happened to the crew makes for one of the most engrossing and amazing stories of survival ever to be told. Against the odds, eight of them survived their ordeal, which lasted for months. Dehydration and starvation were to drive them to a new frontier of human behavior. That threshold, however, once crossed, was one that would forever haunt those who survived. Their agonizing journey and foray into anthropophagy is chillingly chronicled.This is a riveting and triumphant book. It is a tale richly told by a masterful storyteller, who is able to make this work of non-fiction come to life for the reader. This is simply a great book."},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"Read this compelling tale of struggle and survival and you will feel strongly that Herman Melville had a real-life story in mind."},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"What does it mean to be indomitable? This book displays that wonderful human quality in a remarkably effective way. The next time you consider giving up, just imagine yourself on the trackless sea in a small boat from the Essex.This story has to be one of the most astonishing survival tales in recorded history. Before I say more, let me caution you that this story (and parts of this review) is not for those with weak stomachs.After their ship is disabled by an attacking sperm whale, the survivors find themselves on three open boats in the middle of the Pacific Ocean over 2,000 miles from their targeted landfall in South America. With luck, they will make it in 30 days. They soon find themselves in a stall as the winds fail to cooperate, except to provide severe storms that threaten to capsize the boats.Soon, all the food is encrusted with salt and everyone is suffering with severe dehydration. Then things start to get worse! I won't go further, but you have an amazing story of survival ahead of you.Two of the few survivors of this terrible ordeal later committed their experiences to writing, which provide great resources for this well-researched book.At another level, the book is also extremely interesting because these experiences were important influences on Herman Melville's writing of the American classic, Moby Dick. The book makes that connection for you, including how Melville came to learn the story.At a third level, the book is a fascinating history of whaling around 1920. If you are like me, you will cringe when the whalers devastate island after island . . . as well as the whale population. But that's not the limit to their willingness to use nature to their own advantage.The ultimate irony is that the survivors went the wrong way. Those from Nantucket did not know about Tahiti and Hawaii, and chose not to go in either of those directions -- either of which would have provided more rapid safety and comfort. The primary reason they chose not to go in these directions is because they feared running into cannibals. Soon the survivors were studying the remains of dead shipmates with hunger. And then it gets worse.So, you have three different kinds of books to read here, anyone of which could be enormously enjoyable to you. Get ready for the trip of your life!Land ho!"},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"I found this to be one of the most engaging books I have read in a long time. I read it in three nights and was sad when it was over. The author appears to have done a LOT of research on this subject, amply illustrated by his extensive notes at the end of the book. It's great to read a book that is both well-researched and well-written. My only complaint, a small one, is that I wish he had spent more time discussing the racial dynamics of the crew. Unlike some authors, Philbrick definitely didn't ignore this topic. But when the African-American members of the boats die off and are eaten, one by one, I was totally incredulous. How could this have happened? I thought Philbrick could have spent more time discussing other historic shipwrecks where there were racial issues involved. Perhaps, however, there really wasn't enough data to go on. Anyway, as I said, I greatly enjoyed this book."},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"This was one of those books that I just couldn't put down. I had to keep reading and reading until the entire story was done. I had to find out what happened to these people as they drifted across the Pacific.What made the tale interesting was how thoroughly human and fallible the characters were. You watch them first commit atrocities of their own (torching one of the Galapagos islands), and you come to understand some of the brutality and savagery that pervaded life in a 19th century whaling ship. So by the time the whale attacks you're kind of rooting for the whale.Then they're adrift in the boats, and they manage to make every bad decision possible. They decide to sail thousands of miles to the coast of South America because they think the natives on the nearby islands are cannibalistic savages (their biggest mistake); and they eat the meat they have instead of using it as bait to catch fish.Watching them drift into their doom, and realizing that it was partly of their own making, somehow makes the story all the more gripping, because it makes you want to somehow reach back in time and yell at them, &quot;Don't do that, you idiot! Don't you realize what's going to happen if you do that!&quot;All in all a great book. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"I had read the paperback, but I wanted this audio book for a friend with reading disabilities. It was very much enjoyed by the recipient. A great story with narration by Edward Herrmann...."},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"Horror, oh, horror! Philbrick's In the Heart of the Sea is a truly horror-filled book. Read it only with a strong stomach, for it vividly portrays the unimaginable extremes to which creatures that were once human can go to maintain life. Once the fragile bonds to safety and security are severed by the sinking of their ship, the officers and crew of the whaleship Essex are reduced from civilized humans to elemental creatures not only willing but eager to drink the fresh blood and eat the warm flesh of their fellows to ensure their own survival.The book's portrayal of total amorality required to preserve one's existence is shared by the portrayal of total hopelessness and unbelievable despair resulting from being set adrift in small boats whose sides rise but a few dismal inches above the devouring sea. Philbrick's incredible descriptive writing draws the reader into the maelstrom of fear and emotional agony afflicting each pitiable, cowering creature groveling in the filthy, salty, undrinkable water in the bottoms of the miniscule boats tossed by the pitiless ocean.Does their common fate and total helplessness in the face of Nature's uncaring power draw these men together? Let us merely observe that those in the crew who were neither caucasian nor Nantucketer found reason to fear the passing of time. Favoring one's \\"own kind\\" is not a new phenomenon among humans. Does Captain Pollard display the best of leadership for his bereaved sailors? Suffice it to say that, had he not been a classic business textbook example of the \\"Peter Principle\\" at work, a good man who became ineffectual when promoted to a ship's captaincy, the tragedy might never have occurred.Whether the reader comes to this book seeking true adventure, a psychological picture of men in extreme duress, or a case study in failed leadership, he or she will not be disappointed. The challenge will be to remind oneself that this story is real, for it is the stuff of novels. Were that all history books could be so captivating! This one, at least, can not be put down for long, though the temptation to analyze it as literature rather than as history remains strong--and that's a plus!"},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"I listened to this book on my long drives home from work. It was almost disappointing to arrive in my driveway. This beautiful piece of work inspired me to read more historic adventures. Many of the books I have read since were very good but none has compared to the tale, writing, and delivery of In The Heart of the Sea. I recommend this book to you and everyone I know."},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"Nat Philbirck's In The Heart Of The Sea is an amazing story of courage and survival at sea. Having read numerous survival stories, as well as Melville's classic Moby Dick (which was partly based on the Essex tragedy) I can say this tale is unmatched by any other.Philbrick's easy style and immense knowledge of the Nantucket Whaling Industy make this one of the easiest and most enjoyable books I've ever come across. After reading this the reader will probably know more about Sperm Whales then he/she ever wanted to know. This isn't a bad thing.The tale takes place in 1819-20, during which the Essex sailed from Nantucket to the Pacific in search of whales. The best part, of course, is the tale of what happens after the ship is sunk and the survivors, hundreds of miles away from any land, embark on a 93 day journey which will lead through storms, delerium, and finally, canibalism. The decisions and actions they are forced to take are so horrible no man should ever have to go through this ordeal. The author even details what it is like not only to slowly die of starvation, but of dehydration and exposure to the elements.If you enjoyed The Perfect Storm, you will certainly enjoy this book. It's a Classic!"},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"This was an interesting story and well-told. Prior to reading it, I was largely ignorant of the Nantucket whale industry. Philbrick doesn't assume any prior knowledge of the subject, and places the story of the Essex into its historical context.Several accounts of the Essex tragedy were written by its survivors, and those who knew and met them. Philbrick does an excellent job of weaving together these different tales, showing the possible biases and motives which may explain their differences. There certainly were an interesting cast of characters aboard the ship, and their personalities and failures are well developed.I'm a bit squeamish by nature, and the book did have be twitching in my seat a few times at the graphic descriptions. In fact, the story of starvation and its physiological effects on the sailors had me munching on tortilla chips, convincing myself that this would never happen to me!This is definitely worth reading, for those interested in the sea or for anyone who enjoys a well-written adventure."},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"\\"In the Heart of the Sea\\" is one of the best books that I have ever read, but the best thing about it is that it is a true story. The tale is highly influenced by the ship's cabin boy, Thomas Nickerson, who was fourteen and on board when the tragedy took place. The story begins in the prosperous whaling community of Nantuckett, offering a good deal of insight into the whaling occupations, as well as into an economy based on the resources obtained from whales. I never realized that Herman Melville based one of his greatest works, \\"Moby Dick\\", on the plight of this whaleship and its crew.Nathaniel Philbrick takes you on a journey that you will never forget, although, this sunken whaleship, who had the fame of the \\"Titanic\\" in its own time period, has almost been forgotten historically. To be on board through the omniscent eyes of a fourteen year old, is utterly amazing. Once I read about the hardships that these men went through, I realized how easy most of our lives are, and how much is taken for granted. This book is as much of a testimonial of human will as it is a documented masterpiece. After reading the book, it is easy to understand why Melville chose to embrace, and captivate this subject securing it a place in fictional literary history, but the non-fictional story is even better. I strongly recommend this book to everyone."},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"This is a very well written story, not so much about the terrible ordeal of surviving in an open boat at sea, but more about how a private, close-knit community survives by sending its sons around the world to hunt and kill and often-times die. The author knits his story together as a history lesson about the whaling industry, and uses as a core the sinking of the Essex. The resultant misery and cannibalism are treated very matter-of-factly, with just the right amount of emotionalism thrown in. This is a must-read book."},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"IN THE HEART OF THE SEA was a great book. Im in 4th grade and Im 10 years old. My teacher told me about this book and said it was GREAT. you should relly buy this book."},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"QUICK REVIEWNantucket, whaling, and survival at sea. This is what comprises this book, and you read them in that order. Some history of Nantucket and whaling can be slow &#65533; but interesting, but the story of survival is incredible, and on it&#65533;s own makes the book worth reading.FULL REVIEWThe amazing story of survival at sea is what brings readers to this book but it takes a little while to get to that story. The author sets up the picture of Nantucket at that time, and gives us a lot of information that actually is interesting but keeps us from getting to the story. You get the feeling that the author has done a lot of research (which he has) and wants to tell us everything he has learned. There&#65533;s nothing wrong with this, but it may be more than readers want to know. The story of the whale hitting and sinking the ship and the beginning of their long journey doesn&#65533;t come until chapter five. Before then we get Nantucket history, the preparation and sailing of their ship and it&#65533;s experiences with storms and whales and a few islands. Some of this is very intriguing but once we get to chapter five the reader&#65533;s attention is grabbed and is not let go until near the end of the book. The crew faces extreme dehydration and starvation to the point of death and the reader gets caught up in the desperate struggle for survival of these men. They are faced with, and make, very tough decisions which ultimately involves living and dying. You will be amazed at what the human body can endure and at the strength and determination of the spirit of those men. After this incredible story comes to a close the author tells us what went on after it was all over and the effect this story had. He then gives us more information on related elements which end up veering off into other stories. Readers may find it all very interesting or may see it as a prolonged ending. Over all this is a good, well-researched book that is worth reading."},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"This is not a book I thought I'd like, but I did. Great job by the author to convey an understanding of the time and the setting. Chilling realities become apparent as survival looms in the balance. Well worth reading."},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"DON'T WAIT ANOTHER DAY! Read this book. It is simply one of the best stories I've ever read. I am a high school history teacher and my US History class will be reading it soon. It is a story about a crew lost at sea but also sheds light into what life was like on Nantucket during the early/mid 1800's. For those who haven't been exposed to whaling history this is a great introduction."},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"An excellent read of the historical account of the sinking of the Essex. I found the historical aspects along with the added physiological and psycological analysis regarding the effects of exposure, dehydration and starvation to be intriguing. The history of cannabalism on the high seas was hereto unknown to me. Finally the irony associated with the leadership aspects and challenges of Captain Powell and his First Mate Owen Chase were quite interesting. I could not put this book down."},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"Highly recommended. Philbrick's research is boiled down to 300 pages that are interesting historically and scientifically, yet fun!"},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"\\"Just as the skinned corpses of buffaloes would soon dot the prairies of the American West, so did the headless grey remains of sperm whales litter the Pacific Ocean in the early nineteenth century\\" writes Nathaniel Philbrick in this superbly researched true story...a tale that was the inspiration for Melville's \\"Moby Dick\\".Being an animal rights person, I found the depictions of the whale killings, as well as the treatment of the tortoises, harrowing, but always keeping in mind that the cruelty goes on, and is now called \\"factory farming\\"...it doesn't lessen the horror of what was done for either greed or survival, but puts it into perspective.The book took me back to the 1820's, with vivid, but not overly worded descriptions, and one is much aided by 2 maps, 3 diagrams of the ship, a list of the crew, as well as many photos and illustrations.There are also copious notes, an extensive bibliography, and index.The first chapter tells us about early 19th century Nantucket, its history, booming economy, and its people, who \\"shared in a common, spiritually infused mission-to maintain a peaceful life on land, while raising bloody havoc at sea\\".With chapter 2, the voyage begins...with every page so compelling that I wasn't able to put the book down. A lot of the information was gleaned from a book written by the First Mate, Owen Chase, and from a notebook (not found until 1960), belonging to Thomas Nickerson, who was all of 14 when he became cabin boy on the Essex.The final chapter tells what happened to the survivors, and how the whaling industry, and life on Nantucket, changed in the following years...there is also an epilogue, that takes place in present day Nantucket.This is one of the most riveting books I've read. An unforgettable true adventure, stranger and more exciting than any fiction."},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"Philbrick not only tells the tragic story of the Essex, but provides details about the time period and other tragedies of the kind. I could not put this book down once the Essex was attacked by the whale."},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"Philbrick has written his book in the style of a \\"Docu-drama\\" on the TV. That is to say, this is neither a history of events, nor is it a novelisation. It hangs awkwardly in-between.On the one hand the author provides us with pages of notes at the end of the book, and makes this \\"Seem\\" like a well researched history of events. But on the other hand he injects excitement and character into the book by imagining the inner workings of the minds of those involved.At times, to illustrate sufferings or events, he leaps to other incidents (the Donner Party) and to studies (of thirst and hunger) to explain the decisions or points of view of the characters involved. This can be disorientating, but generally helps the modern reader to get to grips with the subject.What Philbrick singularly fails to do is to convey the reality of life aboard a whale ship to his readers. Many other books have done this far better. Dana's \\"Two years before the mast\\", and Melvilles \\"Moby Dick\\" give much more insight into the sailors lot, and there are many other well known incidents that Philbrick could have drawn upon to illustrate his story better.This is a light read, and interesting to someone who knows little or nothing about the subject. But for those who have read a lot on things nautical it comes across as shallow, and clearly an outsiders perspective."},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"A truly extraordinary account of the Whale Ship &quot;Essex&quot;, the tragedy of it's sinking and subsequent effect on her crew. The analysis of the social structure and hierarchy in the Nantucket community was particularly interesting.A good read!"},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"I can't quite put my finger on it, but it strikes me that there's a certain strain of superfluousness in the contemporary narrative nonfiction genre. I get the vague sense that there are all too many books coming out that are merely reheating slices of history that have been well documented, but in a way that makes them more digestible to the modern reader. This National Book Award winner is a perfect example. The \\"Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex\\" isn't exactly obscure -- Herman Melville drew upon it forMoby Dick, two accounts by survivors of the actual events exist, and Thomas Hefferman'sStove by a Whale: Owen Chase and the Essexhits pretty much all the parts of the story one really needs to know. So, while this book does flesh it all out a good deal more (and offers a great deal of added conjecture), it never feels particularly vital.Which is not to say it's not a decent read. That is, assuming you're interested in the popular nonfiction survival stories where men battle the elements, face great dangers, and at least some of them make it home to tell the tale (books likeInto Thin Air,Endurance,Miracle in the Andes,The Perfect Storm, etc.). It's not the kind of thing I usually pick up, but I read it for my book club and consider myself marginally glad I did so. The short version is that a Nantucket whaling ship set out in 1820 to harvest the seas and winds up sunk by a belligerent whale. The crew attempt to survive for something like 3 months on the open seas -- some are eaten by others and some make it home. The book is quite good a certain things: harrowing descriptions of starvation, the economics of 19th-century whaling, and the closed society of 19th-century Nantucket island. In fact, the parts describing the Quaker whaling society were the most interesting part of the book for me -- much more so than the drawn-out plight of the men adrift on the sea.I certainly wouldn't dissuade anyone from reading this, but nor would I give it a blanket recommendation. I guess if you like narrative nonfiction that casts its eye on some distant event and milks every last word from it, you could do a lot worse than this. Personally, I could have been satisfied with a longish essay on the topic instead."},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"One of the best and most interesting books I have ever read. I highly recommend it to anyone."},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"As Nathaniel Philbrick freely admits, history is replete with tales of shipwrecked castaways - and planewrecked rugger teams - eating each other. And the Essex was not the only whale boat to sink, nor even was it the only one to get rammed by a whale. Nor is N. Philbrick the only man to have written about this particular ship: leaving aside Herman Melville, Philbrick acknowledges and cites at length from three other authors who have written on the same subject, and two of them were actually on board.So while the book rips along at a jaunty pace, and is a pleasant enough read, it's never clear what its raison d'etre is, other than to cash in on the current appetite for strange but true tales about quirky but forgetten strugglers against the conventions and odds of history (you know, Fermat's Theorem, Longitude, that sort of thing).The learned author also fails to even consider, let alone answer, the point that, if the great offshore whaling grounds were in the South Pacific, why - instead of sailing there, around South America, from the New York region, didn't the Natucketers just up sticks and move to California? Would have saved them a lot of time, you'd think, not to mention the aggravation of rounding Cape Horn.A worthy enough effort, but it is a bit pointless, and inevitably it pales into comparison with Moby Dick."},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"Philbrick's award winning non-fiction retelling of the Essex tragedy captured my attention as a tale of family tragedy. As a father of teenage sons, I kept trying to imagine the lives of those families torn apart by the whaling industry and the misfortunes of the &quot;family&quot; of men on this whaling journey. Though Philbrick paints an oversimplified picture of the Quaker village life of Nantucket, once at sea, this book is hard to throw overboard.For two other non-fiction books on the family, take a look at THE FAMILY CLOISTER: BENEDICTINE WISDOM FOR THE HOME (winner of the national Catholic Press Association &quot;Family Life&quot; Book Award 2000), by David Robinson; and also by Robinson, THE CHRISTIAN FAMILY TOOLBOX: 52 BENEDICTINE ACTIVITIES FOR THE HOME (Crossroad, September 2001)."},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"I enjoyed &quot;In The Heart Of The Sea&quot; for about 200 pages, the first 3/4 of the book which is your basic stranded/survival story. Once the survivors are rescued, Philbrick loses his storytelling ability. Characters stumble all over each other in a confusing mismash. Even Philbrick's writing gets worse in the last 50 pages; there are several sentences towards the end of this book that are simply incomprehensible."},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"I usually tend to make a difference between fiction and non-fiction literature. This book proves though that a combination of both has its advantages as well (if you don't believe me, look at &quot;Moby Dick&quot;, which, by the way, has strong connections to the events described in &quot;In the Heart of the Sea&quot;: &quot;Moby Dick&quot; is a novel containing information about the whaling business as well as a fictional story about the hunt for the White Whale; those 2 parts melt into each other and, after their unification, they appear as one of the most powerful novels of all time). Non-fiction parts (which aren't separated from those I count to fiction) bring facts about the whaleship Essex, its world, the huge Sperm Whale that sinks the ship, and the crew of 21 men who must travel around half of the Pacific Ocean in small whaling boats to reach the saving shore of South America. After storms, whale and shark attacks, horrible hunger and thirst, only 8 men return home alive.Then there is this other part I tend to call fiction. Even though N. Philbrick, the author of this work, used memoirs written by 2 of the survivors to understand the characters of the whalers, I am still not sure how much truth is in those passages because even Philbrick confessed that both narrators didn't want to express the truth, but had intentions either to show off with their courage or to justify their behavior during the last weeks of their odyssey when the few survivors turned to real cannibalism. This uncertainty rises the suspense because you wonder if it is really the truth you read or simple suppositions by the author.At the end, the question what kind of literature this book belongs to is not important although you ask yourself this question all the time. Important is what it wanted to express, namely a real human tragedy in addition with strong emotions and unusual behavior you'll be shocked of sometimes (a few times I doubted the reasons why the humankind calls itself &quot;civilized&quot; whereas all other lifeforms on Earth are underdeveloped). Apart from the human tragedy, it is a story about the continuing war fought by humanity against nature, and it reminded me it would be better for us to make peace as soon as possible; otherwise we are all doomed. So, if you are interested in adventure or survival stories and want to find out more about the sea and/or the whaling business, read this book! If you'd like to have an approach to &quot;Moby Dick&quot;, this book is written for you! And last but not least, for people interested in human psychology under difficult conditions, &quot;In the Heart of the Sea&quot; is simply unavoidable."},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"Nathaniel Philbrick is not a squeamish man, and most readers (including me) will remember the...uh...culinary sections of this book long after the rest has faded away.The book's title is slightly misleading: while Philbrick does detail the story of the Essex, he spends large sections of the book setting the background with a discussion of the whaling industry and contemporary seafaring in general. This information is fascinating (if you don't care about eating anyone, perhaps you want to know how to process a whale carcass?), but often tangential to the story, and readers shouldn't expect a Jon-Krakauer-style narrative that grabs you by the collar on page one and never lets you go. But I still loved the book and would heartily recommend it to anyone."},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"The doings of the whaleship Essex make for spell-binding reading, and Nathaniel Philbrick did a great job with the personalities and conflicts. The ship sinks early in the book and the tiny whaleboats drift for many chapters.Philbrick seems to be looking for controversy and, finding none, having to drum some up:1) The book is down on Quakers -- condemning as hypocritical their business sense and profits. I don't know enough about Quakers to know whether they spoke publicly against prosperous business decisions, and Philbrick certainly did not inform me of any proof along these lines.2) The sexual needs of the wives of seagoing men took up quite a few pages -- what? They were Quakers? Obviously Quaker women shouldn't have sexual needs. Right?3) The book also seeks to make a scandal of the insular nature of Nantucketers. Color me shocked, I guess, that island people are insular and take care of their own.Lastly, it isn't a surprise to learn that the black sailors on board the Essex ate worst and died first. The book \\"Black Hands, White Sails\\"Black Hands, White Sailsspells out the unappealing career options available for many northern black men at this time -- I recommend reading that book to see why whaling was chosen by so many freedmen and escaped blacks.Best for capturing the states of mind of the men as they deteriorate, and the disastrous consequnce of having weak leadership in a crisis, the book was an entertaining and memorable read. Thanks, Mr. Philbrick."},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"This was a compelling story that kept me interested until the last page. Nathanial Philbrick told me more than I ever wanted to know about whaling in the early 19th century and the tragedy of the Essex. The actual sinking of the ship by a sperm whale is stunning enough, but the tale of survival by the crew members was even more remarkable. I would recommend this book to anyone."},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"Philbrick puts together a tale that transforms you into a crew member. The thrill of the chase, the fear of the dangers, and the exasperations and futilities of all of a whaler's life. He creates great scenarios without bogging down in too many details. The text and writing style moves you smoothly through all the pages to the end. Great read."},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"I plowed through this book more quickly than anything I've ever read. Simply awesome. The action and drama are like something out of a Hollywood blockbuster movie...but this was all real and it happened in the early 1800's. I read the author's Mayflower. This was better. He really brings old Nantucket and the whaling industry to life. I can't believe that anyone survived this horrible event. The book will run you through the ringer - but at the end it will leave you inspired by what humans are capable of when they have the will to live (even if that means some must die).

In the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries whaling was a major industry because, in the days before gas and electric lighting, oil lamps were the main form of illumination and whale oil, especially from the sperm whale, was in high demand for this purpose. A whaling industry had existed on the island of Nantucket, just off the coast of Massachusetts, ever since the 1690s, and by the time of the voyage of the \\"Essex\\" this industry had expanded until the island had become the whaling capital not merely of America but of the world. By the 1820s, however, over-exploitation had reduced the supply of whales in the North Atlantic, forcing whalers to make ever-longer journeys into first the South Atlantic, then into the Pacific. When the \\"Essex\\" sank she was more than a year into a voyage which was expected to last two-and-a-half-years. (The reviewer who asked why nobody thought to establish a new whaling centre closer to the whaling grounds should remember that in the 1820s the USA did not possess a coastline on the Pacific, and that South American countries were too far from the main markets for whale oil on America's eastern seaboard and in Europe, markets which an Atlantic island was ideally placed to serve. Nantucket only started to decline with the growth of the railways, which favoured mainland rivals such as New Bedford).The \\"Essex\\" sank when she was rammed by a huge bull sperm whale in the whaling grounds of the South Pacific. The twenty-one members of the crew were forced to take to three small whaleboats, with inadequate supplies of food and fresh water, hoping to reach the west coast of South America, some 2,000 miles to the east. There were, in fact, inhabited islands such as Tahiti and the Marquesas group which were much closer and would have been much easier to reach with the help of the prevailing winds, but the captain, George Pollard, ruled out this course of action, believing the Polynesian islanders to be bloodthirsty cannibals. Most of the crew perished through thirst or malnutrition; only eight survivors, including Pollard, were eventually rescued. Ironically, in view of their fears of the Polynesians, the crew were eventually forced to resort to cannibalism themselves in order to survive, eating the corpses of their dead companions. At least one man was deliberately killed to provide sustenance.Nathaniel Philbrick's book is based upon accounts of the disaster written by two surviving crew members. For many years the authoritative account was that published by Owen Chase, Pollard's first mate, shortly after his return to Nantucket. More recently, a second, unpublished, narrative has come to light, a manuscript written by the cabin boy, Thomas Nickerson, many years after the event, and Philbrick has drawn upon both Chase and Nickerson to produce his story. Besides narrating the story of the \\"Essex\\" and her crewmen, he also touches upon such matters as the history of whaling in Nantucket, life aboard whaling ships, the biology of sperm whales, the medical aspects of shipwreck, the history of survival cannibalism and theories of leadership. (Philbrick is often critical of Pollard's captaincy, regarding him as insufficiently authoritative and too easily influenced by his junior officers).One potentially interesting point not treated in much detail is the precise reason why the shipwrecked crew did not make for Tahiti, whose inhabitants were by 1820 predominantly Christian. The sailors seem to have clung firmly to a seventeenth-century Hobbesian view that the life of man in his natural state was \\"nasty, brutish and short\\". In the eighteenth century, however, this view began to give way to Rousseau's ideal of the gentle, pacific \\"noble savage\\", an ideal of which South Sea islanders were often seen as the perfect embodiment. (When the crew of HMS Bounty mutinied in the 1780s one of the causes was their desire to return to what they saw as an idyllic way of life on Tahiti; had they held the same prejudices as the crew of the \\"Essex\\" they would presumably have mutinied before reaching the island rather than set foot in a land of cannibals). It would have been interesting if the book had dealt more with these two conflicting views of \\"primitive\\" peoples and why American seamen clung so firmly to the earlier one, unlike their British counterparts of a generation before. One interesting fact is that several of the crew were black- a reminder that the history of pre-Civil War African-Americans is not merely the history of slavery. All those who survived the disaster, however, were white- a fact in which Philbrick sees possibly sinister implications.Philbrick tells us that the story of the \\"Essex\\" was once one of the best-known marine disasters of the nineteenth century, so well known that nearly every child in America read about it in school. Today, however, it is little remembered- perhaps oddly so, given that it inspired one of the great classics of American literature, Herman Melville's \\"Moby-Dick\\". This book, however, should revive interest in that story. Although it is a work of non-fiction written by an academic historian, it moves along at a brisk pace and often reads more like an enthralling, if grisly, seafaring yarn. That, however, should not diminish its value as history."},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"The sinking of the whaleship Essex in 1820 by an enraged sperm whale \\"was one of the most well-known marine disasters in of the nineteenth century,\\" writes Nathaniel Philbrick in \\"In the Heart of the Sea.\\" But until I picked up this book, I had never heard of it.Now I will never forget it.Philbrick does an outstanding job pulling together information from disparate sources to create a gripping account of the Essex's sinking and the crew's subsequent struggle to survive. The event was Herman Melville's inspiration for \\"Moby Dick.\\"The Essex sank in the middle of the Pacific, far from land, and its 20 men set out in three small boats in an effort to save themselves. Most of them wouldn't make it.It's a grim story and sometimes painful to read, but is also fascinating and dramatic. More than a tale of survival, this book is a look at human strengths and failings in desperate circumstances. \\"Like the Donner Party, the men of the Essex could have avoided disaster, but this does not diminish the extent of the men's sufferings, or their bravery and extraordinary discipline,\\" Philbrick writes.Setting the stage for the story of the Essex, Philbrick illuminates the world of 19th century whaling and the town at its heart, Nantucket, Massachusetts. It was a difficult lifestyle in which men went away to sea for years at a time, while their wives ran the families and the town. Often, the husbands didn't come back: About a quarter of adult Nantucket women were widows, Philbrick writes.Still, for young men and boys (they started on the ships as young as 15), whaling offered a chance for adventure and advancement. Once at sea, harsh realities set in. Philbrick notes the Natucketers' favorite treatment for seasickness: \\"The sufferer was made to swallow a piece of pork fat tied to a string, which was then pulled back up again. If the symptoms returned, the process was repeated.\\"I don't want to spoil anyone's reading of the story by saying too much about the events after the sinking, but there are some surprises. I like how Philbrick broadens his discussion of events by adding in scientific information on the difficulties of starvation, thirst and open-sea navigation. Two good maps in the book were helpful.If you like this sort of book, let me recommend two others. First, there's \\"Unbroken,\\" the new book by Laura Hillenbrand, about an American who survives a plane crash, a perilous raft trip and extraordinary abuse in Japanese POW camps during World War II. Another good read is \\"Adrift,\\" Steven Callahan's first-person account of floating across the Atlantic alone for 76 days in a life raft after his sailboat sank (it may have been hit by a whale, though he never knew for sure)."},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"This was one of the few books I've read that I knew the ending of before I even turned a page. And in reality, \\"In the Heart of the Sea\\" is one of those rare tales where the outcome isn't what makes the story compelling - it's how they arrive at it.Nathaniel Philbrick does a great job of appropriately setting the scene for the Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex. He goes into a decent history of Nantucket and its then-booming whaling industry, giving readers a sense of the social & economic pressures at work on the island and on the ships at sea.Philbrick approaches the entire story from the perspective of a man interested in the truth, without adding any drama to it. Dialogue is limited to what has been reported or written down. He doesn't attempt to make a whale attacking a ship any more exciting than it already is - and in the process he manages to keep his story clean, concise, and truthful.The tale of the Whaleship Essex is a story of poor decisions that continue to build on themselves until the captain and crew are well beyond the point of no return. Like theThe Donner Party, like the survivors ofAlive, the crew of the Essex is faced with one of the most challenging decisions any survivor must ever make. And even though you'll know this going in to the book, it is still totally worth the read."},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"Who doesn't know the first line of \\"Moby Dick,\\" except those who have never read it?Somehow, some way, I ended up having to read \\"Moby Dick\\" three times within a two year period and be tested on what color the sky was at 4 p.m. on a certain day in the book, what was the meaning of the fourth wave on the fifth day, and what did Ahab represent. All I can figure is, \\"Moby Dick\\" was a really big deal to the professors back when I was in college.Anyway, I can honestly say, after reading \\"Moby Dick\\" three times in such a short period, I was about sick of admiring this way-too-wordy piece of chunk bigger than the Bible. Though, I was thrilled to pieces watching Gregory Peck cling insanely to the top of the highest sinking mast in the movie on tv plenty of times and truly loved the book the first time I read it.Melville did us a great service by taking the time, 20 years after it happened, to write his version. And I love his alegorical book. But I also love the true story that his tale was based upon and thank Philbrick for bringing it to us.I just wish Philbrick had been able to locate even more personal records and dive even deeper into the truth.And, if bad jokes are allowed.....Here's one of my all-time favorites: \\"What's pink and scrapes the bottom of the ocean floor?\\""},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"What a great telling of a true tale. The story told in this way seems to me to be a much clearer rendition of truth by vertue of the extensive research done by the author and the use of several narratives for comparison. After all, no matter how we remember an incident, our perspective is always slanted, we only see it one way. Someone else will see soemthing different.I enjoyed it thoroughly and recommend it to anyone looking for the truth about how men will act under extreme conditions. Like it or not we do not really know how we would act as individuals, until we are actually put in a certain spot. You might think you know what you would do, but think again, you don't!"},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"The story of the whaleship Essex was well known in the 19th century and most likely formed the inspiration for Herman Melville's novel MOBY DICK. In the middle of the Pacific Ocean in November 1820, the 238-ton Essex was rammed and sunk by an angry sperm whale. Over the next three months and 4,500 miles, the dwindling crew fought the open sea and each other in a struggle for survival. Although the story no longer resides in our national consciousness, it is a story worth telling and Nathaniel Philbrook does an admirable job of it with IN THE HEART OF THE SEA.Piecing together first-person accounts, Philbrook recreates the final voyage of the Essex in remarkable detail. He provides a vivid picture of the life and work aboard a Nantucket whaler in the early days of the whale trade. However, the bulk of IN THE HEART OF THE SEA concerns the events following the sinking of the Essex as the crew of twenty officers and men crowded into three small, open whaleboats pondering their fate. After three months, two whaleboats (now separated by hundreds of miles) and five men remained and were eventually rescued off the Chilean coast.The story of survival on the high seas is both harrowing and moving: the suffering unimaginable. Resorting to cannibalism to sustain themselves, at one point they had to draw lots rather than wait for the next man to die. Again due to the accounts of survivors, Philbrook is able to recreate these months in astonishing detail.What emerges is a multi-faceted book which not only tells a compelling tale of high adventure and survival, but also illustrates beautifully a lost era in American history. I highly recommend this book.Jeremy W. Forstadt"},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"This is a great nautical introduction for the landlubber. Philbrick does a great job of telling the straight story of Nantucket, of whaling, of this journey, of what happened to the men, and of what happened to their legend.Philbrick especially does a great job of filling-in-the-blanks when the historical record is thin. When the men are adrift with minimal food for weeks, he uses WWII-era experiments to speculate what probably happened to the men's physiology and psychology. He interviews contemporary whale experts to evaluate the likelihood of the reputed whale behavior.Overall, a great story well-told and well-researched, and deserving of the National Book Award.

The book begins with a history of Nantucket and whaling, immersing the reader in the climate and culture of life on the eastern seaboard in the early 19th century. While being very educational, it describes the attempts at survival by the crew who had to overcome starvation and dehydration in order to live. It creates the natural questions in the reader, &quot;What would I do in a similar situation?&quot; and the ultimate questions, &quot;Would I be able to eat my shipmates in order to survive?&quot;and &quot;What would I be like after the ordeal?&quot;Nathaniel Philbrick does an outstanding job of introducing and explaining subjects related to the many facets of whaling and the sea. He describes life on a whaleboat, the behavior of sperm whales, the psychology of survival, starvation and cannibalism.

The 20-man crew, forced to take to three whaleboats as the Essex sank after it was rammed by the whale, faced a horrific three-month ordeal that included subsistence living on a coral island, hunger and thirst at sea, and ultimately cannibalism. Remarkably, five men survived, and several of them committed the tale to paper. Philbrick's account is partially inspired by new details uncovered in the memoirs of Thomas Nickerson, the Essex's cabin boy, which were only published in the 1980s. It has long been known that Herman Melville's MOBY DICK was inspired, at least in part, by what happened to the Essex. Philbrick gives us the whys and hows, and much more besides, in these densely packed 240 pages. (Melville, who was not known for concision in his writing, is probably shaking his head somewhere and wondering how Philbrick was able to accomplish the feat.)Philbrick takes us through the history of Nantucket Island and the Quaker influences that shaped its culture, a description of the whaling industry of the 19th century, observations on the biology of whales, and, when the time comes, a rather gruesome (but necessary) discussion of the physiology of extreme hunger and thirst. He also has important observations to make about the state of race relations among the Nantucket whalers (not as charitable as one might expect, given the Quakers' color-blind reputation) and the deep divisions between the \\"Nantucket men\\" and the off-islanders, or \\"coofs,\\" who were brought in to fill out whaling crews as the demand for manpower grew. These last are not mere sociological digressions; the first victims of the cannibalism were African-American, and the dispensation of the personnel in the whaleboats owed a lot to \\"in-group\\" and \\"out-group\\" dynamics. Throughout, Philbrick knows just the right amount of detail to bring into his narrative without bogging it down.At Stevenson University, we've used this book as a common reading in our Freshman Science Seminar sections. Despite the somewhat grotesque subject matter and the occasional deployment of technical sailing terms and the like, this book is an excellent way to show students, as well as the general public, how science in the most \\"general\\" sense has intersected with other elements of American culture in the past, and is a good jumping-off point to discuss similar interactions of today."},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"How much interesting trivia can you pack into one book???Non-fiction is usually not my reading choice, too many dreary details or written by an expert in the given field but with little talent for writing.

Herman Melville got me interested in the Nantucket whaling industry in the early 1800s.

The ship's crew are forced to get whatever provisions they can load from the sinking ship and attempt to get back to civilization in their three whaling boats. They are stranded in the middle of the Pacific Ocean about as far from civilization as anywhere on earth. Nathaniel Philbrick tells the story of the Essex from the beginning in Nantucket, to their adventures in the Atlantic, to their Pacific boat ramming and the terrible hardships endured, to the final rescue (for some). Most of the knowledge about this tragedy was written by the ship's first mate Owen Chase, in his book \\"Narrative of the Most Extraordinary and Distressing Shipwreck of the Whale-Ship Essex\\", published in 1821. Nathaniel Philbrick tells the story with the added information from the writings of the youngest crew member, Thomas Nickerson. These notebook writings where found around 1980.

He did almost as well constructing life on a whaleship. The post-disaster struggle for survival and ultimate rescue was carefully well-told. Philbrick should have wrapped up the story at that point with a brief what became of them epilogue.Instead, the book begins to slog along with minutia of the survivors' lives (or some of the survivors, an overdone footnotes epic, and an exhaustive bibliography.

Also, it is astounding to read about and consider what the men when through during their three months in the open whaleboats after the Essex sank. Philbrick augments this part of the narrative with information gleaned from contemporary medical studies and accounts of persons who have been subject to starvation and lethal dehydration.I can't imagine what it must have been like to contemplate eating the flesh of one's comrades in order to survive, to suck the marrow from their bones to avoid dying of thirst.

He sets the stage by informing the reader of the origins of the Nantucket whaling industry and its quest for whale oil, a product used in lighting lanterns which extended the day until displaced by Edison's electric light bulb. You'll learn a lot about the social makeup of 19th century whaling communities and the ships that supported their economies. You'll learn about navigation techniques and you'll also learn about what went into provisioning such surprisingly large ocean going craft. You'll learn what desparate men due when faced with starvation and death at sea in a small boat.It's a nicely paced tome which keeps your interest, all within the crux of a tale founded in the elements of survival as lived by the sailors on the whaleship Essex. Theirs is a true quest for survival, the kind that is real and for keeps. It's a page turner, don't miss it."},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"Nat Philbirck's In The Heart Of The Sea is an amazing story of courage and survival at sea. Having read numerous survival stories, as well as Melville's classic Moby Dick (which was partly based on the Essex tragedy) I can say this tale is unmatched by any other.Philbrick's easy style and immense knowledge of the Nantucket Whaling Industy make this one of the easiest and most enjoyable books I've ever come across. After reading this the reader will probably know more about Sperm Whales then he/she ever wanted to know. This isn't a bad thing.The tale takes place in 1819-20, during which the Essex sailed from Nantucket to the Pacific in search of whales. The best part, of course, is the tale of what happens after the ship is sunk and the survivors, hundreds of miles away from any land, embark on a 93 day journey which will lead through storms, delerium, and finally, canibalism. The decisions and actions they are forced to take are so horrible no man should ever have to go through this ordeal. The author even details what it is like not only to slowly die of starvation, but of dehydration and exposure to the elements.If you enjoyed The Perfect Storm, you will certainly enjoy this book. It's a Classic!"},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"I'm sure if you're reading this review, you already know the tragic story of the whaleship Essex just like I did when I bought this book. However what I didn't know was the history of Nantucket, the birth of the whaling industry and the many other shipwreck stories that ended in cannabilism.This book is extensively researched from every aspect with an impressive bibliography that led me to read other books by the time I was finished with this one. It is impossible NOT to read this book in one sitting. It's up to you now if you want to read it or not. 'Nuff said!"},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"This book is not one of my &quot;typical&quot; reads. I bought it for my mother as a gift, and after reading a little about it - I got hooked. It is a really good book. I loved the ending"},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"In The Heart Of The Sea: The Tragedy Of The Whaleship Essex is a thrilling tale of the clannish island community of Nantucket, which launched the whaling ship Essex, and then received those of its sailors who survived against all odds. Author Nathaniel Philbrick drew upon newly discovered documents (including an account written by Thomas Nickerson, the ship's cabin boy, uncovered in an attic in New York in 1981) and exhaustive original research to tell of the Essex maritime disaster. Narrator Edward Herrmann brings Philbrick's account vividly to life with a pulsating story of class, race, work, family, and men who went to the sea hunting for the whale. A superb audiobook production."},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"It was an experience to read an epic such as In The Heart of the Sea while visiting Cape Cod. The descriptions of the whale boats, Nantucket Island and its people, and the science of whaling itself was extraordinary. Mr. Philbrick's research and writing skills were quite evident in each chapter. I felt as if I were on the small boat with Chase and found myself asking questions about human survival and how far I would go to live another day."},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"Very interesting and fast paced retelling of a truely superhuman survival story; very well researched and written."},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"One thing about early nineteenth century life in the US is that it was far less safe than what we now enjoy. A perfect example of a dangerous life in that time is what those in the whaling industry faced: venturing onto the high seas with crude instruments, incomplete and inaccurate information, and the constant threat of violent storms. Add to that the pursuit of giant sperm whales in small whaling boats launched from the main whaling vessel with the intent of killing them for their bodily oils. That is the business in which virtually the entire Nantucket community of some seven thousand was engaged for most of the eighteenth and the first half of the nineteenth century. The fact that one-quarter of Nantucket children and wives were without fathers and husbands is one indication of the hazards of the whaling business.Probably no better tale exists that can demonstrate the perils of the open seas and the courage needed to persevere than that of the men of the whaleship Essex in their disastrous journey to collect whale oil. The author is from a family long interested in the sea and moved to Nantucket in the 1980s with the intent of telling this astonishing story. He provides a great deal of background on the rise of Nantucket to becoming the whaling center of the world, on general whaling life, business, and ships, and about whales: habits, how to hunt them, and how to obtain their oil.The Essex left Nantucket headed for the eastern Pacific Ocean, the premier grounds for sperm whales, on Aug 12, 1819, never to return. In perhaps a forewarning of what was to come, on the journey to the Pacific, the Essex endured a crippling storm in the Atlantic and the loss of whaling boats both from the storm and encounters with whales. Those incidents were merely a prelude to the sinking of the Essex when a huge sperm whale rammed the ship 1500 miles west of Peru in what was known as the Offshore Ground on Nov 20, 1820.The book focuses on the extraordinary survival efforts of the twenty-man crew, dumped into the Pacific in three, twenty-five-foot whaling boats. Only eight men survived the ordeal. It is from the writings and testimony of three of them that the author was able to piece together this unbelievable and tragic story. It should be noted that many of these \\"men\\" would be regarded as teenagers in our lexicon.The path of the three boats from the time of the sinking until two of them were rescued on Feb 18, and Feb 23, 1821, (the third boat disappeared at night on Jan 29) is followed very closely including a very fortuitous, yet ultimately frustrating, one-week stop on volcanic and deserted Henderson Island thirty days after the destruction of the Essex. The men of the Essex had to contend with the constant threat of their boats being destroyed or becoming unworthy for the sea either from harsh weather and huge waves or from the flimsy construction used for whaling boats and with the fear that their supplies would be lost or ruined. However, the author goes well beyond route details by exploring the physiology and psychology of trying to survive in harsh conditions, including the effects of starvation.By far the most controversial revelation in this survival saga, not only to those in Nantucket but to modern readers, is the resort to cannibalism in the depths of their deprivation that began sixty days into the wanderings. There were simply insufficient supplies of food and water to sustain life, and men began dying. Each boat had a sufficiently large stone on which to burn wood and cook the human flesh. On one boat the cruel process of drawing lots to see who would be sacrificed occurred. Cannibalism in the course of disasters was not unknown; however, it was seldom spoken of. It is doubtful that any of the men of the Essex would have survived without it. A rather distasteful fact is that the first four men eaten were black men. Countering the racial implications, the author does point out that the body fat content of those four was less than the others at the start of the journey, giving them perhaps less reserves on which to survive.The Essex saga is both exasperating and almost impossible to comprehend for today's reader. In the modern era with virtually the entire surface of the earth known and mapped with vast communications networks, it is extremely difficult to appreciate the courage that it took for our forebears to face the unknown - not only the Nantucket sailors, but all those who crossed the Atlantic or journeyed to the far West. What is tragic about the Essex episode is that the men made a decision to attempt to reach the coast of South America going against prevailing southeastern winds. They held the erroneous view that islands to the west, easily reachable in a week or two, were inhabited by people who would harm them. In fact, it was somewhat known at the time that the islands were friendly stops.The personalities of the men of the Essex were very important concerning choices and their survival. The captain George Pollard, Jr., and the first mate Owen Chase, both of whom survived, almost reversed roles on this journey with Chase overruling Pollard on the all-important decision concerning which direction to take to find safe harbor. Chase made the wrong choice, yet his calmness and encouragement of the men, as well as Pollard's, were key to making it to the coast of South America where they were rescued.In many ways this is a tale of excess and overreach. The whaling businessmen of Nantucket pursued whale oil with a zeal that precluded precautions. They risked financial loss, but it was the men on the whaling ships who put their lives at risk. It is ironic that by mid-century Nantucket was scarcely in the whaling business. It brings the fanatical drive for profit into question. Perhaps there was room for a moderate and safer approach. The Nantucket economy is now based on tourism and large vacation homes. Their whaling history is acknowledged but downplayed - burnished according to the author. It would hardly do to have the predicament of the men of the Essex looked at too closely."},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"Philbrick's book reads a lot like Sebastian Junger's &quot;The Perfect Storm.&quot; Like Junger, he details life in a fishing community and documents a seafaring trajedy that shook the town. Similar to Junger's description of drowning, Philbrick provides a graphic description of death by dehydration to emphasize what the fishermen were experiencing as they drifted for three months in open whaleboats on the vast Pacific Ocean. The main difference between Philbrick's account and Jungers is that some of Philbrick's fisherman lived to tell the tale. Philbrick is an excellent storyteller who brings his subject alive. Anyone with an interest in either the sea or a good adventure story will love this book."},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"The modern reader believes in the many-little-men theory of history. He demands the story not of Napoleon or of the French economic climate at the turn of the 19th Century, but of Pierre from Alsace who fought in the ranks. Philbrick has, therefore, found the whaling industry's most interesting Pierre from Alsace: the Essex.I'll not repeat the tale of that cursed ship here; you can find it in enough other places on this page. But I will note that what I like best about this book is the way Philbrick uses the story of the Essex as a narrative thread to hold together a broader story about the whaling industry as a whole. Since these historical details must necessarily accommodate the narrative thread, we are left at times with a partial picture of the industry -- we watch the crew take a whale apart, but never learn why Nantucket would remain the home base for men who worked in the Pacific.What emerges is a surprisingly touching tribute to the Nantucket whalers, but little insight into the place that produced the whaling culture. For readers seeking that context, I would recommend Diana Muir's Reflections in Bullough's Pond, a wonderful book that does much to allow the reader to understand the men of the Essex in the context of New England's history."},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"Fascinating true story of whaling ship Essex, recounting not only its fate, but also the background of its sailors and life on board a whaler. Great mix of suspense and history, made even more riveting because its true. If you enjoyed \\"Perfect Storm\\" or \\"Into Thin Air\\", you'll love this one even more."},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"This is one of the best history books I have ever read. Although the story itself draws you into the lives and history of the whale ships of Nantucket, the author does a wonderful job giving you history and painting a picture of the lives of the men in the book. Some history books are so dense, you lose interest after a few chapters, but this one kept me reading late into the night."},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"Having put off reading this book for years, either because of or despite my familiarity with its subject, I found a lot to annoy and disappoint. Philbrick had virtually no primary sources beyond the old original narratives by the survivors, so he padded the story out with side notes about whales and cannibalism and medical studies of starvation.Much excellent research there, and Philbrick's chatty endnotes are superb, possibly the best part of the book. But I found these digressions on natural history intrusive. They disrupt the main narrative. There you are, dying of thirst and hunger in the South Pacific, when suddenly the action stops and in trots old Nate with his big research volume, eager to bore you with three pages of extra material he just stumbled across...'Twere better, mayhaps, to tell the main narrative quickly and smoothly, then spend the rest of the book discussing the curious and toothsome aspects of whaling and the Essex disaster. I suspect Philbrick himself would have preferred to do the book this way, but got hornswoggled by an agent or editor eager to produce another true-life ripping-yarn bestseller after the manner of 'Longitude' and 'The Surgeon of Crowthorne'. Anyhow, as I say, the endnotes are the real tasty meat. Philbrick obviously had more fun and freedom here, and was able to avoid the awkward transitions found in the main text.I felt there were not nearly enough illustrations in this book. For Captain Pollard there is not a single portrait. Not a painting, not a photograph. There is no clear picture of a whaleboat, either. It would be nice to get a sense of what the lonely whaleboats looked when they reached the end of their journeys. Surely the publisher could have spared a few thousand dollars to hire an illustrator, and not merely limited us to pictures in the public domain. What cheapskates. Why do publishers skimp on the visuals these days?"},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"In \\"In the Heart of the Sea,\\" Nathaniel Philbrick writes a fascinating and horrifying account of what happened to a group of sailors whose whaleship Essex was attacked and sunk by a sperm whale in the Offshore Ground of the Pacific on November 20, 1820. He presents excellent detail on what these men went through during several months in open whaleboats alone in the Pacific ocean with little more than several ounces of water and hard tack a day. Most of these men did not survive. Those who remained in the boats after a stop at an island who lived to be rescued did so by committing horrific acts of survival.Among other sources, Philbrick uses accounts of two of the survivors. One of the accounts, written by first mate Owen Chase, was published not long after they were rescued. An account by cabin boy Thomas Nickerson, written late in his life, was not published until the Nantucket Historical Association released limited copies in 1984. This account offers information about storm damage to the Essex that occurred early in its voyage that was not deemed important by Chase as well as additional information not offered in the Chase book. Philbrick also incorporates other source materials to describe as best as possible what the men went through suffering progressive stages of starvation, dehydration, hypothermia, hypernatremia (excess salt), and even a lack of magnesium that can cause bizarre and violent behavior. Sources used include a study on starvation done by the University of Minnesota's Laboratory of Physiological Hygiene during World War II and other accounts of shipwrecks.Philbrick also conducts excellent analysis of those involved in the tragedy. He compares the leadership styles of Captain Pollard and first mate Chase. Their personalities actually had them reversing roles. On the ultimate decision immediately following the destruction of the Essex, Philbrick notes: \\"Only a Nantucketer in November 1820 possessed the necessary combination of arrogance, ignorance, and xenophobia to shun a beckoning (albeit unknown) island and choose instead an open-sea voyage of several thousand miles\\" (pg. 100). He also explains how, with female whales living together to take care of their young and adult males leaving for higher altitudes returning only intermittently, the Nantucketer's life \\"mimicked that of their prey\\" (pg. 71). \\"In the Heart of the Sea\\" is not only an illuminating account of a tragedy but also covers the life and mentality of Nantucket during a time when whaling dominated.The book ends with information on what happened to the survivors, how their story was received by Nantucketers and the legacy of whaling on Nantucket today. Included are two sections of glossy, black & white photos and illustrations and two important maps covering the voyage of the Essex and the route taken by the whaleboats. What the men on those whaleboats did to survive will not be soon forgotten by anyone who reads \\"In the Heart of the Sea.\\""},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"First let me say I am a big fan of survival against all odds types of books. I have read and loved Alive, Forever on the Mountain, In Harms Way, etc. This would not rank up to those standards in my opinion. Of course those three books I mentioned had a big advantage - actual survivors for the author to interview. This event took place in 1820 so the author had less to go on. All that being said, if you are a fan of survival books this is worthwhile. A 3 out 5 sounds right on."},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"I adore tales of survival, especially when set at sea and this is truly one of the best. That it is so well- conceived and written puts it on my personal list of top ten non-fiction books. It's a real page turner, you won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"About ten years after it was written, In the Heart of the Sea is rapidly becoming one of the sea adventure classics. Unlike many survival classics, it doesn't have an eye-grabbing title. Many people probably miss it when they search for true adventure stories. However, it is one of the more excellent accounts of such experiences. It never lags into mediocrity or tedium but maintains a steady line of tension which keeps the reader motivated. There are, of course, other similar tales of whaling voyages and tragedies, but that doesn't matter. This story is unique in some ways and I came to care about the characters. Philbrick did his homework and also knows his craft. You cannot go wrong in picking up this book."},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"If you are considering changing carrers to become a nineteenth century whaler, you might want to read this book about whaling, tragedy. cannibalism, and survivial. It has it all. Philbrick has done an excellent job telling the story of the doomed whaler, Essex. It's story is supposedly what Melville based Moby Dick on. It is a page turner. The author brings into the story other old and new survival tales and does a great job keeping the reader involved. The good news is that it is a great book. The bad news is that you might want to reconsider any plans you might be entertaining to buy a harpoon and become a whaler."},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"This review refers to \\"In The Heart Of The Sea\\" by Nathaniel PhilbrickNathaniel Philbrick leaves no stone unturned in this very tragic and complex, but true account of the wreck and sinking of The Whaleship Essex. Rammed by a huge sperm whale, that from all accounts was a definite attack on the ship, the crew, men who lived and profited by the sea and were the slayers of whales for the precious oil provided, were now the victims as the hunted became the hunter. It is an incredible story of man's will to survive against all odds, that was the inspiration for Melville's \\"Moby Dick\\".Philbrick immediately draws you into not only the lives of the Essex's crew members, but the entire town of Nantucket, from where the ship sailed,detailing the close-knit families, the women's roles and the daily life in Nantucket. Often revealing some very intimate details. The life on board a whaling ship, the hardships of the journey for both the crew and their families, and the journey itself through the vast ocean are all very much a part of this story.You will feel like you have gone back in time to 1820, and are there with them, as the whale attacks the ship, the men nearly frozen by horror and disbelief, and the beginning of a long, horrifying journey,a fight to stay alive under some of the worst conditions imaginable.For thousands of miles, and many months, I was constantly amazed at their ingenuity, and stamina as they tried to find safety, food and water. Steering clear of islands they thought might be inhabited by cannibals, they later found they had to resort to that themselves. Questions still remain as to the actual circumstances that occurred.A handful of survivors left to tell the story, not all agreeing on some points, but enough so that this tragedy at sea and the men who lost their lives as well as those that survived may be remembered for their bravery. Philbrick delves into all the details, from the people involved, to procedures at sea, and even what became of the survivors through the years.The book is so well written, that it will grab you right away and won't let you go. Sometimes you have to keep in mind that this amazing tale is not an adventure novel.For those who may prefer an audio editionIn The Heart Of The Sea: The Tragedy Of The Whaleship Essex... is an excellent reading . Narrator Scott Brick sets the tone and captures the importance,the tragic events, and the emotions involved. It is unabridged. For details of the audio edition see my review of 9/14/06.A book that will certainly get read again and again. Highly recommended read for anyone, but for those who love tales of the sea...an account so vivid of this tragic story at sea, you may want to pack some Dramaine for the ride.Enjoy the read....Laurie"},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"Nathanal Philbrick (author of the recent \\"Mayflower,\\" another essential read) dug deep into the Nantucket whaling community and the true story of the loss of the Whaleship Essex. The story of the Essex, the one that inspired Melville's \\"The Whale\\" a.k.a. Moby , is one those essential stories that I believe every american should know. Philbrick's writing makes that lesson an easy one to absorb. What I like about his writing is that he leaves you with the impression that he did ALL the homework the world would allow on the subject.Like Joseph Ellis does with George Washinton in \\"His Excellency,\\" Philbrick quite obviosuly did read everything there is on the subject before putting his own words down. Which is to say that the work doesn't leave you wondering...is this opinion, or fact? Philbrick made himself the world's leading authority first....then wrote the book.Five Stars and secure on the Top 100 of my Must Read list."},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"This book is realistically written. The author draws you in by using historical facts along with his thoughts on how the actual men felt by going thru this ordeal. It provides the realism of the story, since it true to fact. It is a good read that it hard to put down. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes true stories and stories related to the sea in past history. I can see how Herman Melville brought this to life."},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"After arriving in the mail, it took but a few hours to indulge all Mr Philbrick had written about the 'Essex', and the life by which a Nantucketer lived in the apex of its whaling might. Mr Philbrick deftly combines the true events of the 'Essex' from numerous written accounts, details which fill in the story with the concepts of whaling, and superb analysis of physical and psychological effects of the events which the men endured. He also uses his own professional knowledge to speculate about certain events where true facts were missing.Through cementing all these , Mr Philbrick creates a work which engrosses the reader into what whaling meant to the men on those ships, and the gruesomeness of their daily lives. Mr Philbrick obviously did his homework for this novel, which results in a rewarding experience for the reader.HIGHLY recommended."},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"I am a Nantucket native living in Hawaii...this book took me back in time as well as back home...incredible...I could not put it down!

Read it, you wont be sorry."},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"The wreck of the whaleship &quot;Essex&quot; went on to inspire Herman Melville to write &quot;Moby Dick,&quot; but ironically, Melville ended his epic tome with a wreck and a crazed whale. Nathaniel Philbrick's &quot;In the Heart of the Sea&quot; begins--after some Nantucket and whale industry background--with the real-life &quot;Essex&quot; wreck and follows the crew through their several-months-long journey around the sea. Working with remarkably little first-hand material--and practically no direct quotations--Philbrick somehow manages to raise up a living, breathing cast of characters who, through a horrific encounter with a seemingly enraged whale, find themselves literally adrift on the ocean with little direction, scant food and water, and fateful disagreement as to their overall plan. Philbrick does an especially fine job sketching &quot;a day in the life&quot; of the typical Nantucketer, showing it to be a place where women could be proudly independent as their husbands and beaux went off to sea for years at a time and they stayed behind to manage hearth and home and most of the island's businesses. That Nantucket began its American life as a proudly insular community which now depends on an influx of strangers (i. e., island vacationers) each year to maintain cash flow is but one of the many ironies evident in this superb book."},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"Nathaniel Philbrick gives us a well-rounded study of life in the whaling town of Nantucket in the early 1800's. Drawing you into the machinations of life there &amp; the motivations of its people, you find you are fully engrossed in a page-turner. I enjoyed the book, and found myself having vivid dreams of life on the sea,(and a few nightmares).Having listened to the complaints of students who can't get through Moby Dick, I would implore them to read this fascinating &amp; historical account first... This book is written well for wide appeal."},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"In The Heart of The Sea won the National Book Award for a reason. Philbrick's attention to detail, his research, and his style all make this incredibly tragic story come alive in a very fresh way. There were moments when I felt driven to tears, moments when I was completely disgusted, and moments when I couldn't help but laugh. This book is good for anyone interested in whaling, the ocean, survival stories, or just an amazing read."},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"You will feel like you were along for the ride. Don't let anyone steer you away from this one. It is a rare good read. Any criticisms are trivial compared with the depth and feel of the history and adventure provided in this book. Just read it."},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"I am ashamed to admit that I have never read Moby Dick. After all, it's one of those classics that everyone is supposed to have read. The premise of the story never appealed to me, before now. I knew before I even started reading In the Heart of the Sea that this was the true story that Moby Dick was based on. Herman Melville actually went over to Nantucket to talk to the captain of the boat. I was pleasantly surprised when I found myself engrossed in the author's first hand accounts. I felt as if I had been transported back almost three hundred years in time. Nantucket and its society during the early nineteenth century is described with breathtaking vividness. It was a bustling town peopled with the women who ran it and their children. The men who were whalers, were rarely home. They would be gone for two to three years at a time only to ship out again after a few months of being home. Later on it is noted by the author how similar this lifestyle was to that of the whales which they hunted. The circumstances which surrounded the eventual destruction of the Essex are fascinating. This is followed by a series of mistakes made by the captain and officers which eerily reminded me of the Titanic's sinking almost 100 years later. The fact that lives were lost from the Essex crew, was not surprising. The fact that anyone survived at all is miraculous."},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"This is the true story that inspired Melville to write &quot;Moby Dick&quot;. A Nantucket whaleship, the Essex, is rammed by a sperm whale in the Pacific, thousands of miles from land. The crew escape in 3 whaleboats, and begin a voyage that is both inspiring and terrifying. Afraid of supposed cannibals on the islands to the west, they resolve to sail south and east, to the shore of South America, fighting both the prevailing winds and their own meager supplies of food and fresh water. I will not spoil the ending of this ordeal with further details, suffice it to say the reader is in for a recounting of both tragedy and perseverence that easily ranks with such modern classics as &quot;The Perfect Storm&quot; and &quot;Into Thin Air&quot;."},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"I thought this book dripped with history and detail. Not since &quot;Two Years Before The Mast&quot; have I felt the excitement of trimming the rigging as they approached the Horn and beyond. Largely compiled of first hand accounts, and the facenating history of Nantucket, it was an real Nautical page turner, a real salty book. As for the endeavors of the poor men of the Essex, you grow so close to them you start to sympathize with them, and ultimately to forgive them. It is a well told story of heros and the possibility in any of us to rise to the moment, come together and perserver against the most dire odds in a merciless frontier. I am most pleased to recomend this book to any in question of the human spirit, or to those who just want to know what it was like to go a whaleing."},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"This story has to be one of the most astonishing tales of survival in recorded history. Before I say more, let me caution you that this story (and parts of this review) is not for those with weak stomachs.After their ship is disabled by an attacking sperm whale, the survivors find themselves on three open boats in the middle of the Pacific Ocean over 2,000 miles from their targeted landfall in South America. With luck, they will make it in 30 days. They soon find themselves in a stall as the winds fail to cooperate, except to provide severe storms that threaten to capsize the boats.Soon, all the food is encrusted with salt and everyone is suffering with severe dehydration. Then things start to get worse! I won't go further, but you have an amazing story of survival ahead of you.Two of the few survivors of this terrible ordeal later committed their experiences to writing, which provide great resources for this well-researched book.At another level, the book is also extremely interesting because these experiences were important influences on Herman Melville's writing of the American classic, Moby Dick. The book makes the connection, including how Melville came to learn the story.At a third level, the book is a fascinating history of whaling around 1920. If you are like me, you will cringe when the whalers devastate island after island. But that's not the limit to their willingness to use nature to their own advantage.The ultimate irony is that the survivors went the wrong way. Those from Nantucket did not know about Tahiti and Hawaii, and chose not to go in either of those directions -- either of which would have provided more rapid safety and comfort. The primary reason they chose not to go in these directions is because they feared running into cannibals. Soon the survivors were studying the remains of dead shipmates with hunger. And then it gets worse.So, you have three different kinds of books to read here, anyone of which could be enormously enjoyable to you. Get ready for the trip of your life!"},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"Couldn't put the book down. This event in our own history is well researched by Mr. Philbrick's, his work is a pleasure to read. Would highly recommend to anyone who enjoys either reading history or about the sea."},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"Since there have been so many excellent reviews already, I'll make mine short. This book is a well researched, detailed, and thoroughly fascinating account of the true tragedy, that Melville used as inspiration for his \\"Moby Dick\\". I read it just before visiting Nantucket, the year it was first published. It was simply a great read before our visit...a visit we have repeated many times since then. The book helped make the island come alive, and I felt enriched for reading it. The history of a place...is the story of people, of their imaginations, of their ingenuity, of their courage, of their weaknesses, of their passions, of their failures, and of their love and forgiveness. This book, from beginning to end, is about the people of Nantucket...and it's well worth the read.It's a story, by the way, that still continues, for both good and ill, as the island has reinvented itself, yet again."},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"Having read the Mayflower by Mr. Philbrick some time ago and knowing how he was motivated to write that book, it interested me as to his motivation for this book. I was not dissapointed as the book is through in facts and presentation. As you already know, his writing is very vivid and complete not leaving the reader constantly guessing or speculating as to what transpired. Also it was a selection for our Sailing Book Club which motivated us to read it. Glad we did."},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"If you have any interest in American history, Nantucket whaling, or a great sea story....then you must read this book. This true story is what Moby Dick was based upon."},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"As a summer resident of Nantucket and an avid Philbrick reader this book in my mind is his best. The rich detail of the whaleship Essex, the tragedy bestowed upon them and the gripping tale of survival and return and then renewal of a life at sea is enthralling."},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"Well written and horrifying account of the Essex. I am from Boston and I was not aware of the story. Found the book in a store on Nantucket a over the summer. I am glad I remembered to order it when I came home from vaca. If your looking for an adventure story, without a Disney ending,,,,then this book is for you."},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"This harrowing, hair-raising adventure story and testament to American ingenuity and resourcefulness is a thrill to read. Philbrick recounts the disaster of the Whaleship Essex largely relying on a careful selection of accounts from the memoirs of First Mate Owen Chase and Boatsteerer Thomas Nickerson that are peppered with interesting and informative annotations from a wealth of other sources.Clearly the author has an advantage in writing about such an exciting and well documented story, but Philbrick sets himself apart in that he lacks the pretension and glibness of many contemporary historians. For example, nautical terms are used throughout, but not in way that is mired in the nitty-gritty (although the notes provide additional depth) and a clearly labeled illustration is quite enabling for the \\"coof\\" (off-islander) or layman reader. Furthermore, the numerous asides do not disrupt the story, but enhance it due to the thoughtfulness and subtly of the author.This is an excellent and enthralling book from a most perspicacious author. Like the piece of twine weaved together and preserved by Essex survivor Benjamin Lawrence to remind Lawrence of his experience, Philbrick creates quite a yarn that will ensure the survival of the story of the Whaleship Essex for generations to come."},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"this is one of the finest books i've ever read. the story is fabulous and the author's delivery is perfect. however, it is VERY graphic. the content can be extremely disturbing if you are not interested in the worst events any human can experience. it is told from the perspective of the survivors."},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"Philbrick is a good writer. Sometimes I felt pulled between the history of Nantucket, an inside look into whaling and the story of the Essex. Each is interesting and deserves its own book. The story of the Essex is incredibly powerful, and I feel that Philbrick treated the terrible survival struggles of the crew at an arm's length. The details were there, just not the emotion. He came close, but this story - with the struggle, errors of judgment, tragedy and cannibalism, had the potential to stand with the classic tales of Bly or Shackleton, but this telling didn't quite deliver."},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"Nathaniel Philbrick's history of the whaleship Essex builds on First mate Owen Chase's account of the tragedy; he adds the perspective of cabin boy Thomas Nickerson, written over 50 years after the actual events. Few sources are available, and scholarship-wise, this story is only beginning to be told. To contradict the author's statement, this is an amazing adventure story, made more astounding because its true. Philbrick also includes plenty of background to aid in comprehension by modern readers with no prior knowledge of whaling, especially the eccentricities of early 19th century Nantucket. This author seems well-qualified in this regard. This book is an informative and entertaining blend of the tragedy of the Essex, background, possible motivating factors, and subsequent developments.It is a curious footnote to history that this story was well-known during the 19th century but almost forgotten today, much like the history of the whaling industry and sea voyages in general. No embellishment nor hindsight moralizing is necessary, nor does Philbrick force any. He is a tactful author, and the facts as much as we know them are more than enough to provide a thrilling tale. This is the way that history should be written; its an absorbing read, framed in the context of historical development. It is neither too difficult for a novice, nor too elementary for the well-versed."},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"Very quick read. Philbrick provides a nice combination of direct quotes from the accounts of the events and historical context to these events. In certain ways, it reads like a historical novel, but these events did happen. Very interesting book, well written, easy read."},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"I always thought Moby Dick was it...a profound historical account of the whaling industry before the 1900's. Kids struggled thrugh it as Melville recounted the tale, yet the wade was painful to a point. The Essex adventure, though, while providing a fairly perfect account of the industry, doesn't have to be digested, analyzed, or dissected much to get inside the characters or get a solid, historical feel for the whaling industry and the Nantucket lifestyle. Thoroughly enjoyable and painlessly educational."},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"This book is by far one of the best historical narrative I've read. Philbrick's in-depth research lends itself to an amazing story that sweeps you back in time and place to the once fabled epicenter of the whaling world. The reader is drawn in and viscerally hit with images reflecting the experiences of the surviving whale ship Essex crew members. Think &quot;Alive&quot; but spun with the flair for adventure one might get from &quot;Into Thin Air&quot; or &quot;The Perfect Storm&quot;. If you enjoy historical accounts, look into Philbrick's in-depth notes relating to how he was able to craft this seamless narrative."},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"Nathaniel Philbrick's &quot;In the Heart of the Sea&quot; is an incredible work of non-fiction that reads like a novel. Several times throughout the book I found myself in stunned disbelief that these events really took place. The book is not just the result of a strange historical occurrence, but of a people apart from all others.This book is fascinating not only because it was the first ship to attacked and sunk by whale, but because it is a tale of survival and the strength of the human spirit. Philbrick is lucky because he is able to draw upon several eye-witness accounts of survivors, unlike other recent sea-disaster books like &quot;The Perfect Storm&quot;. Through these first hand accounts, the reader can more fully grasp the suffering these men endured. Not only that, but the author's description of the whaling industry and of life on Nantucket, transports the reader into a bygone era.Surviving three months and 4,500 miles on the open ocean in small, 6-person whaleboats, the men of the Essex experienced something that very few have known, and probably no one will ever experience again. The book provides a unique insight into this ultimate trial, and any reader will find themselves gripped by the story, unable to put it down until the conclusion is known. In short, it is an unforgetable adventure and worthy of your time."},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"Mr. Philbrick tells a great story about a tragedy in the Pacific Ocean, the tragedy that inspired Herman Mellville to write Moby Dick. But he does more than tell of a ship smashed by a whale and the unfortunate survivors, he tells how they got to be months of sailing from home, out in the middle of the ocean hunting one of the largest mammals on the planet. That is the story of Nantucket and how it became the island that dominated the whale oil trade, about their customs and culture that allowed them to surpass many larger and better situated communities. It is an impressive tale and well worth reading."},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"Philbrick as written this tragedy in such a manner that you must experience the trip with the sailors. Altho non-fiction, it is easily read, a book that is savored and felt for the bravery, courage, humanity and convictions of the men. I highly recommend this - good for sailing reading material!"},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"A great read, both educational and entertaining, In the Heart of the Sea goes beyond a typical sea story and captures the time and space of a real event, trumping the famous fiction story (Moby Dick) that loosely rose from the history.Starting with a great adventure as its base, Philbrick has wrapped in many fascinating details of the time (the nantucket whaleing industry, the island's cultural roots, a geography lesson and social commentary).I bought this book following on some of the sea adventure stories I've read lately (including the fascinating story of Shackelton's travails (&quot;Endurance&quot;)... and was pleased to find adventure and so much more.Run out to buy this and you'll have a suspensful read, a sailing story, and a history lesson all in one!"},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"This is a captivating book that cannot be put down easily. The description of the survival methods of these whalers in the early 1800's makes for engrossing reading. I highly recommend this to everyone. It is better by far than The Perfect Storm. I purposely slowed my reading of the book in order to make it last longer since it is a relatively short novel. Enjoy it everyone!"},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"A great story of survival on the seas. I enjoyed this book and was amazed by the depths to which these men sank. The writer did a great job pulling his information from all sources available for a story 180 years old. When there was disagreements as to stories, this was pointed out. By now you have probably heard the main part of the story: massive whale attacks and sinks ship, men are put in small whaling ships and set out on the sea to travel over 2,000 miles with crude navigational devices spending over 90 days on the sea. This book really describes in detail the depths the human body will go to from a physical and mental standpoint. The book becomes so engrossing you can't put it down. I do most of my reading at night but started reading early over breakfast right as the issue of cannibalism came up. Not my best move as it is studied in depth.This writer does a good job of relaying the journals kept and then translating the physical and mental effects to later studies done on starvation, particularly the Minnesota study done in the 1940s.The crew eventually splits into four groups and it's interesting to see what happens to the four groups. I particularly found it interesting they were able to determine what happened to the three crew members left on an island after refusing to get back in the whaling boat.Overall, I think you will enjoy this book. If you like this book, I strongly encourage you to read Endurance about the journey of Shackleton. It's very similar and mesmerizing how they survived in extreme cold. I normally don't like period piece books but this is very good and I strongly recommend. If you like books of adventure and survival, this is a good book for you."},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"This excellent piece of writing tells an absolutely amazing story. A whaling ship in the 1800's in the middle of the Pacific is struck and sunk by a Sperm Whale in a matter of minutes. While this in itself is astonishing, the fact that the survivors spent months trying to get to land in boats that were basically row boats, with little food and water, is practically beyond belief. I found I had to constantly remind myself that this was a true storyPhilbrick tells the story well. He conducted extensive research that makes the facts and details come to life. For example, not only does he tell you that all they had on board was hardtack, but also how it was made, and how much would be required to sustain a sailor. All of the facts are meticulously researched, and there are extensive notes and references at the end of the book.I could not put it down. Great reading, and an even better true story. The incident that inspire Melville to write Moby Dick."},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"What a powerful book. This book drew lots of emotion out of me and I developed lots of empathy for the whalers and their families, plus the slaughtering of the whales added to my wanting of the whaling industry of today totally stopped. Its totally inhumane, gross and horrible. I feel for the whales too.Great action and historical truth about the whale ship Essex and her crew and their families in Nantucket.In the Heart of the Sea The Tragedy of the whaleship Essex is a page burner. Read it in 1 1/2 day. No boring parts...a fascinating read.This was the true story Herman Melville based his epic great novel Moby Dick on.Nathaniel Philbrick wrote a fascinating true historical book on the tragedy that befalls the crew on the whale ship Essex. 1819 the whale ship Essex and her 20 man crew leave Nantucket island for a 1 1/2 year regular whaling voyage. Unfortunately the Essex is rammed twice by an estimated 85ft Sperm Whale. The Essex is capsized and later sinks. The crew abandon ship in 3 small whaleboats with only a few hundred pounds of hardtack for food and luckily several nautical sighting instruments.LOTs of mistakes are made by Captain George Pollard, first mate Chase and a man named Joy in charge of their respective whaleboats. The captain had originally the right idea to head for an island but was swayed by the other officers because of fears of cannibals on islands to head for South America. We see the tragic dilemma of missing the right winds, missing closer islands with no cannibals and having to travel thousands of miles and running out of food and water. The men are forced to become cannibals and eating their dead friends and one time a young man ( Captain Pollard's nephew) draws a lot and is killed and eaten. Strange and suspect that the first eaten were all the black sailors. INMO the true Nantucket natives kept to themselves and became the hawks to prey on the blacks who seemed to get sicker first. The blacks had the poorer food on the Essex and developed less body fat to sustain them in their hunger and lack of food shipwrecked at sea.This to me was a very emotional tragedy story not a true adventure story. If you can't feel for these people you have no emotions.Two partial boats with a few survivors are rescued after a few months at sea...most dead and eaten by the survivors. One boat found with only 4 skeletons. Three men are left on a small island with only their wits to capture the little food on the island and a spring that goes out under the tide so little or no water, are later rescued.You can imagine what the different families on Nantucket went through after hearing about the Essex sinking and later the survival stories related to cannibalism. Gives me the horrors just thinking about it.Just look at all the 5 star reviews. Lots of other reviewers thought this was a great book. If you want a book that will pull on your emotions and let you develop deep empathy toward the whalers and their families this is the book for you. Again INMO this is not a true adventure book but a deeply emotional tragedy. Also lots of great nautical whaling history before and after the Essex tragedy. 5 stars"},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"A great story! So many things about the whaling industry and Nantucket that I didn't know about made this book all the more enjoyable. Some of the scenes described after the shipwreck made my skin crawl and I wonder...what would any of us do if in a similar situation?"},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"I enjoyed reading this book. However, it did make me nauseated. Author goes into a lot of detail."},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"Philbrick deserves the praise given to Into the Heart of the Sea. In giving a historic account of the true story that gave inspiration for Herman Melville's Moby Dick, Philbrick unveils the world of the Nantucket whaling industry and the fate of one unfortunate crew. For a history book, this is a rich page-turner that is uncommon in its historic depth and compelling narrrative."},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"I only started to read this book because someone gave me it to me and said it was good. I didn't even think it sounded like something I would enjoy. I was wrong! I was drawn into the story quickly. Historical fiction that is truly interesting and compelling."},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"Belongs on the shelf right next to your copy of Moby Dick. Maybe it should even replace Melville's weighty tome. I could never get through Moby Dick. I could barely even get started on it. But I'm a semi-idiot. In the Heart of the Sea kept me up all night, and left me with images that I suspect will remain with me for as long as I remain."},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"This book is a must have for anyone looking for a good history based novel about whaling.

I will not get into the story of what the book is about because the reviews made before me has done the job remarkably well. Especially the fact that it is a true story. It seems to me that fiction has taken prominence over fact sometimes in this modern world that we can not disern which is which any more. We live in a world that sometimes cannot put things like this in there proper perspective. Folks, it did happen. If its not on the six o'clock news we think it never happen. Well, what is history for? Never the less it is a great read,unless of course you happen to be stranded on a island or on a life boat. Enjoy every morsel."},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"This was one of those books that I just couldn't put down. I had to keep reading and reading until the entire story was done. I had to find out what happened to these people as they drifted across the Pacific.What made the tale interesting was how thoroughly human and fallible the characters were. You watch them first commit atrocities of their own (torching one of the Galapagos islands), and you come to understand some of the brutality and savagery that pervaded life in a 19th century whaling ship. So by the time the whale attacks you're kind of rooting for the whale.Then they're adrift in the boats, and they manage to make every bad decision possible. They decide to sail thousands of miles to the coast of South America because they think the natives on the nearby islands are cannibalistic savages (their biggest mistake); and they eat the meat they have instead of using it as bait to catch fish.Watching them drift into their doom, and realizing that it was partly of their own making, somehow makes the story all the more gripping, because it makes you want to somehow reach back in time and yell at them, &quot;Don't do that, you idiot! Don't you realize what's going to happen if you do that!&quot;All in all a great book. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"This was one book I truly could not put down. It starts off with a fascinating history of Nantucket, the whaling industry and the mystery of the Pacific Ocean in the early 19th century. It then becomes an epic story about survival in the high seas. I guarantee the reader will not be disappointed with this book."},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"This is without question one of the more entertaining books I've ever had the pleasure to read. I had to keep reminding myself that it wasn't fiction. In fact, it has inspired me to read Moby Dick again. I think now I have a much greater appreciation for those who lived and sacrificed their lives on whale ships. I would recommend this book as a Father's Day gift for anyone who has an interest in history, or just enjoys a good adventure. Mr. Philbrick should be congratulated for his efforts!"},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"This is a well researched, easy to read account of the historical underpinnings of Moby Dick. I had trouble putting the book down. Although cannibalism is addressed, don't expect gruesome details. The issue is straightforwardly but not voyeuristicly addressed."},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"I really liked this book. Part of me thinks it intellectually weak to have enjoyed so much this work, as it is on one hand a simple survival tale. But, it is what it is on the other hand that makes a rich and powerful, balanced read. The tale is interwoven with a history of Nantucket, details on the whaling business, a survey of survival psychology, a highlight history of maritime disasters, a primer on Moby Dick, and a light geography on/geology of Pacific island outposts; all this with the added candy of a full-blown preface, endnote and bibliographic frame. One could use this text as a springboard for a full study of any one of these topics. I plan to use it as an intro to a new better-informed reading of Melville's classic. But, like I said, I really liked this book...even if just for the \\"Into Thin Air\\" value of the narrative."},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"In this meticulous recounting of the tragedy of the whaleship Essex, sunk by a sperm whale in the 1800's, the awesome power of nature once more strikes a dramatic pose as man struggles for survival against the elements. In careful perspective, Philbrick takes into account all of the available records, from the erudite second mate, Owen Chase, to the 14-year-old cabin boy, Thomas Nickerson. As well, Captain John Pollard was able to relate his own accounting of the tragedy that forever changed the lives of the few remaining crew.Taking a sperm whale is fraught with danger, but none of the crew of the Essex could have anticipated the attack on the ship itself. With only seconds to spare, the men gathered what they could from the rapidly sinking vessel, navigational instruments, some fresh water, a modest amount of provisions. Deployed in three boats, the first was manned by the Captain, the second by Owen Chase, the 1st mate, and the third by Mattew Joy, the 2nd mate. The boats attempted to keep within sight of each other, but were later separated by unavoidable circumstances.Strength and provisions were unequal from the start: the Captain's boat consisted of Nantucketeers, most bonded by blood; the second boat held off-islanders and one black seaman recruited at the last minute; the third boat held the majority of the black crewmen and a 2nd mate already showing signs of ill health. Desperate to steer a course toward land, serious mistakes were made, and the days passed under an unrelenting sun, as provisions grew scarce. The men were at all times obsessed, either by unquenchable thirst or ravaging hunger. As they began to perish, all realized that the next to die would become sustenance for the living.Cannibalism was not unheard of for seafaring men, and the will to live was preordained. Philbreck makes an interesting psychological and sociologial point when he notes that the first to die and be eaten were the black crew members, already weakened by their shipboard diet, which had far less protein than that of the officers. In addition, there was a familial bonding among the Nantucketeers, survival of the &quot;fittest&quot; never in question.This is a story to be experienced by each reader, as the strengths and weaknesses of the crew reflect the eternal struggle between life and death. It is amazing that any were found alive after this horrendous experience; those who did survive found their lives irrevocably changed. Man's significance is dwarfed against the epic power of natural forces."},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"Excellent account of survival at sea, and a wonderful summary of the history of Nantucket whaling industry. I found the author's occasional preoccupation with the sailors' race to be distracting - he seemed to rationlize and almost apologize for the thoughts of 19th century men as if they were aware of, but chose to ignore, moden civil rights. Less opining on that subject would have made the book more appealing."},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"This is one of the best accounts of suvivorship that I have read. Philbrick not only tells the story of the Essex, but he also tells the story of what made the men of the Essex the men that they were. Only Shakelton's story compares with this story as far as I am concerned, but even Shakelton had an easier time than the survivors of the Essex. I would suggest it to anyone who likes suspense and adventure."},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"Owen Chase, the first mate on the whaleship Essex that shipped from Nantucket in 1820, to be visciously attacked and sunk by a sperm whale over 2,000 miles from the South American coast, survived at sea on a whale boat for two months. Cannabalism of a dead crewman was his key to survival. Chase subsequently became a whale boat captain and authored a tome on his experiences. In 21 years at sea, Chase only spent 5 months on land but managed to have 6 children by 4 wives (2 died in childbirth, 1 was divorced for infidelity while he was at sea). This history book, though highly entertaining, is an eye-opener about 19th century America, Natucket Quaker culture, the whaling industry, race (when the survivors resorted to cannabalism, the first four crew members eaten were Americans of African descent, a face that the Quaker abolitionist whalers of Nantucket tried to keep silent). The literature that came out of the Essex tragedy, from Melville's Moby Dick to works by Edgar Allen Poe, is also well reviewed. To combine entertainment with the acquisition of knowlege, this book cannot be beat."},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"This is an amazing book. Initially, it comes across as sort of a spin-off on books like &quot;Into Thin Air&quot; and &quot;The Perfect Storm&quot; -- both of which Mr. Philbrick has acknowledged as inspirations -- but I actually think &quot;Into the Heart . . .&quot; surpasses both, particularly in the depth of feeling this book inspires. All the elements of a great adventure story are here: life on the high seas, tragedy at sea, cannibalism, rescue after months at sea in small whaling boats, and so on. But the author trascends the obvious, and renders the participants in this tragedy as fully believable, three-dimensional human beings even though the incidents described in thebook took place almost 200 years ago. A very, very well-written and very moving book."},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"This story is the well documented story of the sinking of the whaleship Essex by a whale. This is the story of the actual events that inspired Herman Melville to create his novel, Moby Dick. In the Heart of the Sea is the story of the whaling industry in Nantucket, as well as the culture of the people of Nantucket. Most of all it is a story of how men faced with what seems to be insurmountable odds against them, strive with everything in their heart and soul to survive and return home. The lengths these men of the sea would go to and the actions they are forced to choose between were stunning. The author describes their physical and mental condition as their situation plays out and you realize what a super-human effort even the smallest necessary task was to perform. To fight when your body has nothing to draw upon or to surrender yourself at that point, these are the decisions they must weigh. The author recreates the emotions at each point in their journey. From the ramming of the ship, when the men cannot believe what is happening, to their isolation on the sea, thousands of miles from the nearest land in small boats and a meager supply of survival supplies, to their arrival on an island, only to realize they cannot survive for long there either. The documentation of the starvation process from other situations (concentration camps, remote crash sights, etc.) provide a crystal clear story of what these men were experiencing. While the first chapter or so did not pull me into the story, suddenly I was swept up in the lives of these whalers and could not put this book down. If you want to read about the sea or what men can overcome when life is in the balance, this is a vivid tale, tragic, heroic and stunning."},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"As a junior in high school, I just finished reading \\"In the Heart of the Sea : The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex\\" for my Oceans class and I really enjoyed reading it. The The first chapter talks about Nantucket and the way the entire town revolves around whaling. The husbands are away from home for months at a time, leaving the women to run many of the businesses and raise the children. Most of the streets were divided up depending on one's position in the whaling industry. After the Essex left Nantucket, I was surprised by how long it took for them to kill their first whale, which was near the equator. The book also discusses the conditions on the ship and how much affect the weather has on the ship and the crew's moral. Numerous little things could destroy the morale of the crew. After an intense rounding of the tip of South America, Henry Dewitt, one of the members of the Essex, deserted. The ship continued on, one man down. After a few months of no luck, they had a two lucky months and got 11 whales and continued heading west. One day, they spotted a whale so the the men got into the three whaling boats and headed after the whale. The whale damaged the boat that got there first so it had to return to the Essex for them to repair the boat. While the other two ships were still after the whale and the third ship was being repaired, a huge whale was spotted, and it was headed for the Essex. The whale hit the ship, knocking the men off of their feet, but that was not all. The whale swam away from the ship but only to turn back around and swim at the Essex twice as fast as it did the first time. The whale destroyed the Essex, leaving the men in the middle of the ocean with three boats. They filled the boats and collected supplies and discussed where they should head. The Captain, Pollard, wanted to head west to the Society Island, but Chase and Joy, the first mate and second mate, feared they would run into cannibals had they gone there. Instead, they proposed they head back to South America, and Pollard, lacking authority, agreed. After waiting for a day, the three boats left the wrecked Essex, heading for South America. They suffered from hunger, thirst, sunburn, and sores from the seawater. They found an island and stayed there for a few days, drinking water from a freshwater a spring during low tide and eating fish and birds. When they left, three of the men were nowhere to be found so they left them there. Once back in the ocean, Joy, who was in charge of one of the boats, began to feel sick and later died. Hendricks took over his boat. One night, during a storm, Chase&#8217;s boat got separated from the other two, never to reunite in the ocean. Shortly after, Hendricks&#8217; boat was separated and the men from it were never seen again. Men started dying frequently. .... The book was interesting, but disturbing, and I enjoyed reading it."},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"Very good and apparently well researched account of the tragedy of the Whaleship Essex which was stove in and sunk by a whale, a rare event. Begins with a good background of the old whaling industry in New England, particularly Nantucket, and follows with the tragic voyage of the Essex. Detailed description of the ordeal and horrors endured by the 20 men who were in 3 small boats on the open ocean for over 90 days. Good descriptions of the Captain, First Mate, and others, and well illustrated with drawings and photographs. Once started, I found the book hard to put down."},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"Nathaniel Philbrick has built a time ship with In The Heart of the Sea. Philbrick transports the reader into another time, and places the reader on the ship amidst the turmoil and struggle. This is a simply fantastic book. Philbrick explains the process of whale hunting without turning his work into an instruction manual. I am not a fan of fiction, and it is because of this that I feel that this book is much more appropriate for high school readers. Any instructor assigning Moby Dick to their students should read this book and reconsider.At times the acts of the crew may turn the readers stomach, but by that time the reader is too involved to put the book down. I didn't want the book to end. Immediately after finishing the book I reread certain chapters. I can not praise this book enough. A fantastic feather in your cap Mr. Philbrick!!!"},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"This is a great adventure story of survival on the high seas.

I liked this story as much as &quot;Endurance&quot; which was the Antarctic survival story of Sir Ernest Shackleton."},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"Excellent read. It's exciting, detailed and quick. The author pulls you into the story immediately, describing how two men were found scooping marrow out of the bones of their shipmates upon their rescue. Very interesting socioeconomic info on early Nantucket, too. I love human survival stories (Everest, Fastnet race, etc.), and this was just fantastic. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"I thought this book was absolutely fabulous. Mr. Philbrick's writing makes what happened on the Essex come to life. His graphic description of how a whale is killed made me a little squeamish, but it also helped me understand what whaling was all about. It wasn't just the horrors that the crew of the Essex went through that kept my attention, but the whole culture that surrounded the lives of a whaling community. This book has whetted my appetite to learn more!"},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"The setting is a whale ship on a whale hunting trip. The story is an adventure that beats any reality-based media production. This is about unscheduled human trials from start to finish. It grips you as you identify with the untold sufferings of starvation and thirst. Hope is always present within some and lacking in others as the disintegration of values begins in the struggle for life. The brutality of circumstances that fell upon the crew is no less than that bestowed upon one of the most magnificent animals on earth."},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"This was a hard one to put down. In vivid but tight language, the story of the Essex is gripping and the details of the culture of whaling and the hard life at sea are intriguing and informative. In the end we get to see how religion, social position and greed play together to tell the grim sort of story we rarely acknowledge as part of our American history. Well worth the time and suitable for non-historians for its high adventure. It made me want a big steak."},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"Philbrick tells the amazing tale of a whaleship sunk by a whale, which inspired Melville's Moby Dick. The whaleship Essex was rammed by a massive sperm whale in the middle of the Pacific ocean, forcing the crew onto three small whale boats as their ship went down. What followed was nearly three harrowing months of dehydration, starvation, and ultimately cannabilism on the open ocean before some of the crew were miraculously rescued. Philbrick tells the tale quite well, with great realism and suspense. He also expertly provides the context of the Nantucket whaling industry in the 19th century. A fascinating, inspiring, and disturbing tale."},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"In The Heart of The Sea is more than just the tale of a chilling tragedy, perseverance, and suffering. Like The Hungry Ocean, the Linda Greenlaw book on sword fishing, Heart of the Sea gives you a fair understanding of the traveling Nantucket factories that were the whale ships of the early 19th century.Philbrick reconstructs Quaker Nantucket society, whaling operations, and American's knowledge of their world, creating a context for the decisions and actions the men in the whaleship took. While we may be horrified at the lengths the crew went to for survival, it does force the question upon the reader.It's amazing what people can survive. After 93 days asea after the wreck, these men (some of them, anyway, or all of them in a way) went home, plumped up a bit, and went right back out to sea again.For those squeamish about familial cannibalism, whale slaughter, and mindless cruelty to tortoises, this is one to avoid."},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"Much has been written (and now shown on national TV) about Philbrick's &quot;In the Heart of the Sea&quot;. This short (less than 300 page) historical account of the whaleship Essex will quickly send those who are fans of the genre back to the Andes Mountains of the early 1970s in &quot;Alive&quot; and the New England coastline where the hearty seamen from &quot;The Perfect Storm&quot; met their fate. What separates Philbrick's writing (and ultimately makes the book interesting) is the often graphic and well-researched accounting of 1820s Nantucket and the brutal lives of the whalers who made a living by going off to sea for nearly 2 years at a time. I cannot rate the book higher only because while the storyline is compelling, I did not find the story of such a unique character as to separate it from other books that deal with brutal human hardships."},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"This is the tragedy of the whaleship Essex. The same tragedy that inspired Herman Melville's very famous novel, Moby Dick. Philbrick's In the Heart of the Sea situates the tale of the Essex in the history of Nantucket during the 1800s. Philbrick draws on the journals and personal testimonies of the survivors, local newspapers, etc. to recreate an event that had an enormous impact on American history and especially Nantucket history.The Essex set sail in 1819 to hunt sperm whales, which were the most oil rich whales in the ocean. The sperm whale gets its name from the stores of clear oil located in its head, which turns cloudy white when exposed to air; this oil burned clearer and brighter than any other whale oil and was in high demand. These whales could provide hundreds of gallons of oil, and one successful whaling expedition could make captains and investors incredibly wealthy.About 3,000 miles off the coast of South America the Essex is attacked and sunk by a vengeful sperm whale that looks to be about 80+ feet in length (double the size of the average male). In three small whale boats, the 20-man crew embarks on a legendary adventure. For 93 days they are stranded facing starvation, dehydration, and mental deterioration.The unspeakable things that happened during those 93 days are revealed through Philbrick's assessment of the history and the literature. He unveils not only the circumstances that would lead men to cannibalism, but also the circumstances that would lead men to temporarily abandon their morals and political and religious affiliations. For example, in the face of starvation they sacrifice a black sailor. This sailor is the first person to be killed for food; despite their abolitionist roots, the Nantucketers opt to save their fellow white sailors.Philbrick also focuses on the families of the sailors who stay behind on Nantucket as their husbands, brothers, fathers, and sons embark on two-year expeditions. Wives see their husbands for a few months at a time only to be left for years on end. Children grow to ages two and three before they even meet their fathers.Overall the book is a fascinating history of the lives of whalers, their families, and their native Nantucket. The history about the island has me itching to visit! My only complaint is that the book is a little dry and the numerous quotes and embedded quotes make for slow going. I've read two books while reading this one!P.S. I've never seen the word \\"sperm\\" so man times in my life."},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"After reading \\"Into Thin Air\\" by Jon K. (about death, tragedy and survival on Everest), I was looking for a similar book about adventure, triumph over tragedy and survival over seemingly insurmountable odds. Well, I got was I was looking for in Mr. Philbricks book.Rather than just being a narrative of first hand accounts of the story of the Essex, Mr. Philbrick gives a good history lesson on the importance whaling played in the economy and lives of many early Americans. He also includes recent studies and research on starvation, cannablism, traumatic stress and physiology into the stories of the men, giving a more complete picture of the entire situation they were experiencing (physically and emotionally). The book is well researched, drawing on the accounts of all the survivors to get an accurate history of what happened on the boats. He is able to bring about the close of the book with how the close knit island of Nantucket dealt with the tragedy that occured. Also in the closing, he includes the history of what happened to the men after their rescue and how the event affected their lives afterwards.I cannot express what this book or story is about better than the author when he expresses that \\"this is not an adventure story\\" but a story of tragedy, suffering and survival. It is well worth the read."},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"It is hard to imagine a greater adventure story. About 100 times while I was reading this book it crossed my mind that this story would make an awesome movie. I hope one day this happens. When I think of all the [...] that Hollywood puts out & then makes 2, 3 or 4 sequels of the same old stuff I scratch my head.The story is incredible & Nathaniel Philbrick does an excellent job of putting you there. He also makes it very clear that he has done a great job researching this story. Numerous times he refers to similar events that happened to other ships in the 1700 & 1800's. I think the last 1/4 of the book is detailed references & footnotes, very thorough indeed. He incorporates modern medical knowledge into the story as well. Of 300+ books I have read I would put this one in the top 10 of books I would recommend to others."},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"Epics rouse the heroic, the tragic, the self in extremis. I, for one, am content for others to scale the Himalayas, the Andes and endure privations that leave me cosily to tend the garden.But I don't in the least mind reading of other's travails, especially when the writing can convey the spectrum of sense data that challenges the participants.'The Heart of the Sea' recounts one of the great whaling stories of the C19th, and without subtracting from the ethos of Nantucket's society, quite plausibly suggests how, if the tragedy of the 'Essex' could not be avoided, could have unfolded differently had the social mix been different. A relatively recent publication of one of the survivor's accounts, adds to Nathaniel Philbrick's grasp. Without studious fuss, he embeds relevant data on what happens to bodies deprived of water and food over extrended periods, cannabalism, the manner by which whaling crafts were built, navigation means of the early C19th and fullsome images of the spectre of the whale and its value to the industry of those times. Above all there is the shadow of Mellville's mammoth, Moby, a momentous story that surely guided Philbrick's magnificently evocative re-telling.The salt is on every page and the sea's rhythmns shape the irrevocable pace of the writing. Utterly consuming. Readers excited by this book might look at Alexander McKee's,'Death Raft' about the survivors of the French frigate,'Medusa' which wrecked only a few years before the 'Essex'. While not rivalling Philbrick's poetic language, it is worth a dip."},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"I'm just back from a visit to a whaling ship in the early 1800s. IN THE HEART OF THE SEA was passed along to me by a reading friend at work. This would not have been a book I would have picked up without her strong recommendation. It is one of the best written books I've read in a long time, a scholarly compilation of information as well as a journal and a notebook left behind by survivors of the whaling ship The Essex which was attacked by a whale. This is the same story that Melville adapted MOBY DICK from. Melville, however, only had access to the journal of the First Mate, and since that time a notebook kept by the cabinboy has come to light. The author, Nathaniel Philbrick, takes those, and thoroughly researches not only the time and the industry, but the history of Nantucket, including the lives of the women (who basically ran things as whaling might require a voyage of 2-3 years) and the peace loving Quakers, who became a rather blood thirsty lot when chasing whales. The book also includes a wonderful collection of maps and photographs. [Only the BEST armchair books include maps and pictures!] The extreme arrogance of man, to cast out into huge oceans (and I mean plural, for the whalers went right around the Cape) to take on these giants of the sea. Imagine - no GPS, no radios, no tracking, no instant communications. To go after these huge sea creatures in small boats with harpoons - and once they lanced the whale it was a merry ride, like a runaway carriage. The author skillfully knits the story together with lot of scholarly research into the effects of starvation, the plundering of the whale (very much along the scale of the buffalo) and the effects on the people who live through this, the leadership or politics of the ships as well as the whaling island of Nantucket. Let me HIGHLY recommend, and ... interestingly enough the Spousal Unit LISTENED when I recommended that he should at least look at the pictures and diagrams ... and he just inquired if I \\"had trouble putting the book down\\" (and he is NOT a reader)."},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"This question was asked in Britain's parliament about the hugely successful and wealthly whaling industry on Nantucket Island. It could have been asked about the Sperm whale, or more immediately, about Nathaniel Philbrick's book itself. IN THE HEART OF THE SEA: The Tragedy of The Whaleship Essex is a well written tale of a shipwreck, all the more absorbing because it's no 'fish story' - every word is true. It is history and also travelogue; a drama of human survival; it tells of Quakers, Wampanoag Indians, English settlers and free blacks; we learn all about sailing on the high seas, the whaling industry, and what life was like on Nantucket.A visit to the whaling museum in nearby New Bedford shows how economically important the industry was to the area in the past. It was also culturally significant, providing the background for one of our greatest novels - Herman Melville's MOBY-DICK. The Seaman's Bethel mentioned in MOBY-DICK is still there, just across the street from the museum. The story of the Essex provided Melville with the idea for his main character - not Ahab, but the whale. Not only Melville. Philbrick uses two accounts by Essex survivors - first mate Owen Chase and cabin boy Thomas Nickerson - as sources. He weaves them together with his own writings on the sea and knowledge of Nantucket to provide us with a harrowing but immensely readable tale.Although the central tragedy in this book tempts us to make bon mots such as this being a book that 'you can sink your teeth into', this trivializes it. There are no Epicurean feasts here. The repast that the men sustained themselves on was something not normally considered palatable. After being shipwrecked, they survived by feeding on human flesh; they were forced to resort to cannibalism. Unlike Moby-Dick where the sinking of the ship was the conclusion of the story, here it only marks the beginning of the real tragedy.The Essex was rammed and sunk by a Sperm whale, going down in the South Pacific. Philbrick tells of how the 20 man crew of the Essex made it into three small whaleboats which they were able to rig with sail. The nearest land were the Marquesas Islands, about 1,200 miles due west, with the prevailing wind. Due East, against the wind and 2,000 miles away was South Amerca. The men decided to head East. That they did so is understandable only in the context of the times and the thinking of the men. Philbrick says plainly, that because of Xenophobic fears and belief in rumours, the officers of the Essex were convinced that the unknown island inhabitants of the Marquesas were cannibals. There was nothing to fear about South America. Heading toward mainland set them on a three month voyage that in a cruel irony of history would see the very thing that the men feared the most - cannibalism - becoming a reality, at their own hands.Philbrick's tale of survival at sea, the desperate situation these men found themselves in, and the final acts of self preservation that they were forced to resort to, is a pretty grim acount. Nevertheless it is a 'can't-put-down' powerful and poignant story and an example of why popular history is so...well, popular."},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"This book is nothing short of phenomenal. The first 50 pages is good, but then this thing takes off like a harpoon shot from a cannon! I could not put it down. Not only is this excruciatingly real tale of suffering and survival rivetting in all its no-holds-barred accounts, but I found the history and information about whaling and Nantucket to be very interesting. Philbrick did a marvelous job of weaving so many accounts of this tragedy into a single, seamless, powerful narrative. Not since John Krackauer's &quot;Into The Wild&quot; have I been so moved by a book."},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"History, whaling, sailors, cannabalism-- not topics I'd usually choose to read about. But this book was much more than the sum of its parts. Philbrick's research was indisputably thorough and the result is an incredible true account of man's determination and will to survive. Not only is there history here, but there are characters that we come to know and respect. Philbrick was adept at adding a psychological perspective to events and conditions which added depth and insight to the reader's own thoughts and conclusions. A tightly written, gripping account. As others have said, you'll be up all night reading this one. Highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"In the early nineteenth century, the whaleship Essex sailed from Nantucket for the final time. The ship encountered a giant sperm whale in the middle of the ocean. The whale attacked the ship, disabling it, sending the men into the whaleships, where most of them would live, and die, for eighty-odd days. This is a rich tale of courage, starvation, cannibalism, and racial politics.Nathaniel Philbrick's account of the ill-fated Essex is thick with history. Philbrick has meticulously researched his book, evidenced by the extensive notes and bibliography. Still, In the Heart of the Sea lacks the heart of Erik Larson's excellent Isaac's Storm, in my mind the book of the year. For all of Philbrick's keen facts and thoroughness, his writing is often academic-sounding, and he does not boldly follow historical tangents as Larsen does so well. Don't get me wrong, In the Heart of the Sea is a remarkable book, well deserving of the National Book Award. I think, however, that Larson deserved it more."},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"A wonderful book, one you just can't put down. The author knows his stuff, very well researched. I'm reading it as part of a class which starts tomorrow, and I can't wait for the discussion. It's exciting and really creates a time and place for the reader."},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"Knowing that this was not a fictional story added an element of intensity as I read this book. Truthfully, this would have made for good fictional reading as well. I enjoyed the character development and the way in which the story was told. I was on the edge of my seat, and looking forward to getting to the book every morning while reading this. In the Mr. Philbrick's words, \\"The Essex disaster is not a tale of adventure. It is a tragedy that happens to be one of the the greatest true stories ever told.\\""},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"What a fantastic story told in a fascinating way. I've read many books about maritime disasters, and this one has gone to the top of the list. Nathaniel Philbrick is a great story-teller and meticulous researcher. I'm very, very impressed."},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"Wow, this is a great book. The author is very skilled in telling historical facts and journal entries but into a story that is easy to read, full of factual informative information, and has great structure. If you like this book I would definitely suggest reading \\"Skeletons in the Sahara\\" another phenomenal book, it's not written by Nathaniel Philbrick, but also another amazing author who tells a tragic story of a crew and his captain lost at sea near Africa and the story of the few that survived.I also bought Nathaniel Philbrick's Mayflower but haven't had a chance to read it yet but look forward to doing so now since i've read In the Heart of the sea."},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"This is a phenomenal book. I am putting it in my top five. It is that rare bit of nonfiction that keeps you on the edge of your seat. I am an avid horror reader, and although technically this book doesn't fit that genre, I am making a place for it on my horror shelf. This truly is a tragedy, and the depths of Captain Pollard's misfortune is staggering. Granted he wasn't a \\"fishy man,\\" but he is a character you rooted for. Chase, more captain than first mate, was the true leader. He kept an almost obsessive watch over the rations and kept his battered boat in sailing shape despite the seemingly insurmountable odds set before his crew. This is an outstanding book. Philbrick is an excellent writer. I particularly like the way he handled the explanation of starvation and the effects on the psyche. I've heard some call the section about cannibalism gruesome, and it was, but in order to understand the sheer power of this tragedy, it was tactfully and, I think, brilliantly handled in this regard by Philbrick.Kudos to the author and kudos to the lucky reader who picks up this book!"},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"It's been a few years since a book stuck with me as much as this one.

Well researched and a clinic on the human spirit.Also recommended:Guns, Germs, and Steel , Fast Food Nation"},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"Engrossing tale based on the true events of the whaler Essex. Good background information provided by the author enhances the reading pleasure. Well written although not brilliant prose. I greatly enjoyed the story despite knowing little about whaling or seafaring."},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"If everyone could write history like Philbrick, we'd have more history majors than you could count. To be fair, much of what makes this particular effort so page-turning is the story that Philbrick selects, but he deserves credit for smart selection too.This book recounts the tale of about 25 young men setting out from Nantucket in 1819 for a whaling voyage that would take them around the tip of South America and into the Pacific Ocean and was expected to last as long as two years - pretty typical for the time. Unfortunately for them, they would undergo a trial that would be so amazing that it would become the basis for Melville's Moby Dick.The Whaleship Essex is attacked by an 85 foot Sperm Whale, and sunk. The crew of the ship get into three small whale boats and attempts to sail more than 1,000 miles to the coast of South America after deciding against closer islands for fear of cannibals (there is a very grim irony in this later in the story).I won't tell you any more of the story, because it's far too fun to have it unfold for yourself as you read. I will say that the story itself is amazing and Philbrick puts you right in the middle of the action with his narrative and use of the notes of the men who were there. In the midst of the drama, you come away learning quite a bit about a way of life that has long since vanished.The way history should be - having the feel of a being about people just like us, but in wholly different circumstances. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"'In the Heart of the Sea' is Nathaniel Philbrick's telling of the whale ship Essex and her last voyage. This true story has been noted as the inspiration for Melvilles - 'Moby Dick'. The tale is well written and provides some background into the whaling industry at that time, and the crew members on that ill-fated voyage.Captain Pollard embarks on this voyage as the new captain of the Essex. Along with the first mate Owen Chase and cabin boy Thomas Nickerson, and eighteen others they set out for the Pacific whaling grounds in search of filling their hold with barrels of whale oil. The journey starts with mishap as the ship is 'knocked-over' on its side during a storm. The captain is convinced not to turn back and continues on.Once in the Pacific thay start filling their hold, and decide to head further west in search of whales. As the crew persue a pod of whales, the Essex is attacked by a bull male. The ship is struck twice and begins to sink. The crew salvage as much as possible from the sinking ship and eventually leave to head for land. Instead of heading to the nearby islands because of a fear of cannibals, the crew head for South American. This decision provse to be a fatal one for a majority of the crew.The book tells the grueling story of the survival of Pollard, Chase, Nicherson and Lawrence. We see the terrible effects of starvation and what drove these men to finally turn to cannibalism.This book is a great read for fans of Moby-Dick and of the terrible journey of survival. This tales reminds me of the other survival stories such as the Shackleton expedition, and 'Into Thin Air'. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"What a wonderful and often time touching story. It is very hard to believe what those men went thru. They were dealt one bad card after another and yet they still endured. I recommend this book to everyone. Especially those who think that they have is bad."},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"Nathaniel Philbrick's rendition of the story of the Essex provides a searing insight into the human experience within it's natural context. Leadership is inexorably interwoven with survival. While acknowledging Shackleton's accomplishments in providing exemplary leadership in the most challenging of situations, Philbrick points out that the leaders of the Essex, in similar dire straits, were not there out of a conscious decision to seek fame or glory, but working men, out to make a living. His correlation of this reality with that of the whale, a mammal with a larger brain, causes one to pause and contemplate. Perhaps the only fitting tribute to the men of the Essex and their families."},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"Superb historical review of the disaster of the Whaling ship Essex.

Very recommended!"},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"This book is thoroughly enjoyable from the standpoints of historical accuracy, human endurance and unthinkable horror. The whalers aboard Essex were the rock stars of their day, and rightfully so. They left home for years at a time, traveled the seas and worked their asses off. They were true men and adventurers. The horrific tragedy that struck the crew of Essex borders on the unthinkable, and the manner in which they chose to make the best odds of survival and return is truly engaging. Despite several mistakes and some extremely tough choices, several of the crew survived against the odds.The book seems to be well researched and accurate. The author lays out the scene of 1820s Nantucket in a way that places the reader right there alongside the whalers. They are then taken aboard Essex and almost become one of the crewmen. Very well written, without unnecessary drama or embellishment, The Heart of the Sea is a compelling account of a true life incident that anyone interested in history, adventure and human spirit should enjoy...I know I certainly did!"},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"This author tells and engrossing, captivating story with energy and humor.

But in the end, some lived to tell the tale. It's a must read for those who like non-fiction adventure/tragedies.I watched Alive with my kids this week. It reminded me some of this book.

This book puts in perspective just how bad and gruesome human tragedy -- and perserverent -- life can be. I have never read a book twice, but this book I will read again."},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"This book is an accurate account of survival at sea for a crew of a shipwrecked whale boat in the Pacific Ocean. It is interesting to read about the &quot;bad&quot; decisions made by the Captain and officers, by avoiding certain islands(which would have saved lives ultimately)because of a fear of island &quot;cannibilism&quot;. It shows the lack of knowledge or communication present during this era. The last chapters of the book are very captivating, in which the crew resorts to the true essence of survival in the human species( I don't want to spoil the story by describing the details!) This really made me think of how we, as human beings, take everyday things for granted. I think that this book brings us back to &quot;reality&quot; of just how fragile our lives are!

Well, what is history for? Never the less it is a great read,unless of course you happen to be stranded on a island or on a life boat. Enjoy every morsel."},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"I enjoyed this book very much.

Big whale, little ship, cannibalization, fascinating characters - all great elements to create a compelling story.This is not the typical genre that I gravitate toward, but I found myself unable to put this book down. The descriptions of the whaling society in Nantucket hooked me from page one - and the story just would not let go. I really don't care for gross out books, and to be honest if I had realized how much of that was in this novel, I would have passed it over. That would have been a mistake."},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"I have been on a &quot;sea-disaster&quot; kick lately and read this book in 2 days. It is an excellent account of the story of the essex and it's survivors, and includes detail that I was unaware of; such as the fact that the son of one of the survivors was a shipmate of Herman Melville on another whaling vessel. Excellent book."},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"One fantastic book! Expertly written and researched, Heart of the Sea is a must. I read it in one day. Absorbing. Don't miss it. And give it to the children, too."},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"An absolutely amazing story. Mr. Philbrick has put together an amazing read regarding the events of this doomed ship. Easy to read, hard to put down; forces one to consider how they would response to such events."},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"I was fascinated by the events of the story and was impressed by the vast amount of research and references that went into this story. The reader gains a knowledge of, not just the ships voyage, but also the Nantucket lifestyle, sailors life, whale processing, life at sea, survival, economic influence of the time....etc. This book really immerses the reader into the period that the disastrous journey took place. It was an easy read for me and i'm not a reader. It's been years since i've rea a book all the way through like i did with this book!"},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"The condition is somewhat less than perfect -- but not much.The book is wonderful. Fascinating story and Very well researched and written."},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"This was the first real maritime book I read several years ago and boy was it worth it. A truly compelling story. Could not put it down. It kept you wanting more and more. I just cannot image what it must have been like to be stranded at sea. This book does a good job of that. I highly recommend it. A true adventure."},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"Nathaniel Philbrick has a well-earned reputation for scholarship and sheer writing talent. He knows how to bring to life historical tales, such as this true story of a whaling vessel sunk by an enraged sperm whale and the crew's torturous struggle to survive on the open sea. It's a remarkable story!"},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"This is a very detailed and thrilling tale of the lives of whalers in the 19th century. The author does a great job taking us back to those whaling days describing how the whaleships are readied for sailing out for what could be years away from home and family. The incredible story of survival through some horrendous trials is just inspiring. It's hard for us to imagine what life was like in those days but this novel takes us along for an amazing journey."},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"This book is a wonderful story of the lives of the sailors on the whaling ships of the period. Their adventure on the ship Essex as it left port sailing for new grounds . Little was know about the islands of the Pacific and in thisstory it was a sad effect that could have made their rescue shorter and saved some lives. Some parts of the story even though it was factual was too much detail in the death of some of the ship mates.Their lives, after their rescue, I found interesting in the way that they personally found solace in the jobs theytook up.I would recommend this book. It was the chosen book by our Book Club of women and all found it interesting ."},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"One of the best books I've ever read. It absolutely should be read in conjunction with Moby Dick since the classic is based on the truths from this book. Learn all about the Nantucket whaling society and the women's secret society within; fascinating to say the least! This is a book to curl up with on a long and stormy night. Enjoy a wonderful read."},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"I might not have picked up this book if it hadn't won the prize, not being much interested in either whaling or sea adventure, but it turned out to be a terrific book for anyone simply interested in history. Awfully good real life story also, and very well told. The writer sticks to what he knows -- Nantucket -- and fortunately he had already written two previous histories of Nantucket, so the historical record was fully deployed and with great skill. As other reviewers here have mentioned, the book is highly engaging and easily holds your interest right to the end."},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"Having no idea about the historical importance of whaling, this book captures both the essence of what it meant to be an American in Nantucket and why so many men were willing to put their lives at risk to pursue whales around the world. The story of the attack and crew's subsequent trials is remarkable. While I lament the product they pursued, the courage of men to challenge the open sea with current navigational technologies is an impressive tale regardless of the circumstances."},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"My husband couldn't put this book down once he started reading. Based on fact and an inspiration for Melville's \\"Moby Dick\\", the harrowing life of the whaling ships and crews of yore is vividly portrayed, especially the voyage of the \\"Essex\\" where desperation meant resorting to cannibalism."},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"Yep...this book has already been reviewed by multitudes of people, so I will only say that this is a very well-written book that you will probably enjoy reading. It is one of those books that you just want to keep reading until you are done and then you are sad you are done reading."},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"I haven't read this book, but I was wondering how this book stacks up with the Penguin version 'The Loss of the Whale Ship Essex, Sunk By A Whale?' From what I understand, this novel is a retelling of events while the Penguin Classics is the actual accounts of two of the crew members? I'm a bit torn as to which one I should read/purchase. All comments are very much appreciated."},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"I have read and enjoyed Ernest Shackleton's books of exploration and adventure sailing to and traversing Antarctica. Though \\"In the Heart of the Sea\\" lacks the gripping first-hand narrative of Shackleton's memoirs, this book is truly gripping with its depiction of the hard life of these shipwrecked whalemen. The author, Nathaniel Philbrick, draws from first-hand accounts of the Essex tragedy and supplements the first-hand accounts with his own research, maps, and explanations of whaling and whaleships. Philbrick's depiction of 19th century Nantucket, Quakers, and whaling culture add to the story and place the decisions and actions of the shipwrecked crew into the context of their times and culture. I feel that had I only read a the first-hand accounts (which I intend to do someday), I would not have understood the reasons why the men acted as they did following the loss of their ship. Most importantly, Philbrick's telling of the Essex tragedy fills in the omissions and exaggerations of the first-hand accounts, and offers a modern perspective on their decisions.Having also recently read Melville's \\"Moby-Dick\\" for the first time, I was quite interested to read \\"In the Heart of the Sea\\" to learn more about whaling. This book covers some of the technical aspects of a 19th-century whaleship and whaling which were hard to gather from the text of \\"Moby-Dick\\". The book includes some diagrams of the whaleship Essex, which I assume is fairly representative of Melville's vision of the fictional whaleship Pequod described in \\"Moby-Dick\\"."},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"The Heart of the Sea will beat, beat, beat in your soul for years to come. Consume this riveting account of the Whaleship Essex. If Heart of the Sea was written at the time of the historic events Melville may have had an employment problem, for why create Moby Dick when truth is stronger than fiction?America's thirst for oil has taken forms in many ways. Our lust for lit lamps sent many men into the darkness of the sea for fortune or fatality. This quest brought on adventure, death, and cannibalism! Nibble, than gnaw at the spine of this thrilling true account of life aboard a whaler! Ride this Nantucket sleigh ride and you will not be disappointed!"},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"A harrowing recount of a Nantucket whaleship's destruction in the Pacific, stoved in by an angry whale. The story inspired Melville to write Moby Dick, but's it's a gripping tale of survival all on its own. The survivors of the sinking have to make sail with their tiny skiffs across half of the Pacific Ocean.The story is grim but incredible. Philbrick wears his research lightly, although his work is thorough the research doesn't get in the way of telling the story well. It's a real window the lost world of the Nantucket whalers, their culture and life, as well as the story of men's behaviour when tested to the limits."},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"I have read a couple of Nathaniel Philbricks' other books (Sea of Glory, and Mayflower) and knew I was in for a treat. His historical research and ability to portray events of resounding consequence in their contemporary contexts filled with very human characters is truly a gift. This book is no different. I had no particular interest in whaling itself and so this book had remained on my periphery for some time. I didn't know what I was missing.Philbrick pulls back the veil on whaling history and of course the Essex' crew themselves revealing mesmerizing scenes. Drawing from first hand accounts the author weaves a solid, continuous narrative of tragedy and triumph that ranks among the greatest survival feats of all time. I love reading tales of survival and this book ranks at the top alongside Alfred Lansing's landmark work, Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage. The thirst and starvation the men of the Essex faced is painted in such graphic detail that I have found myself stopping to contemplate each meal for the last several days after finishing the book. The book also offers a good case study in leadership styles under emergent situations in its comparisons of Capt. Pollard and First Mate Owen Chase. It may be tempting to think that reading about a group of men sailing, often just floating, on the ocean for months may tend to drag, but Philbrick's lens focuses us on both their outward deterioration and inward struggle, making the narrative a fascinating and disturbing spectacle. I certainly flew through this book much faster than the Essex crew lived it. From the anxiety building up to the whale's attack, over thousands of miles of starvation inducing, dehydrating, storming, undulating sea, to the final desperate hours and conclusion you will be as glued to these pages as the crew was to their boats. I highly recommend this book to anyone who is a fan of survival. It may come in handy someday.In a closing note, this book is not for the faint of heart. The narrative contains gruesome scenes of both whale harvesting and cannibalism. Also, I read this book on my Kindle and was delighted to find the illustrations still available. This has sadly not been the case with some other titles I read recently. Remember when you come to them the illustrations can be zoomed for better viewing."},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book about the sinking of the Essex, the story of which was the inspiration for Herman Melville's Moby Dick. Apparently, the story of the Essex was well known at the time although not so much in modern times. The author does a wonderful job of drawing out the story from the original sources and presenting it in a compelling way. This is the type of non-fiction book that reads like a fictional thriller. Another strong point is that the author did not go on and on about certain superfluous details in a way that other authors in this genre tend to do. This book was just the right length to cover the story and do it justice. Highly recommended, especially for those with an interest in maritime history, survival, or just the sea itself."},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"Truth really is stranger than fiction. This book was hard to put down. The author is very gifted at telling the story and weaving it all together to created a suspenseful masterpiece.As I read, it was easy to imagine that I could actually hear the ship's boards creaking, smell the tar and oil, hear the waves lapping against the sides of the ship and feel the sea breeze. I felt very sorry for the whales as they were exploited and hunted down without mercy.Later though, I felt sorry for the crew as well, some of them were only teenagers. It is hard to imagine human beings having to suffer as they did. The incredible turn of events kept me riveted because there was one horrendous ordeal after another.The telling of the story is graphic and raw. It leaves nothing to the imagination. It is also a story I will never forget."},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"Cannibalism! Starving seamen! A WHALE ATTACKING A SHIP AND WINNING. It is the story that Herman Melville patterned Moby Dick on, according to Philbrick, and it is a story that is so sensational and amazing that it is difficult not to become engrossed in it. Along the way, Philbrick also gives us a brief history of whaling and the island of Nantucket, but his writing style is so engaging that even this potentially dry bit of history becomes an entertaining lesson. He also addresses, briefly, the role that racism may have contributed to the survival of the seamen, leadership problems that played a part in creating the tragedy, and the question of what happened to the survivors afterwards.I strongly recommend this book to anyone who enjoys adventure and survival stories, or has a special interest in New England or maritime history."},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"I just finished this last night...wow! The narration is lively and keeps the pace of the story while the author imparts a great deal of information that could have been dull but is not. The prose is so vivid that I could not eat while reading the passages about dismembering the whale; I could almost smell the burning oil and feel the slick decks. Amazing that men made a living this way! I can hardly wait to start Philbrick's MAYFLOWER."},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"Philbrick accomplished something here for which I am grateful; he wrote a masterful account of this tragedy, and found the balance between providing a sufficient amount of historical and scientific detail to fill out the story, without suffocating us in mind-numbing details about, say, the psychology of dehydrated castaways or the mating habits of birds on remote South Pacific islands. Clearly Philbrick did his research, he just doesn't kill us with it - as is often the case with books in this classification of \\"adventure\\" or \\"survival.\\" A mercifully easy-to-read but informative and artistic presentation of this horrible tragedy. Beyond the survival story, this is rich in information on whaling, the whaling business, the whale oil economy, the rise and fall of Nantucket, and the high-seas culture. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"I'm an English teacher and I just finished dragging my students kicking and screaming through Moby Dick during the past 5 weeks. Just as we were finishing, an old friend sent me this book as a gift (yes, from Amazon); it was a weird coincidence, because he didn't know I'd been doing Moby Dick. Anyway, he claimed it was one of the best books he'd read in quite awhile, and that once you got into it, you couldn't put it down. I was a bit skeptical at first, but he was very right. Actually, reading Moby Dick so recently probably made In the Heart of the Sea even MORE enjoyable for me, because there are all kinds of little things in there that helps one to understand some of the terminology and happenings in Melville's classic. It is a fascinating (and I mean that literally--it is truly fascinating) yet horrifying book, and I don't see how anyone could say anything negative about it. Surprised Hollywood hasn't gotten ahold of it for a screenplay... This one won't let you down."},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"I bought this whilst on vacation in USA from my native Scotland. I knew nothing of whaling and Nantucket island before reading the book. This soon changed.Philbrick certainly seems to have done his homework; everything from the strange lexicon the Nantucketers used (many words similar to the Scots vernacular, oddly) to the type of food that was consumed in the early 19th century.I read and read, almost willing Pollard, Chase, Nickerson, Barzillai Ray, Owen Coffin and Obed Hendricks to make it back to dry land and safety. Some did, some didn't. I won't spoil it for you.An altogether excellent read, though."},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"A friend loaned me the book and RAVED. I took it along on a car trip to Vegas... not really expecting much (i'm not really into books about the ocean and fishing). I read it aloud to my hubby on the way back. he was soooo into the book that he pulled over after the sun started to set to buy a flashlight so i could continue.The book was extremely descriptive. I must say that I had been bordering on the edge of becoming a vegetarian for some time. This pushed... no SHOVED me over the edge.The book has raised so many interesting questions... my husband and I have marveled at the adversity these men faced...I can honestly say this book has changed my life.I haven't eaten meat in months.AWESOME BOOK!!!!"},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"This is one of the most exciting books I have ever read. I have liked stories about the sea and sailors since I was a little girl. So, when I happened to see an article in the Mobile Press Register about Nathaniel Philbrick and the book &quot;In The Heart Of The Sea, The Tragedy Of The Whaleship Essex&quot;, I had to head to the nearest bookstore. As soon as I started reading it, I knew it would be one that would be hard to put down. I was right, I read it and read it the second time. Philbrick's writing is excellent. He has a way of making your imagination wander and before you know it, you are feeling as part of the crew. It is sad that the crew had to suffer the cruelty of the sea. It definitely had no mercy on these men. I encourage anyone that likes a true, exciting story to read this book and if possible to listen to the audio tape. They are both great. I now have intentions of vacationing in Nantucket next year. I want to visit the town that once was home to these men that I have grown so close to in this book. As I said before, I encourage you to read this book, it is awesome!"},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"It will be short review because there have been 160 good reviews created before.I do not have enough positive words to describe how fantastic this book is and I do not want to repeat what has been entered below about the Essex and his crew.So why do I attempt to write something here anyway?I came to conclusion, that by expressing myself in such a place like Amazon, I will show respect and admiration to Nathaniel Philbrick, his great research and writing.If you happen to come across this book anywhere during your lifetime, make sure not to walk away without it. I promise you will not regret."},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"I'm a big fan of Moby Dick, so I was predisposed to like this book by virtue of a strong interest in the subject matter. I don't know how someone with no interest in whaling or survival at sea stories would like this, but for me, it was a winner.This is a plain, straightforward, and comprehensive account of the disaster of the Nantucket whaleship Essex, sunk by a massive sperm whale in the Pacific ocean in 1820. Philbrick skillfully augments the basic story with the history of the Nantucket whaling business, the society of Nantucket, and various other ancillary topics. As the story progresses to the survivors' ordeal in open boats, Philbrick brings in such topics as survival psychology and research on starvation. Fortunately, Philbrick includes the necessary maps one needs to fully appreciate the journey, as well as interesting photographs and drawings.If you have any interest at all in sea stories, or survival stories, or if you love Moby Dick, you will surely enjoy this engaging account of a truly amazing story."},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"On August 12, 1819, the Nantucket whaler ESSEX, captained by George Pollard, weighed anchor for the Pacific hunting grounds. Of the 21 men aboard, only a handful would return.Nathaniel Philbrick's IN THE HEART OF THE SEA exceeded my expectations. His historical narrative begins as a treatise on whaleships and the business of whaling. Indeed, killing and cutting apart a whale is so ungentle an art that Greenpeace activists are likely to punch the air and exclaim \\"Yes!\\" when the Essex is rammed and sunk by a sperm whale on November 20, 1820 far out in Watery Nowhere. The book then becomes a gritty survival story replete with an examination of the stages of dehydration and starvation, a brief history of cannibalism among disaster survivors, and commentary on the essence of successful command leadership under dire straits.As Philbrick is careful to point out early on, the ESSEX survivors sailed in open lifeboats 500 miles further than Captain Bligh of the HMS BOUNTY after being set adrift my mutineers, and three times further than Ernest Shackleton of the ice-crushed HMS ENDURANCE on his celebrated passage to South Georgia Island. IN THE HEART OF THE SEA is an amazing tale deftly recreated by the author from primary sources. I was loath to put it down even for such necessary activities as sleeping and going to work.After a story such as this, one gains a new respect for those that went down to the sea in wooden, sailing ships. And, should someone invite me out for no more than an afternoon of simple whale watching just off the coast, I'll be sure and pack my water wings."},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"This is a great peice of work. Nathaniel Philbrick uses a wonderful, empathetic style when telling this tragic story. If you like history, adventure, and sailing you may want to read this one twice."},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"There have been many great stories of survival and tragedy on the seas, and this book is one of the best of them. At one time the story of the Whaleship Essex was well known in America, but gradually that story faded into memory. Nathaniel Philbrick brings that memory back to life again with his very well written book. The main events in this book took place in the time period of 1819-1821. The Essex was based on Nantucket Island, and in the first part of the book there is a very interesting history of Nantucket and the Whaling Trade. Enough information is given so that we understand the world that the men of the Essex lived in, and the ordeal that lay before them. The Essex was believed to be a lucky ship, but that reputation of good luck would soon be overwhelmed at sea. After several months at sea, the Essex was attacked and rammed by an eighty-five foot whale. It is fascinating to read about the attack of the giant whale on the ship, and to realize that the attacking whale was the actual basis for the whale in &quot;Moby Dick&quot;. The Essex was severely damaged and in danger of sinking after the whale attack, and the crew faced the grim prospect of a desperate journey in open boats across the Pacific Ocean. The story of their battle for survival with little food or hope of rescue will grip your heart. Terrible choices of survival had to be made, and there are graphic accounts of starvation and cannibalism in the book. This is truly the story of a great tragedy at sea, but there is also the hope and endurance that can sometimes be found even in the darkest moments. There are moments of wonder with thoughts and descriptions of whales and the ever changing sea. I recommend this book to everyone that loves the history of the Sea, and the spirit of survival against all odds."},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"All too often a book telling a story may also require that the equipment or the vessel used to be described. Much less frequent is the help of illustrations to let a reader who may know little to nothing about the construction (in this case) of a Whaling Vessel, understand the explanations and gain further enjoyment from the book. A further tribute to the Author is that the detail given of the ship The Essex and the implements of the Whaling Trade were of an appropriate length. Too long and the reader would have been lost in a maze of technical jargon, too little and understanding all that happened would not have been possible.For anyone desirous of going much deeper into the History of Nantucket, or of Whaling, there are 39 pages of notes written in prose form at the end of the book. They are organized by chapter, and they are further supplemented by a Bibliography.Mr. Philbrick clearly is a man qualified to relate this tale which records one of the more miserable tales of human suffering. It would have been easy and disappointing to let this story turn into a lurid 93 day telling of decisions and actions that no person should ever be forced to make. The Author maintained a scholarly approach, together with objectivity on some points of contention/speculation, of the events and how they may or may not actually have happened. He also offers insight into how these massive creatures communicate, and how that could have played a role in the collission.The Author also relates modern day medical study and facts about what physical and emotional torments the survivors endured. I thought this was a welcome addition to the understanding of just how horrible this experience was.This is the only book I have read on the History of the Essex. The book is readable even if your knowledge of ships, like mine, is near zero. And the story told without embellishment is both terrifying and amazing.A very enjoyable book."},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"In 1819 the whaleship Essex was rammed and sunk by a very large sperm whale. The ship sank and the crew was forced to sail across thousands of miles of the Pacific ocean fighting thirst and starvation. This was the story that inspired Melville's Moby Dick. It is absorbing, well researched, and reads like a good adventure novel, only it is true. It is elegant from start to finish and I say elegant because of its restraint. Philbrick had every chance to play this one for the bleacher seats, but didn't.We could have gotten a long saga of castaways dying of thirst and starvation with all of the drama of a potboiler. He could have given us a day by day description of the sea trek, but instead the trek is mercifully taken up in 90 pages. (Don't fret, you will get the anxiety wobblies during this phase of the book.) Philbrick has fully researched the physiology of dying of starvation and thirst and spares us none of the details. To survive, the crew resorted to the drawing of lots, execution and cannibalism. We learn about the history, quite plentiful in fact, of survival cannibalism from the Raft of the Medusa to the Andean plane crash. It is not a book for the squeamish.It is also a book about Nantucket, whaling, men at sea, celestial navigation, maritime commerce, and more. Never are the facts crammed down us like so many notecards in the author's collection, but are deliciously laid out in the context of the story. It is not a long book, but it doesn't seem to short either. Like most good books, it made me want to learn more about the subject, in this case the fascinating history of whaling."},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"After reading and re-reading Junger's The Perfect Storm last summer, I wondered if it were only a fluke that a land-lover like myself could become so engrossed in a maritime yarn. After reading In the Heart of the Sea, it is clear that this was no fluke. With little to no experience with nautical life, I was quickly caught up in this drama at sea.Like Junger, Philbrick recounts a historical, nonfiction tale with the drama and tension exceeding much of today's bestselling fiction. His attention to detail gives a documentary feel and paints a vivid portrait of the struggle of survival. Specifically, I was continually impressed with the way Philbrick wove the specific details of whale hunting and sailing with the driving narrative--a narrative that will keep the pages turning quickly.In addition, Philbrick writes with a keen sense of imagery, pulling the reader into the story by appealing to all senses. As a result, the reader finds him/herself caught up in the drama and excitement of the hunt, filled with dread as the situation looks hopeless, aghast at the suffering, and finally, contemplative of the decisions made.There are no easy answers to the questions raised by this book. Instead, the drama offers a chance to consider and reconsider the drive of survival and the human spirit. Narratives of life and death situations are almost inherently gripping; however, because of Philbrick's skills as a writer, this book does more than entertain--it provokes thought, raising issues that do not end with the final page."},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"I would recommend without reservation this audio book abridgement of THE HEART OF THE SEA. Anyone who has an interest in suvival stories, or sea yarns would love this one. The tragedy of the Nantucket whaleship Essex was the inspiration for Herman Melville's MOBY DICK. The Essex was destroyed by a whale who, to the awe of the crew, seemed to have malignant intent. The crew was set adrift in the Pacific in small whaleboats with few provisions and little water---resulting in cannibalism and the drawing of lots ending in the death of one crew member.The portraits of the Essex captain and first mate are particularly well drawn and distinctive for an abridged version, as well as the effects of starvation and dehydration. Unlike MOBY DICK, this abridgement gives just enough information on the whaling industry to be interesting, and focuses on the human dimension of the story. The listener has to wonder whether he or she could behave as well as these men did under equally desperate circumstances.Edward Herrmann's reading of the book was excellent with one persistent mispronunciation of the name &quot;Bowditch&quot; being the one jarring note. I guess no one associated with the production had ever been sailing!"},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"I thought this book was a fairly good account of the disaster that took place on the Essex. It was lacking in detail in a few places, but was adequately informative in others. This book was an easy and quick read, and I recommend it to anyone who enjoys reading about real-life adventures."},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"&quot;In the Heart of the Sea&quot; is a very good book. Like &quot;The Perfect Storm&quot;, to which it will obviously be compared to, the author balances the story with historic and scientific background information. The combination works very well, informing the reader with fascinating tidbits while leaving him or her gripped in the thralls of a great tale.This is the story of the whaleship Essex, out of Nantucket on a two year voyage to the Pacific in search of the early nineteenth century's liquid gold, whale oil. The unthinkable happens. A usually docile sperm whale, although large enough to sink a wooden ship, does just that. Rammed twice by an 85 foot leviathan of the sea, the crew takes to three whale boats while its ship is crushed and rendered useless. The resulting ninety day journey is a story of hope, discipline, tragic mistakes, and ever present thirst and starvation which leads the men ever closer to having to execute the &quot;law of the sea&quot; in order to survive.Nathaniel Philbrick weaves first person accounts from survivors, a concise history of Nantucket and the work of catching and rendering whales as well as the physiology of the giant sea mammels and starvation into a first rate book. I read this over three days -- it moves very quickly. The author has a talent for fleshing out his common whalemen so that they are interesting and distinct characters without sacrificing authenticity and fact.If you liked &quot;The Perfect Storm&quot; or Jon Krakauer's &quot;Into Thin Air,&quot; you'll find &quot;In the Heart of the Sea&quot; very much in the same vein. A story of people under terrible physical and mental assault which the reader could not imagine enduring, coupled with a superbly explained telling of the issues at hand that is well set in its place and time.Highly recommended -- you may want to finish this one all at once."},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"Nathaniel Philbrick has created a carefully researched and highly-detailed account of this great tragedy on the high sea for the modern day reader. Being one of the few persons I suppose who had never read or heard about the tragedy of the Essex and having not read Moby Dick either, I was captivated not by the style of writing here, but by the positively compelling events of this voyage which grew increasingly more horrific with each new chapter. It is without a doubt a gripping, nail-biting, page-turner of a book which always brings the reader back to the same gnawing question...&quot;If I was in this situation, would have done the same things these men did?&quot; The answer which each reader must supply to that question is what makes the book so effective."},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"Having never read &quot;Moby Dick&quot;, I wondered if this book could hold my interest. Boy, was I wrong! A masterful work of historical narrative that ranks right up there with &quot;A Perfect Storm&quot; and &quot;Into Thin Air&quot;, I was spellbound by the story of The Essex and the plight of her crew...highly recommended regardless of your nautical prowess!"},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"Wonderful book, really entertaining and edifying. I didn't know much about sailing or whaling but found the book very informative and accessible. Truth IS stranger than fiction. Philbrick didn't need to spin yarns around this story. He beautifully stuck to the accountable facts and put it in a very enjoyable format, well researched. Highly recommended. My only negative is that I felt that I wanted more depth and information at the end--more about the impact of whaling, more about whales and especially more about the emotional lives of the men who hunted them. Oddly, that's what makes this story fascinating--the &quot;why&quot; behind everyone's behavior!"},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"Given its aim to inform, not just to tell a good story (in the style of Moby Dick), the book has three fatal flaws: Philbrick's ignorance of both sailing and whaling, and his simplistic view of human psychology. Here are examples of some of the false assumptions Philbrick employs about sailing: in the 1820's a whale ship's captain would continue carrying a large, hard to reef, light-air sail with a storm approaching in the Gulf Stream while reefing other sails; an early 1800's whale ship will come back from a 90 degree knockdown; when caught over-canvassed in a storm, some captains prefer to come up head into the wind rather than falling off and running before the wind; first-time members of the crew remain \\"green\\" after months at sea; the ship's carpenter cannot build a whaleboat; the ship's carpenter can repair a whaleboat that was smashed to bits. Etc. These little mistakes about sailing go on and on. There are also numerous \\"little\\" mistakes made when describing whaling. The \\"killer\\" mistake occurs when Philbrick writes that in the 1820's so much whaling was occurring that the Pacific was dotted with the carcasses of dead whales. This, when even a brief amount of research reveals that one of the big problems faced by whalers was keeping a dead whale afloat. As these little errors mount up, the reader ceases to be able to take anything Philbrick says about either sailing or whaling seriously or, by analogy, anything he says about Nantucket, its history and its people. If the story were not presented as if to provide information about both this might not matter. But as it is, it does. Then there are the predictable one dimensional stereotypes that are Philbrick's cast of character's. Any adult who thinks this is a dose or reality probably cannot be convinced otherwise, though if you are in this group, I suggest comparing the character development in this \\"National Book Award\\" novel with, say, character development in Graham Greene's \\"A Burnt Out Case,\\" for example."},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"Nathaniel Philbrick has written a research paper and had it published as a novel. The book has 302 pages, which includes 64 pages of notes, bibliography, acknowledgements and index.The story is interesting and worth the read, but one thing that struck me as odd in the authors referral to the black members of the ship's crew as &quot;African Americans&quot;. Keep in mind that this story occurred in 1820. I hardly think that the use of the politically correct term African American was even conceived at that time. The author also seems to want to build the case that because the black members of the crew were the first to die, that there may have been racial reasons for this to occur. He discusses the difference in body fat content between blacks and whites, and the closeness of the Nantucket Quakers, which may have accounted for the whites being treated differently while trying to survive at sea. The possibility of racism is raised a couple of times, but then quickly dismissed.I would recommend that unless you have a burning desire to read this book immediately, that you wait for the paper back edition. It is sure to be a better value."},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"I ordered a hardcopy of this book and was sent a paperback. The seller did not even have a hardcopy in stock event though the item description explicitly said that it was a hardcopy. Had to send it back, waiting for refund - this is a hassle and I still don't have what I wanted."},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"'In the Heart of the Sea' is a classic story of sailors stranded at sea. However it does have some gruesome parts that classic stories like 'Moby Dick' and 'Two Years before the Mast' don't have. For instance there is much death and cannibilism. The story is told by a narrattor and is about how the Nantucket whaleship, the Essex, is wrecked by a sperm whale and how they must survive in three whaleboats with built up sides. The story is true and what the book, Moby Dick, is based on.This book is very imformative but I did not like the way it was written and it dragged in many parts. I would not recomend this book."},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"Personally I thought this book was dried out and boring. I had to read this book for my English class and I did not enjoy it. It seemed like it took 50 pages to tell about how the character was hungery. I am no expert in novels, but I have read plenty of more enjoyable and worthwhile books. On a good note, there was a lot of interesting facts on whaling, sailing, and survival. I probably enjoyed learning all the facts more than the storyline itself."},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"A mind-blowing Poe-ish experience of adventure and woe. Philbrick is to be commended on his genius of researching and recreating the sad but true tale of the battered, sunken 1820 whaleship Essex and its shipmates.After being rammed by an eighty-five foot monster sperm whale, twenty men leap into three whale boats and aimlessly wander around the Pacific for ninety days. Except for a brief visit at an uninhabited island, the men subsist on next to nothing until some of them start to perish from lack of food, water, exertion and nature. Only eight survive the ordeal (three of those being rescued months later at the aforementioned island). The accounts of these men clinging to life are beyond the scope of human imagination.The basis for Melville's classic Moby Dick."},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"I could not put this book down! For those who enjoyed the story of the Essex, I also recommend Ordeal by Hunger: The Story of the Donner Party. Both of these books allow the reader to enter multidimensional worlds which are so often represented thinly in the history texts. As well, the reader is able to glimpse the horrors of survival cannibalism through the interpretations of empathetic authors. It is easy to harshly judge others, and to reduce these stories to their least common denominator. However, if you want to enjoy the emotional roller coaster of exquisite time travel into two different realms of the American experience, you must read both of these books."},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"This was a great book to read. I had a hard time putting this book down. The men of the Essex went through pure hell to survive and should have their story told. Mr Philbrick presented their tale very well. By the end of the book, I could really feel for the tribulation that these men endured. On my next trip to Nantucket, I'll be sure to vist the sites on the island Mr. Philbrick mentioned in his book. I highly recomend this book to all."},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"Philbrick does a wonderful job of pulling you back in time to Nantucket Island in the 1800s. With his vivid descriptions not only can you envision the island, but you're also given a feel of how important the fishing and whaling industry was at this time, \\"Nantucket was a town of roof dwellers. Nearly every house, its shingles painted red or left to weather into gray, had a roof-mounted platform known as a walk. While its intended use was to facilitate putting out chimney fires with buckets of sand, the walk was also an excellent place to look out to see with a spyglass, to search for the sails of returning ships.\\" Details are one of this author's extreme strengths. You gain a vast amount of knowledge on topics such as the roles men and women played within the Nantucket culture in history, what happens to the human body physiologically when it wastes away from starvation and dehydration, and of course; the dangerous world of whaling in history, how and why it occurred."},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"I stumbled over this book in probably the perfect setting -the New Bedford Whaling Museum- &amp; as my title indicates, I literally couldn't put it down. Instead I retired to a quiet corner of the museum shop and, well, a couple of hours later I came to with the bulk of the book read. Not that this isn't a well-researched book with good background material, but i found both the drama of the story &amp; Philbrick's prose quite compelling &amp; this for someone who frankly doesn't like whaling stories! This is an exciting window into a strange and terrible period in our relationship with the sea, and also an amazing glimpse at the lives of soem extraordinary men placed in impossible conditions. Philbrick gives us the sense of both their strengths and weaknesses without excessive pseudo-psychoanalysis, and we are left frankly in a state of wonder -wonder at how the survivors not only made it through their epic voyage, but also the rest of their lives, and also wonder at how we would have fared under similar circumstances."},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"&quot;In the Heart of the Sea&quot; is a brilliant historical reconstruction of one of the greatest maritime disasters of the Nineteenth Century. In 1820 the Nantucket, whaling ship, Essex, was rammed by an eighty-five foot sperm whale and sunk in a remote part of the South Pacific. The original crew of twenty endured more than ninety days or thirst, starvation, storms, and cannibalism in open lifeboats until finally only eight of them were rescued. Although maritime disasters were fairly common in the Nineteenth Century, the ordeal of the Essex was particularly striking because no ship had ever been attacked by a whale before. In fact, the sinking of the Essex probably provided Herman Melville with much of his inspiration for writing &quot;Moby Dick&quot;.Drawing on existing accounts of the disaster and supplementing them with numerous sources and contextual studies, Nathaniel Philbrick has done a wonderful job of reconstructing life aboard the Essex and in its home port of Nantucket. For example, Philbrick supplements the limited information about the crew's first successful whale hunt with descriptions of how whalers chased and slew their pray, the amount of time it took, the skills and the danger involved, the effort required to drag the whale back to the ship and finally how the whale was cut and processed aboard the ship. Philbrick's detail, which is all drawn from primary sources, makes us feel that we are right there in the small whaleboats being dragged through the ocean by a newly harpooned sperm whale, or aboard the ship itself with the whale's blood and oil all over the deck and the stench of boiling whale blubber permeating the air.Philbrick also draws upon modern scientific studies to explain what the crew did incorrectly and what they endured during their survival in the lifeboats. For example, once the crew had regrouped after the sinking, a decision had to be made about which direction they should sail to in search of land. Although Captain Pollard had what turned out to be the correct instinct about where to proceed, he deferred to the combined judgment of his junior officers. Philbrick informs us that according to modern crisis management theory, a leader must be decisive at the onset of a crisis and should be increasingly democratic as the situation develops. When evaluated by standards that did not exist in his lifetime, it turns out that Captain Pollard chose the least suitable leadership style for the crisis at hand. Philbrick also draws upon modern scientific studies of the affects of starvation when describing the ordeal of hunger that faced the crew. From this he is able to gauge their physical and psychological state as their ordeal progressed.One of the most enjoyable aspects of this book is the way Philbrick explains and contextualizes the thoughts and values of Nineteenth Century whaling communities such as Nantucket. Philbrick explains the Quaker ethos that pervaded the whaling business, the code of ruggedness and bravery that dominated not only the whalers, but also their wives and children. This information is invaluable in helping us to understand what went through the mind of the entire crew from Captain to cabin boy at every stage of their journey and upon the subsequent return of the survivors. In fact, Philbrick is so good at bringing the rugged, industrial, and entrepreneurial Nantucket of the Nineteenth Century back to life that it is odd to compare it to the sleepy tourist destination that it has become today.While it is clear that Philbrick loves his subject matter his narrative is commendably objective and avoids glorifying the people involved. In fact, Philbrick repeatedly makes note of the fact that the first of the Essex crew to perish were African American and he raises the possibility that the Nantucketers may have starved or killed them first in order to prolong their own survival.&quot;In the Heart of the Sea&quot; is a splendid read for lovers of history or true-life adventure narrative such as &quot;Into Thin Air&quot;. In addition to being interesting and well researched, Philbrick's book is superbly written and will be difficult to put down."},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"The sinking of the Essex by a whale is probably most famous as the inspiration for Herman Melville's Moby Dick but in In the Heart of the Sea (The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex) by Nathaniel Philbrick, the reader will be engaged in an adventure more exciting than most works of fiction. The author skillfully combines elements from the accounts of two survivors to locate the truth of the tale. In addition, one will become immeresed in the history of Nantucket, the whaling industry (including graphic accounts of the hunt not for the faint hearted), and other elements of this particular place and time in history. An exciting read and a fine speciman of that popular creature, the true survival story. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"I could not put this book down. Fascinating depiction of human beings struggle for survival. If you enjoyed Into Thin Air you will also enjoy this one."},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"I agree with the 5 star reviews. This is an excellent work of popular non-fiction recounting the story of the sinking of the Whaleship Essex and the horrors that befell the survivors of that sinking.Most of the (mildly) critical reviews seem to be concerned either with the fact that the book does not bring any new (factual) information to the subject or that the book has perhaps been over hyped and will really only appeal to existing fans of \\"popular\\" non-fiction adventure\\\\survival stories.Of the first criticism I would challenge anyone to suggest a better, more engaging, \\"introduction\\" to the subject and of the second I would say, yes, if the subject of this book holds no interest for you then the book itself will probably struggle to hold your interest. But then the fact that I am unlikely to find a best selling romance novel a riveting read is hardly a fair indictment of the romance novel is it?So, with the proviso that you have at least an inkling of interest in the subject matter, I think this is an excellent account of an incredible story."},{"Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","review":"This book is an historical account of the whaleship Essex which was the inspiration for Herman Melville's novel Moby Dick. The Essex left its home port in Massachusetts and about six months later was attacked by an angry sperm whale in the South Pacific and sank. Because of tales of cannabalism among the island natives, the surviving 20 crew members decided that their best shot at survival was to join their three life boats together in an attempt at a daunting 3,000+_mile trip to the coast of South America. The ensuing trip results in a harrowing account which involves fighting the realities of the open sea, starvation, unbearable thirst, and cannabalizing the remains of their deceased shipmates. In the end, only 8 men survive of the original 20.Author Philbrick recreates their story by piecing together information concerning the whaling industry of the time, accounts of attacks by whales as well as information concerning the beasts of the sea, and accounts handed down by the survivors. I thought this was a fascinating story that was very well done and enjoyed it thoroughly."},{"Title":"The Joy of Ballooning","review":"Ballooning Book Takes Readers up, up and away!Maybe it was the photograph of the cow jumping over the moon; or several balloons cheek-by-jowl, jockeying for position during competition.Somewhere in George Denniston's &quot;The Joy of Ballooning&quot; (Courage Books) it became clear that thrills, cameraderie, humor, creativity and competition are all part of the ballooning experience.Imagine floating over the Snohomish Valley, or trying to be the first to float three miles to snag the keys of a pickup that are attached to a 30-foot-high pole, or taking your wedding vows in a sky-high ceremony.Denniston offers an overview of ballooning, from history and physics to extreme ballooning, special shapes and festivals.Sharon Wootton"},{"Title":"The Joy of Ballooning","review":"With a cover this beautiful, and a writer this experienced, it would be hard to miss.

The new poems that comprise the first section of the book provide the reader with a deeply satisfying glimpse of his recent work that attains new heights of innovation not for its own sake but in pursuit of complexity and connection. These new poems have retained all that Hoover's poetry had before achieved--intellectual depth, language dexterity, range, humor, and a strangely satisfying candor. Add to these an unfailing eye for the unusual, an astute ear, and a thoughful rigor that allows the unseen to appear before our eyes as if it were there all along. Paul Hoover's work is necessary and clarifying: &quot;Behind the news that can't be printed,/ a cold rain falling, for this is not the world/ and this is not the dark. This is the word as mark,/ where high in the attic of introspection/ you can smell the chimichanga.&quot; This is the awesome power of Hoover's poetry to reconfigure the world for us and thereby change the very way we read our lives. Whenever I read Paul Hoover's poems, I feel reassured that poetry can continue to &quot;make it new&quot; with such reverence for language, music, and truth."},{"Title":"Totem and Shadow: New and Selected Poems","review":"The poems in Totem and Shadow, especially the newest work by Hoover, are so strong that style seems to drop away, as complex truths are given to the reader.

The author is a professional craftsman who builds veneered furniture on commission. Published in 2000, half of this book covers all phases of veneering topics from how veneer is cut, methods of matching veneers, tools, glues and bonding techniques, substrates, cutting, finishing, building a veneer press, steam press, vaccuum press plus a few other subjects. Tried and true PLUS modern techniques and equipment of veneering are covered. Please note marquetry is not discussed.The second half of the book walks you through 5 projects step by step to build projects from scratch. The author made a point to select a wide range of projects that brought their own set of challenges and the building and veneering techniques used to over come them. The author admits that he selected projects an emphasis on building and veneering curved pieces as if you can master that, you will have no problem with flat surfaces.What I like most about the book are tips and tricks the author has learned from his building experience and home made tools and equipment he's made. The book is also profusely filled with colored photos (no b&amp;w here) and is written as though you were working as an apprentice in his workshop. The book and print are large and makes easy and entertaining reading.The book is highly recommended to novices and seasoned wood crafters alike and is a great value in price and for the information it provides. You won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"Veneering: A Foundation Course","review":"What an informative, well-presented, clearly explained, must-have book! The practical details and concise, complete explanations take the mystery out of veneering. The five projects Mr. Burton walks the reader through answer questions I didn't realize I'd have until in the middle of a project.I thoroughly enjoyed his practical wit, the use of many low-tech (low-cost, too) techniques, and the in-depth way the pictures supplemented the text.I'll buy any woodworking book this man writes. He knows what he's talking about!"},{"Title":"Veneering: A Foundation Course","review":"The author of this book surely has a lot of experience with veneering, but in my opinion there are better ways to do things than some of the ways he suggests. For instance he uses regular wood glue (PVA) to apply veneer by letting it dry and then using an iron to reactivate the glue. I would never trust this to hold over the long run and PVA glue is not the best kind of glue to use with veneer anyway. It is to thin and it doesn't dry to a hard glue line so it will allow the veneer to creep with seasonal changes in humidity. He also never mentions using a vacuum press. While a press might not be for beginners, it is the easiest, best way to veneer a flat or curved panel."},{"Title":"Veneering: A Foundation Course","review":"For the raw beginner wishing to gain an insight into the various methods of gluing veneer using a variety of different adhesives and their accompanying techniques, this book more than adequately serves to address this function. However, the all-important minutiae of veneering are not touched upon in any respect. The art of veneering lies not so much in the methods of gluing, but in the laying-out and trimming, particularly where the edges are concerned. An examination of any piece of pre 20th century cabinetwork will bear out this conclusion: the edges are blended with an almost surgical degree of precision to give the impression that the piece has been hewn from a solid piece of wood. This book's title should read: \\"A Beginner's Guide to Gluing Veneer\\" which is a far more accurate description of this book's contents and function."},{"Title":"Veneering: A Foundation Course","review":"I Have read a lot of how to books, but this book takes things to the next level, clearly defined and understandable text. Recommended for anyone wanting to know all there is to know about the subject."},{"Title":"Veneering: A Foundation Course","review":"This is the one veneering book that will teach you what you need to know about veneers and veneering. Patching, flattening, glueing and types of glues, veneers and types of veneers, and a ton of other information, and tips and tricks. It is a very easy read, and very enjoyable as Mike Burton has a good sense of humor, and enjoys what he does. I look forward to other Mike Burton books."},{"Title":"Veneering: A Foundation Course","review":"This is the finest book on veneering I have ever purchased (I have 3 others). Veneering is like many other skills in that it takes a certain amount of vocabulary and familiarity with techniques before it all starts to make sense. The way the author organizes the material makes it easy for the beginner to come to grips with the tools and techniques of veneering.Perhaps more important is the additude Burton takes to writing this book. You never know when he will sneak in something funny--at times very funny-- in the middle of an explanation or a shop story. He has a disarming sense of humor, and is frank about balancing art with practicality as a professional craftsman.This book is a pleasure to read. And that makes a real difference in learning the subject. Like someone else said, I will buy any future woodworking books Michael Burton writes."},{"Title":"Veneering: A Foundation Course","review":"I came to Amazon to find a copy of this book to share with a co-worker who restores antiques. I was stunned to find that one of my favorites in my extensive woodworking book collection was worth over double what I paid for it in 2001, as it is now only available in the used markets. All other reviews have said it best already - horse sense knowledge - no major investment required to veneer, cheapskate behavior encouraged even!! - humor - wisdom - honesty and ultimately the value of knowledge gained - a rare find indeed. Please, Mr Burton, print some more - you deserve the monetary rewards of this project. I've paid exorbitant prices for other rare woodwork related books. If you're reading this and trying to decide to pay the price for this book, you probably won't be disappointed if you do - it's that good. Again, I hope the author can arrange a way to print more and deservedly profit more from his honest sharing of his years of experience and invaluable time - it can enlighten and profit us all."},{"Title":"Veneering: A Foundation Course","review":"Don't spend $40+ on a used book. Sterling Publishing is printing an updated version of this book to be released June 2006."},{"Title":"Veneering: A Foundation Course","review":"Some parts of this book are very educational and others so bad they are weird.As a previous reviewer notes, the author's approach to vacuum pressing is to make his bag by gluing and taping two thin plastic sheets together, making a bundle of more plastic sheeting around a [garden?] hose to make the connection valve, and then connecting the hose to a wooden block covering the intake port on his air compressor (Don't try this at home; constricting the intake port on many piston driven compressors can screw up the valves). He reports that 'real' vacuum presses are expensive, and he finds vacuum pressing not terribly effective...If you've never veneer vacuum pressed before you might not recognize that as the hominid precursor approach. I'm surprised he shows use of a veneer hammer instead of the more cost effective stone club method. For a lot of (better) info on vacuum pressing, google up the Joewoodworker website.As others have noted, some of his approaches to glue preparation are a bit odd as well.

On that subject, don't let some moron try to convince you there is something wrong with a vacuum press. It's simply the only economical way for a small shop to properly adhere veneer, especially on large panels. If you hate excellent results, good tools and modern ways, then avoid the vacuum press.He also makes strong statements, then ignores them in his projects (I'm thinking about facing MDF, specifically).

When we consider that he lacked literary training and did not learn English until his twenties, the accomplishment is near-unbelievable. All fans will of course want this, and its relative straight-forwardness makes it a good place for neophytes to start.Like most Conrad, the book can be thoroughly enjoyed on a very simple level as an adventure tale in an exotic locale. This story of nineteenth-century Borneo has much exciting drama: smuggling, international political intrigue, internecine rivalry and fighting, and much more. There is even a very moving and somewhat unconventional love story as well as a focus on domestic matters to which Conrad rarely returned. His depictions of the little-known landscape are also lush and memorable; he truly seems to bring to life a world very few Westerners know anything of even now with all its excitement and danger. These are the elements that initially got most attention, much to Conrad's chagrin because they were not his real point. However, they are still notable, and we can now enjoy all elements in proportion.The others are indeed noteworthy; it is truly nothing less than remarkable how much food for proverbial thought Conrad injects into this early work and how many themes later dealt with in more detail were already here. He would of course write many more stories featuring the sea and out-of-the-way locations, but these are only trappings for his tried and true themes, the most immediate being colonialism as well as the clash between Eastern and Western cultures, racism, and other ensuing factors. The story is set at a time when the Dutch and English both had interest in Borneo, dramatizing their profound and often destructive effect on the indigenous culture with stirring realism. The colonialism condemnation is not as overt as in later Conrad, but he spares no detail in depicting the havoc it wreaked. This debut novel interestingly focuses more on the native perspective than later works, giving a nuanced view and earning considerable sympathy for the oppressed culture. Indeed, in a true blow to Western ego, non-whites eventually triumph, and their constant cries against the \\"infidel\\" and benedictions of Allah's merciful Providence ring true.More important, though, is the tragic vision that all this symbolizes. Few writers - nay, few human beings - have been as pessimistic as Conrad, and he began at least as darkly as he ended. The appropriately named novel focuses mostly on its tragic title hero, who is not without admirable qualities but is simply unable to overcome his flaws. His dreams are big, but self-delusion, prejudice, greed, and narrow-mindedness ensure continuing failure and miserable destruction. The novel is a grand vista of individual tragedy; loathsome as Almayer is in many ways, he is arguably more sinned against than sinning. His truly wretched fate arouses much pathos, as does the emotion-drenched book generally. It paints a very grim picture of human ambition and the efficacy of communication - a truly moving tragedy to which many can unfortunately relate.As always with Conrad, the prose itself is also of great note. At about 130 pages, the story is very concise, and the prose is extremely precise yet highly evocative; Conrad's vocabulary is simply incredible, and his descriptions are profoundly memorable and often affecting whether about landscapes, love, or blighted hope. There are more signs of not being a native speaker than later, as he had yet to master the language, which will fascinate fans and scholars, but he already had a greater command than nearly all natives in the areas that make great literature.All told, while this does not make Conrad's very top tier, it is tantalizingly close; it is not only an incredible debut but would be nothing less than most writers' masterpiece, which is probably all that need be said."},{"Title":"Almayer's Folly: A Story of an Eastern River (World's Classics)","review":"This tale, set in the colonial-era East Indies, narrates the brief rise and slow descent of a man's search for fortune and adventure. Quite simply, the treasure never appears and Almayer is left to ponder what could have been. His woes are intensified by the departure of his daughter, one of his few links to &quot;civilised Europe.&quot; Classic symbolism occurs late in the novel, as Almayer erases the footprints of his daughter the day of their parting. While &quot;Almayer's Folly&quot; doesn't reach the heights of Conrad's longer (read: better) works, this effort still captures the romantic essence of the Far East in the classic Conrad style."},{"Title":"Almayer's Folly: A Story of an Eastern River (World's Classics)","review":"Almayer's Folly was Joseph Conrad's first novel. I have nothing to compare it to, as I have not read his signature work, Heart of Darkness, nor any of his other lesser known stories and novels. I came into the possession of Almayer's Folly by chance; one of my friend's mothers had taken the book from the DISCARD pile in the library and urged me to take it from her.I'm glad that fate has brought me this book. It's the story of Almayer-- a Dutchman who has been born and raised in Colonial Indonesia. He spends his life idolizing Europe and Western ideals, scorning his homeland. Yet he never once ventures to Europe. In fact, most of his interactions with Europeans often find him the butt of their jokes. He doesn't fare much better with the Malay natives and Arab merchants--while often treated as a superior by virtue of his race, they still regard him as a fool.Almayer has nothing but haughty contempt for the native Malay culture of Borneo. Even with his Malay wife and half-Malay daughter, he keeps a Imperialist's distance from the culture which surrounds him. Feeling no true kinship with his European heritage, and scorning the one with which he is most familiar, he's a case study in the pathologies which arise from Colonialism.Essentially, Almayer is a semi-sympathetic buffoon. His life is full of grandiose wishes and little reward. He yearns for great treasure, yet is no warrior and a mediocre businessman. He lacks the cunning and courage of many other characters--A Malay Rajah, a slave, an Arab trader, and a swashbuckling British compatriot, are just a few of the characters who outshine Almayer.Yet, its his weaknesses which make his placement as the central character one of the most endearing aspects of the book. Because he is such a fragile, inept person, we become more comfortable with the savageness, intelligence, and verve in the other principal characters.Almayer's undramatic life serves as the backdrop for the love story between his daughter and a handsome Balinese Prince. Her choice to eschew a comfortable European upbringing and to align herself with the romantic, savage culture of her Malay mother is the emotional keystone in the novel.I was often astounded by Conrad's rich evocation of the setting and characters in colonial Indonesia. I'm not much for florid, lush descriptions, but Conrad sets himself above the heap of dilettantes and impostors: his ornate narrative holds together, forming a monumental, often breathtaking vision of Colonial Indonesia. The dynamic characters, expansive forests, and socio-political themes all receive the same rigorous, beautiful treatment.One drawback is that, because Conrad's talents are so visible and easy to explain, the mystery and magic in great pieces of art is obscured in this work. Furthermore, his characters seem to vacillate unnaturally between mythical, cliched representations of themes and truly organic, dynamic beings. That being said, the novel was a thoroughly enjoyable read and I am excited to soon discover some of Conrad's more well known works."},{"Title":"Almayer's Folly: A Story of an Eastern River (World's Classics)","review":"\\"Almayer's Folly\\" adequately introduces the theme of culture conflict, an angle that is expressed more fully in Conrad's later works. I would certainly recommend this to anyone familiar with Conrad's body of work, which is not to say that readers new to his work should avoid this novel."},{"Title":"Almayer's Folly: A Story of an Eastern River (World's Classics)","review":"This is Joseph Conrads first novel. It deals with the conflicts between native people (Malayans) and Dutch tradesmen in the jungle of Borneo. It has some brilliant passages, but all in all it's a quite dull read."},{"Title":"Almayer's Folly: A Story of an Eastern River (World's Classics)","review":"This excellent short novel is very representative for Joseph Conrad's work. Its main theme of the foolish, dangerous and deadly dreams of colonialists was also treated in his short story \`An Outpost of Progress' (in 'Tales of Unrest') and in his masterpiece \`Heart of Darkness'.The main character in this story dreams of finding a mysterious treasure in order to be able to return to his homeland and live for the rest of his life in \`untold wealth'.For the indigenous, he is not more than another \`white man that comes to us to trade, with prayers on his lips and loaded guns in his hands.' He shows \`the same manifestations of love and hate and of sordid greed chasing the uncertain dollar in all its multifarious and vanishing shapes.'He is bitterly confronted with \`the savage mood which civilization could never destroy'.For Conrad, \`no two beings understand each other', so certainly not the \`savage' and the \`white man'.More, the \`uncompromising sincerity of Malay kinsmen' stands in sharp contrast with \`the sleek hypocrisy of white people with their vivid but foolish dreams'.This novel has not the same high standard as \`Heart of Darkness', but should not be missed."},{"Title":"Almayer's Folly: A Story of an Eastern River (World's Classics)","review":"This book by Conrad is a love story and a tragedy. The tragedy of Nina's father, Almayer--and the love story of Dain and Nina.But Almayer's Folly is not as great a book as Lord Jim or Nigger of the 'Narcissus,' which are among the great masterpieces of literature.There are several problems with Conrad's novel. For one thing, Almayer is not sympathetic enough to be a tragic hero. He just comes across as a real jerk. For another, the love story of Dain and Nina is so overblown and romantic as to be almost laughable, comic, and ridiculous. The characters and settings are hard to keep straight, as are the motivations of some of the doings.Frankly, I found it quite difficult to take any of it seriously. It may be that we are just too distant from Conrad's Borneo in time and place, but this is not a problem in some of Conrad's other novels.This is an inferior piece of literature. (Why the three stars in that case, you ask. Conrad's writing is so skilled in detail, and the setting and some of the other details so interesting, that the novel is absorbing--and mercifully short.)"},{"Title":"Almayer's Folly: A Story of an Eastern River (World's Classics)","review":"An alternative title for this novel could be Amayer's rut.For that is the situation that the main protagonist in this novel finds himself in. Almayer is a European trader living in atrading post somewhere in Indonesia or Malaysia with his daughter,a product of mixed marriage.Almayer dreams of escaping to Europe after making himself wealthy and bringing his daughter with him also.But as time drags on it becomes obvious that he is going nowhere with his life. He is not getting richer nor is he getting any younger. His own daughter ends up deserting him by eloping with a native who takes her to his own village.Not being a pure European by blood she realizes that she would never be accepted as an equal among Europeans or the whites.For this reason she chooses instead to live with the natives.As for Almayer he remains as he was.He is an example that one can find everywhere in the world.Someone stuck in a situation going nowhere but always dreaming of getting out and changing his life."},{"Title":"Almayer's Folly: A Story of an Eastern River (World's Classics)","review":"Loosely based on the life of a Dutch merchant, setting up a trading post along a river in the interior of Borneo, Conrad's novel 'Almayer's Folly' is actually about man's alienation from his environment and eventually himself.Written during the heyday of western imperialism, when the great powers of Europe subjected the tropics to their rule, the tale of Almayer explores how the tropics actually devoured the individual westerner.The main character of the book is a man obsessed. Chasing a dream, he completely loses touch with reality. Although on the surface it may seem that he is a white man gone native, Almayer hasn't got a clue what he is dealing with. He is blind to the schemings of his Malay wife and equally oblivious to the fact that his daughter is drifting away from him.Admittedly, the book has 'orientalist' overtones but, then, Joseph Conrad is both a man of his time and a master of poweful prose, not a politically-correct scholar. The stereotypical mystique of Asia and the inscrutable oriental are exploited as a literary means to descend into the deeper levels of man's psyche. Just like the 'true heart' of Borneo and its inhabitants is hidden under layer upon layer of deceiving images, so is the core of each and every individual. The scariest place to travel is not the interior of an Indonesian Island, but the inner reaches of our own soul.Almayer's Folly is one of the best novels ever written. Not only because of the author's masterful portrayals of character, but also due his astounding command of English. It is hard to believe that Conrad's first and second language were Polish and French: he only learned English as an adult. It is this combination of psychological understanding and extraordinary use of language that make him into a literary genius."},{"Title":"Almayer's Folly: A Story of an Eastern River (World's Classics)","review":"This was Conrad's first novel, and I think it's an underappreciated jewel. It's written with a typical Victorian plotline, and one part of it has a romantic couple seeking their own happy ending, but don't be mistaken - it's real Conrad, so there's the glorious Conradian gloom, fear and descent into madness, too. It's a tale about a Dutchman in a business-gone-bad stranded in the Indonesian boondocks with his witch-like Malay wife who wishes him all the ill in the world. His only hope in life anymore is for his beautiful daughter and he dreams constantly of getting her educated and married off back in Amsterdam so he can wash his hands of his island nightmare and go back to normal life in Europe. But she grows up, grows distant to him, and he's clueless about the reality that she's adopted the local style and wants to be there. A handsome Balinese prince seeks her hand and the plot cranks into motion, spinning to a thrilling climax. It's an interesting study of problems of interracial, intercultural interaction, as valid today as it was in the late 19th century. The visual picture it paints of the old Dutch East Indies - the rivers, the tangled jungle flowers and the wildlife is another of its finest points."},{"Title":"Almayer's Folly: A Story of an Eastern River (World's Classics)","review":"I was surprised to find out this was Conrad's first book. I expected an awkwardness of a writer refining his skill, but what I found was a captivating, accessible and satisfying story. It has suspense and romance as well as the tragedy that Conrad is known for. I think the young characters and themes make this book far more accessible to a young person than the standard required Conrad novel--Heart of Darkness. Almayer's Folly is an excellent introduction to Conrad's work."},{"Title":"Almayer's Folly: A Story of an Eastern River (World's Classics)","review":"Almayer's folly is a powerful beginning to Conrad's second profession, writing. Since the story was written so close to Conrad's adventurous youth (the spring for his most powerful works), it provides the rawest expression of Conrad's views. Almayer, the prototype of Tuan Jim, takes the &quot;leap&quot; when he marries the Malay captive for promised wealth. This transgression drops his character into contact with the cold truths of nature; truths which dispel any artificial illusions or meanings. For Almayer, these illusions entailed sucess and fame in Europe, a place that he had never visited but only heard about from his mother. Superficially, this journey towards inner truth involves a journey into the wilds of Borneo, but,like in future Conrad works, we quickly realize that the journey is inward into the pysche of Almayer. Overall, an excellent introduction to Conrad."},{"Title":"Almayer's Folly: A Story of an Eastern River (World's Classics)","review":"Almayer's tragedy is that he has become mired in an enterprise which has not paid off. His supply station just doesn't make him rich as he had hoped. In the meantime he has taken a wife, a Malay, and they have a daughter. So Almayer is mired in Malaysia in more ways than one. Almayer dreams of Europe but it is unlikely he will ever return. His fate is to rot in the tropics. Conrads tale of a hopeless colonial exploiter is interesting for its unsentimental, unidealized view of the whole colonial enterprise. It is seen as being a losing situation for both sides. Both cultures suffer. The most tragic figures are those whose heritage is divided between both cultures, exploiter and exploited. (This is something this years Nobel Laureate 2001 V.S. Naipaul, who is often compared to Conrad, writes about.) Conrads book has an appealing exotic side to it as well though. The descriptive writing of the winding rivers and foliage and the entire tropical setting is tempting as it attracts interesting types and seems to offer a life of indolence and easy riches and forbidden pleasures but of course there is a backlash. The plot itself is a winding river with many turns. Not a perfect book but an interesting book to read after having read many of Conrads later books. Conrad in his autobiographical A Personal Record describes his meeting with the character who inspired the fictive Almayer as being the beginning of his writing career. The whole colonial enterprise seemed to be embodied in the attitude and fate of that one isolated figure for him. I guess for that reason we can thank Almayer for existing."},{"Title":"Almayer's Folly: A Story of an Eastern River (World's Classics)","review":"I refer to the Wordsworth Classics printing that contains the short stories 'Tales of Unrest'. 'Almayer's Folly' is an engaging novel that kept my interest despite being read in a haphazard way during travel. My favourite quote from the novel is: 'But a man busy contemplating the wreckage of his past in the dawn of new hopes cannot be hungry whenever his rice is ready.' I enjoy the convoluted paragraphs that Conrad constructs that are surprisingly transparent for the reader - an extraordinary achievement for a man with English as his second language. He really does show the power of the language to richly counterpoint ideas of place and people. What, I wonder, was Conrad's skill with his native language? 'The Return' is a story of such mundane environment that I wondered if I was reading Conrad, but the unfolding of the narrative soon restores my impression. is there some Anna Kavan here? (or is Conrad in Kavan?)."},{"Title":"Almayer's Folly: A Story of an Eastern River (World's Classics)","review":"Though overshadowed by his later work, Joseph Conrad's Almayer's Folly is one of the most impressive debut novels - excellent in itself and fascinating to fans and scholars in how it has in embryo so much of his later greatness.

Anyone wanting extra will need to look elsewhere, but the work more than stands on its own."},{"Title":"Almayer's Folly: A Story of an Eastern River (World's Classics)","review":"This was Conrad's first novel, first published in 1895. It is the start of a series of novels and stories set in South East Asia. He had first hand knowledge of the region due to his own work as a merchant sailor. He also knew a lot, obviously, from Alfred Russell Wallace's travel account The Malay Archipelago.Main themes of the story are the greed of colonialism and the racism of colonial routine. The story: a young colonial Dutchman, grown up in Java, takes a job as a clerk in a trading firm in Makassar, on the island of Celebes, keen to get rich. A legendarily rich merchant captain picks him as son in law for his adopted Malay daughter from pirate background, offers him a job as station manager in Borneo, with prospects of a huge inheritance.All goes wrong. The business fails over the years, not the least due to Almayer's lack of social intelligence. The fortune of the father in law dwindles. The station is unable to compete or even coexist with the local ruler and an Arab competitor. The marriage fails, partly because Almayer is a racist, partly because the wife has other ideas of the world, as one would expect from a Sulu pirate. He invests his emotions in a beautiful daughter and dreams of settling in Europe with her, after striking it rich. He dreams of a Borneo El Dorado. He understands nothing and nobody, certainly not his daughter, who can not see the charm in the prospect of settling in Amsterdam. She prefers to fall in love with a Balinese prince, betting on the local half of her heritage.The historical background is the Dutch consolidation of their rule in the region that later became Indonesia. Borneo is yet hardly under control. A definition of British and Dutch interests and boundaries was still to come. Aceh was rebelling against Dutch rule, as they would later against Javanese rule. Bali is still independant and fiercely determined to remain so. That's why the Balinese prince shows up in Borneo, he is looking for gunpowder. Which in turn quickens Almayer's downfall, since the colonial rulers see him as an unreliable subject who trades with insurgents.A problem with the novel is the total lack of redeeming features in the damned fool Almayer. He is so much not a positive hero, that his failure fails to touch us as tragedy. But the man is real. The world is full of such people.Conrad's start into the writer's career was not the top of his achievements, but for me, it is one of my favorites among his works. This is partly due to a personal relation to the locations."},{"Title":"Almayer's Folly: A Story of an Eastern River (World's Classics)","review":"Although not to be compared with his major works, this is nonetheless a most impressive first novel. Perhaps because he was already well into his thirties when he wrote and published it, the book contains all the major themes that one associates with Conrad. If one has not read any Conrad at all, I would recommend going to his great masterpieces first (VICTORY, NOSTROMO, THE SECRET AGENT, UNDER WESTERN EYES, HEART OF DARKNESS, THE NIGGER OF THE 'NARCISSUS', or LORD JIM). But for anyone who enjoys the work of Joseph Conrad, this book can hardly fail to fascinate."},{"Title":"Almayer's Folly: A Story of an Eastern River (World's Classics)","review":"As this is Conrad's first novel, it is not fair to expect the sort of power that illuminates his later works. However, Almayer's Folly is a good, solid novel which shows the potential for Conrad's later greatness.

Composed as he lay dying of tuberculosis, the book nonetheless encaptures the author's renowned zest for life as well as the libertine spirit of the age in which he lived. The journey down through France to Northern Italy is the perfect vehicle for an excursion into the nature of human sensibility, and from the moment that this cultured Anglo-Irish cleric sets foot in Calais, the reader is treated to a seies of exquisite encounters with the fairer sex. Rarely has an author transmitted so well his understanding of the psychological complexity of women, or the pleasure he takes in their company. Engaging, perceptive and witty, this is a book whiich cannot fail to leave an imprint on the imagination."},{"Title":"A sentimental journey through France and Italy","review":"Sterne befuddles and delights readers and critics alike in A Sentimental Journey. He takes the fashionable travel log of the time and satarizes it. Contemporary critics had a fit over its supposedly bawdy nature, yet some modern readers may over look its sublte innuendo. The form of the novel is quite unlike anything that had preceeded it, thus is important for any scholars. Most importanly, however, the book is funny and fun to read."},{"Title":"A sentimental journey through France and Italy","review":"Even for modern readers, \\"A Sentimental Journey\\" (published 1768)is as startlingly innovative as Sterne's celebrated \\"Tristram Shandy\\". Sterne's ability to crystallize the minute details of experience - which may be down to a few seconds only - is reminiscent of Virginia Woolf's \\"To the Lighthouse\\". Indeed, Woolf admired this book.This is by no means an easy read. The 18th-century prose is difficult; the book is larded with Frenchisms and Biblical or classical allusions; the complex, slow narrative often requires re-reading. But the rewards are great! It's wise, deeply comical, and incredibly perceptive.There are several helpful reviews below dealing with the aspect of \\"sentimentality\\", and so I will just single out two things which appealed to me:1. STERNE AND BODY LANGUAGE. Sterne shows an almost 20th-century appreciation of body language. In fact, I believe he might have been the first to identify it as such. His chapter, \\"The Translation\\", highlights the importance of being able to interpret subtle physical hints, like a language: \\"There is not a secret so aiding to the progress of sociality, as to get master of this _shorthand_, and be quick in rendering the several turns of looks and limbs, with all their inflections and delineations, into plain words.\\" How visionary!2. STERNE AND THE FRENCH. Ever since Shakespeare inserted a scene in \\"cod French\\" into _Henry V_, actually ever since the Norman Conquest and up to Monty Python and beyond, the English have revelled in mocking the French and their language. His Continental travelling gives Sterne the perfect excuse to do this. At one point he differentiates between \\"tant pis\\" (= \\"never mind\\" - where there is nothing to be gained) and \\"tant mieux\\" (= so much the better - where there IS an advantage). He also has a hilarious section on the grades of French swearing: first \\"Diable!\\", then \\"Peste!\\" and finally the words that he won't repeat. In all cases, Sterne carefully shows the social niceties of these expressions.The protagonist, Yorick, has various adventures of lust and feeling with women and other typically travelish things like losing his passport that we can all relate to. He's tender, obscene, learned, funny, companionable, and above all, readable - if tough."},{"Title":"A sentimental journey through France and Italy","review":"A Sentimental Journey is a fabulous book for so many reasons. Laurence Sterne was an immensely influential writer in the 18th century--his major works, Sentimental Journey and Tristram Shandy, were responses to the travel narrative and newly born novel, respectively. His writing is essential to scholars of the 18th century--he is referenced in Austen's Mansfield Park and Northanger Abbey, Brown's The Power of Sympathy, Foster's The Coquette and Tyler's The Contrast. To understand and appreciate his novel is to have a better appreciation and love of the works that built their structures on his foundation. And yet it is original, as Yorick says himself, \\"both my travels and observations will be altogether of a different cast from any of my fore-runners.\\"Yet it is not solely for historical benefit that one should read Sentimental Journey. The adventures and amours of Sterne's semi-autobiographical Yorick are delightful. One of the most romantic passages I've read in a book occurs when Yorick inadvertantly takes the hand of a woman and describes in detail the thrill of merely holding it. Granted, hers is not the only hand he will hold, but he writes so wonderfully, candidly and engagingly that it is extremely difficult to hold his passions against the sentimental Yorick. His scene with the starling locked in a cage is pertinent and a touching commentary on slavery. What a guy! My only complaint is the editor of this edition does not feel it necessary to translate the French-of which there is plenty-making some passages difficult to understand at best. However,this is a sentimental journey that I will gladly take over and over."},{"Title":"A sentimental journey through France and Italy","review":"Like Sterne's other works, _A Sentimental Journey_ is extraordinarily playful. His works are the eighteenth century's postmodernist works of play. They have lots of textual puzzles and tend toward the absurd. For example, the Mr. Yorick of the _Journey_ is also a character in Sterne's major novel _Tristram Shandy_ and is also the name under which he publishes his own sermons (he was a clergyman). The text is very &quot;fragmentary&quot; and the novel even jokes about that itself, labelling parts of itself &quot;fragment.&quot; In these ways, the _Journey_ is fun and modern.But it is also indicative of an important eighteenth-century trend--sensibility or sentimentalism. All eras have their debates about the relationshp between the individual and society and this is one eighteenth-century answer. This opinion has nothing to do with &quot;rights&quot; but everything to do with &quot;sympathy.&quot; Mr. Yorick, the &quot;sentimental traveller,&quot; relates to other human beings through sympathetic physical responses, most notably the &quot;pulses&quot; and &quot;beats&quot; of his heart and hands for various women.Therefore, this book is a good way to get into a very different historical mindset while at the same time seeing the roots of some of the literary forms of today."},{"Title":"A sentimental journey through France and Italy","review":"Building up my library so no time to read-then-review but looks good at first glance. Sorry I can't be of more help but it will be a while before I do. The title caught my eye!"},{"Title":"A sentimental journey through France and Italy","review":"It's been a number of years since I read this short work for my Pre-1900s British Novels class as an undergraduate, and while my memory is a little fuzzy on the details, my general impression of dislike and boredom is crystal clear. While I'm sure there is complexity in the words, it's hard to overlook the basic fact that almost nothing happens in this first of the sentimental novels.However, I can readily admit that it's obviously at least somewhat preference given all the glowing reviews I have found. I like my books character driven. The kind of characters that I walk away feeling like I know them personally and am sad to part ways. While Yorick is the driving force, he lacked that depth.We followed it up with Evelina by Burney, which was far more enjoyable."},{"Title":"A sentimental journey through France and Italy","review":"This book is a fun, light read.It's the kind of book you'd read while sunning out in the garden on a nice sunny summer day.I giggled quite a lot."},{"Title":"Strength Among Women","review":"Having been a nurse for 30 years, many of which were worked in OB, I finally found a book that addresses the issues of all type of births, from still births, to miscarriages, to hydadiform moles, and how the women and men coped with their losses. This is a poignent book, not a sad read. It is informative on how to deal with friends, family, and oneself. The chapter type stories make this excellent because you can read a person's experience easily in a short amount of time, and when you come back, you begin with a new person's ordeal. It's like having coffee with someone as they tell you about themselves, very easy listening /reading. With today's many ways of getting pregnant, and more chances of mishaps, this is timely reading for anyone. They don't have to be of childbearing age, and the versatility of the experiences makes it so very interesting. A soft, gentle, joyous noise of things that used to be whispered about. The binding makes it great to hold too! Connie Newell, RN/BS in Allied Health/Michigan"},{"Title":"The economic history of world population (Pelican Books)","review":"Professor Cipolla, in his preface, sets out his goal to; \`...describe from a global point of view the development of mankind...'. He himself admits that this is quite a task, but luckily he sticks to his guns and we do get a good description.The book starts by describing the two revolutions that he feels changed our history the most, the agricultural revolution of around 10,000 years ago, and the more recent industrial revolution. He explains how these affected our development, and relates this to mankind's increasing need for sources of power. This is where I feel the book really shines. Although he tends to quote a little heavily, his quotes are always relevant.He touches on the inequality of the distribution of global income and, true to his goal, he merely describes it.For a more in depth, and much longer, explanation of most of the themes covered in this book, with most of the 'whys' explained, try Jared Diamond's \\"Guns, Germs and Steel\\". For an off the beaten path explanation of underdevelopment, which Cipolla touches on, try Andr&eacute; Gunder Frank's \\"On Capitalist Underdevelopment\\"I enjoyed the book, reading it in one sitting. It definitely does what it set out to do. It does leave you asking why a lot, but then again his goal wasn't to tackle the 'whys'. Although the book was written in the early 1960's, thanks to the timescale it covers it has aged well, and is worth adding to a bookshelf."},{"Title":"The economic history of world population (Pelican Books)","review":"This book opens with a description of the thin layer of the earth's surface which man occupies. It aims to indicate how small and fragile the whole human enterprise is .Cipolla suggests that it is so miniscule that it is no wonder that other possible Civilizations cannot observe us. He then goes on to talk about the billions of years of earth's history and the small time Mankind has been part of this. Again he seems to want to underline the fragility and relative insignificance of our place in the Universe.He then puts our present Industrial and Scientific Civilization in the framework of Time Mankind has been said to exist, which he estimates as five hundred thousand years. He points out that the greatest part of that time human beings were involved in hunting for their subsistence, and that the Agricultural Revolution came with the Neolithic only ten- thousand years ago. He then traces out for the greater part of the book the history of Mankind in terms of its sources of energy, production and consumption , births and deaths ( population). He suggests that the accelerated population growth of the past century is creating unmanageable and undesirable pressure on resources. He too examines and deplores the great global inequality in distribution of resources. In his final chapter \\" The Age of Transition\\" he again refers to the three basic types of economic organization-hunting, agricultural, industrial as corresponding to the three ranges of demographic and economic organization society operates at. He says that now in our Age of Transition the Industrial form of organization is spreading throughout mankind, with correspondent abandonment of the land and crowding in great Cities.He says a new Age and style of life is emerging, and that this is subject for anguish and concern. He indicates family ties are on the wane, and a new form of technical training for the many will replace the philosophical education for the few. New tastes, values, ideals are part of the transition.Cipolla sees the Golden Age of Industrialization as 1850-1913 and suggests that we are now and will future generations will pay heavily in economic and social well- being for this process of Industrialization. He sees that there will be not only economic but also spiritual costs for it.He concludes by considering how in only ten- thousand years Mankind has moved from what he calls a state of savagery to a situation where he controls a good part of the world. He asks the question of whether our control over the Environment has led to correspondent increase in our quality as human beings. He laments that 'aggresiveness' which he sees as key to our survival in the world of savagery is still such a formative power in our lives. He worries over our weapons of mass- destruction and where our aggressiveness may take us with them.He too wonders whether the increase in the quantity of human beings will not lead to a decrease in the quality of our lives. He again mentions that at the start of the Neolithic there were perhaps ten million people on earth but in 1950 that had become 2.5 billion. ( I wonder how he would feel today when the number is 6.6 billion. Feb.2008) He concludes by saying that Control which leads to massive death and destruction is abominable. And he pleads for human tolerance and for the respect for ' the dignity and the worth and indeed the sanctity of human personality'.A brief summary work surveying human history like this is bound to be read with many questions and objections. But it provides true material for thought.I wonder for one what Cipolla would make of the latest electronic- Internet Revolution, or of across the board if vastly skewed increase in the standard of living of mankind- that has taken place over the past fifty years."},{"Title":"Revelation: Elham","review":"I have never read poetry this good, the author goes beyond the boundries of poetry entering a new world, when the gates of the book open, the reader enters into a fantasy land, the original pictures are amazing, the author expresses his love for his lady, with such clarity and beauty, love has never been expressed in such words, yet words are not enough to describe it! whoever the luck lady in his life is, bravo author! please write more, we need such gentle books in this harsh life!"},{"Title":"Revelation: Elham","review":"This book of prose is so overwhelming with tranquility!

It is a deceptively simple tale of a house-bound mouse who befriends a caged dove. But the conversations between the two creatures and the juxtapositions of domestic tasks for the mouse with the longing for the wild of the dove takes on a touching comment on Romanticism. The idea for the story is to be found in Dorothy Wordsworth's journals of Grasmere, which she kept for the pleasure of her brother, the poet William. She, William and Coleridge enjoyed a creative community of writing, but the contributions of Dorothy to this effort are only recently being recognized in feminist studies. Certainly this little story with its themes of domestic security and an awakened sense of the sublime of nature reflects the dilemma of women writers in Romanticism. While in Dorothy's original story the dove dies, in this book the dove is released by the mousewife. I do believe it would be well worth it to publish this book again."},{"Title":"the mousewife","review":"I have had this story for years in my class teaching of religion.

What a fantastic story about unforeseen friendship and bittersweet affection. The story is about a house-bound mouse who unexpectedly meets a caged dove. The mousewife is bored with her everyday routine caring for her mousehusband and has an appetite that cheese could never satisfy. She meets a dove who was captured and trapped. The dove's tales fill the mousewife with wonder and she is fascinated immediately. She learns about the world outside and aches for something more. Blue skies! Tall trees! Far horizons!

Children and adults of all ages will embrace this story which can be read on many different levels and deem it a true classic."},{"Title":"the mousewife","review":"Meet a special mousewife. She goes through the motions of doing her mousewifely duties but is just not satisfied with same old, same old. This mousewife, getting a glimpse at the world outside her realm (the confines of the house) \\"want[s] more.\\" Finally, a remedy to her longing arrives in the form of a turtledove, caught by a boy and confined in a cage by the woman of the house. Longing for his freedom, the dove refuses to eat. But in his new habitat, he has an avid audience in the disillusioned mousewife, with whom he shares his stories of flying and the joys of the world outside. Eventually he falls for her, even greets her with dove-y endearments and kisses \\"with his beak.\\" One night she puts her babies to sleep, then sneaks off to rendezvous with the bird.

I can imagine (and have seen) the whole disillusionment issue going (expectedly) straight over the heads of these kids. My biggest beef with the book, however, is that the original author, Dorothy Wordsworth, gets almost no credit for her story! Shouldn't the cover say, \\"by Dorothy Wordsworth, as retold by Rumer Godden\\"? I mean, where is the outrage? For this, I can't get beyond thinking the published version is just \\"okay.\\" And unfortunately, I have not been able to find the original version to judge it on its own merits.As the mother of picture book readers, I believe that there are much more appropriate books for four to eight year olds: Frederick, Swimmy, Inch by Inch and The Biggest House in the World - all by Leo Lionni and Lily's Purple Plastic Purse and Chrysanthemum by Kevin Henkes, who writes neat books with mice as main characters."},{"Title":"the mousewife","review":"Very good book.

Like the audio, this is no step-by-step list of specific actions to take to create or improve your relationships.

And who wouldn't want that? As we've seen in his three previous books, Steve Chandler is hip, funny, understanding--and right on the mark. He's knocking on our door, calling us to pay attention to each other, to ourselves, urging us try it, we WILL like it. And have fun doing it.With observations running the gamut from &quot;intention deficit disorder&quot; to basketball coach Phil Jackson's attitude toward coaching his championship players, Chandler has a great time gently, relentlessly, humorously reminding us that the success of our relationships--how we deal with people--is all about US. It's in our hands.

For the record, however, in response to Peter George: my note on Stonewall Jackson accurately observes that the Confederate forces under his command repulsed the Union army at the first Bull Run and forced their retreat to Washington. I elsewhere add (chapter V, note 14) that J. E. Johnston commanded all Confederate forces in the battle. Peter Bridges also seems to object that my notes are too detailed, even \\"demeaning\\" to \\"educated Penguin readers,\\" yet that my note re. Bailie Jarvie is not detailed enough.

Yes, it's dated, and to modern readers, the dialogue at times is corny and silly (as is DeForest's hesitancy to be more explicit about certain sexual matters). To me,though, that's part of the charm, along with its Victorian sentimentality. It's too bad it was not appreciated when it was published in 1867. Anyone interested in The War needs to read this--and keep in mind the fact that I'm a blue-blooded Southern boy."},{"Title":"Miss Ravenel's conversion from secession to loyalty,","review":"Miss Ravenel's Conversion from Secession to Loyalty may have a cumbersome title, but it is an enjoyable read. It tells the story of Lillie Ravenel who with her father are exiled from Louisiana at the beginning of the Civil War. Lillie is an ardent Confederate, but her father's loyalist sympathies force them to take refuge in New England. In the fictional city of New Boston, they meet two men who both fall in love with Lillie. These men fight for Lillie at the same time as fighting for the Union. It is through these relationships and through her experiences on returning to occupied Louisiana that Lillie's gradual conversion occurs.John De Forest's novel is part romance and part war story. These strands of the story are interweaved well and are fascinating for the insight they give into life in the 1860s. The romance is at times quite conventional with Lillie constantly blushing and occasionally swooning, but the story also contains unusual elements for a 19th century novel. The story includes a woman seeking an affair with a married man, a man keeping an apartment for his mistress and a Union officer conquering not only a Southern town, but also two of the women in it.The battle scenes are well told and are clearly based on De Forest's experiences during the war. He is not afraid to show the consequences of battle, describing soldiers horribly mutilated with rotting wounds. The actual battle scenes are quite few in number and are mainly skirmishes. The only large-scale engagement in which the characters are involved is Port Hudson. This is a pity for with De Forest's writing skill, it would have been interesting if he had been involved in and given an account of one of the really great battles. Nevertheless he provides a detailed account of army life during the Civil War showing the bureaucracy and boredom, the frustration and pettiness, the bravery and the cowardice. His account is extremely one-sided and he has scarcely a good word to say about the Confederacy, but this adds to the fascination of the novel, for it gives the reader first-hand insight into the attitude of a Union veteran towards his beaten enemy and why it was that he fought against the South.The Penguin edition of the novel has a good introduction with some helpful information about De Forest and the reception of his novel. It also has many useful notes especially those which translate phrases written in French and Latin. However it must be said that a lot of these notes are superfluous for most readers, e.g. explaining what the Mason Dixon Line is, or what the dodo was, and some of the notes are mistaken such as the statement that Stonewall Jackson commanded the Confederate forces at first Manassas."},{"Title":"Miss Ravenel's conversion from secession to loyalty,","review":"This is perhaps the best novel with the worst title ever written. Set during the Civil War, the novel depicts the war in all its sordidness: the blunders, the incompetence, the poor leadership. Miss Ravenel is a Southerner who falls in love with a Union captain and gradually sheds her rebel coat for the Northern cause. De Forest's realism is admirable, his writing ability even more so. It's hard to think of a better novel about the Civil War than this one, the first to treat the war realistically. This is truly a minor American masterpiece and should be much better known."},{"Title":"Miss Ravenel's conversion from secession to loyalty,","review":"Written shortly after the end of the Civil War this novel covers all of the bases -- politics, battles, social issues, and personal relationships -- affected by the war. It does this with a depth not usually seen in Civil War novels and particularly those written in the 20th century. De Forest does not insult the reader's intelligence and his characters are not just stereotypes but have real flesh and blood. (Well, except maybe for the heroine!) If you enjoy this book try A Fool's Errand for a good novel about Reconstruction also written shortly after the end of the Civil War."},{"Title":"Miss Ravenel's conversion from secession to loyalty,","review":"Note: I read the Univ. of Nebraska Press edition.Does this novel depict the Civil War realistically? Yes. Is Lillie Ravenel the strong heroine depicted by the book's description? No. She comes off as a bit silly, actually. Miss Ravenel's Conversion is less about Miss Ravenel's conversion and more about life during the Civil War (wait, I'm in the South...War of Northern Aggression) and domestic affairs at the time. The first half of the book was rather boring, being mostly about Lillie's friendship with two military men, the drinking, philandering Carter and the gentle lawyer Colborne, and how she eventually decides which of the two she'll marry. It sounds kind of Jane Austen-esque, but De Forest fails to make it very interesting. The second half of the novel picks up some, however, with descriptions of battles and military life, Lillie's father's plantation experiment with free black labor, and Carter's eventual dissolution into political corruption and adultery. While De Forest's characterizations of women and Southerners seemed rather degrading, he doesn't glorify the Union, either (again with Carter's corruption, and there's some comical bits about drunk and/or cowardly commanders). After all, the novel is considered a work of realist literature."},{"Title":"Miss Ravenel's conversion from secession to loyalty,","review":"This is a very good novel and it behooves every Civil War student to read this book. Books written today about the War often say more about our times than the War; that's why I like this book. My great-grandfather fought with the Sixth Kentucky Volunteers (USA) in the Western Theater. His father was wounded at Chicamauga and sent home. Reading this book allowed me to glimpse into that time, not from the perspective of a modern day author, but from the perspective of one who really lived the War. His battle descriptions are fascinating and, for my money, his finest passage begins on p. 307 (Penguin Edition) with \\"Such was the defense of Fort Winthrop...\\" I think that DeForest wonderfully captures the wistfulness of those individuals who experienced the raw energy of battle (e.g. Oliver Wendell Holmes' descriptions on his service) and realize, with a bit of relief, but with a bit of melancholy that he will never have that feeling again. All veterans live with this kind of thought, I think; DeForest captures the Civil War veteran's thinking here perfectly.One more thing positive about this novel: DeForest's use of characters, who are Southern and yet against secession, is a fine change of pace from modern novels which can only offer up tired cliches of North/South characters. DeForest's characters seem closer to the truth than our modern sensibilities allow (especially when it comes to race). This is a novel really worth reading for many reasons."},{"Title":"Miss Ravenel's conversion from secession to loyalty,","review":"i was somewhat putoff by the title of this book but after adapting to the 19th century prose, i was blown away by discovering a book to put by melville , hawthorne or henry james.

Traveling by foot with his stoic wife and baby girl, hay-trusser Michael Henchard arrives in Weydon-Priors during its annual fair. Having drunk too much laced furmity he makes an astounding offer to those gathered in the tent: he will auction off the unvalued females to the highest bidder! Fate protects poor Susan and Elizabeth Jane as the only bidder proves a decent sailor named Newsome. The simple-minded woman does not realize that such a contract is not binding, but remains with him--even emigrating to Canada for 18 years--until his reported death at sea.Somewhat sobered the next day Henchard feels deep remorse--to the extent that he enters an empty church and swears abstinence for 21 years in penance. Arriving in the major city of Casterbridge-site of ancient Roman ruins and some lugubrious customs-he works his way up in Society until he becomes a respected grain merchant and eventually the mayor. Though unwed he had a dalliance on the island of Jersey with a local girl named Lucetta, who nursed him through an illness--thus compromising her own reputation.The wheels of fate are grinding away when Susan and Elizabeth Jane-who may not be his daughter after all-arrive in Casterbridge. The latter has been raised in ignorance of the auction and Henchard's role in her life, but her mother is nervous, desiring to appeal to him quietly before deciding her next course of action and residence. On the eve of a big feast in town another newcomer arrives: a young Scotsman named Donald Farfrae, en route to Canada himself. Taking an immediate liking to the smart young fellow, Henchard convinces him to stay on and serve as his manager. Thus Hardy sets in motion the literary mechanism of a complicated plot: two men courting one woman; two women who are attracted to one man and eventually two men claiming to be Elizabeth Jane's father.There is a sense of fatalism in many of Hardy's novels; his characters strive against their destiny (the result of poor choices, as well as untoward coincidences) but they seem compelled to play out their dismal roles. Tragedy perhaps, pathos definitely. Hardy highlights the often unfair role of women in his society, set against a backdrop of snobbery, poverty, a strict class system and an undercurrent of superstition. A bit grim but satisfying for devotees of 19th century British literature."},{"Title":"Life and Death of the Mayor of Casterbridge (New Wessex editions)","review":"The Mayor of Casterbridge, Thomas Hardy's great novel published in 1886, is a classic of English Literature. The main character, Michael Henchard gets drunk at a fair and sells his wife and child to a sailor. Henchard, after sobering up, realizes what a terrible thing he has done and swears off alcohol and tries to find his wife and child.Now, that sounds like something Homer Simpson would do in a drunken bout, doesn't it?Sounds like a classic to me!

If you are a reader who likes suspense and tragedy then this book is for you."},{"Title":"Life and Death of the Mayor of Casterbridge (New Wessex editions)","review":"One of Hardy's best novels. The characterisation are excellent and the descriptive writing is superb. I recommend it highly."},{"Title":"Life and Death of the Mayor of Casterbridge (New Wessex editions)","review":"Thomas Hardy's \\"The Mayor of Casterbridge\\" seems to be a moral allegory. In a moment of drunken callousness, young Michael Henchard sells his wife and daughter to a genial sailor. When he awakes from his drunken stupor Henchard sinks deep in regret, and swears not to touch the bottle again for two decades. He searches for his family, and unable to locate them he stumbles into the town of Casterbridge where he develops a successful farming business, becomes mayor and the pillar of the community. Eighteen years later, when his wife and daughter find him the single and temperate Mayor of Casterbridge makes haste in reclaiming his lost family, and it seems it's all well that ends well.At the same time a young dashing Scotsman Donald Farfrae enters Henchard's life, and the Mayor is determined to make Donald his acolyte. It seems that the two have much in common, but Donald proves he is in fact the Mayor's polar opposite. Whereas Michael can be both generous (he pleas with Donald to remain in Casterbridge to work for him) and stingy (he fires Donald after dancing with his daughter Elizabeth-Jane), loving and brutal, brooding and quick to anger, Donald is the model of the proper Christian businessman and husband. Donald understands, forgives, tolerates, and endures all of Michael's impetuous insults and attacks, and he is finally rewarded with Michael's lover, daughter, business, and mayorship.But ultimately Michael Henchard is the protagonist of the novel, and while he is certainly petty, provincial, and proud his fall is both epic and poignant. Michael had eighteen years of quiet prosperity in Casterbridge, but the novel makes no mention of it at all, and Michael must endure one tragedy after another. It seems that Michael's undoing is that he thinks and feels too much. He is quick to anger and proud of mind because he is first to love and steadfast in his loyalty; in comparison, Donald Farfrae seems cold and calculating, slowly and methodically building his reputation at the cost of Michael's. Yes, Michael did fire Donald, but Michael had urgently pleaded with Donald to stay in Casterbridge and given him experience, connections, and a reputation: if Donald had truly been good and loyal he would have left instead of staying to compete with Michael. And then there's Lucetta who was engaged to Michael but eloped with Donald: this one act proved the irreversible destruction of Michael's fortune.If this is a moral allegory, and ostensibly it is nothing but a moral allegory it is not certain what is being said. Should we really aim to be like Donald Farfrae who is cold in his generosity and calculating in his fair-mindedness? And yes there really isn't much to be said for Michael Henchard's pride and anger, but there was also something concretely good and stubbornly noble about the man. He was also capable of reflection, and in the end he sought to do what was good, even if it meant disappearing forever. Look under Donald Farfrae's smooth handsomeness, and you'll discover guile and duplicity. Look under Michael Herndon's rugged vehemence, and you'll discover love and goodness. Michael Herndon has wronged so he seeks to do right. But having never done wrong does Donald Farfrae know the difference between right and wrong?\\"The Mayor of Casterbridge\\" marks a revolution in rural England, as the Enlightenment and Industrial Revolution finally begin to set in. Calculating reason and Christian piety seek to overturn the rural tempers and superstitions that have dominated the England countryside for so long, and so Donald Farfrae must inevitably triumph over Michael Herndon. Yes, with Michael Herndon's departure, the world has become a calmer, more reasonable, more enlightened place. But \\"The Mayor of Casterbridge\\" leaves us with a hanging question: are we better for it?"},{"Title":"Life and Death of the Mayor of Casterbridge (New Wessex editions)","review":"This was an ok novel.

Never have i read such a wonderful piece of literature. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Life and Death of the Mayor of Casterbridge (New Wessex editions)","review":"The notes on the back of my copy of this book describe it as a &quot;Sophoclean&quot; tragedy. This is a very apt description. Like the plays of Sophocles, Hardy's novel proceeds directly from one mistake and misunderstanding to the next with very little padding in between. As a result, the plot can seem unlikely (as several below have commented). It's sad, however, if people reject it for that reason.This novel contains one of the more fascinating characters in literature. Michael Henchard is a man of the &quot;old school&quot; who conducts business on a hand shake and who constantly acts and reacts to the visible world. Despite this, he is often aware of his mistakes after the fact, yet is unable to use this knowledge to avoid future pitfalls.He's contrasted brilliantly with Donald Farfrae, who is a &quot;new man&quot; who trusts in the future. Ironically (and I suspect intentionally) Hardy make Farfrae seem a far shallower man than Henchard. Yet, the &quot;new man&quot; ends up on top.The end of this novel is one of the bitterest in all of literature. Henchard's will being an almost total negation of his existance. What could be more tragic than that for a flawed, but essentially good man?"},{"Title":"Life and Death of the Mayor of Casterbridge (New Wessex editions)","review":"I loved the irony.

Yes, that is part of it, but 80% of the story has little to do with that fact. In actuality, it is about relationships, and the choices we make that can have an impact on those we love.

It came just in time."},{"Title":"Life and Death of the Mayor of Casterbridge (New Wessex editions)","review":"About two thirds through this undeniably great work, I began to question everything I thought I knew about this book. Kicking off in high drama and then barrelling on in that fashion with not even a stop for air, the twists and turns in Hardy's tale of morality, regret, and character seemed to occur due to the faults and failures of the principal actors, and not thanks to any plot contrivances on the part of Hardy. Which ever the case, this is a great testament to Hardy's writing abilities, but as the story progressed, the idea that Hardy was pushing the limits of \\"fate\\" and \\"tragedy\\" to its extreme seeped in. By the time I finished the book and sat puzzled over the complete change in tone for the last two paragraphs, I realized that Hardy had written one of the greatest pieces of satirical tragedy ever.Based on an actual inicident Hardy read about in a local newspaper, a husband, travelling on the road with his family, gets drunk and auctions off his wife to the highest bidder. After being offered a considerable amount of money, the wife is sold and she willingly leaves with the highest bidder, daughter in tow, as the drunken husband stays behinds and drinks.End first scene, cut to 18 years later. The man has become a teetotaler and has so righted his life, he has become the Mayor of Casterbridge. The wife enters the town, beautiful now older daughter in tow, looking for her former husband now that her husband-by-auction has died. They meet, work out a plan to remarry, and set about doing that.We then discover that the Mayor is already engaged to another woman. We discover that one of the Mayor's enemies is interested in wooing his daughter. We discover that the girl he believes is his daughter- has been told is his daughter!- is not actually his daughter. Discovery after discovery rain down upon us, each one forcing the characters to react in ways that while always consistent with their characters, creates further drama and eventually, tragedy.Hardy is an incredible author and even if this was nothing more than a tale about character and ethics, it would be an incredible read. When viewed as a satire of such tales, however- like an updated Job story without the God aspect, with the Mayor being Job- the work rises to another level. Hardy is funny, and even in the context of obviously serious works, there are occasional lighthearted moments. But once one grasps this complex work as a satire of similar works, Hardy verges on being hysterical. The Mayor of Casterbridge is a living character with obvious faults, but the heap of abuse that Hardy piles upon him in no way corresponds with his initital heinous act. Unless, of course, you're trying to be funny.Regardless of whether this is meant to be taken seriously or not, it is an underrated (as far as Hardy books go) classic.(And those last two paragraphs I alluded to above: their tone, syntax, vocabulary all sound like they come from a different book. To me, it sounded like Hardy was having one last laugh, foolishly trying to validate all the tragedy that occurred with two \\"intellectual\\" sounding paragraphs. One last bone to throw to those so absorbed in morality tales that they couldn't see that this whole journey was a farce.)"},{"Title":"Life and Death of the Mayor of Casterbridge (New Wessex editions)","review":"Fast delivery and was able to enjoy with my daughter on a cross country trip. It came just as I thought."},{"Title":"Life and Death of the Mayor of Casterbridge (New Wessex editions)","review":"Nineteenth century literary classic, details a man seeling his wife and daughter and the long term consequence. It's a pretty powerful and deeply ambitious story, one that makes up for a couple feeble plot stimulators with a powerful psychological representation. What's most interesting is the protagonist, the titular individual. A man so committed to drunk and evasion that he will sell off his own family. Also a man that works across the rest of the novel to redeem himself from this moment, but not without much backsliding and fresh egotistical mistakes. He's also capable enough to claw his way up into a position of wealth and authority, but then later lose that fortune, and the book is quite effective in showing the degree to which his admuirable qualities are tied in with his core defects. He's far from a monster, and for all the damage his pride and spiteful rejection cause to other lives there is much to admire about him, his strength of character, his general optimism and the way he's able to come forth with strong ethical choice at the most surprising moments. He's an intriguing, complex and overall plausible character, most notably in the way that none of his grand transcendetal moments lack, the way he continually reverts back partially to his earlier ways.More generally, the work shows an engaging cynicism about the status of class, gender and hypocrisy in contemporary England. There are some very strong critiques in here against Victorian society, to the extent that I'm surprised it attained the popularity it did in its own time, and these are always coonected to an engaging novel. It makes me a lot more interested in reading the other nineteenth century literary classics I've so far neglected.

Foreseeing its approach, I would want to put the whole novel aside, but morbid fascination led me to continue reading. That's the way it is with thrillers.

The Mayor of Casterbridge is widely considered to be Thomas Hardy's greatest novel. It is a classic tale of the spiral and eventual demise of an essentially bad man. The story is rich with personal intrigue... sins, lies, cover-ups, love triangles, secret identities and so on... making it a continual pleasure to read. The regional dialect (spelled phonetically throughout) can be a bit cumbersome to wade through at times, though it certainly lends atmosphere to the novel.The characters are interesting and easy to relate to and Hardy did an admirable job of making most of them distinctly human: Michael Henchard is \\"bad\\" (as evidenced by the sale of his wife and child in the opening scene) but is also carefully drawn as essentially flawed and insecure, rather than a flat parody of evil. Donald Farfrae, who is as good as Henchard is bad, is also flawed in his own ways which adds depth to his character too. Hardy was obviously better at creating men than women because the women are a little more \\"Victorian stereotypical\\": the good ones are pictures of chaste virtue who can actually take ill and die over a nasty shock (puh-lease) and the bad ones are fat hags in bawdy houses. The women are certainly less interesting than the men in this book.The plot is nearly impossible to adequately discuss without writing a book of my own. After the initial unforgivable act, the book fast-forwards 19 years and we soon learn that the previously down-on-his-luck Henchard has made a success of himself in the rural town of Casterbridge, where he is a wealthy merchant and mayor of the town. At the same time that he takes on a quick and capable apprentice (Farfae), his wife and daughter reappear in his life. Farfrae proves to be better at Henchard's business than Henchard is, Henchard has to abandon another woman in favor of doing right by his wife and the daughter's paternity is quickly called into question. Intrigue, twists, turns and surprises ensue. And all the while, Henchard's selfishness, quick temper and poor-decision making contrive to bring about his eventual fall. It all makes for a very satisfying read... not as satisfying as say, reading about the Count of Monte Cristo dealing out his brand of justice... but it is interesting to see how things unravel for Henchard nonetheless.The Bottom Line: a very entertaining and complex story from the Victorian era.

See my profile for details."},{"Title":"Life and Death of the Mayor of Casterbridge (New Wessex editions)","review":"\\"The Mayor Of Casterbridge\\" captures a lot of what makes Thomas Hardy resonate with people today: hard existential truths playing out amid pastoral splendor; naturalistic descriptions of fantastic events; an agnostic worldview that centers around a sense of Christian guilt and loss. The countercurrents create a lot of creative tension.But what makes \\"The Mayor Of Casterbridge\\" so powerful more than a century after its 1886 publication is its multifaceted, emotionally conflicted depiction of the central character. Like King Lear and Ibsen's Solness the Master Builder, Hardy's Michael Henchard has no one but himself to blame for most of the misery that befalls him. Still he compels sympathy and a growing sense of investment from the reader.We meet him, in one of the all-time great openings of noveldom, selling off his timid wife and child in a fit of rum-tinged pique. He regrets this almost immediately, but fails to relocate them. Instead, he swears off liquor and remakes himself years later as a prosperous leader in a town he chances upon in his travels, Casterbridge.Alas the dark spikes of his id are never far from the surface, especially after his wife and her daughter come to Casterbridge. \\"Though under a long reign of self-control he had become Mayor and churchwarden and whatnot, there was still the same unruly volcanic stuff beneath the rind of Michael Henchard as when he had sold his wife at Weydon Fair,\\" Hardy writes.Henchard is a portrait in grayscale, nothing too black or white. In one scene, Hardy shows him mercilessly humiliating a lazy farmhand, then tells us Henchard keeps the farmhand's mother stocked with coal in winter. When the wife returns, Henchard has a romance brewing but puts it aside to do right by the woman he wronged. He's definitely not happy about it, and prone to self-pity and lashing out, but Hardy's intuitive narration keeps you identifying with Henchard, never leading you too far from his point of view.For a character study the story moves fast, even if the prose style is ornate. Hardy's descriptive abilities are on constant display, with scenic rides through the country. There's much local Wessex color (Hardy's own quasi-mythical kingdom, where most of his novels are set) and a chorus of memorable townspeople, like a fellow whose theft of coins from the eyes of a corpse is excused thus: \\"Money is scarce, and throats get dry. Why should death rob life o' four pence?\\"Death is omnipresent in \\"Mayor Of Casterbridge\\", but Hardy justifies the novel's gloomy tone with a memorably powerful, courageously bleak conclusion. \\"Casterbridge's\\" greatness lies at its two ends. In between, the story keeps your interest but keeps hitting the same notes, with some sketchy melodrama and improbable coincidences amid brighter moments. Hardy even gets maudlin with a dead goldfinch metaphor.Most problematic of all is the absence of interest in the main characters beyond Henchard. Except for a jilted lover who forces her way back into Henchard's life with minxish self-possession, they are an entirely boring crew, existing only to be contrasted with Henchard's more forceful personality.\\"Casterbridge\\" may leave you wishing you chose something else to read in a lighter vein, say \\"The Painted Bird\\" or \\"The Bell Jar\\". But it's worth reading for that same emotional toll, a reminder of life's harder truths that may leave you sad but perhaps a bit more conscious of the truth behind the line: \\"There but for the Grace of God go I.\\""},{"Title":"Life and Death of the Mayor of Casterbridge (New Wessex editions)","review":"In some ways this is a hard book to get into since it is set in a totally different culture from ours -rural England of the mid-nineteenth century. You would think that that is close enough in time to not be a problem. But to me the things like their courtship customs, or what is considered scandalous/honorable behavior, are really at a variance with the way we act today that I found it hard to relate to. Add to this some of the implausible melodrama and coincidences that make up the plot and I almost ended up putting down the book.However I kept reading and in the end I thought it was an excellent story. This is because it illustrated a truth about life that I could empathize with. How a man through pride, anger, stubbornness and alcoholism could end up destroying his relationships with all of the people he is close to and in middle age end up being alienated from everyone who was important to him in his life. Since this story was written there have been millions of guys like Michael Henchard. The details of their lives are different, their endings may have been different. But there is an underlying truth that is the same. That aspect of the story is timeless."},{"Title":"Life and Death of the Mayor of Casterbridge (New Wessex editions)","review":"this is the first book ive read out of thomas hardy's many works, and i thought it was absolutely brilliant. he uses his perceptive insight into the human nature to create very realistic characters with complex personalites.each scene he describes is filled with vivid imagery that leave your senses tingling.i highly recommend this book to anyone that loves a well-written, easy-to-understand classic."},{"Title":"Life and Death of the Mayor of Casterbridge (New Wessex editions)","review":"I have not read any of Hardy's books before - and chanced upon this one, and found no regrets.

When a man sells his wife and daughter to a sailor for five guineas, he becomes devastated. Finding a whole new life, he becomes the wealthy mayor of Casterbridge. Not ever thinking he would see his wife and daughter again, the inevitable happens. As the story goes from bad to good and good to worse, various characters explore the realms of fate.The work of Hardy allows his readers to have a better understanding of the world. Many people today are nave of the terrible things happening all around them. The exaggerated situations, such as a woman dieing because of embarrassment, allow readers to have a new perspective of life. A realization is created that everyone has two sides to them; good and bad. Whether it is a lie or the truth, people affect the lives of others.What if one secret could ruin the lives of many others?

The loss of a wife, mother, daughter, love, husband, father and mentor are all carried off extremely well. I chose to read this book for a project I'm doing in my English class and although it was not my first choice, I do recommend it to anyone who loves English literature. I'm a big fan of Dickens and Hardy and truly loved this magnificent piece of work."},{"Title":"Life and Death of the Mayor of Casterbridge (New Wessex editions)","review":"When one finishes \\"Casterbridge,\\" one is immediately struck by its place in the development of the novel. Hardy came after Dickens and before James, and his style intrigues as you connect parts of it to the former, parts to the latter.His plotting is sort of Dickens \\"lite.\\" There are mysterious benefactors, sudden tragic deaths, reversals of fortune, paternity mysteries, ect. His prose is cleaner and easier to read than both Dickens and James; \\"Casterbridge\\" scans better than \\"Bleak House\\" or \\"The Wings of the Dove.\\"The story begins when a pastoral laborer, in a drunken rage, sells his wife and child one evening (I hate it when that happens...). When he wakes the next morning, abhorred at what he has done, he swears off liquor and decides to make something of his life. The novel truly begins eighteen years later, when his wife and daughter come back to present themselves to him. In the course of the rest of the novel, we witness the fall of the now Mayor of Casterbridge, brought about by his own character flaws and the interventions of fate.Henchard, the main character, is a facinating combination of hot-spirited volition and turn-on-a-dime repentance. He is quick to do things which damn him but just as quick to admit his guilt. He is a wonderful character and a precursor to the later \\"psychological\\" novels of James and Forster. The satellite characters remind one of Dickens, but they are not nearly as startling and interesting, but of course, a character such as Henchard never existed in all of Dickens.The novel proceeds to its forgone conclusion inexorably, albiet with a few melodromatic touches, yet it sustains its tone and readibility due mostly to Henchard, and the dramatic situations Hardy puts him through.Well worth a look."},{"Title":"Life and Death of the Mayor of Casterbridge (New Wessex editions)","review":"Since I have decided to dedicate part of my time spent reading in 2003 to the classics, I started first with The Mayor of Casterbridge, not the most famous of Hardy's works but seemingly a good place to start. I will definitely read the other works by this author since I was so captivated by this book.The novel begins with the sale of Michael Henchard's wife and child to the highest bidder at a local summer fair. Henchard is drunk and his wife, tired of his habits, decides to leave with the sailor who bids on her and her daughter. Henchard wakes up the next morning, somewhat remorseful for what he has done and vows not to drink for twenty-one years.The very next chapter picks up the story nineteen years later, with the return of the wife and child into Henchard's life. Henchard is now quite wealthy and is such an important man in his community, he is now Mayor of Casterbridge. From here, a series of wrong decisions and misunderstandings lead to the devastating conclusion.Hardy is well known for his tendency towards gloomy endings and this book certainly fits the mold. But he is also well known for his lyrical descriptions of the English countryside and describing a way of life which had disappeared even in his own time. There were beautiful passages about the hay carts being driven through town, loaded so high that people on the second floor of homes could reach out and touch the top of the hay. Small details abound, describing the sound of rain on trees and the smell of the local foods. But perhaps the most significant aspect of the novel for me was the feeling that Henchard had wished for everything that had happened to him, and all of his wishes came true, and thus ultimately his downfall. These wishes were almost all made in a rash moment, when perhaps a minute or more of reflection could have produced a clearer head. Yet Henchard lives by his instincts, since for almost twenty years they seemed to serve him well.I would recommend this book to any serious literature lover and I believe it serves as a good introduction to his other works. His books serve as a bridge from Victorian literature to modern literature, with no happy endings guaranteed."},{"Title":"Life and Death of the Mayor of Casterbridge (New Wessex editions)","review":"At first I was forced to read &quot;The Mayor of Casterbridge&quot; in school more than 12 years ago. Reading it slowly made an impact on my life. This book always served a special purpose in my life. It introduced me to the wide world of Literature. It sort of enlighten my interest and liking for English literature. Now re-reading it not only brought back fond memories of my yester school days but also renewed my liking to one of the greatest writer of all time Thomas Hardy.Through this novel I came to the understanding of Irony and oxymoron. Hardy totally wrote with a sense of awareness of human characteristic and he had a amazing style of mixed humour with tragedy.His protagonist,Michael Henchard's life was under the microscope of Hardy.I love the way the story began I quote:&quot;ONE evening of late summer, before the nineteenth century had reached one-third of its span, a young man and woman, the latter carrying a child, were approaching the large village of Weydon-Priors, in Upper Wessex, on foot. &quot; I love the Englishness and the sense of intriguing events that would follow...In brief, Michael Henchard was a drunk who sold his wife and daughter at the fair. Later he realised his mistakes he work real hard and eventually became the mayor of Casterbridge. His life took another twist 20 years later when his wife and daughter came back to his life plus a few more other characters adding on the complexity of his life.Soonafter events unfolded and many things became to go against his way and then came his downfall. Indeed Michael Henchard's rise and fall were filled with compelling details and his encounters with numerous intestering people.What I love most about this novel was the way Hardy depicted Henchard's behaviours and thoughts and totally enhanced his weak character and irresponsibleness with dashes of ironies. His sardonic literary style were brilliant and at the same time he also vividly described the scenery and situations. Another greatest of Hardy was his ability to create innovative characters still account for in modern contemporary days and he was a pioneer in analysising human's weakness and blended it into his creation. It's a vintage classic,psychoanalytic and intriguingly written ,a must read for all books lover."},{"Title":"Life and Death of the Mayor of Casterbridge (New Wessex editions)","review":"I'm re-reading this book that thrilled me years ago and thrills me today. Now, however, I realize just how &quot;modern&quot; it is, even more so than the works of Dickens, whom I also revere, but whose writing had a quaint quality that actually makes him the lesser artist, in my opinion. Hardy's writing is spare but nothing is left out. You feel it, you taste it, you live it. It has the firm, sure quality of a minimalist work of art, and yet the twists and turns of its plot are dizzying. I detect its influence on novelist Toni Morrison, I might add. I'd be willing to bet she's a Hardy scholar. I read many passages, many scenes, that reminded me of her &quot;folksy&quot; conceits. And I was amazed at Hardy's contemporary understanding of addiction, in this case alcoholism. In fact, Henchard is a &quot;dry drunk.&quot; He abstains from liquor for 21 years, but his character defects and lack of spiritual awareness catapault him right back into his disease when he begins drinking again. In fact, his life spirals out of control faster and faster with his first return to drink, showing that alcoholism, like all addictions, is a progressive disease. A reviewer here said the book was depressing, and that Hardy is dark. However, the &quot;light&quot; in Hardy comes with his wisdom, not unlike Faulkner's, of human nature. There are so many themes of the enduring truths that one is uplifted just by the reading. Sometimes I mourn for the writers I will never meet, the ones who have passed on. Their teaching is so important to my own spiritual and artistic growth, that I have experienced a great love from them and for them. Hardy is one of those for me. Wherever he dwells now, I send him my appreciation."},{"Title":"Life and Death of the Mayor of Casterbridge (New Wessex editions)","review":"The Mayor of Casterbridge is not Thomas Hardy's most famous or acclaimed novel, but in the opinion of this die-hard fan it is his best. The later Tess of the D'Urbervilles and Jude the Obscure are generally considered his masterpieces, but while this lacks their epic grandeur and sociopolitical relevance, it is more immediately arresting, has a more conventionally interesting plot, and features one of literature's best tragic heroes. I give it the highest possible recommendation not only for fans but for anyone even remotely alive to literary greatness.Hardy in his day was nearly unique in mixing high literary elements with what would later be called pulp factors. Hard as it is to imagine, he was like William Faulkner and Stephen King in one - a true artist with mass appeal, both critically acclaimed and bestselling. However, his early nineteenth century rural English settings, heavy dialect use, eccentric vocabulary, and other characteristics make many current readers think his books slow going. The Mayor is the obvious exception, beginning almost immediately with one of the most arresting and unforgettable scenes in all literature - nothing less than a drunken man selling his wife and child to a stranger out of anger and disgust. As often with Hardy, it is based on a real incident, but he dramatizes so vividly that we cannot help being enthralled. The drama indeed reaches such a fever pitch in these first few pages that even those normally averse to classic literature can hardly help being pulled in.Such a beginning sets a very high standard, and it is a testament to the book's greatness that it never disappoints - and, indeed, hardly lets up. The popular aspects of Hardy's fiction made him more influential on later writers, especially mainstream ones, than nearly any other classic author; it is almost impossible to exaggerate his impact, which is such that even many who have never read him have been greatly influenced without knowing it. These strengths are present even in his earliest fiction, but The Mayor is the preeminent example. Supremely engrossing and intriguing, it is full of plot twists that will keep even the savviest readers guessing and ends in one of the most spectacularly memorable conclusions ever. One could not expect more from even the most entertaining pulp novel - and The Mayor of course has a wealth of great artistry to boot. To be sure, this Hardy aspect has always had critics bemoaning apparent overreliance on complex plots and melodramatic coincidence, the implication being that Hardy was unable to make a story without them. However, anyone even remotely familiar with him knows that he was intensely interested in coincidence, chance, and fate, using them deliberately to dramatize what dominated his thought. Those aware of this can see how well his writings work out the implications of his bleak impressions: that humans are near-laughably insignificant on the cosmic scale, that no force sympathetic to humans or generally benevolent controls the universe, and that human life is essentially miserable with little chance of success at love or other happiness. More specifically, his work illustrates what he called the Imminent Will - an unconscious force controlling human action. What seems luck or chance may thus be very much otherwise, though we can do nothing about it. Many have said that he has an almost malevolent attitude toward his characters, plotting so that things work out in the worst possible way and cause them the greatest possible suffering, but this is simply Hardy's view of the human condition. The Mayor's complicated plot is an essential example - perhaps the preeminent. Hardy was later somewhat unsatisfied, thinking that it suffered more from serialization's effects than any of his other novels. He worried that he included too many improbabilities and twists in an effort to include an exciting event in every installment but noted with satisfaction that the events arise naturally from the story, and so they do. Those who do not like this feature elsewhere will be unconvinced - or even have their view cemented -, but those for whom Hardy's tragic vision speaks powerfully will be in awe of the masterful execution.There are several keys to its success. Hardy reiterated over and over again that probability of character, not of action, is what matters, and this proves it. The book works mainly because its characters are so believable and often identifiable; we care about them in spite of - or arguably even because of, such is Hardy's skill - the highly-wrought events. It has one of Hardy's largest casts, and the four main characters are some of his most fully realized and memorable. Three are unsurprisingly doomed to near-constant suffering: the admirably strong-willed and hard-working but fatally impulsive Michael Henchard; Elizabeth-Jane, who has great empathy and love potential but is so passive that others constantly step on her with impunity; and the dignified but overly passionate Lucetta. The fourth, Donald Farfrae, is one of Hardy's most original and interesting. He was not one to champion a creation, but Farfrae is probably his most thoroughly positive and genuinely likable. Other characters are drawn to him almost irresistibly, and so are we; intelligent, industrious, and positively infectious, he is drawn with a good humor almost never seen in Hardy and gives much of the book's appeal. He is also notable as a sympathetic and nuanced Scotch character from an English writer.But this is of course mainly Henchard's story, and what a story! Hardy based his tragic fiction on ancient Greek models, but Henchard is his only true example of the tragic hero central to those works - a character who is in many ways admirable but imbued with a flaw that proves his downfall. \\"Impulsiveness\\" perhaps sums up his and is manifested in various ways; many know such a person, but the far more important thing is that we can see ourselves in him. He is in some ways an Everyman despite obvious flaws and has several admirable qualities, not least how he raised himself from extreme poverty to relative wealth and prominence by sheer force of will. However, his fall is even greater than his rise - in fact, one of the greatest and most affecting ever imagined. It is a true testament to Hardy's artistry that he makes us care for Henchard despite him being in many ways despicable; for him to win our hearts after the opening scene seems not only impossible but perverse to even conceive, yet Hardy pulls it off. There is much to dislike, but he is fully and thus frailly and tragically human. Whether or not we think him redeemed, he is more sinned against than sinning, as even those he has wronged eventually see. Yet he also undeniably caused his own demise; what seems like bad luck or wretched fate is really his bad decisions' delayed consequences. His end is one of the most highly tragic and sympathetic ever written; he dies miserably alone and fully broken, denied even the last ray of light that a guilty conscience and sincere repentance could have potentially given. The scene with his final note - complete with misspellings belying the lack of education and humble background that made his rise more remarkable but that he was in many ways unable to overcome - is one of the most moving I have ever read. It is the culmination of what is a highly emotional work throughout; Hardy runs us through a gamut of feelings as only he can. The pathos is at times almost unbearable, and few readers will not cry at least once. Indeed, aside from Les Mis&eacute;rables, which I believe is unquestionably the greatest creation of all-time, no other book out of the hundreds or thousands I have read has moved me so often or deeply. Other than Victor Hugo, Hardy has no equal at conveying emotion, and this is his supreme example. Later works, particularly Tess, show the tragedy of the human condition on a grander scale, but only Oedipus Rex itself even rivals this as a supremely moving depiction of individual tragedy. Indeed, I can say without hyperbole that nothing else I have ever experienced - artistic or otherwise - has driven home life's profound tragedy with such conviction or force.This alone is of course more than enough reason to read the book, but the work is also notable for other reasons. Chief among these is another perennial Hardy strength - great sense of place. Perhaps no one equals him in making place so vivid that it is essential to the story; setting is never mere background with him. He is of course best-known in this regard for Wessex - the part-real, part-dream country based on his native Southwest England that he made world famous. Setting is not as important here as in some other works, but the Casterbridge focus is particularly noteworthy. Based on the real-life Dorchester, Casterbridge is Wessex's largest town; nearly all Wessex stories and a considerable number of the poems mention it, and many take place there in part. However, this is unique in being almost entirely set there, giving both a fascinating glimpse into Southwest England's early nineteenth-century hub and filling in much of the background to other works. This is invaluable to fans and of considerable interest to historians and others.Relatedly, Hardy's work is well-known for showing modernity's ache, i.e., how technology and other advances were rapidly and drastically changing a society that had been essentially the same for a thousand years. The Mayor in particular portrays its effect on agriculture and other business aspects, depicting all with realism and human interest. Some current readers may think this makes the book drag somewhat, but it will be a big attraction for others, especially those keen on the background to the book and its importance to Hardy's life and thought.I simply cannot praise the novel highly enough; it is one of the all-time greatest artistic achievements, a supreme creation of artistry and, more fundamentally, the human heart. Suffice it to say that anyone sensitive to the unforgettable final two paragraphs, which sum up Hardy's grim but eminently practical view of existence in his fine inimitable style and conclude by calling happiness \\"the occasional episode in a general drama of pain,\\" will not find the sentiments more vividly dramatized anywhere. This is enough - perhaps even all anyone could ask for."},{"Title":"Life and Death of the Mayor of Casterbridge (New Wessex editions)","review":"When Thomas Hardy penned The Mayor of Casterbridge, he brought to life a very authentic character in Michael Henchard. He is possibly the perfect tragic character. The only other character I can think of to compare him to as I struggle to describe him and the story - for he is so much the story - is King Lear. But where Lear was a King who was foolish, Michael is the common man, a simple hay trusser, with several character flaws ... most notably shortsightedness and a desire to \\"be on top\\". He at no point feels something that most people don't but where we restrain our first rash and selfish actions (most of the time), he goes full out until he has cost himself everything and too late finds redemption. His flaw is insidious and all too common, so we relate easily even through his most outrageous misadventures.In a fit of drunken despondency, feeling that he is being pulled down by the responsibility of being a twenty-one year old husband and father, he jests that he would gladly part with his wife and daughter for the sum of five pounds. After having sworn this so vehemently for the entire evening, he has little recourse when someone takes him up on it and his wife, in shame and anger, agrees to go with the purchaser, taking their daughter with her. When sobriety brings full realization, it also brings a vow of temperance from Michael who in the following fifteen years builds himself up to a position respectability and public admiration in the nearby town of Casterbridge.Though he seems to have learned his lesson, we are only on chapter two and his story is just beginning as his wife and child return and his friendship with a trusted friend and critical advisor becomes a bitter rivalry. Time and again he demands allegiance when he need only ask it and return it in kind.Hardy's writing style is direct and straight-forward with no flourishes like you might find with Dickens or Twain. He has a story to tell and he tells it - no swashbuckling adventures like DeFoe or Dumas. However you feel about that, the character of Michael Henchard continues to skulk around in my head. He represents to me a very real possibility of personal failure and haunts my mind now just as Scrooge's deceased partner haunted him in A Christmas Carol. I would have given this book a fun factor of three stars when I first read it. Now I give it five stars because I have had the time to realize what a masterful job Hardy did when he created Michael Henchard."},{"Title":"Life and Death of the Mayor of Casterbridge (New Wessex editions)","review":"Having thoroughly detested Tess of the d'Urbervilles for its overload of melodrama and odious characters, I was hesitant to It often seems that to be considered a classic, a work must be both lengthy and tragic. Mayor is indeed a tragedy, but unlike start on another novel by Hardy. It was then a happy surprise to find that The Mayor of Casterbridge, though less famous than Tess, is an infinitely more enjoyable work.Tess, it succeeds in drawing sympathy from the reader. Thomas Hardy's irony is also much in evidence, and he comes across as quite witty. The result is a concise and interesting mixture of humor and tragedy in which characters are reasonably likable. Henchard is impetuous and comes to his end almost entirely through his own actions, but his actions are always motivated by realistic emotions and there is nothing overblown or melodramatic about his downfall. Because he is so human and flawed, it is far easier to feel sorry for him than it was for Tess, Hardy's embodiment of the perfect woman.There are, of course, elements in Hardy's style that do not change from novel to novel. His writing remains very Victorian and therefore rather ornate and longwinded. Nor is the melodrama absent from Mayor-- events often take on such an absurd turn that the reader is left momentarily with the impression of a soap opera. The plot relies heavily on coincidences, reminiscent somewhat of Dickens, and things work out so neatly and implausibly that incredulity must be firmly restrained.It is worth it, though. Beneath the superficial plot lie careful writing and hidden parallels. The elaborate Biblical Saul and David parallel with Henchard and Farfrae throughout emphasizes the unchangeability of human nature (the love/hate relationship between Henchard and Farfrae) and the cyclical rise and fall from power. Hardy also uses limited third person narration that allows the reader to know the characters and events only through their actions and conversations, further evidence of a meticulously constructed novel. In a refreshing change, Mayor moves along quickly with virtually no extraneous events.The Mayor of Casterbridge is an unusual book, and one that can be understood on multiple levels. On one, it is the simple story of the fall of a proud man; on another, it is a retold Biblical story, updated but not deprived of its original power. And though I never thought to say this about Hardy's novels, The Mayor of Casterbridge also does pretty well as entertainment...Ailanna"},{"Title":"Life and Death of the Mayor of Casterbridge (New Wessex editions)","review":"The first book I read out of Thomas Hardy's many works was \\"Far from the Madding Crowd\\" back in my secondary school days. I immediately fell in love with Hardy. Reading \\"The Mayor of Casterbridge\\" only confirmed that my liking for Hardy's works was not misplaced. The Mayor of Casterbridge is absolutely brilliant as the author uses his perceptive insights into the human nature to create very realistic characters with complex personalities. For example, Henchard is an alcoholic who suffers from many of the accompanying afflictions that include low self-esteem, shame, guilt, self-castigation, self-punishment, loneliness, a death wish, and a tendency to depression.The book starts in the first chapter with a dramatic masterpiece that perfectly sets the tone and theme for the rest of the novel. A young man named Michael Henchard and his wife Susan and baby daughter Elizabeth-Jane enter a village where Henchard hopes to find work. They go to a country fair where Henchard, an alcoholic, gets drunk and sells his wife and baby to a sailor. Once Henchard sobers up, he realizes his mistake, and searches, in vain, to retrieve his family. Abhorred at what he has done, he swears off liquor and decides to make something of his life. The story unravels nineteen years later, when his wife and daughter come back to present themselves to him. In the course of the rest of the novel, Henchard who was now the Mayor of Casterbridge falls from grace, this being a result of his own character flaws and the hand of fate.I enjoy reading Hardy's impressive prose, which is strong, sharp and descriptive. The various scenes the author describes are filled with vivid and compelling imagery that leave one wanting to read more and more. Thomas Hardy is especially adept at describing the environment which he has a deep seated love for. The ironic twists of fate provide a setting that demonstrates the brilliant writer that Hardy is where he expertly weaves a plot that shows the themes of the balance between fate and individual choice. That makes The Mayor of Casterbridge very pleasant to read despite the sad story.For those who wish to study English Literature, The Mayor of Casterbridge is on the top of the recommended list. The book provides exceptional descriptions of England and its culture as well as exposing the student to themes of profound gravity and importance. The book provides clear and concise explanations, dialogue and emotional energy. It is well-written, is easy-to-understand and to follow."},{"Title":"Life and Death of the Mayor of Casterbridge (New Wessex editions)","review":"Having never read Hardy before, I picked this book at random off a list provided by my Western Civilization teacher. I can't help but attribute my choice to destiny; this is quite possibly the best book I've ever read, written by the single greatest English author in history. While some other reviewers have classified his descriptive passages as somewhat dull, I thought they were rather intoxicating; I don't know how one could not enjoy the superbly vivid style Hardy employs. It's impossible to really describe his writing to one who hasn't read it.The plot in Mayor of Casterbridge is compelling throughout. I read somewhere that the book was originally published a few chapters at a time in a literary magazine, and this is quite evident, as every many sections seem individually complete with rising action, climax, resolution, etc. Hardy still manages to integrate these individual sections without flaw and create a wonderful composition of the life of Henchard. As everyone else has testified, the conclusion of the book is moving beyond description- without a doubt the most affective book I've ever read. Be forewarned: this is a book that will surely leave the reader in a depressed and brooding state. Going by Kafka's standard, that a book should be &quot;like a suicide... an axe for the frozen sea within us&quot;, The Mayor of Casterbridge is surely one of just a handful of the great books in English literature."},{"Title":"Life and Death of the Mayor of Casterbridge (New Wessex editions)","review":"I can understand the polarity of opinion about this book.

It has a \\"heavy\\" style, but I think it was this depth that appealed to me most - that, and the obvious devotion Hardy felt toward his beloved Wessex (strange how this passion of the author for his countryside seems to me more forcefully written than most other stories where passion is thematic). Of course I have since read all the Wessex novels but this remains my favorite, and probably my favorite novel of all.Still, not an easy recommendation."},{"Title":"Life and Death of the Mayor of Casterbridge (New Wessex editions)","review":"This is the easiest Thomas Hardy novel, but one of the most complex in terms of emotions.

In fact, a better description of this novel comes from a colleague of mine, Professor Neale Scott of the Baltimore University, who remarked &quot;I realise now I had mistaken the dullness of Henchard's character for the dullness of the whole novel.&quot;. Ultimately, Prof. Scott is quite accurate in his assessment of the text. The characters bumble around, waiting for circumstance to attach itself to their groins, and do very little of plausible importance at all. Henchard himself is, without doubt, one of the most irritating characters to be placed in 'classic' fiction, and one can't help but wish that the death of our tragic hero had happened an awful lot sooner, such as before the novel started. The character of Elizabeth-Jane, wonderfully parodied by Helli Kitchin, of the Moscow State University, is so blase towards her constantly changing parenthood that it completely ruins any sense of empathy that the audience may have for her. The least convincing Scotsman ever can also be found in this text, in the form of Donald Farfrae, and I am inclined to agree with Dr Daniel Greenfeld, whose thesis, &quot;Hardy makes the heart grow colder&quot;, points out that the author would not know a Scotsman if one jumped up and bit him, a way that most of us admittedly meet them. To sum up - I discourage my students from reading this shambolic text. Avoid this novel like the plague - it is so soggy, you couldn't even burn it to stay warm. Attempt, perhaps, to read something a little more plausible with something other that a praetorian wanderer and an intransigent hay-trusser to tantalise the imagination, something that the author was obviously lacking - Wessex indeed."},{"Title":"Life and Death of the Mayor of Casterbridge (New Wessex editions)","review":"I loved the book! It is not for the faint of heart as it takes a little more time to read....the old English. The story is classic."},{"Title":"Life and Death of the Mayor of Casterbridge (New Wessex editions)","review":"This book is similar to a Dickens novel in that it seeks not to reach perfection, but to please its audience at the time. Like Dickens, it is very dry and filled with hard to believe coincidences that make the story hard to swallow. Still, Hardy paints a very lively, realistic and flowing impression of the English countryside in the early days, before the industrial revolution. I would recommend this only if you are obsessed with Hardy, if you have run out of books to read (try Fifth Business by Robertson Davies) or if you are forced to read this as a part of some course."},{"Title":"Life and Death of the Mayor of Casterbridge (New Wessex editions)","review":"Michael Henchard (yep - - later he's the Mayor, all right), having sold his wife and baby early in the novel for 5 guineas while in a drunken rage, gets what he deserves despite his valiant efforts at atonement years later after an initial rise in fortune and a 'chance' reunion with his long-abandoned wife and daughter. Not that an example of Divine retribution is Hardy's intention; Hardy was an atheist. But he stacks the cards so heavily against Henchard that it's hard to believe he isn't a True Believer after all. Chance? Irony? Coincidence? (Synchroncity?? Gadzooks!) Divine retribution? All grist for Hardy's deterministic mill, and a grinding mill it is for Henchard. It ultimately doesn't matter - - to prove his point Hardy orchestrates the narrative so obviously and nothing can stop Henchard's downward spiral, of course. Everywhere in the novel, it's plain he's doomed. Hardy created this character whose final wish, as Hardy has him spell out in his will, is that he be forgotten. And then Hardy titles the novel after him for the ages. Did I hear someone say 'Omniscient Narrator'? Pretty divine, I'd say."},{"Title":"Life and Death of the Mayor of Casterbridge (New Wessex editions)","review":"The book is essentially a daytime soap opera. Except, none of the characters are likeable.My suggestion: read only the very last line of the book.

Although it may pick up later, it certainly is not worth it."},{"Title":"Life and Death of the Mayor of Casterbridge (New Wessex editions)","review":"I read this book for a class, and I am sorry to say that it was a disappointment. It is a silly tale, and totally unrealistic. I cannot believe that something like this could be considered a &quot;classic&quot;. Mike sure made some dumb choices, and it is unrealistic! No one could make that many blunders. It was bogged down by unnecessary details, etc. All-in-all, a 100% waste. Don't buy this book. You've been warned."},{"Title":"Life and Death of the Mayor of Casterbridge (New Wessex editions)","review":"Thomas Hardy, while certainly an extremely talented author, seemingly had the knack of producing Victorian-era soap operas which never fails to depress even the most cheerful soul. Sometimes his depressing stories has a message that produces a somewhat cathartic reading experience (as with Tess of the D'Urbervilles), but with The Mayor of Casterbridge all we get is utter negativity. This mayor is one twisted, selfish and self-loathing individual. He seems to live with a rain cloud over his head, and doesn't quite understand how it is to be loved. Fun guy? Nope. And there isn't even a happy ending.Bottom line: nice characterizations and fine prose amount to lipstick on a sow. Not recommended."},{"Title":"Life and Death of the Mayor of Casterbridge (New Wessex editions)","review":"I skimmed some of the longer descriptions of scenery/village life. There was still plenty to stir my imagination. This study of human character - especially that of Henchard - was very interesting. Really enjoyed the book!"},{"Title":"Life and Death of the Mayor of Casterbridge (New Wessex editions)","review":"Thomas Hardy was never one to refrain from controversey in his writing, as is evidenced by his decision after the negative reviews that \\"Jude the Obscure\\" received to never write novels again but to devote himself entirely to poetry. \\"The Mayor of Casterbridge\\" opens with perhaps one of the most unique plot devices in Edwardian/Victorian literature, when Michael Henchard, a young haytrusser becomes drunk at a country fair and sells his wife and daughter to whoever will pay five guineas for them. What follows afterwards, for Michael Henchard, is a life tinged by regret, even as he finds himself prospering in all other manners. \\"The Mayor of Casterbridge\\" is a compelling story of how falsehoods and regrets can overshadow one's life if they are allowed to do so.After selling his wife and daughter, Michael Henchard vows that he will not touch alcohol for twenty-one years and manages to build himself up to the position of a prosperous businessman and mayor in the town of Casterbridge. As he nears the twenty-first year of his oath, his wife Susan returns, finding him in his exalted position, and Henchard knows the only right thing to do is \\"remarry\\" her since they have been legally married all these years, and therefore make it possible for him to claim Elizabeth-Jane as his true daughter, not just step-daughter. Yet life has many secrets for Michael Henchard - some he keeps, like the fact he is engaged to another woman, and one shocking one that his wife keeps from him that will desperately impact his dealings with Elizabeth-Jane. While Henchard has prospered up to this point, a falling-out with his foreman, the Scotsman Donald Farfrae, leads to his eventual downfall in both his private and his public life. As evidenced by the selling of his wife, Henchard allows his quick temper to get the better of him, and he sets his mind on revenge to all those who have wronged him, whether acutal or not. Therefore, he constantly finds himself at odds with Elizabeth-Jane, with Donald Farfrae (whom he would like nothing better than to kill), and with another woman from his past who has upset his life.Michael Henchard is truly a tragic character, for while it may be easy to dislike him for his roughness and his callow actions, he is not entirely an evil man. His fault is that he regrets his actions, just usually too late. \\"The Mayor of Casterbridge\\" is a surprisingly fast-paced read, with a vivid setting and an extremely intriguing character in Elizabeth-Jane. The web that Michael Henchard manages to spin for himself is compelling and familiar, as these characters and their motives transcend beyond the time period captured so effortlessly by Hardy."},{"Title":"Life and Death of the Mayor of Casterbridge (New Wessex editions)","review":"...but without the histrionics.One of the greatest novels ever written. Also one of the most suspenseful and (for those whose palates have not been ruined by trash) one of the most enjoyable."},{"Title":"Life and Death of the Mayor of Casterbridge (New Wessex editions)","review":"Reread this one recently - what a great book. This is my favorite of all Hardy's books. The fascinating part of this novel is the protagonist, because he is such a mix of good and bad. He has good and even heroic impulses and acts, and bad and even evil impulses and acts. The way he manages to sabotage the good things he could get reminds me of Lily in the House of Mirth, although Henchard's sabotage is due to through bad temper and anger and insecurity, while Lily's are due to ambivalence. But the trip downward is quite similar. Basically it ends up being the story of a man's self-destruction. What a crime that Hardy's novels were unpopular when he first wrote them, and the bad reviews discouraged him from writing more! I have them all but wish there were more."},{"Title":"Life and Death of the Mayor of Casterbridge (New Wessex editions)","review":"The Mayor of Casterbridge is undoubtedly one of the finest novels of the Victorian Era - quite a tribute given that the period produced a countless number of classics. The conflict between Michael Henchard and Donald Farfrae reflects a clash between tradition and modernity. This dichotomy is perhaps best encapsulated in their contrasting styles of record keeping; Henchard relies entirely on intuition and memory while Farfrae maintains extraordinarily meticulous accounts of all his transactions. Furthermore the struggle between Farfrae and Henchard reflects a conflict of vastly different temperaments. Henchard proves to be of a passionate temperament while Farfrae is rational and levelheaded. For instance, despite his modest means and limited experience, Farfrae boldly ventures into agricultural trading and through a series of shrewd bets manages to unseat Henchard as Casterbridge's preeminent merchant. In order to regain his erstwhile position, Henchard engages in rash and seemingly desperate speculation - in contrast to the prudent risk taking of Farfrae - that ultimately culminates in his ruin.While some AP students have chastised Henchard for his inability to overcome his animalistic nature, the more astute reader realizes that his inveterate character serves to illustrate a basic theme of most Hardy novels - the philosophy of determinism. The rise and fall of Henchard illustrates the unpleasant reality that one's life is subject to forces beyond one's control - in Henchard's case a deeply flawed character - and these forces often overwhelm the power of one's determination and ambition. This doctrine is certainly anathema to 21st century Americans who firmly believe in the concept of free will and a future holding great promise. While constantly lamenting one's ill fate is self-defeating, it would be naive to entirely disregard the power of destiny to shape one's life for worse as powerfully shown in the tragic tale of the Mayor of Casterbridge."},{"Title":"Life and Death of the Mayor of Casterbridge (New Wessex editions)","review":"The mayor of casterbridge is a descriptive, sad, but fun to read novel that keeps the reader glued to the seat. In this novel, Tomas Hardy's skill for describing the enviroment is clear, and his characters are vibrant and true to life. I recommend this novel to anyone who is in search of a great read."},{"Title":"Life and Death of the Mayor of Casterbridge (New Wessex editions)","review":"This is truly a classic tragedy, and perhaps Hardy's very best. The opening is one of the most memorable I've ever read; Michael Henchard gets drunk and auctions off his family. The tale spins off from there, boldly and without restraint. Though Hardy is a pessimist, he knows how to craft a story of unforgettable characters inspired by all sorts of passions- some taking whatever they can find for themselves, and some giving generously and unconditionally. Wait until you meet and get to know Elizabeth; she is a beautiful human being! I always learn so much from Hardy. I'm grateful that he wrote the novels he did before turning exclusively to poetry. This one in particular is so well done that I don't know how anyone can fail to be impacted and changed by it."},{"Title":"Life and Death of the Mayor of Casterbridge (New Wessex editions)","review":"A question about the source of human tragedy lies at the heart of The Mayor of Casterbridge. Characters frequently mention fate and providence as causes for tragedy (and joy), but Hardy offers more subtle and complex explanations for individual tragedy. At times, Hardy seems to indicate that circumstance and timing play a more important role than Providence in shaping the course of human destiny. Can people survive without the aid of luck or providence by pure force of will? Henchard (the Mayor) is a man whose loneliness, egoism, and pride cause him to make bad decisions. His faulty judgement certainly do not help him in his quest for fulfillment, either. Hardy's depiction of an ultimately unknowable universe is achieved partly through his characters' false assignment of meaning to meaningless incidents. Fate, human will, and faulty perceptions are central issues in much of Hardy's writing. Though not as moving and intense as Hardy's masterpiece Tess of the d'Urbervilles, The Mayor is not to be missed. Hardy's complex rendering of Henchard's multi-faceted personality is remarkable. In addition, The Norton Critical Addition provides excellent commentary and background information from noteworthy critics."},{"Title":"Life and Death of the Mayor of Casterbridge (New Wessex editions)","review":"In the novels of Thomas Hardy, tragedy can be an externalized force like Egdon Heath in THE RETURN OF THE NATIVE or it can be of the internalized sort, the kind that Michael Henchard brings on himself in THE MAYOR OF CASTERBRIDGE. In either case, nature is unforgiving, a quality which is a given in any of Hardy's works. When tragedy is of the latter kind, then the protagonist is not unlike the doomed tragic hero from classical Greek drama wherein he is first seen as a great or simply a good man who suffers from a tragic flaw, the results of which drag him down so that by the end of the action, his state is so miserably pathetic that the reader/audience can do no more than shake their heads in sorrow at his downfall, that in another and less proud man need not have happened at all.Michael Henchard is the post-Victorian man of mixed qualities who like Oedipus, commits a sin and then spends the rest of the book trying to make amends. His sin is maudlin self-pity. He allows his current debased financial position to lead him to drink, all the while blaming his wife and child. At an auction, he offers his family for the sale to the highest bidder. He ignores the warnings from those present that he is courting disaster. An unknown man offers the highest bid and off he goes, taking Henchard's wife and child with him. Hardy takes pains to place Henchard squarely in the middle of this somber farce. Hardy gives no name to the successful bidder nor does he allow the reader to note the wife's actions. She, surprisingly, remains silent, but weeping. Henchard, by contrast, is loud, crude, and obnoxious. He occupies central stage until the next chapter when he sobers up, is filled with remorse, and then tries to set things right. He fails and winds up the leading citizen of Casterbridge. The image of the drunken Henchard and the mayor Henchard are startlingly unlike. The latter is sober, industrious, and respectable, causing the reader to commiserate with him. But the tragedy of Henchard does not lie merely in a series of vain regrets. Just as he seems to undergo permanent rehabilitation of self, his ex-wife shows up again, with a new child from the now dead bidder. Hardy complicates the plot with his usual unwieldy complications. As a result, Henchard plunges again into the depths of despair; this time he shows that his old sins of false pride and egotism have returned with a vengeance. He tries to bankrupt his business partner Farfrae, for reasons purely of jealousy. It becomes progressively more difficult for the reader to maintain the same sympathy that they had earlier. Later, at the novel's close, Henchard is made to wander like a wounded Lear, and this alone partially elevates him back to his previous stature of a tragic figure. He, like Lear, dies repentant. From his death, the audience discovers that the essence of a tragic fall lies not so much in how much sympathy that protagonist garners during that fall but rather in how true to life his fall was. Michael Henchard was neither saint nor reprobate sinner. He was the Victorian Everyman with a mixture of goodness and mean-spiritedness, either of which could emerge under the right circumstances. At his fall, the reader saw that the \\"right\\" circumstances were sufficiently ordinary so that anyone of us might have done the same. This is the essence of the tragedy of THE MAYOR OF CASTERBRIDGE."},{"Title":"Life and Death of the Mayor of Casterbridge (New Wessex editions)","review":"Read this novel after Far From The Madding Crowd and Return of the Native. It's a very bleak and depressing novel - without the comic flourishes and moments of his earlier work.The story follows Michael Henchard, a hay-trusser, who sells his wife and child for five guineas in an 'auction' during a fit of inebriety. He spends the next 21 years regretting his action, but during that time he does well for himself, becoming mayor of Casterbridge, a rural town. Years later, his wife and daughter reappear. This starts a chain of events that leads to Henchard's fall. He eventually ends up losing everything because of his pride, passion and stubborness.

This instance of reckless cruelty would come to haunt him in his later years. Overall a pious and good man, his downfall was his reluctance to face his past. His will dictated his epitaph.

There were numbers of similarities between this book and Dickens' \\"Little Dorrit\\", except Hardy appeared to see how many mistaken innuendos, statements never made that could have cleared up false impressions, and misguided moralistic pressures could be fit into one story.

Once you get used to the period of time and the style of writing ~ in old english, of sorts ~ one needs to continue this type. You get so much more out of a book that way.While this book may have been written in the 1800's I must say that the events taking place, the people and their responses doesn't seem to have changed one iota to the way society behaves today. This is a charming story of rags to riches to rags again. A story of humility, starting over, of pride, of desolation and back to humility again. It does have a bit of subtle romance, which keeps the story flowing.Both of the Thomas Hardy's books (Tess of the de'Ubervilles) and this one are wonderful stories and well worth reading.Interestingly it wasn't after I finished reading them that I discovered that these books were considered Young Adult reading. I guess someone rated it this way because it's a pure, non-smuttly book so ubiquitious of today's media.I don't care about the rating I just appreciated Thomas Hardy's contribution of literature."},{"Title":"Life and Death of the Mayor of Casterbridge (New Wessex editions)","review":"Opinions on this novel seem to be a bit polarized to say the least. The plot is a tad too complex and soap-opera-ish for its own good, but the twists and turns are interesting enough to keep people interested, and it really isn't a tough read.

He seeks to put it behind him and become a pillar of his community. But the consequences of his deed come back to haunt him and one by one he is stripped of all that he holds sacred and dear.The prose is so vivid and the tragedy of the ending so great that it is like being pierced with hot and cold daggers again and again as one reads the last fifty pages or so.Vivid characterization, realistic deeds, thought, and dialogue, and graphically depicted settings all combine to make this one of the finest novels in the English language.Even if you are not a Hardy fan, this novel is a must-read!

This trivialises it, for it is, to my mind, truly tragic. In a shockingly irresponsible drunken act, protagonist Michael Henchard sells his wife at a local fair. The consequences, stretching over a couple of decades, sweep away both him and other characters.The plot teems with journeys, coincidences, long-lost people showing up, and a strong vein of morality. In typical Hardyesque style, Henchard moves from the height of civic success to bankruptcy and alienation. A quasi-Greek-tragedy air of fate prevails, but Hardy manages to keep suspense alive. Protagonist and antagonist (Farfrae) are pitted against each other on civic and domestic fronts. There is not one Mayor of Casterbridge, but two, and success, failure and rivalry play a large part. There is also competition among the males as lovers, husbands and fathers.This novel gives an insight into civic life, the worthy burgesses of Casterbridge networking in their council-rooms and taverns. But the animal instincts of the wife-sale, the gutter-press viciousness of the locals' \\"skimmity-ride\\", and the proximity of the countryside, where so many Victorian characters wander to survive and to lay bare their feelings, reveal the fragility of civilisation and our urban constructs.Great stuff."},{"Title":"Life and Death of the Mayor of Casterbridge (New Wessex editions)","review":"I read this novel in English class, like most people probably did. It was one of the best assigned to us.Hardy is a gifted author. He writes in a clear style with vivid descriptions that really bring the setting alive, without making the reader (at least this reader) feel inundated with borning, unnecessary detail.The thing that I look for most in a novel, however, is quality characterizeations, and this book had them in spades. Dialogue was used effectively to flesh out characters. These are not stock characters, either. These people have flaws and shades of grey. They seem as though they could be real. I found that I could relate to the characters, and I did empathize with them, even when I didn't agree with their choices. Everyone had clear motivations. The characterization of Henchard shows that Hardy clearly understood the notion of the tragic flaw and the tragic hero/anti hero.Students who have to read this book as part of their English class may find it a bit on the long side. I would urge you to stick with it; once you get through the initial chapters the book will pick up (a commonality that all British classics seem to share). The book is easy to follow and understand. It is a key novel that marks the shift from Romantic Age to the Victorian Age, so it's an important read for anyone who has a serious interest in English Literature."},{"Title":"Life and Death of the Mayor of Casterbridge (New Wessex editions)","review":"The Mayor of Casterbridge is not Thomas Hardy's most famous or acclaimed novel, but in the opinion of this die-hard fan it is his best. The later Tess of the D'Urbervilles and Jude the Obscure are generally considered his masterpieces, but while this lacks their epic grandeur and sociopolitical relevance, it is more immediately arresting, has a more conventionally interesting plot, and features one of literature's best tragic heroes. I give it the highest possible recommendation not only for fans but for anyone even remotely alive to literary greatness.Hardy in his day was nearly unique in mixing high literary elements with what would later be called pulp factors. Hard as it is to imagine, he was like William Faulkner and Stephen King in one - a true artist with mass appeal, both critically acclaimed and bestselling. However, his early nineteenth century rural English settings, heavy dialect use, eccentric vocabulary, and other characteristics make many current readers think his books slow going. The Mayor is the obvious exception, beginning almost immediately with one of the most arresting and unforgettable scenes in all literature - nothing less than a drunken man selling his wife and child to a stranger out of anger and disgust. As often with Hardy, it is based on a real incident, but he dramatizes so vividly that we cannot help being enthralled. The drama indeed reaches such a fever pitch in these first few pages that even those normally averse to classic literature can hardly help being pulled in.Such a beginning sets a very high standard, and it is a testament to the book's greatness that it never disappoints - and, indeed, hardly lets up. The popular aspects of Hardy's fiction made him more influential on later writers, especially mainstream ones, than nearly any other classic author; it is almost impossible to exaggerate his impact, which is such that even many who have never read him have been greatly influenced without knowing it. These strengths are present even in his earliest fiction, but The Mayor is the preeminent example. Supremely engrossing and intriguing, it is full of plot twists that will keep even the savviest readers guessing and ends in one of the most spectacularly memorable conclusions ever. One could not expect more from even the most entertaining pulp novel - and The Mayor of course has a wealth of great artistry to boot. To be sure, this Hardy aspect has always had critics bemoaning apparent overreliance on complex plots and melodramatic coincidence, the implication being that Hardy was unable to make a story without them. However, anyone even remotely familiar with him knows that he was intensely interested in coincidence, chance, and fate, using them deliberately to dramatize what dominated his thought. Those aware of this can see how well his writings work out the implications of his bleak impressions: that humans are near-laughably insignificant on the cosmic scale, that no force sympathetic to humans or generally benevolent controls the universe, and that human life is essentially miserable with little chance of success at love or other happiness. More specifically, his work illustrates what he called the Imminent Will - an unconscious force controlling human action. What seems luck or chance may thus be very much otherwise, though we can do nothing about it. Many have said that he has an almost malevolent attitude toward his characters, plotting so that things work out in the worst possible way and cause them the greatest possible suffering, but this is simply Hardy's view of the human condition. The Mayor's complicated plot is an essential example - perhaps the preeminent. Hardy was later somewhat unsatisfied, thinking that it suffered more from serialization's effects than any of his other novels. He worried that he included too many improbabilities and twists in an effort to include an exciting event in every installment but noted with satisfaction that the events arise naturally from the story, and so they do. Those who do not like this feature elsewhere will be unconvinced - or even have their view cemented -, but those for whom Hardy's tragic vision speaks powerfully will be in awe of the masterful execution.There are several keys to its success. Hardy reiterated over and over again that probability of character, not of action, is what matters, and this proves it. The book works mainly because its characters are so believable and often identifiable; we care about them in spite of - or arguably even because of, such is Hardy's skill - the highly-wrought events. It has one of Hardy's largest casts, and the four main characters are some of his most fully realized and memorable. Three are unsurprisingly doomed to near-constant suffering: the admirably strong-willed and hard-working but fatally impulsive Michael Henchard; Elizabeth-Jane, who has great empathy and love potential but is so passive that others constantly step on her with impunity; and the dignified but overly passionate Lucetta. The fourth, Donald Farfrae, is one of Hardy's most original and interesting. He was not one to champion a creation, but Farfrae is probably his most thoroughly positive and genuinely likable. Other characters are drawn to him almost irresistibly, and so are we; intelligent, industrious, and positively infectious, he is drawn with a good humor almost never seen in Hardy and gives much of the book's appeal. He is also notable as a sympathetic and nuanced Scotch character from an English writer.But this is of course mainly Henchard's story, and what a story! Hardy based his tragic fiction on ancient Greek models, but Henchard is his only true example of the tragic hero central to those works - a character who is in many ways admirable but imbued with a flaw that proves his downfall. \\"Impulsiveness\\" perhaps sums up his and is manifested in various ways; many know such a person, but the far more important thing is that we can see ourselves in him. He is in some ways an Everyman despite obvious flaws and has several admirable qualities, not least how he raised himself from extreme poverty to relative wealth and prominence by sheer force of will. However, his fall is even greater than his rise - in fact, one of the greatest and most affecting ever imagined. It is a true testament to Hardy's artistry that he makes us care for Henchard despite him being in many ways despicable; for him to win our hearts after the opening scene seems not only impossible but perverse to even conceive, yet Hardy pulls it off. There is much to dislike, but he is fully and thus frailly and tragically human. Whether or not we think him redeemed, he is more sinned against than sinning, as even those he has wronged eventually see. Yet he also undeniably caused his own demise; what seems like bad luck or wretched fate is really his bad decisions' delayed consequences. His end is one of the most highly tragic and sympathetic ever written; he dies miserably alone and fully broken, denied even the last ray of light that a guilty conscience and sincere repentance could have potentially given. The scene with his final note - complete with misspellings belying the lack of education and humble background that made his rise more remarkable but that he was in many ways unable to overcome - is one of the most moving I have ever read. It is the culmination of what is a highly emotional work throughout; Hardy runs us through a gamut of feelings as only he can. The pathos is at times almost unbearable, and few readers will not cry at least once. Indeed, aside from Les Mis&eacute;rables, which I believe is unquestionably the greatest creation of all-time, no other book out of the hundreds or thousands I have read has moved me so often or deeply. Other than Victor Hugo, Hardy has no equal at conveying emotion, and this is his supreme example. Later works, particularly Tess, show the tragedy of the human condition on a grander scale, but only Oedipus Rex itself even rivals this as a supremely moving depiction of individual tragedy. Indeed, I can say without hyperbole that nothing else I have ever experienced - artistic or otherwise - has driven home life's profound tragedy with such conviction or force.This alone is of course more than enough reason to read the book, but the work is also notable for other reasons. Chief among these is another perennial Hardy strength - great sense of place. Perhaps no one equals him in making place so vivid that it is essential to the story; setting is never mere background with him. He is of course best-known in this regard for Wessex - the part-real, part-dream country based on his native Southwest England that he made world famous. Setting is not as important here as in some other works, but the Casterbridge focus is particularly noteworthy. Based on the real-life Dorchester, Casterbridge is Wessex's largest town; nearly all Wessex stories and a considerable number of the poems mention it, and many take place there in part. However, this is unique in being almost entirely set there, giving both a fascinating glimpse into Southwest England's early nineteenth-century hub and filling in much of the background to other works. This is invaluable to fans and of considerable interest to historians and others.Relatedly, Hardy's work is well-known for showing modernity's ache, i.e., how technology and other advances were rapidly and drastically changing a society that had been essentially the same for a thousand years. The Mayor in particular portrays its effect on agriculture and other business aspects, depicting all with realism and human interest. Some current readers may think this makes the book drag somewhat, but it will be a big attraction for others, especially those keen on the background to the book and its importance to Hardy's life and thought.I simply cannot praise the novel highly enough; it is one of the all-time greatest artistic achievements, a supreme creation of artistry and, more fundamentally, the human heart. Suffice it to say that anyone sensitive to the unforgettable final two paragraphs, which sum up Hardy's grim but eminently practical view of existence in his fine inimitable style and conclude by calling happiness \\"the occasional episode in a general drama of pain,\\" will not find the sentiments more vividly dramatized anywhere. This is enough - perhaps even all anyone could ask for.As for this edition, it is essentially bare bones, lacking even Hardy's Preface, though it has a bibliography. The dedicated will want something more extensive, but the work more than stands on its own."},{"Title":"Life and Death of the Mayor of Casterbridge (New Wessex editions)","review":"Michael Henchard, a down-on-his-luck, unemployed hay trusser, succumbs to the siren call of alcohol at a country fair. Subconsciously feeling his wife, Susan, is holding him back from success in this world, he awakes to sobriety the next morning and realizes that, in a foolish fit of pique, he has auctioned her and his daughter, Elizabeth-Jane, off to a sailor. Despite his frantic efforts to find them, they have disappeared. Ravaged with guilt over his selfish, impulsive act, he swears he will not take another drink for twenty-one years.Whether his wife was indeed one of Henchard's problems is left for the reader to ponder as Henchard moves to Casterbridge, prospers wildly in business and eventually becomes the town's leading citizen and mayor. Henchard's wheel of fortune, however, begins to spin on a wobbly axle as Donald Farfrae, an enterprising young Scot travelling to seek his fortune, enters his employ as the manager of his business. At the same time, Susan and Elizabeth-Jane, re-enter Henchard's life believing that Michael Newson, the sailor who had purchased them some nineteen years earlier, has perished at sea. Henchard's life truly begins to come apart when Lucetta Templeman, a former lover, also moves to Casterbridge and, ashamed of her past romantic entanglement with Henchard, seeks to hold him to his promise of marriage!Hardy raises many issues but, not expressing his own opinion through an unequivocal direction in the story's plot line, seems content to leave these issues as topics for sober analysis by his readers. Hardy questions the conflict between the merits of tradition vs modernization. There is the enormous irony that Henchard's success as a business person seems clearly attributable in part to his tee-totalling vow but is founded upon the five guineas seed capital raised through the auction of his wife and daughter! Henchard seems to epitomize the constant personal conflicts we all face between decisiveness and strength of character as opposed to impulsiveness and stubborn bullheaded intransigence! One wonders whether Lucetta is flighty, coquettish, thoughtless and selfish or is she an early manifestation of modern woman sadly out of time and years ahead of the ladies around her? Is Farfrae to be admired or scorned for his meteoric rise to power in Casterbridge and his complete devastation of Henchard's place among his peers?Perhaps the most powerful moment of the entire novel comes with the discovery of Henchard's will and his words directing that the world leave him to rest in forgotten isolation and that no person mark or mourn his passing in any fashion. Once again, we are left to decide for ourselves whether Henchard's life should be pitied, forgiven, admired or looked upon with scorn and disgust.To the readers of the day, \\"The Mayor of Casterbridge\\" would have been perceived as a darkly pessimistic tragedy that might have evoked emotions akin to those raised by Shakespeare's \\"Hamlet\\" or Sophocles' \\"Oedipus Rex\\". A classic worthy of the term, \\"The Mayor of Casterbridge\\", certainly never cheerful or uplifting, is however many, many things - compelling, moving, disturbing, thought-provoking and poignant. Above all, it is worthy of being read and enjoyed by any lover of classic 19th century British Literature.Paul Weiss"},{"Title":"Life and Death of the Mayor of Casterbridge (New Wessex editions)","review":"This book has everything fans of the 19th century novel, such as myself, love-melodrama, romance, secrets, plot twists, mistaken identities, rising fortunes, and, of course, a tragic ending. I can't give much away because the novel rests on a series of shocking revelations-each more shocking than the last!However, since the book begins with the most startling event of all, and since it is given away on the back of the book, and happens at the very beginning, I will only deal with that event, which is what drew me to the book in the first place. This will set the stage and make you want to read the book as much as I did when my friend told me about it!The main character is a certain Henchard who SELLS HIS WIFE AND INFANT DAUGHTER. That's right, he sells them! To a sailor! Granted, he is drunk. It's an intriguing study of alcoholism, although some men wouldn't have to be one to want to sell their wives for some beer if they could get away with it. Henchard's wife is understandably furious, and leaves with the sailor. After this, Henchard vows to never again drink-although the introduction to my edition suggests that he remains a \\"dry drunk\\". I don't exactly know what that that entails, but the introduction assured me that it was one of the first books on alcoholism which is important enough.Henchard then redeems himself and in Jean Valjean fashion would like to both atone for, and hide, his shameful past. He tries to find his wife and daughter, and that's where all the fascinating plot twists come in. It's very well-written and kept my attention throughout. I have also read \\"Tess\\" by Hardy and I like his writing style. I cannot say that his works moved me in any profound way as other literature has, but I'm not sure why that's important. There's a lot of humor and farce in this book which is first-rate, and I just enjoyed his protagonist-it's not easy to create one so believable and yet so interesting at the same time.Yes, there's a lot of melodrama, but who is to say that an individual like Henchard, with his addictions and his furious personality, wouldn't realistically live a melodramatic life? I'm sure all those who panned this book may have known someone who found a way to surround themselves with drama even in this day and age. All the book's drama is caused by Henchard and his mercurial personality-if at any time he'd played things differently he could have had a better life. But no, he had to be a lunatic."},{"Title":"Life and Death of the Mayor of Casterbridge (New Wessex editions)","review":"One of my favorites works of English literature. The opening \\"wife selling\\" chapter is one of the best in all literate, setting the major tone and themes for the entire book. The ironic twits of fate provide a wild, entertaining ride that shows off Hardy's themes of the balance between fate and individual choice in a non-didactic way. The Mayor must be ranked as a tragic character in line with Shakespeare's best work. A work that makes profound psychological and philosophical statement while remaining engrossing on every level."},{"Title":"Life and Death of the Mayor of Casterbridge (New Wessex editions)","review":"I began reading The Mayor of Casterbridge as an ISP (Independant Study Project) novel, as it was reccommended to me by my English teacher. At first, I found the book to be unbearably boring, but beautifully written. The language is something to be admired. But I soon became absorbed in the story, and I have to say it was one of the most compelling ones I've ever read. I might just say it's the best book I ever have read. And it's sad. I'm a 16 year old guy, and I cried at the end. I don't want to sound prissy, but it's true. And you will cry too, I'm sure. If there is one thing I can say to you, it's this: read The Mayor of Casterbridge. It would be a great injustice to one of the most profound stories of our time."},{"Title":"Life and Death of the Mayor of Casterbridge (New Wessex editions)","review":"For being written in 1886, this book felt surprisingly modern and completely engrossing. The twists and turns of Henchard's life enthralled me and though many of his actions proved him reprehensible, he was still somehow likable... Farfrae also was an interesting character, though Elizabeth-Jane truly stole the show. All in all, I was surprised at just how much I enjoyed reading this and I will certainly keep an eye out for his other works. Hardy is one of those classic authors that genuinely isn't a chore to read!"},{"Title":"Life and Death of the Mayor of Casterbridge (New Wessex editions)","review":"Thomas Hardy's \\"The Mayor of Casterbridge\\" es a truly remarkable novel. Interesting throughout, it is the story of the rise and fall of a man named Mechael Henchard. Ay the beginning of the novel, Henchard is a volatile, twenty-one-year-old hay-trusser. He becomes drunk at a fair and sells his wife and daughter to a sailor in an auction, which originally began as a joke, turns serious.Upon realizing that he has sold his family, Henchard searches for them to no avail, and takes an oath to give up alcohol for twenty-one years. After the supposed death of the sailor, Michael's wife, Susan Henchard, and her daughter began a search for Michael Henchard, who has become the mayor of Casterbridge.The novel proceeds as many soap-opera-like events unfold. The unique plot-twists made reading the novel a very entertaining experience. An unfavorable trait Henchard possesses is not letting go of past mistakes. Although he tries to atone for the past indiscretions, fate always seems to catch up to him. These factors and others contribute to the downfall of Michael Henchard."},{"Title":"Life and Death of the Mayor of Casterbridge (New Wessex editions)","review":"Thomas Hardy has a reputation for writing bleak, sad stories. The Mayor happens to be my first Hardy read, and I can't tell you how saddening I found the overall tale.Many points are made by Hardy: dealing with the past and its haunting effects; pride before the fall; and even the folly of mental inflexibility.I couldn't shake the parallel of the King Saul/David story from the Bible while reading this. You have the powerful man who takes in an apprentice then becomes overcome with jealousy and envy as his apprentice eventually outshines him. And rather than putting his usurped life in perspective, allows his anger and envy to make matters much worse.I saw Michael as a flawed man who is redeemed by his sense of duty and obligation.I think the theme of duty to world versus self is important here. Michael's duty to his first family overrides his desire to be with his new girlfriend Lucetta. He probably would have been happier with Lucetta; but wouldn't we as the audience have seen him as selfish if he had chosen her instead of Susan? Both women were manipulative, one aggressively, one passively, so it probably didn't matter. But it does raise the question of how much of our personal happiness should be sacrificed for societal duties.Donald Farfrae, the Scottish apprentice is put here purely to provide Michael Henchard with a foil. I don't feel he is developed at all, and is kind of dull, as is Elizabeth Jane.There are character driven stories and plot-driven stories. And in plot-driven stories, you know that the characters' personalities or decision-making won't really matter in how things end. That's an aspect of Mayor...that some may find the most frustrating. You never could shake the feeling that destiny was unalterable. I, however, had no problem with it. It was a good ride."},{"Title":"Life and Death of the Mayor of Casterbridge (New Wessex editions)","review":"THis book was intresting becaues of its plot, and the vivid charters.

Now I've grown up a bit I recognize the superb perception he had. This one is no exception."},{"Title":"Life and Death of the Mayor of Casterbridge (New Wessex editions)","review":"Thomas Hardy's The Mayor of Casterbridge is a story about Michael Henchard attempts at redemption and the many sorrows, pain, and misery that comes with his decision to uphold his pride and name. To say that Henchard is the only character that suffers in this novel would be a misrepresentation; almost every character at some point suffers immensely in some trial of life, whether it is death of someone close, pain of separation, or the frustration of a relationship. For these reasons, this work is not a \\"light\\" read by any stretch of the imagination, and will probably test even the optimist's patience in getting through. Still, Hardy's story, the descriptions of the countryside and the characters' inner feelings, as well as the way he ties together every character in this book, is a remarkable feat and makes for a powerful read.The story begins with Michael Henchard walking with his wife, Susan, to the fair as they cross the countryside. While there, in an act of drunkenness, Henchard sells his wife to a sailor, and seemingly sets in motion his irreversible bad fortune. Not being able to find his wife the next day, he makes an oath to not drink alcohol for 21 years, the exact amount of years he has lived. The novel then fast forwards 19 years to find Henchard the Mayor of Casterbridge, and a noteworthy man of respect. Susan finds him, marries him after forgiving him, but there are many secrets that both parties have and will have until the end of the novel. It seems that many of these secrets are the character's downfalls. Henchard, while Mayor of Casterbridge, meets a man named Donald Farfrae, who he comes to like and implores to stay in town; however, eventually he and Farfrae become bitter rivals in not only their business and society, but also in their relationship with Lucetta, a woman who had an affair with Henchard in the past.Henchard's fallacy of character lay in his stubborn pride and his foolish belief that name and appearance is everything. He sometimes tries to create a faade, or cover up one sin with another secret or problem. When he tries to persuade Lucetta to marry him, so as to not destroy her name, he retorts: \\"But it is not by what is, in this life, but by what appears, that you are judged.\\" He is a tragic individual who seems to not be able to change his views long enough to make something right occur; when something does go well, it is short lived. He even gets to a point where he connects himself with an ominous and unpreventable fate, at one point referring to himself as Cain. He never really heeds Elizabeth's attempts at love until very late in the novel when tragic occurrences seem to be set in motion.Still, despite all his problems, and all his pride, he is a \\"likeable\\" character because he makes the effort at retribution and is sorrowful each time he gets hit with a dilemma or makes an unfavorable decision. He has the willingness and conscience to try to amend his deficiencies, but, in the end, he just makes too many mistakes, and has too much pride to reverse his fortunes."},{"Title":"Life and Death of the Mayor of Casterbridge (New Wessex editions)","review":"&quot;The Mayor of Casterbridge&quot; feels like something Charles Dickens would have written if he had been a more efficient storyteller, more economical in his prose, and had a better understanding of how humor is supposed to be applied to tragedy, if at all -- with subtlety and congruity. This is not intended to be a slight against Dickens, but rather a testament to the quality of Thomas Hardy's writing.The first chapter alone is a dramatic masterpiece and perfectly sets the rhythm for the rest of the novel. A young man named Michael Henchard and his wife Susan and baby daughter Elizabeth-Jane enter a village where Henchard hopes to find work as a hay-trusser. They go to a country fair where Henchard immediately gets drunk and sells his wife and baby to a sailor. Regretting his actions the next day, Henchard looks for them in vain, swears off liquor for twenty-one years, then takes up residence in a town called Casterbridge.Nineteen years later, Susan, now widowed, and Elizabeth-Jane track Henchard to Casterbridge. It turns out that in the intervening years, Henchard has become a successful granary owner and is now the town's mayor. He welcomes his former wife and daughter, proving himself to be genial but often petty and easily vexed. For one thing, he is in a bitter rivalry with a former employee, a young Scotchman named Donald Farfrae, not only in business but also for the affections of a vixenish woman named Lucetta who has recently moved to town.Hardy wastes no pages unfolding the plot, which is filled with Dickensian intrigue. It chronicles Henchard's relationship with Susan and Elizabeth-Jane after their return, his jealousy over Farfrae and Lucetta (who happens to be Henchard's old flame and inadvertently incites a public scandal because of this), his fear of the discovery of his deceit, and, finally, his feelings of isolation from Elizabeth-Jane and the town he loves. By the end, you realize that Henchard is not a bad man; he's a lonely man who's made the mistake of letting his love for Elizabeth-Jane distort his judgment.Especially impressive is Hardy's prose, which is strong and descriptive without being florid. He has a sharp ear for native dialects, and the dialogue of Casterbridge's inhabitants comes off as genuinely homey chatter rather than just dispensations of information set up to advance the plot. Moreover, like any good fictional place, Casterbridge takes on a vibrant life of its own, offering a realistic bucolic backdrop for this stormy human drama."},{"Title":"Life and Death of the Mayor of Casterbridge (New Wessex editions)","review":"An early fall afternoon in the 1840s bucolic world of Wessex.

Sue Henchard is the wife sold by Henchard to a sailor. She emigrates with him to America. When she returns 20 years later to Casterbridge she remarries Henchard but dies soon after the wedding. She is a simple-minded country woman lacking in knowledge and sophistication.3. Donald Farfrae-While Henchard represents ancient Wessex in folkways and beliefs, Mr. Farfrae is a young Scotchman who soon steals Henchard's supremacy in Casterbridge. He is hired by Henchard to straighten out the latter's business affairs but leaves him to start a successful rival business firm. Farfrae is the second Mayor of Casterbridge in this novel. He marries Henchard's mistress Lucetta. When Lucetta dies after being the center of a scandal caused by old loves letters to Henchard being revealed, Farfrae weds Henchard's stepdaughter Elizabeth Jane. He is a kind man who seeks to help Henchard to no avail.4. Eliaabeth-Jane-She is an intelligent person who returns from abroad with her mother Sue. She has been raised to believe that Michael Henchard is her father. Elizabeth-Jane becomes a hired companion to Henchard's quondom mistress Lucetta. Elizabeth Jane later weds Farfrae. This young lady learns her real father is the sailor Newson and Sue.5. Seaman Newson-The real father of Sue who returns to find her twenty years after the deal of exchange he made to purchase Sue as his wife from Michael Henchard.6. Lucette-The Jersey miss who had an affair long ago with Michael Henchard. Lucette is sexy and exotic. She weds Donald Farfrae dying after details of her affair with Henchard lead to scandal.The characters in this ironical novel are all puppets in an uncaring universe.The last word in the novel is \\"pain\\"! There is plenty of pain to share among all the characters.As with all of Hardy's classic novels, the descriptions of the town folks and the flora and fauna of Wessex are beautifully written. Hardy is the best regional novelist in all of English literature.The Penguin Edition of the novel contains excellent illustrations by Robert Barnes which were included in the original edition. A helpful chronology of Hardy's life; discussion of the textual history of the novel and a useful introduction by Dr. Keith Hardy are included. The novel is one you should read and enjoy."},{"Title":"Life and Death of the Mayor of Casterbridge (New Wessex editions)","review":"My second reading of a Thomas Hardy novel was every bit enjoyable as the first, if not more. Having a very limited background with this gifted author, it has taken years to appreciate his talents.The Mayor of Casterbridge starts with a very dubious event...concerning a drunken 'sale' of two persons by one Michael Henchard...bidding them a not-so-fond farewell; once Michael sobers up, he realizes his mistake, and searches, in vain, to retrieve his family.Flash forward 19 years, when a weary woman and her now-grown daughter appear near Casterbridge, searching for the woman's first husband, who has now become the mayor, and succeeded in keeping his 21 year pledge to abstain from drink following his grievous error years before.Susan Henchard, now the widow of a missing sailor, comes looking for Michael, and is surprised at what she finds. A sober, well-to-do, respected member of the community, and a leader. A far cry from the man who bartered her away years before. Also new in town is Donald Farfrae, who, once apprenticed to hay and corn merchant Michael, becomes more than Michael bargained for.To tell any more of the plot would be to deprive a reader of numerous twists and turns that occur along the way to the conclusion of this wonderful novel. Perhaps its due to a limited amount of experience with Hardy, but I found several jaw-dropping revelations along the way, and more twists than a television reality series.The story is never dull, nor is it mired in too much unnecessary detail or character introduction. Each of the 'dramatis personae' are well-realized, as is the notion that the past can always change the course of the future.For newcomers to Hardy's works, indulge in this page-turner, which is fraught with enjoyment. As this is a less 'dreary' tale than Jude the Obscure, I would recommend it as an introduction to Hardy's style...and a chance to meet a masterful storyteller."},{"Title":"Life and Death of the Mayor of Casterbridge (New Wessex editions)","review":"The Mayor of Casterbridge has so many plot twists and turns that it would not be an exaggeration to label this book as a \\"plot spiral.\\" With practically every new section, Hardy invents a new way to reveal some surprising (and sometimes not so surprising) twist to the plot line. Hardy creates a complex story about love, lust, relationships, economical hardship, family, shifts in power, and more in a beautiful and picturesque way. He concentrates so much on detail that it seems as if you are watching the events first hand. His style presents information as if you were reading it in the form of a play. He nearly always sets up the scene before beginning the action, which makes it so much easier to delve deeply into the action of the characters.Hardy also creates enormously dynamic characters that are subject to so many changes throughout the novel that they become like real people. The author's grip on human emotions makes his characters believable and easily loved and then hated. The fluctuating emotions of the main character, Michael Henchard, as he falls subject to disappointment in every avenue of his life is a true example of Hardy's gift for characterization.The contrast of the out-dated and underdeveloped town of Casterbridge vs. the complexity of the relationships that develop within it is brilliant and makes the reactions of the common townspeople to these relationships even more significant to the development of the setting and also the relationships themselves. Though not portrayed obviously in the book, the town of Casterbridge itself plays a very large role in the story. As Hardy thrusts outsiders from other cultures into this archaic town, things suddenly become very complicated and even more so when the newcomers begin to meet and mix together. The Scotchman, Farfrae, and Lucetta, the Jersey girl, as well as some others, react in such a way to the old ways of this society as to disrupt the harmony of this simple community, making this novel an avenue for Hardy to demonstrate his gift for rich dialogue and language, as created in direct relation to the character&#65533;s point of origin.Hardy has created a book about rises and downfalls of a small group of people and presents a very fitting theme about the events of ones life and how they affect everyone around them in death. I must say that I enjoyed this novel for its substance and complexity, as well as the timelessness of the general plot outline."},{"Title":"Life and Death of the Mayor of Casterbridge (New Wessex editions)","review":"At first, I was a little confused as to how Hardy could stretch what seemed to be a simple plot into such a long novel--especially because the story in blurb on the back cover happened within the first 50 pages. But the story is more than the blurb on the back cover. It is about betrayal, last wishes, the &quot;evils&quot; of drink, and how one mistake can affect you 21 years down the road. Hardy's fatalistic view, seen through Henchard, is, at times, enough to drive the reader crazy.Like many of the other reviewers here, I cried throughout the book. There are constant turns in the story line that at times uplift your soul, and then crash it into the depths of depression. This book is not an easy read though. There are sections that you will struggle to get through because it is dry, but then there are others that will keep you up at night rushing to finish.I liked this book slightly less than I liked _Tess_, but it was _Tess_ that made me buy this book. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Life and Death of the Mayor of Casterbridge (New Wessex editions)","review":"I remember having read this book in high school. I immediately fell in love with Hardy. (I was also fond of Hardy Boys at that time, so in my opinion the name Hardy acquired a special significance.) Unfortunately, though, I never liked another book by him quite so much. I've read Tess of the d'Urbvilles, Under the Greenwood Tree, Far from the Madding Crowd(which was perhaps his second best novel, as others here have affirmed), and perhaps a few others. It is strange, or perhaps significant that I remember the exact circumstance when I was reading this book. It must have been about ten in the night. I had cleared my study desk, and unlike my common practice of lying on my stomach on my bed to enjoy a book into the night, I sat down on the straight-backed chair at the desk to read it. Very soon, I was overwhelmed by the narrative of Mr. Hardy. My father came in to see what I was up to, saw the tears streaming down my face as I turned the pages of my book, and quietly went away. I have never before owned any story books- my parents told me to read out of libraries. But now I am 22, and have started earning some money of my own, and I'm going to start a little collection of my most beloved books, to pass on to my children, perhaps? And this is among my very best."},{"Title":"Life and Death of the Mayor of Casterbridge (New Wessex editions)","review":"The Mayor of Casterbridge, focused and simple the premise has been in itself, affords a quite convoluted plot that packs with events as the memorably niched characters play out their lives and unravels the novel. The book is riddled with a well-faceted theme of conscience: the purging of conscience and its reconciliation through an allusion to deceit and characters' shameless past that ceaselessly haunt them and render them despondent and guilty. The tragic actions revolve around one man who manages to establish prestige, wealth, and authority over Casterbridge and ironically the very elite status leads to the fall of the deeply flawed man.In a fit of drunken anger and delirium, young Michael Henchard sells his wife Susan and baby daughter Elizabeth-Jane to a sailor for 5 guineas at a county fair. Over the course of the years, though he manages to establish himself as a respected and prosperous pillar of the town from literally nothing, Henchard still affords a ray of hope in reuniting with his family, until he meets Lucetta Templeman who nurses him in America. Such black spot of his youth as wife-sale caused by his fits of spleen not only renders him ashamed of himself but also wears an aspect of recent crime: something that will shame him until his dying day. Behind his success is always lurking such shameful secret of his troubled past shielded from the public and a personality prone to self-destructive pride and temper.Contributing to the suspenseful nature of the novel is the return of the mayor's wife and daughter some 18 years later whom Michael Henchard believed to have perished at the sea. The sentimental reunion, which marks Henchard respectable 20-year abstinence from alcohol, brings about a heartrending revelation and an ironical sequence of events that irritate Henchard. The very truth cruelly leaves in him an emotional void that he unconsciously craves to fill. At the same time, the regard he has acquired for Elizabeth-Jane has eclipsed by this revelation. The new-sprung hope of his loneliness (or \\"friendless solitude\\" in Hardy's own words) that she will be to him a daughter of whom he can feel as proud as of the actual daughter she believes herself to be, has been stimulated by the (yet another) unexpected arrival of the sailor to a greedy exclusiveness in relation to her.All these ineluctable consequences of his past shameful transaction at the fair take a stupendous toll on Henchard and his conscience. He is also uneasy at the thought of Elizabeth-Jane's passion for Donald Farfrae, whose rising prestige and success in his independent business provoke in Henchard enmity and envy. Henchard quails at the thought that Farfrae shall utterly usurp her mild filial sympathy with him, that she might be withdrawn from him by degrees through Farfrae's influence and learns to despise him. The pricking of conscience subtly manifests in Henchard's solicitous love and growing jealousy. His fear of losing tie after the death of his wife is sympathetically understandable. Though he in his effrontery has been weaning Elizabeth-Jane from the sailor by saying he is her father, she understands that Henchard has himself been deceived in her identity.Lucetta Templeman, inescapably torn between her past disgraceful entanglement with Henchard and her love for a more refined gentleman, is also pricked by her conscience. In an impulsive moment, purely out of gratitude, Henchard proposes to the Jersey woman who has been so far compromised to him. But as the years gone by, Lucetta is more convinced that she has been forced into an equivocal position with Henchard by an accident. She has discovered some quantities in Henchard, who is either well-educated nor refined in manner, that irretrievably renders him less desirable as a husband than she has at first thought him to be, notwithstanding there remains a conscientious wish to being about her union with him.When Lucetta learns of the wife-sale, she immediately dismisses any possibility of being with him and realizes she cannot risk himself in his hands. It will have been letting herself down to take Henchard's name after such an ignominious scandal. But her past which she diligently seals, if not expunge altogether haunts her. The surreptitious history with Henchard becomes the torture of her meek conscience and the reconciling of which through a marriage with a second man remains also her secret alone.Subtitled \\"A Story of a Man of Character\\", Henchard's origins remain unexplained but he literally begins and ends the novel away from Casterbridge, where he achieves his prominent status ironically destines his downfall, through the lampooning and skimmity-ride. A psychological study, the novel accentuates the fury that causes him to lash out against both himself and those who stand closest to him. It depicts to the fullest the very self-destructive nature of the power that causes Henchard's fall, which is so obvious through his louring invidiousness.2004 (46) MY"},{"Title":"Life and Death of the Mayor of Casterbridge (New Wessex editions)","review":"Luckily I have the physical book too so was able to read the missing bit.

The hardcover is appropriately decorated with motiffs of Casterbridge. The wood engravings by Agnes Miller Parker are wonderful and unique! Of course, the story reads like a tragedy - Henchard is certainly his own worst enemy. On the other hand, Thomas Hardy's prose is certainly wonderful reading, unlike many 20th century so-called literary authors. Hardy's descriptive analyses of places and characters are exquisite, including the historical aspect of the English countryside near Casterbridge. The secondary characters are varied, some solid and some weak in spirit. Henchard seems to use them all to his detriment and the detriment of others. Elizabeth-Jane and Farfrae give the story balance and in the end are winners despite Henchard's downward spiral.This review is not in any way a descriptive review of the book's story line. However, there are hopes that your interest has been peeked and that you will give this book a complete reading. Also, there are DVD's of this story which can be accessed on Amazon.

This shocking event is our introduction to Michael Henchard's tempestuous character.Once sober, Henchard searches high and low for his wife and child, but with no success. He makes a vow in church to abstain from alcohol for the next 21 years, and he keeps that vow.We encounter Henchard two decades later, now a prosperous corn and wheat merchant and the Mayor of Casterbridge.Character is fate.

Don't start reading it on a night that you hope to get to bed early!"},{"Title":"Life and Death of the Mayor of Casterbridge (New Wessex editions)","review":"In Michael Henchard, Thomas Hardy created a tragic figure of Shakespearean dimension. The opening scene of a drunken Henchard selling off his wife and infant child at a country fair immediately establishes him as a rash and impetuous character. These qualities will return to haunt him and those nearest to him again and again as his fortune rises and falls.Henchard is contrasted with the genial and almost too innocent Scotsman Donald Farfrae who starts as his friend but becomes his rival in almost all things. Farfrae has an easy charm about him that makes him an unwitting competitor that stirs additional dark forces in Henchard as his rashness mixes with a growing envy.The Mayor Of Casterbridge is one of Hardy's great works alongside Tess and Jude The Obscure. Hardy's vision is dark and the relentless sadness in his work may put off some but in the end these characters he created are as strong as tragic figures as those of any writer in the English language.Finally Hardy's descriptions of rural England and the people who inhabit including their dialects of the time are priceless."},{"Title":"Life and Death of the Mayor of Casterbridge (New Wessex editions)","review":"Good literature provides keen observations in behaviors and psychology of human beings when faced with moral choices and consequences, and this book definitely is filled with good stuff. The main character, Mr. Henchard, is severely flawed and his iniquities are multiple, and yet, he also is so human and really hard not to have sympathetic feelings toward him in the end. The writing is wonderfully philosophical and dramatic, especially the last paragraph of Elizabeth-Jane's reflection on life is movingly insightful."},{"Title":"Life and Death of the Mayor of Casterbridge (New Wessex editions)","review":"Hardy mixes the comical here with the sorrowful so you're at once, entertained and saddened by the events; the largest event which brings on the sale of one man's wife and child to another; a moment which both liberates and destroys the main character through-out the story. Competition and jealousy figure prominently in the time line, which covers many years in the lives of a few sad people. You could say Michael Henchard was doomed from the 1st chapter. He certainly is haunted by his past to the point of no escape. And in fact, it's his past (as well as everyone who was part of it) that fuels the inevitable heartbreak to come. Casterbridge as a central location isn't quite as powerfully stark as Edgon Heath from... Native but the landscape does affect the players in similar ways.

This is possibly the most boring book that I have ever read. Nothing happens! I feel that a lot of people call this book a classic simply because some literary expert happened to like it once, and so these people, in a vain attempt to appear more intelligent than they are, simply churn out someone else's opinion, without actually thinking of their own response to the novel. I don't know how many copies of this book have been printed, but it is bound to be a large number, and all I can say is that it is a huge waste of paper which could have been put to better use elsewhere.

It wasn't until later on that I discovered the book wouldn't be as painful as I feared. The Mayor of Casterbridge is based entirely on irony and coincidences. Never have I rolled my eyes so many times in disbelief.Hardy created a soap opera-like world in the town of Casterbridge. This actually gave a humorous appeal to the book. After every major section of the book you can't help but mumble, \\"Sure...\\"Some people deem this book, \\"Depressing,\\" however The Mayor of Casterbridge didn't once give me a similar feeling. This book is presented in such a way that it helps you laugh at other people's misfortune.I wouldn't recommend this book as a \\"free-read;\\" But if you must choose between a bunch of boring books, and this one happens to be on the list, then I highly recommend you choose it. It may seem boring at first, but give it a chance; Hardy's humorous look at tragedy will give you a good laugh. I mean how bad can a book be, that starts out with its central character actually selling his wife and baby girl at a fair?"},{"Title":"Life and Death of the Mayor of Casterbridge (New Wessex editions)","review":"Hardy was a naturalist in whose novels everything goes wrong. Michael Henchard is a drunk who \\"sells\\" his wife Susan and infant daughter Elizabeth-Jane to a sailor. Susan doesn't realize the sale is bogus because she is \\"simple,\\" throws her ring away, and leaves with the sailor. When he sobers up next day, Henchard searches all over for his lost family, and finally enters a church and swears an oath over an enormous bible that he will not drink from his current age of 21 to double that age. Meanwhile, and 18 years later, when the sailor dies, Susan, with Elizabeth, comes looking for Henchard at Casterbridge. He is now a corn merchant and mayor of the town. As a teetotaler, he is described as drinking glass after glass of water at table for a town hearing. Eventually Susan, via Elizabeth-Jane, contacts Henchard and he pens a note suggesting that they meet at the \\"Ring.\\" This last turns out to be a ruined Roman amphitheater or coliseum, a 1500-year-old relic full of ghosts and whose very name symbolizes the dark past. Henchard and Susan agree to remarry, playacting a courtship for public appearances, and to keep the daughter in ignorance that the sailor was not her biological father. After they marry, Henchard and the manager of his business, Farfrae, have a falling out because the latter shows the former up and makes a fool of him, making himself more popular than the mayor. To make matters worse, Elizabeth-Jane falls in love with Farfrae.Frankly, that's as far as I've gotten. I know how it ends for Henchard, but I won't spoil the ending. Hardy is a mean naturalist writer, and has no sympathy for his characters whatsoever. _Casterbridge_ was first published in 1886, when alcoholism was little understood - least of all by people like Hardy who didn't have the disease. It's all too easy for this author to condemn and be judgmental of alcoholic people. I would suggest for an alternative reading Eugene O'Neill's _The Iceman Cometh_, since O'Neill was himself an alcoholic and could rightfully speak for alcoholics. The subject, no matter in whose hands, is by nature depressing. All my editorializing aside, Thomas Hardy is a great novelist who has earned his place in the canon. His poetry is good, too. _The Mayor of Casterbridge_ is worth pursuing to the end if you're not an alcoholic."},{"Title":"Life and Death of the Mayor of Casterbridge (New Wessex editions)","review":"This book was originally written to be printed in newspapers, newspapers were then used to wipe one's posterior.

So isn't nice to read a classic novel with straight-forward writing that aims for no insight into society or people? Actually no, it's kind of depressing. The Mayor of Casterbridge relies on coincidence, melodrama, and, as the afterword in my edition puts it, &quot;the constant exploitation of chance happenings to determine situation and hence the fate of his characters.&quot; I chose this Hardy novel because it was supposed to be character-centered. The story starts with Michael Henchard selling his wife and child at a fair. I thought this book would examine his redemption, it would be a Lord Jim type tale of profound psychological insight. A strange event like that is a good way to get a book started, but the crazy, unlikely events just keep a-coming. You feel nothing for the characters, ever.

In fact, a better description of this novel comes from a colleague of mine, Professor Neale Scott of the Baltimore University, who remarked &quot;I realise now I had mistaken the dullness of Henchard's character for the dullness of the whole novel.&quot;. Ultimately, Prof. Scott is quite accurate in his assessment of the text. The characters bumble around, waiting for circumstance to attach itself to their groins, and do very little of plausible importance at all. Henchard himself is, without doubt, one of the most irritating characters to be placed in 'classic' fiction, and one can't help but wish that the death of our tragic hero had happened an awful lot sooner, such as before the novel started. The character of Elizabeth-Jane, wonderfully parodied by Helli Kitchin, of the Moscow State University, is so blase towards her constantly changing parenthood that it completely ruins any sense of empathy that the audience may have for her. The least convincing Scotsman ever can also be found in this text, in the form of Donald Farfrae, and I am inclined to agree with Dr Daniel Greenfeld, whose thesis, &quot;Hardy makes the heart grow colder&quot;, points out that the author would not know a Scotsman if one jumped up and bit him, a way that most of us admittedly meet them. To sum up - I discourage my students from reading this shambolic text. Avoid this novel like the plague - it is so soggy, you couldn't even burn it to stay warm. Attempt, perhaps, to read something a little more plausible with something other that a praetorian wanderer and an intransigent hay-trusser to tantalise the imagination, something that the author was obviously lacking - Wessex indeed."},{"Title":"Life and Death of the Mayor of Casterbridge (New Wessex editions)","review":"\\"The Mayor of Casterbridge\\" ought to be the model of what a classic is not. Books deemed as a \\"classic\\" are said to be everlasting and universal in its message. This book does not spread its wings into our era, and it does not apply to everyone in some way, unless you've experienced paternity uncertainty and emotional neglect. The characters are rigid, changing without reason, and lacking practical emotions. Michael Henchard is repulsive from the start, from when he sells his wife and child, to his emotional withdrawal towards the young woman who turned out to be his non-biological daughter, to hiding the truth of who her father actually was to Elizabeth-Jane, so one cannot pity his outcome. Elizabeth-Jane, the non-biological daughter of Henchard, was completely void of personality. \\"Blas&eacute;\\" has more personality than Elizabeth-Jane. After a tennis match type life, of being flung back and forth between fathers, to marrying Donald Farfrae who one day courted her, married another woman (who just happened to be the landlord of the house Elizabeth-Jane was living at, at the time), and then realized his affection for her, Elizabeth-Jane would've been a prime candidate for therapy (how could she give her heart to men who kept being introduced as her father?), but instead acted as if she was a spokesperson normalcy. Finally, Donald Farfrae, a Scotsman, who was the poster boy for blandness, never really showed growth. He was always monotone, and I could not tell if he found Elizabeth-Jane's biological father to scorn Henchard, or truly help Elizabeth-Jane find the truth.

To such a Christian, this book will help to dig deep into spiritual knowledge. The spiritual experience of such seeker would be on knowledge not on blind faith and belief. This book has the potential of dividing the fundamental Christians from other Christians in a big way. This book could create a new class of Christians who would be open minded, who would put their faith in the philosophical knowledge that Jesus imparted to his disciples. Such Christians would have less faith in a salvation that comes in believing in the person of Jesus, but in knowing and doing the things that Jesus taught."},{"Title":"The Way, the Truth, and the Lies","review":"I would like this \\"author\\" to please re-write the bible as he is the self appointed enlightened one.

I am not for man made religious rituals that replace the teachings of our Lord, Jesus the Christ. However, this is simply the same message that has been biting back against truth for centuries.

At best, an argument from silence could provide circumstantial evidence. But as a requirement for PROOF, an argument from silence falls notoriously short and is labeled by logisticians as a logical fallacy.Unfortunately the majority of this books PROOFS are nothing more than arguments from silence. To further understand this egregious error imagine that you have read 4 biographies about John F. Kennedy.Three out of the four books mention that JFK received a Purple Heart.Two out of those three mention that he was awarded the Navy and Marine Corps medal.The fourth writer failed to mention either the Purple Heart or the Navy and Marine crops medal. But what can we put forward from this omission by the writer? Are any of these statements below a PROOF?1. The fourth writer never knew about these medals.2. The fourth writer, by not telling you about these medals, actually knew that JFK never received them and the others are lying.3. The fourth writer did not know JFK and only got his information as hearsay.In each case the answer is a resounding NO. If I were to posit any of the following arguing it was a PROFF it would be a logical fallacy. But this is precisely what this book has done in almost every case.For example in Chapter five the book shows that 3 out of the 4 gospels have a story about Satan tempting Jesus in the wilderness. However, the fact is John's gospel does NOT record this. So what does the author make of John's gospel being silent on the temptation of Jesus?\\"So if John, knowing who Jesus was (based on his Gospel) did not mention the temptation, then it stands to reason that it never took place.\\"[Direct quote from page 61 of the book.]No, No, NO, NOOOOO, (banging my head against the table in despair).If all four gospels or in all four autobiographies of JFK were identical what would the reader think. Either massive collusion on the authors parts or they were purposely faked. Come on, each person when writing a biography is going to include parts that they feel are germane to their goals of an author and to their intended readership.Historians (Christian, Secular and critical or liberal) ALL agree that John was the last of the four gospel to be written. Much like a writer of the fourth JFK biography he will have reviewed the other manuscripts and try to add new insights or details that were left out. It would not make sense to write a duplicate of the other biographies, it is only logical to assume that John would NOT copy every story.The book makes other huge errors as well. In trying to show that the bible has been tampered with the author brings up Matthew 6:9-13 and tells us with great fanfare that the very end of the verse 13 cannot be found in the earliest transcripts. The point in questions reads\\"For yours is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever. Amen.\\"The author then posits the following\\"If such a small and seemingly harmless change can take place and go unnoticed (or worse, be ignored), what more critical passages may have been deliberately added, altered or even prevented from appearing in the bible we have today.\\" (14)Wow, the start of a great conspiracy theory. The only problem with this is that I started checking different bible versions. The first two I looked at (NIV, ESV) did not have the phrase that was added later. As a matter of fact they both had a footnote at the end of the verse and then at the bottom of the page very explicitly stated that the end was only found in later manuscripts and was not found in earliest manuscripts.Even in the two versions that had the verse included there was a footnote that said the same thing.To those who have not done much research on this issue, I can assure you that all late editions are clearly marked and well known. For the author to imagine that this has gone\\"unnoticed (or worse, be ignored)\\" is pure hyperbole playing on the uneducated in this manner.I could go on and on, but there are better books out there for enlightenment.In response to Linda:My review was specifically targeted at the major logical error that is repeated throughout the book. I stated this very clearly. My main point was not to argue each and every inaccuracy but to show a pattern that is extant throughout the book.For example you yourself fall into the trap that the author has done. You write the following:[The author then uses John 1 29-39 to prove his point by showing that the temptation time line in the synoptic gospels of Matthew, Mark and Luke don't work based on John's account of Jesus entering his ministry. The author ends his chapter with the following:\\"Did you note from John's account that Jesus was baptized on one day, and then John the Baptist sees Jesus the very next day-even sending two of his own apostles to follow Christ and to be with Him from that time on? It is here the \\"Temptation\\" Scriptures most contradict themselves: How can Jesus immediately go in the wilderness for 40 days as the Gospels of Mark, Matthew, and Luke say, when according to John's Gospel, John the Baptist sees Jesus the next day after His baptism? . . . ]This would all be well and good IF John WAS recording Jesus' baptism, but he does NOT. The event is only refereed to in John 1 29-40. It is in no way transcribed as happening then and this causes the error.We will make this a little be easier to understand. Imagine if a biographer of President Kennedy writes that he and President Kennedy spoke about how JFK received a purple heart. However, he spoke to JFK about this on the day after his inauguration. He then writes about this incident in his biography, but this is the only time he mentions the Purple Heart.Does that mean President Kennedy received his purple heart then?Does that mean that the other biographers made up stories about what happened from the time he received the Purple Heart to his inauguration?Perhaps it might mean that the other biographers are simply embellishing Mr. Kennedy's life?Or just possibly does it mean that JFK received a purple heart, did a bunch of thins, got elected president and THEN retold the story about receiving his purple heart?The answer is self-evident.As far as the how could Satan tempt God?Hmmmm how about asking some really BIG questions, likeHow could God be killed?Why did God need to come and die at all?Why would this God have to be tempted just as Hebrews 4:15 proclaims?If this God could not be tempted would his death have been efficacious?Perhaps if we dug a little deeper we would do a study on the Incarnation of Jesus Christ, that mysterious miracle at the heart of historic Christianity. The whole incarnation theme is central in the New Testament witness and as such a plethora of writings is available to anyone. It would take very little effort on your part or even the authors to do the research.Linda after you get done examining the pine needles you'll see a pine cone, then a branch and soon a whole tree. Then one day you will step back and realize that, that tree is in a great big forest. Then those \`big question' about mysterious floating pine needles will disappear, good luck in your enlightenment."},{"Title":"The Way, the Truth, and the Lies","review":"This book came highly recommended to me by many of my friends as they found it paired with Misquoting Jesus.

Consider carefully before taking that broad path.To those who need PROOF to believe, there are museums and volumes filled with archaeological/historical evidence.

Gravity is unseen but we don't rise to the heavens. I believe in the GOD I don't see because I have experienced Him in many ways. I have a real relationship with Christ Jesus through His Holy Spirit.

I say it tells us that Jesus wants us to love our fellow man, that Jesus was/is indeed the son of God, and that we should love our God with all our heart(s). The thing that I believe disturbs some readers is that it questions some of the writings in the bible that contradict each other. This book has helped me strengthen my faith, not lessened it at all. I am a questioner about EVERYTHING. To see so many different stories,versions,teachings can be quite confusing and even disheartening. I have always loved the Lord and consider myself a Christian, in that I want to be more loving, non-judgmental, and really want to put my faith in the Lord rather than the teachings of man. To many I am probably a sinner to the nth degree, but that is okay by me because I still love (or really try my hardest to love), those that would think this. My take on Rev. Teel's book is, if you are a struggling Christian because you have a difficult time believing writings that were written by men that were not witnesses to what took place, if you wonder why some books are missing or are not included in the bible, or if you just can't wrap your head around the differences in \\"testimony\\" maybe this can help you straighten out some of your thoughts or views.

Teel."},{"Title":"The Way, the Truth, and the Lies","review":"I might be mistaken but isn't the bible supposed to be interpreted by people? And aren't people supposed to ask questions to seek knowledge? This book brought out a lot of emotions in me as did reading some of its reviews of late. The book asks some pivotal questions and gives insight into scriptural inaccuracy.Chapter one gives a general overview of the origins of the New Testament nothing that anyone familiar with the bible won't know.Chapter 2 asks if Jesus was really born of a virgin? The author then answers the question quite direct by stating No! He supports his argument using nothing but the gospel accounts from the New King James Version and the King James. The author speaks on the \\"slaughter of the innocents\\" from Matthew 1 16-19 and asks how could such an event take place? \\"Could it be that the Bethlehem regional area was too small and that records of such an atrocity were not kept? Could it be that the records were destroyed through the ages and did not survive to this day? Or is it what seems more likely: That the event itself never took place? Such an event in that place and time under the famously history-tracking Roman Empire would have been noted.\\" He concludes convincingly that this event never took place.He ends chapter 2 with his feelings on the virgin birth and why he feels it does not work. \\"In order for this to have occurred there would have had to have been sperm to fertilize Mary's egg. This would mean that God would have had to have had physical relations with Mary to conceive the baby Jesus, thus throwing out the story's \\"virgin\\" aspect. God can not break His own rules. He set in motion procreation: In order for a human to bring forth a child there must be an egg and a sperm. This law is undeniable. What we do have is a record left behind for us to review, and that record tells us that we must accept this story as literal. We know there were many liberties taken by New Testament writers and scribes, and one can only imagine what embellishments, additions, or subtractions have been made to the original versions written so many millennia ago by translators and scribes through the centuries. The evidence presented, however, screams a resounding NO! Jesus was not born of a virgin.\\" A disturbing statement for literalist, to me it made perfect sense.Chapter 3 covers Jesus' life before ministry. The author must glean what he can from the canon of the scriptures offered in the gospels of the New Testament. He then interjects some not commonly known apocryphal stories about Jesus as a child.\\"As a small example, the Infancy Apocrypha tell the story of a Jesus who brings clay animals to life, and who in anger kills another child and then is remorseful for what He has done and resurrects the slain child. But to see our God angered as a child-to the point of killing another child-is not something that the mainstream faith would accept. The story also shows a young Jesus learning through trial and error that He must harness His power and not use it for evil but only for good. So in the apocryphal account of Jesus and this child, Jesus is shown as a child with no control who is learning to use His powers appropriately.\\" As disturbing as this is one reviewer lashes out at the author, he didn't write it someone else did he just relayed a little known unaccepted work. The work did not paint Jesus in a favorable light, so it was left out of the canon as were many, many other works.In Chapter 4 the author argues convincingly that John the Baptist was not Elijah using the bible to support his argument.In Chapter 5 the author asks how could Satan tempt God? The author brings forward some great insight into this and in the end what he says really dispels any other argument. If Jesus is God and He can be tempted by Satan then that makes God, the omniscient, Omnipresent, omnipotent ruler of the universe corruptible. And if He is corruptible then as the author says \\"we are all in big trouble.\\" You can throw out any other arguments that you like on the person of Jesus. But if He is your God and He can be tempted then He is not a God I would worship.Chapter 6 Covers Jesus' miracles and asks the question did He really do all the miracles that the writers claim He did?Chapter 7 is there a problem with taking Jesus' sayings literally? A great chapter on the literalization of words written by men for men. And words that were written long after the death of not only Jesus but the original followers of Jesus as wellChapter 8 deals with the passion and what is known about it from the bible and from the secular world.Chapter 9 deals with the subject of the crucifixion and what really happened to Jesus that day. It handles the subject well but a little more graphic detail then I would have liked.Chapter 10 deals with the resurrection and the myth of the physical resurrection versus a spiritual one. The answer on the literal resurrection is honest and his opinion based on the bible and physics.Chapter 11 cleans up the loose ends and makes sense of some of the rest of the works. All in all I found it to be both entertaining and enlightening, is this book for everyone....no. But if you really are willing to think outside the box and are willing to look at alternate view points and interpretations, this is a great read."},{"Title":"The Way, the Truth, and the Lies","review":"Dr. Teel starts this book from a literalist perspective of the New Testament. He then takes us on a journey through the four gospels giving an objective eye to the literalist viewpoint. In the end I was both informed and inspired by this book.

D.

Fox, a few notes:D. Fox: \\"reverend\\" ... That word is only used one time in the entire Bible, and it is used to describe our Lord.YouAreThat: In English? Which translation? Because I doubt that anyone in 1st-century Palestine ever said \\"Reverend\\" at all.D. Fox: The reader is also told that Jesus had the same purpose in life as any other person does. The author couldn't be more incorrect.Hebrews 2:17: ...he had to be made like his brothers and sisters in every way...D. Fox: ...garbage...blasphemy...trash...Matthew 5:44: Love your enemies...Now what?The current environment, in which people are reading Dan Brown and Michael Baigent and, yes, REVEREND Teel can only lead to more people having a deeper grasp of the ultimately ungraspable. I hope that D. Fox will come to see that, as Dr. Teel admirably points out, the Bible is a book of QUESTIONS, not of ANSWERS. When I preach or speak in public and someone says, \\"I enjoyed your message,\\" I feel I may have missed my mark. Read Matthew 10! Jesus \\"did not come to bring peace, but a sword.\\" Get shook up! Move off your comfort spot! Allow Dr. Teel et. al. to challenge your views.

Reverend Teel then answers the questions in a way that makes sense and gives a real understanding of the possibilities. The book asks the reader to set aside all preconceived notions on religion, Jesus, and God and take a look at it in a most unique way. I went into the book on the defensive as a fundamentalist Christian and found myself following the argument of Reverend Teel and even, at moments, agreeing with him. While I certainly don't agree with all of the points he brings out, he does bring up some really good questions and gives some really provocative and thought provoking answers. He asks the reader only to keep an open mind and in the end I was moved by the book, I'm recommending it to all of my friends."},{"Title":"The Way, the Truth, and the Lies","review":"This is a work destined to become a classic. As a professor of literature and argument I was astounded by the writing of the author. A subject so difficult to tackle yet tackled with intimacy and accuracy it is forensically detailed in its look at the biblical text and the literal context taken by fundamentalists. It is a brave new world and wonderful to see that there are a few open minds willing to tackle such lofty subjects head on with passion and precision. No fear here, this is a person driven not only by the clear biblical inaccuracies. But also a man stricken with such a devastating disease as MS who in the end still professes his faith in something that is completely in conflict with the canonical works that profess to be truth impressed me."},{"Title":"The Way, the Truth, and the Lies","review":"In The Way, The Truth and The Lies Roy Teel tells it like it is. There is nothing here that other scholars have not written about before with one exception; not only does Roy ask the questions, he answers, and the answers can be unsettling. The myths are exposed and in a brilliant way.He takes the bible and offers the scripture in its whole and then comments on it and then compares the gospel accounts against each other. When he is finished what he gives the reader is a full circle view and logical and rational look at the events. I would place this book on the same shelf with Bart Ehrman, John Spong and other liberal theologians with one exception. When Roy Teel brings up a point in the bible that he feels is not true he doesn't dance around it he smashes right through it. I found myself several times stopping to say \\"how can you say that?\\" and then looking at the biblical evidence he presents and saying, \\"wow! Your right\\"I agree with the other reviewers and say to those who are die hard closed minded fundamentalists STAY AWAY FROM THIS BOOK it is only going to make you angry.What I found inspiring about the work as a whole was the way Roy tackled each subject with both whit and wisdom. The book has its moments of great critical thinking and then moments of true levity. I wish that everyone would read this book if for no other reason then to get them thinking.

I purchased the E-book and then the hard cover. The author has the guts to dissect the Bible Gospel by Gospel and set them in parallel to each other then ask and answer some really hard questions. Was Jesus really born of a virgin? What did Jesus do before his public ministry? How could Satan possibly tempt God? And so on all the way through the entire Gospel story. The author covers every aspect of Jesus' life from birth, crucifixion to the resurrection. He takes each question examines it fully against nothing but the Christian Bible and answers them using the Bible; I don't want to give away all of what the author concludes in this review only to say that this man shows great courage he flat out says what is true and what is false and uses the Bible to prove his argument.The author dares to say what I have often wondered to myself and then lets you know it's alright to ask questions that is how you get knowledge and understanding of the Bible. The author takes on his subject matter with great thought and obvious knowledge; he knows what he is talking about. If you're a closed minded Christian fundamentalist stay away from this book IT IS NOT FOR YOU! If you are like me, and always wondered about Jesus and the Bible and why some things just don't make sense then this book is for you. It is refreshing and encouraging and I must say a gutsy move for a preacher to make the statements that the author makes. When I finished the book I felt a whole new understanding of the Gospels and was encouraged to know that I was not the only person on the planet who saw these BLATANT inaccuracies, the author has the courage to go against mainstream Christianity and bring in conventional wisdom.

The reviewer does a good job of making his argument with one major omission. The reviewer does not tackle the core question of Chapter 5 which is \\"How could Satan possibly tempt God?\\"The argument of the author is if Jesus is what the Christian church teaches \\"God in human Form\\" How could Satan tempt him? The last reviewer totally ignores this question. The author takes this on in the first paragraph of chapter 5.\\"The Old Testament speaks very little about Satan, who he is, or what he does; the New Testament gives Satan a much more prominent role largely because of Luke's \\"Temptation\\" story. It's ironic as we move into a discussion of Jesus' ministry that we have no picture from the Gospel of Him as an ordinary man. Perhaps if we did, the story of His temptation by Satan might be believable. But alas, we are told that Jesus is God and in Him is no darkness, no evil, no deceit. He is perfection.\\" Page 40; the author bases his statement on the statements made in the Gospel of John verses 1 through 5.The author goes on to compare the accounts in Matthew, Mark and Luke against each other and the temptation stories. The author then asks a very important question chapter 5 page 40.\\"This is important because the Christian church propagates to the world using, for the most part, the words from John's Gospel that Jesus is not only the Son of God but that He is God in the form of man. This begs the question I open this chapter with: If indeed Jesus is God, then what in Heaven or Earth could Satan offer to tempt his own creator?\\" The argument from the authors perspective is simple it is not based on omission but inclusion. If Jesus is as the Christian church propagates \\"God\\" how could Satan tempt him? The author then brings up a very good point and one for thought by any believer:\\"The only thing I have been able to deduce from John's omission of this temptation is that it did not happen. John can not contradict what he knows Jesus to be by showing that Jesus, while being God all-powerful and mighty, could be insulted by a temptation attempt by His nemesis Satan. Tempted by the very angel Jesus cast out of Heaven with a third of the heavenly host for their disobedience to God, if indeed we accept Jesus is God in human form.\\" Chapter 5 page 44. This is a great point and puts the question right back to the reader \\"How could Satan tempt God?\\" The argument of the author is very clear and in the end he convincingly argues that if indeed John's gospel is true and Jesus is indeed God then there could be no temptation and that is why John excludes this narrative all together.The author goes on in page 44-45 \\"As God, Jesus is the universe's ruler and creator. What possible good would it do for Satan to attempt to tempt the very being that created him? Satan had nothing to barter: He was in the presence of God in the form of His creation, and everything that exists is because of Him! This is a fact that John makes very clear in the opening of his Gospel, John 1:1, \\"In the beginning was the word and the word was with God and the word was God.\\" So was there anything on the Earth that God could not have? Of course not! So how could something so simple and so apparent be thrust upon intelligent Christians millennium after millennium?\\"The author goes on to say if Jesus is indeed God then there is no way that this temptation ever took place. He ends the chapter leaving the reader with a good set up into the rest of his book. If Jesus is God then there is no need for a \\"mythological\\" temptation story. The author states, and rightly so, if Jesus is God as the church propagates and he can be tempted by Satan then that would mean that God is corruptible and what hope is there for us if God can be corrupted.I found the authors argument very clear and very compelling and asked some very intelligent and direct questions. He also made a very convincing argument for not only biblical alterations but literalist interpretations of the bible and the danger of doing so.The author then uses John 1 29-39 to prove his point by showing that the temptation time line in the synoptic gospels of Matthew, Mark and Luke don't work based on John's account of Jesus entering his ministry. The author ends his chapter with the following:\\"Did you note from John's account that Jesus was baptized on one day, and then John the Baptist sees Jesus the very next day-even sending two of his own apostles to follow Christ and to be with Him from that time on? It is here the \\"Temptation\\" Scriptures most contradict themselves: How can Jesus immediately go in the wilderness for 40 days as the Gospels of Mark, Matthew, and Luke say, when according to John's Gospel, John the Baptist sees Jesus the next day after His baptism? The logic is that Jesus needed no mythological showdown with Satan in the wilderness to show His divinity. So if we accept what the modern Christian church teaches, that Jesus was indeed God in human form, then we know that He could not be tempted by Satan. Jesus is about to enter the world stage, and His appearance also begins some of the most dramatic and miraculous moments of His ministry.\\"I too could go on and on but won't. I strongly suggest this book to anyone seeking to understand the conflicts and contradictions in the bible. The book lays out in vivid detail a very logical argument not only for biblical inaccuracies but also the dangers of biblical literalization."},{"Title":"The Way, the Truth, and the Lies","review":"This book takes a new look at the New Testament and the teachings of Jesus. Unlike some of the other books on the market touting to give you \\"the real Jesus\\" Dr. Teel shows a lively and plausible Jesus. Jesus the man, human and compassionate, he strips away the myth and leaves golden nuggets of truth. I like the way Dr. Teel used only the bible to support his argument. The book brought the bible to life for me. I felt as if I were walking through the gospels verse by verse. Dr. Teel is easy to read and understand. He doesn't speak over your head but he does speak to your heart. I have a whole new perspective on the bible not only as a Holy book, but as literature, and a new view of the Jesus I thought I knew. The chapters are well laid out to guide the reader through Dr. Teel's analysis.

First of all, this man advertises himself as a \\"reverend\\" when in fact that word is only fit to describe our one and only true God. That word is only used one time in the entire Bible, and it is used to describe our Lord. This word is an inappropriate title for any human, since we could never live up to its true meaning.As for Mr. Teel's book. Instead of relying on faith, which is the basis of our teachings, Mr. Teel resorts to quoting authors of works of fiction to disprove parts of the Bible he doesn't like. Mr. Teel goes on to make bold statements about the Bible not being accurate. If you're thinking you feel the same way and would like to see proof, don't buy this book because there is nothing here but opinion.2 Tim 3:16-17All Scripture is God-breathed and is useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting and training in righteousness,NIVThat means ALL scripture is God-breathed! That doesn't mean the parts you like were the inspired Word of God, that means ALL of it is!Mr. Teel goes on to make wild statements about Jesus killing a kid when he was young and then resurrecting him after feeling bad about it. The reader is also told that Jesus was just like you and me, and he was married with children. The reader is also told that Jesus had the same purpose in life as any other person does.The author couldn't be more incorrect. Jesus' life was devoted to teaching God's Word and to ultimately die for all of our sins! He even died for the people who don't yet know Him.If you are knowledgeable in the Bible at all, you will easily be able to sift through the garbage in this book. But if you are very new in your faith journey, please be aware that not everyone who says they come with God's Word actually does that. Unfortunately, many people are so driven by money and other worldly things that they will do ANYTHING to make a buck. Even speak blasphemy about God!Once I am done laughing at this author and his trash, his book will go straight into the garbage wher it belongs!Not recommended to anyone!"},{"Title":"The Autobiography of Butch Jones Y.B.I.

This German writer(1878-1957), who was a contemporary of Thomas Mann and Franz Kafka, was a tireless experimenter who never did anything twice. He is best known for &quot;Berlin Alexanderplatz&quot; (1929), his modernist novel about big city life which is strongly influenced by Joyce's stream of consciousness techniques. &quot;Tales of a Long Night&quot; is D&ouml;blin's last novel and it was written in the year after the end of the Second World War.Coming to terms with the war seems to be the where the novel starts. Edward Allison, a young English soldier, is wounded in a kamikaze attack on his battleship. He loses a leg and is taken to a mental hospital after his return to England. After his mother has succeeded in getting him back to the family home, Edward haunts the house like a ghost: He does not want to accept what happened, he wants to know who is responsible for the war. Finally his father, a famous writer, decides that it will be best to gather some friends around Edward and himself and to try to get closer to the truth by telling stories.Some people have called this book a collection of novellas, but it is much more than that. The stories that are told reveal people's ideas of themselves and of the Allison family. The emphasis shifts more and more to an analysis of the dark secrets of Edwards family, he feels more and more like Hamlet who must unravel what has gone wrong... There are lots of twists and turns, however, before the story can come to an end which is also a beginning.D&ouml;blin converted to Cahtolicism in 1940, and it shows in the moood of this novel, which wants to show where the world has gone wrong. But there are no easy answers, nor is there a big reconciliation at the end. This is a very convincing and beautiful book."},{"Title":"Tales of a Long Night: A Novel","review":"Over the past year or two the German novelist Alfred Doblin has aroused more interest in this country than he ever did during his lifetime, thanks partly to Rainer Werner Fassbinder's film version of ''Berlin Alexanderplatz'' and partly to the appearance of an English translation of ''November 1918,'' Doblin's trilogy about the abortive German revolution led by Rosa Luxemburg and Karl Liebknecht.''Tales of a Long Night'' is the story of a young Englishman called Edward Allison who loses a leg during World War II and returns home a nervous as well as a physical wreck, tormented by doubt and anger, and obsessed with what seems to him the mystery of where the blame for the war really lies. He is released from a clinic in the hope that living among his family will hasten his cure, but he simply transfers his fixation with hidden guilt to the domestic front. Why does his father - a successful author - seem to reject him? What is the secret struggle being waged between his parents? Why does he feel that he is the child of a tainted past?In an effort to exorcise his demons, the Allisons and their friends start telling a series of stories, many of them variations on ancient myths and legends. Some of these tales serve to reveal the character of the storyteller, others as a riposte or as a comment on what has gone before. All of them are meant to advance the psychological and spiritual action.Many of the tales of D&quot;oblin's long night have an undoubted lurid power. But there are too many of them, and they ramify too rapidly. We move through an expressionist phantasmagoria from a wayward bus in Los Angeles to Pluto and Proserpina, by way of Michelangelo and Salome and a mock-medieval tale about the Virgin. Edward's mother, Alice Allison (a significant name, we can be sure), spins variants of a story about a mother who waits for her son to come back from the war, now in Montmartre, now in Germany, and elaborates on the already elaborate legend of her patron saint, Theodora. In the final stages of the book the distinction between framework and fantasy starts to break down completely. Yet through the haze it is possible to discern a continuous story unfolding. The unreality is heightened by an English setting that is in some respects quite weirdly un-English.At its deepest levels it is heavily colored by Doblin's religious convictions - an agnostic Jew, he converted to Roman Catholicism in 1940 - and there can be no doubting the seriousness with which he devotes himself to major themes."},{"Title":"Pinochle","review":"Bought this for my aging father-in-law, he couldn't read it, said it was too complicated, and he already knew how to play pinochle so this book was pretty much a bomb.

When they found themselves baulked on the surface, both sides began to burrow beneath each other's lines to lay and fire heavy explosive charges.&quot;&quot;A separate, almost private war between rival sappers started, It was a three-year, bloody, claustrophobic, uncomfortable, primitive, exhausting war-within-a-war. Military experts predict that noting like it will ever again be seen.&quot;Barrie describes the formation of the tunneling companies and the development of the techniques and strategies they employed. Based on interview with former tunellers and published military histories Barrie has constructed a history based around the activities of John Norton Griffiths who was instrumental in establishing the first tunneling companies.But it is the sheer size of the mining activities that is most surprising. By the height of the mining war 20,000 men were actively engaged on each side and hundreds of miles of tunnels were completed before the end of the war.This book gives a vivid account of a type of warfare that will thankfully never be seen again."},{"Title":"Preschool Lesson Plans","review":"This is a wonderful Christian-directed set of lesson plans for pre-K and Kindy age children.

This edition uses older translations because in order to offer such an unbelievable value, the editor must use text that is not copyright protected. I found the translations used to be readible and I enjoyed the character development. Chekhov is not O'Henry ... i.e, the stories in this book do not have tremendous plot development and surprise or ironic twists. Rather, he seeks to give a slice of life in the Tzarist Russsia of his day. Four of the stories are slices of life of fairly well off members of Russian society or, at least, Russian upper middle class. One, appropriately entitled &quot;The Peasants&quot; is indeed a story about the lives of peasants. I enjoyed all of the stories but, my favorite was &quot;The Lady With the Toy Dog,&quot; which explored the age old phenomenon of extramarital affairs and the tragedy of forbidden love. Chekhov explores the chraracters' emotions, in this story, without being judgmental one way or the other. Another engaging story is &quot;The Black Monk&quot; which explores happiness in one's delusions as opposed to unhappiness in the real world (or was the main character's vision a delusion at all?). Like I say, the translations are not the latest and only five stories are included but this is a five star value. The book has made me interested (when I have more time) to explore a larger volume of Chekhov's stories so, this edition has fulfilled its task well."},{"Title":"Five Great Short Stories","review":"For those who wonder what Anton Chekhov is about but don't like reading plays, Dover Thrift Edition's \`Five Great Short Stories' is a good introduction to the universe of the Russian writer. Sure his short tales are not as good as his plays, namely \\"The Seagull\\", but they give a fair dimension of this style and interests.And his interests lay rather in the development of the characters psyche than plots twists or an elaborated story. His stories are more about creating an atmosphere than drowning the characters into it. See the first story, for example, \\"The Black Monk\\". It is actually a study of the madness, or, for some, the portrait of a supernatural situation. It depends on which side you are coming from.Another good example is \\"The Lady with the Toy Dog\\", probably my favorite Chekhov short story. The characters are so real and human that it is not impossible to suffer with them. Like in most of his work, the author tackles with sociological and psychological analyzes of the people he has created --and they end up being as a metaphor for all the human kind, be them Russian or not.Once enjoying this book, the reader can move to more of the Russian author. There are plenty of short stories and wonderful plays to be discovered."},{"Title":"Five Great Short Stories","review":"I love Chekhov; this review has nothing to do with the value of his writing.

It's bizarre. I'm missing three stories and the end of a fourth.

This stops the flow of reading because the reader has to page back. There's no reason not to just repeat the footnote.

Warning: the first part of the mystery is very hard to understand because we don't know what's going on, but towards the end it will reveal what happened. Another downfall of this book is the way Faulkner puts the narrator in third person, using &quot;he&quot; and of course there are other &quot;he's&quot; in the story which makes it very difficult to figure out who's talking; if this is his type of writing, he should've used at least a capital H to distinguish when &quot;he&quot; is the narrator and &quot;he&quot; is another person, and the other characters, even though the reader might be confused who they are at first, Faulkner will describe them more throughout the book. Warning: there are also flashbacks which are put in parentheses, and yes sometimes the parentheses will be about 1 page long, so be careful. Well in conclusion, this is a good book but is badly structured. Advice: since the sentences are extremely long, sometimes to 2 pages, you must read it out loud, like you're talking to someone, and must read it with feeling and criticism; another advice: don't read this book at night while lying on a bed, you will be wear out and become very sleepy and cannot concentrate; read it during daytime and sit on a chair and read, not on a bed.

The further you read, the more certain you are that this cannot end well - but no way can you stop reading.Classic Faulkner at his best, with the typical huge cast of 'characters' (in every sense of the word) and side plots."},{"Title":"Intruder in the dust: A novel","review":"I read this on my own and have read other works by Faulkner, so I'm not just some innocent student.On the positive: Faulkner does create good imagery such as the two scenes in the graveyard. I also like that he never tries to explain himself, let's the reader figure it out. The symbolism is OK if you're into that sort of thing.On the negative: He must have written this while out and out drunk and the editor, publisher and the adoring public make great allowance because this is \\"William Faulkner\\". The sentences are not just run-on, but change subjects midstream and simply make no sense. The dialogue is the same as the narrative except for the quotes surrounding it and thus since everyone talks the same, there is not much for characterization. The plot is a simple mystery which depends on timing, coincidence, stupidity and is just unbelievable.If not for the fame of the author, this book would be forgotton."},{"Title":"Intruder in the dust: A novel","review":"Why is Faulkner considered a classic writer. Who sets the standards? Intruder in the Dust is a prime example on how to fail English Comp 101. His run on sentences are dull, unispiring, and two pages long. It's exhausting! If you want to read long sentences, read Kerouac. Ditch Faulkner!!"},{"Title":"Intruder in the dust: A novel","review":"William Faulkner was a peculiar writer. When it came to ordinary literature, he boldly repudiated. His goal in literature remains as obscure as his style of writing. And Intruder in the Dust is a perfect example of what Faulkner was made of.Rooted in the South - in his famous Yoknapatawpha County - Intruder in the Dust is the story of Lucas Beauchamp and the men who toil for his freedom. It's a story that, though complex, is touching and wonderful. A nonconformical work of art that is surreal in language and impressionistic in symbolism.This book will not keep you at the edge of your seat, but it will indeed make you think. There's, of course, some entertainment (for it's the major characteristic of any novel), but the novel is mostly made of stuff to make you think. And I guess that's all that really matters when one reads Faulkner: to think."},{"Title":"Intruder in the dust: A novel","review":"As a sophomore in high school nearly 10 years ago, I had a terrible experience with this book. The plot was confusing and complicated by tough vocabulary and grammar. In the version I had borrowed from the school, the \\"long sentence\\" was (I'm pretty sure) around 7 pages (5x7 size pages).Recently, I tried to pick it up again, convinced by my wife, who had liked reading Faulkner. I found it only slightly easier, with no real improvement. I believe that the problem stems from something that Douglas Adams had once said: \\"I'm trying to be literate, not literary.\\" I get the feeling that Faulkner was trying to create literature as an artform, rather than try to convey his story to the masses.I can appreciate that many people love this story, and that it is a literary masterpiece, but I cannot say that I think it is good."},{"Title":"Intruder in the dust: A novel","review":"I have a Literature exam tomorrow - kind of a final- and this is one of the books included. I never got past chapter 2 but I really wish I had! I just couldn't keep up with it but I'm pretty sure that if I understood what I was reading I would have enjoyed it very much. The sentences are extremely long and by the time you get to the end of one, you don't even know what you read. I think that Faulkner's &quot;stream of conciousness&quot; writing is very interesting - you need to read it as if you were having a conversation with Faulker and he's telling you the story and he's jumping all over the place. I SHOULD TAKE MY OWN ADVICE...BUT ANYWAY GIVE IT A CHANCE!"},{"Title":"Intruder in the dust: A novel","review":"My 14 y/o daughter was given this title as a summary reading assignment for freshman English.

This book is INCOMPREHENSIBLE and I couldn't get past the first 5 pages much less understand what I actually read.Trying to read this book is like trying to read a book while the lights go on and off, being sprayed with water, while your chair spins around and around with someone screaming obscenities in your ear. It's not worth the effort or time.There is a reason for &quot;rules&quot; in writing, speech, etc. that have evolved over a million years. Human beings are only capable of grasping 3-5 &quot;chunks&quot; of information at a time.

The mystery and plot could have been greatly enthralling if I hadn't spent so much time trying to unwind Faulkner's sentences. Not only were the sentences long and complex, there were so many rambling thoughts between the action that I missed the thought and the action. I think Faulkner had a profound statement to say about social injustice and the South's part, but he certainly didn't say it in any way I could have understood it."},{"Title":"Intruder in the dust: A novel","review":"\\"Intruder in the Dust\\" wraps a fine mystery around and through a story that could only happen in Faulkner country, yet is a timeless monument to man's stubbornness, stupidity and honor. Mr. Faulkner enfolds his prose around you like kudzu and makes you part of his world.In a small Mississippi town in 1948, black Lucas Beauchamp is wrongfully arrested for shooting white Vinson Cowrie in the back. Sixteen-year old Charles Mallison owes Lucas a debt of honor incurred four years ago. Lucas hires Charles' cynical uncle, Gavin Stevens, to defend him. The most pressing matter is not Lucas' guilt or innocence; it is keeping him from getting lynched before he is arraigned. Lucas is a nightmare of a client. He is stubborn, stiff necked and proud. He dresses like an old time plantation owner and neither owes nor accepts favors from anyone. Uncle Gavin is trying to save Lucas' neck while Charles is trying to clear him. Gavin laments that Lucas would be easier to keep alive if \\"he would just ACT like a n----r.\\" This Lucas refuses to do. There is body snatching, graveyards at night and some thoroughly frightening characters to liven up the journey.Another reviewer mentioned \\"drunk on his prose,\\" and it is a very apt description. It works best if read aloud; you will find Faulkner's rhythm and make it your own. The long sentences don't trouble if you just let his prose carry you along. Mr. Faulkner thinks any southern woman over 35 years old is a secret Amazon of quiet strength and fortitude, which makes for interesting characters, but is a little hard on credibility. There is long section on how \\"outsiders\\" (read \\"Northerners\\") have interfered and thereby delayed integration. However true or false this may be, it slowed the story down and seemed tacked on.\\"Intruder in the Dust\\" is not generally ranked with \\"premier\\" Faulkner (\\"Light in August,\\" \\"Absalom, Absalom!\\"), but it stands on its own as a fine read and certainly is one of his best post-WWII books.-sweetmolly-Amazon Reviewer"},{"Title":"Intruder in the dust: A novel","review":"No it's not one of Faulkner's &quot;big four&quot; (the classics &quot;The Sound and the Fury,&quot; &quot;As I Lay Dying,&quot; &quot;Light in August&quot; and &quot;Absalom! Absalom!&quot;), but &quot;Intruder in the Dust&quot; is certainly in his next tier of top novels, and is the one book that can fly in the face of the &quot;he never wrote anything great after World War II&quot; way of thinking. I enjoyed this book immensely. Yes, the sentences tend to be extremely long and the book is slow to get going, but find Faulkner's rhythm and stick with the story; you'll be glad you did. As always, the highlight is Faulkner's beautiful use of language, which always towers over whatever story he's writing and whatever flaws you may stumble upon along the way. This story of a black man wrongly accused of murder doesn't always go where you think it will or even where you want it to, but somehow it works brilliantly. Faulkner throws in his take (apparently) on how the South should handle civil rights on its own -- not really necessary to include and a small flaw in the book, I think. But stick with it, get drunk on the prose and enjoy an underappreciated work from a master. This relatively short book will be over too soon."},{"Title":"Intruder in the dust: A novel","review":"After twenty years of writing experimental fiction and Hollywood screenplays, Faulkner seemed destined to create a novel like \\"Intruder in the Dust\\"--a noir-ish mystery set in Yoknapatawpha County, Mississippi, that incorporates his signature prose style into a continuing commentary on race relations in the South. The premise of the accusation of a black man for the murder of a white man may seem too facile, but the novel does not rely solely or even primarily on plot-driven intrigue; it is the criminal aspect only as it relates to the prevalent social attitudes that generates interest.One day a local white man named Vinson Gowrie is found shot to death, and a black man named Lucas Beauchamp is arrested at the scene and charged with the murder. In this part of the country at this time in history, a black man who is even suspected of murdering a white man is in danger of being lynched, especially by people like Gowrie's relatives, who are from a particularly rough and bloodthirsty enclave living in an area called Beat Four.The story is told in the third person but from the viewpoint of a white boy named Charles \\"Chick\\" Mallison, who in the past has tried to befriend the solitary but kind Beauchamp and is convinced of his innocence. With the help of his uncle Gavin Stevens, a lawyer who decides to represent Beauchamp, his black friend Aleck Sander, and an elderly spinster named Miss Habersham, Chick investigates the matter and discovers, unsurprisingly, that there is more to the case than initially meets the eye.This sounds like generic pulp detective stuff, and indeed there is not much to say about the plot except that it involves a lumber scam, quicksand, a false grave, and a real culprit who is not too bright; but what makes this novel worth reading is the insight it gives about how easily in this milieu a black man can conveniently take the heat for a white man's crime, regardless of provability of guilt, and the ethical implications that arise from this situation. There is a particular manner in which the characters communicate with each other that reveals this information, conveying Faulkner's sublime sense of the range of personal moralities.Faulkner has several narrative modes at his disposal, and the one he chooses here is similar to that of \\"Absalom! Absalom!\\", employing impossibly long and syntactically deformed run-on sentences that compress copious visual detail into quickly moving scenic impressions. This technique could annoy many, but for those who know how to \\"read\\" Faulkner, it may be accepted as a characteristic part of the package. I'd place \\"Intruder in the Dust\\" somewhat below \\"Sanctuary\\" as an aesthetic achievement, but I still commend it as satisfying, like that tasty last bit of dessert after a full meal."},{"Title":"Intruder in the dust: A novel","review":"This novel has a traditional detective story plot and a conventional attitude about race relations (although it was progressive for the South in the late 40s). After that, all bets are off. The style is like a thicket, but that's because Faulkner puts you into the head of a confused boy caught up in events beyond his control. Chick Mallison is white, and his friend Aleck Sander is black (Aleck Sander doesn't know his name isn't two words, because he can't read or write). The paired adult characters of equivalent race are Chick's uncle, Gavin Stevens, a lawyer, who defends Lucas Beauchamp (pronounced \\"Beecham\\"), a black tenant farmer accused of a murder he didn't commit by the people who did it. They know that in a prejudiced society, white people are likely to believe a black man is guilty, so they try to palm it off on him. Lucas is a rather severe character who often doesn't seem to appreciate the help he's getting (part of the plot involves trying to prevent the citizens from pulling him out of jail and lynching him), but he's a marvelous character and something of a father figure to Chick by the end of the book. Reading the book is a bit of a chore at first, but I got through it in high school years ago, and am reading it now for the third time. If you want some help getting into the book, you might try a \\"Masterplots\\" description of it or a reader's guide to Faulkner (there are several around). You might also look for the 1949 film based on the book, which was filmed in Faulkner's home town of Oxford, Mississippi, with local citizens as extras, and with the great Juano Hernandez playing Lucas."},{"Title":"Intruder in the dust: A novel","review":"I am in 11th grade, and my hackles naturally went up upon reading the several reviews written by high schoolers on the subject of this novel. Do not be put off by such efforts to defile a masterpiece. This is one of the most profound and convincing novels I have ever read.Tolstoy once wrote that the success of any work of art depends ultimately upon the artist's maintaining an \\"independent moral relation\\" to his subject, and that he who does not bring to his work a fresh and enlightened view of the universe will invariably fail in attempting to create good art. Applying this criterion to Intruder in the Dust, Faulkner's novel stands as a paradigm of great art; for its moral scope and philosophical perspective are singularly awesome. Faulkner is simultaneously sympathetic toward and critical of that Southern society which serves as his subject, and yet he manages never to stoop to petty preaching or outright sermonizing. His work is a marvel of artistic delicacy and intensity. Bravo."},{"Title":"Intruder in the dust: A novel","review":"Those who follow the AP Book of Rules for writing (i.e., subject, predicate, no commas, no decora) will have a tough time negotiating Faulkner's peregrinating sentences, but it's worth it. This book delivers several experiences at one time: a look at the Southern social codes, a textured appraisal of racial relations, an adolescent's step off into adult life, and an entertaining murder mystery. The lead characters are nicely drawn, with surprises; the action and crowd scenes are portrayed in easily visualized imagery. For all the Southern writing I've read, this added more information about the culture and people. I feel sorry for those who don't have the patience for Faulkner's style: a taste for it isn't that difficult to acquire and it's well worth it."},{"Title":"Intruder in the dust: A novel","review":"This novel is not only a supervivid representation of the ugly and cowardly side of racism, but also one of the best coming of age stories I've ever read. Funny as well as emotional detail, and between the lines, Faulkner explores and displays in all their glory and infamy the connections between families, friends, strangers, and enemies, to a point further than others are brave enough to go."},{"Title":"Intruder in the dust: A novel","review":"... the \\"owner\\" of which was a man who said \\"mister\\" to whites, but did not really mean it. The meal was served to 12 year old Charles Mallison, after he had fallen in an icy pond, and the server, who didn't mean mister, was Lucas Beauchamp. Four years later the \\"bill\\" for those collard greens would come due, and it would be Mallison's actions that would save Beauchamp's life. \\"Intruder in the Dust\\" is one of Faulkner's later works, written just after World War II. The perennial themes of his works are exhibited: his examination of life in barely fictional Yoknapatawpha County, whose county seat is Jefferson, (Oxford, MS) and the continued fall-out from America's \\"original sin,\\" slavery. From Faulkner's majestically southern mansion of Rowan Oaks, he wrote in fear of the \\"white trash\\" that surrounded him, so often identified as the Snopes family, but in this novel they are transformed into the Gowries, from \\"Beat Four.\\" Faulkner's stream-of-consciousness style always challenges the reader to stay engaged, or a vital clue to the story will be missed. And like those slower internet connections, he \\"backs and fills\\" his pixels, slowly revealing the entire story. This is also an excellent \\"mystery\\" novel; the particular situations involving the grave seem \\"impossible,\\" but Faulkner makes it all so understandable, masterfully so, in the fullness of time. Faulkner is certainly not for the \\"fun read\\" crowd, nor, apparently, based on the reviews posted here, for sophomores in \\"Advanced Placement\\" English. I shutter at the thought of how many students have become confirmed non-readers of serious books for the rest of their lives as a result of such classes.I am an immense fan of Faulkner, and still hope to read or re-read all his works. This time it was a re-read, after 35 or so years, and fortunately, even the first time was not a dreaded school assignment. There remain the wonderful, original descriptive passages that contain nuggets like: \\"...and forlorn across the long peaceful creep of late afternoon, into the mauve windless dome of dusk...\\" and \\"...if there were only some way to efface the clumsy room-devouring carcasses which can be done but the memory which cannot.\\" But on the re-read I noticed Faulkner's \\"feet of clay.\\" In referring to a patched roof, how much meaning is conveyed by \\"insolent promptitude,\\" or a lathe's \\"ineluctable shaft,\\" or \\"incredulous disbelief\\"?But the real \\"feet of clay\\" are political, and there is a three page defense of the South's \\"go slow\\" policy for granting Blacks equal rights. The passage doesn't work in a literary sense, in that it plops, \\"cut and pasted,\\" interrupting the dramatic tension of an enthralling mystery. Consider: \\"...only we (meaning white Southerners) must do it, and we alone without help or interference or even (thank you) advice since only we can if Lucas's equality is to be anything more than its own prisoner inside an impregnable barricade of the direct heirs of the victory of 1861-1865...\\" James Baldwin, in \\"Nobody Knows My Name,\\" in his chapter entitled \\"Faulkner and Desegregation,\\" offers the seminal critique of such an attitude: \\"After more than two hundred years in slavery and ninety years of quasi-freedom, it is hard to think very highly of William Faulkner's advice to \`go slow.' \`They don't mean go slow,' Thurgood Marshall is reported to have said, \`they mean don't go.'\\"Upon the re-read I was also struck by how derivative Harper Lee's classic book,To Kill a Mockingbirdis, down to the two different men, both sitting in the doorway of the jailhouse, to prevent a lynching, as well as even the mockingbird! It is a point another reviewer made, but I had never realized it before, nor seen it in a critique of Lee's work.Faulkner may be most associated with black-white relations, but he also has something to say about male-female relations. Consider: \\"...just enough dirt to hide the body temporarily from sight with something of that frantic desperation of the wife flinging her peignoir over the lover's forgotten glove...\\" or \\"I am fifty-plus years old,' his uncle said. \`I spent the middle fifteen of them fumbling beneath skirts. My experience was that few of them were interested in love or sex either. They wanted to be married.'\\"It pains me to knock a star from a Nobel-prize winning \\"idol,\\" but the \\"feet of clay\\" are most certainly there."},{"Title":"Intruder in the dust: A novel","review":"Probably one of the most intense books I've ever read -- well worth the effort.

However, as Faulkner got further entrenched in his stream of consciousness technique and he continued to reiterate the significance of the events on what essentailly is a 24-36 hour period, I began to come to the conclusion that this must have started off as a short story and was extended strictly to satisfy elements of style and to send a message to the rest of the country (let The South solve its own Civil Rights problem). I have previously successfully navigated the stream of consciousness style in such books as Absalom Absalom! and found that in the retelling of a 50 year saga it was very effective. Here however, it seems to get in the way and serves only to extend a basic (but interesting) storyline from an evening read, to an extended read. I recommend it for the Faulkner fan since it was one of his rare commercial successes, but the Faulkner novice may be better off with easier books such as The Unvanquished or even for that matter Light in August."},{"Title":"Intruder in the dust: A novel","review":"This novel is, in form, a thriller with a classic thriller plot- the fight to prove the innocence of a man accused of a crime he did not commit. (Alfred Hitchcock used this plot in a number of his films, and \\"Intruder in the Dust\\" was itself made into a very good film by Clarence Brown in 1949, only a year after its publication). Faulkner takes this basic plot and uses it to explore the problem of racism in America's Deep South; Harper Lee was later to take a similar plot, and use it for a similar purpose, in \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\".The book is set in Faulkner's fictional Yoknapatawpha County and its capital, Jefferson, based upon the real Lafayette County and Faulkner's own home town of Oxford. The innocent man wrongly accused is Lucas Beauchamp, an elderly, widowed black farmer. Although Beauchamp is honest and respectable, he is resented by many whites because he refuses to \\"behave like a nigger\\", that is to say behave in a servile manner. When a white man named Vinson Gowrie is shot dead, Beauchamp is accused of the crime. Gowrie was from Beat Four, a wild, hilly district of the county, whose white inhabitants are noted for their lawless ways and their ingrained prejudices against blacks. A mob, mostly members of Gowrie's extended family, gathers in Jefferson, threatening to break into the jail and lynch Beauchamp.The story is told through the eyes of Charles Mallison, the sixteen-year-old nephew of Gavin Stevens, the relatively liberal white lawyer who acts for Beauchamp. Charles, who regards himself as being in Beauchamp's debt ever since, four years earlier, the old man rescued him after he fell in a stream, sets out to prove that Beauchamp did not fire the fatal shot. Together with his black friend Aleck and Miss Habersham, an elderly spinster (did Faulkner derive her name from Dickens' Miss Havisham?) he makes the dangerous body to Beat Four to exhume the body of the murdered man- and makes a surprising discovery.Racial issues play an important part in Faulkner's work; indeed, it would probably be difficult for any Southern writer to avoid them altogether. His own views on the topic, however, seem to have been rather mixed. On the one hand he was an anti-racist, regarding the intolerant prejudice of many white Southerners as an affront to both decency and rationality. On the other hand, he was himself a proud Southerner, conscious of his family's Confederate heritage; his great-grandfather, Colonel William Falkner (thus spelt), had been a Confederate hero in the Civil War. In this novel Faulkner himself seems to adopt what might be called a neo-Confederate position, believing that, if the South could not be an independent, sovereign state it should at least form a culturally autonomous unit within the USA and have the right to deal with its own problems without interference from the North. He devotes several pages of the novel to his thesis that attempts by outsiders to combat racism in the south had actually been counter-productive and that black Southerners would never achieve equality until white Southerners were allowed to address the issue on their own terms.The novel was written in the late forties, before the rise of the Civil Rights movement, and I think that Faulkner was wrong about race. The large-scale exodus of rural Southern blacks to Northern industrial cities in the first half of the twentieth century meant that race relations could no longer (if indeed they ever could) be thought of as solely a Southern issue. Since 1948 race relations in America have seen an immense change for the better; as I write this in October 2008 it seems quite likely that next month Barack Obama will not only be elected America's first black President but will also carry several Southern states. This change would not have been possible without the Civil Rights movement and the active involvement of Northerners, both black and white, and of the institutions of the Federal government.Despite my disagreements with him, I nevertheless found Faulkner's analysis of the South's racial problems a stimulating and thought-provoking one. The characters are, for the most part, memorable and powerfully drawn. I did not, however, altogether enjoy this book, largely because of the eccentricities of the prose style that the author adopts here, a prose style characterised by long, rambling (and often syntactically disorganised) sentences, sometimes extending over several pages. He also has a weakness for obscure vocabulary items.Faulkner was, presumably, aiming at the sort of stream-of-consciousness style he had used to good effect in other, better, novels, such as \\"As I Lay Dying\\". This style can be a valuable tool for showing us the world through the eyes of a fictional character or, in the case of \\"As I Lay Dying\\" which uses first-person multiple-narrator technique, through the eyes of a string of different characters. When stream-of-consciousness is used to represent the writer's own authorial voice, it becomes much less effective. \\"Intruder in the Dust\\" is a third-person narrative, and, although Charles is the central character, we are not always certain if it is his voice we are hearing, or the author's. The effect is less stream-of-consciousness than stream-of-confusion. As a result of this uncertainty, and of his often impenetrable syntax, the author's train of thought is in places difficult to follow, which means that, despite its interesting themes, \\"Intruder in the Dust\\" is not as effective a book as it could have been."},{"Title":"Intruder in the dust: A novel","review":"I had been looking for William Faulkner's \\"Intruder in the Dust\\", because I wanted to have Charlie Mallison's quote about Pickett's Charge on file.The copy sent to me was hard cover, 16th printing of the first edition, in excellent shape, and meets my requirements in every way.I am totally satisfied."},{"Title":"Intruder in the dust: A novel","review":"he purposely made the sentences long like that for a reason. through his style, he was trying to show you the mindset of people in the South after World War 2.

Few beginning readers should be turned loose on their own to cut their literary teeth on this author, however."},{"Title":"Intruder in the dust: A novel","review":"We are in the South, in a rural city and area. A crime is committed, a white man is shot dead and an old black man is arrested for it on Saturday night, red-handed, because he was next to the dead shot body with a gun in his pocket. This black man has had a past of refusing samboism. He always behaved in a non standard way for a black man in the South. No question is asked. A lawyer is called by the black man and the lawyer does not ask questions and assumes the black man is guilty of the crime he is accused of committing. It will take a white teenager (16 and the lawyer's nephew), a black teenager (his friend) and a white older lady with a truck to accept to go and explore the grave of the dead man on the request of the black man. They find out the man in the grave is not the man it should be, but is another assassinated white man. And then the plot thickens tremendously because these three people plus the lawyer will manage to take over and convince the sheriff to go investigate this tomb with them. The father and two sons of the victim have been summoned by the sheriff. The two sons will dig out the grave and find it empty. Then they all manage to find the body the teenagers and the woman had found more or less carelessly hidden in some sand and the body of the first assassinated person in a patch of quicksand. The black man is definitely saved. The criminal will be found out to be a fourth son of the old man, a brother of the victim himself because the murdering brother was cheating some wood out of a forest patch that was being cut down and sawn into boards to be sold later on, at a profit of course, from the assassinated brother with an accomplice, the second man who was killed two days later and hidden in the assassinated brother's tomb. This murdering brother will be forced to commit suicide in jail for the white community not to have a trial, not to have to hang a white man for the killing of two white men while at first a black man had been accused and had by pure chance escaped a lynching. But the book is interesting for a lot more than this murder plot. It is no thriller because we nearly know from the very start that the lynching will not happen. The interest of the book is in the narrator who looks at the situation and events through the sole eyes of the lawyer's nephew that is always referred to as \\"he\\", third person singular, and never with a name. This awkward narration creates a distanciation in the fictional voyeurism of the book that kind of keeps us active and alert. The second interest is in the long speeches and explanations the lawyer delivers to his nephew in order to initiate him to adulthood. The discourse is a general speculation about racism, samboism, the liberation of black people or rather of the South from this samboism and racism, how it can only happen from inside and not from outside, the reaction of the whites in front of this accused black and the possibility or impossibility of a lynching, etc. It is a close examination of the racial conscience of the South, and not only the whites, but also the blacks. The third interest is in the initiation of this young teenager that goes far beyond only understanding the southern mind, the southern past and future, the southern race relations and how to free them from the heritage of slavery and the end of it imposed from outside. It has to do with physical growing and even the sexual or emotional levels of that growing, how some sexual emotion can appear in the strangest of all situations and distort the teenager's vision for a while. Finally it also depicts the complexity and beauty, contradictory confusion and clarity of their mentality and consciousness, or unconsciousness. Faulkner has it all wrong as for how the liberation of the blacks will come, but it does not matter : it represents the vision the whites had at a certain moment in history, in fact between the two world wars. He could not take into account the consequences of WW2 on the mental liberation of the black community and particularly the weight and power northern blacks will find in the war that will make them go down South, if necessary and with white people too eventually, to help their black brothers down South to get on the road to civil liberties. But it is this very historical limitation that makes the novel all the more interesting.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University of Paris Dauphine & University of Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne"},{"Title":"Intruder in the dust: A novel","review":"Thanks to its stream-of-conscious narrative, this book leans more toward the incomprehensible side of Faulkner's canon, despite a simple plot that often feels as if it would have been suited to a short story and was dragged out to fit the necessary length for a full-length book. When you add to that the blatant preachiness and, aside from the inciting event, a predictable storyline, this book ends up being more work than its worth."},{"Title":"Intruder in the dust: A novel","review":"This novel doesn't rank with Faulkner's classic work and there are dozens of reviews here that tell why--but the most basic problem is the difficulty of writing a mystery, a plot-driven story, in prose that is often gibberish."},{"Title":"Intruder in the dust: A novel","review":"My opinion is that this book was overly long and boring. The ideas and the narratives are difficult to understand. Of course, the book is an enticing novel or racism in the south. Of couse what the hell do I know? I am 16 years old."},{"Title":"Intruder in the dust: A novel","review":"Excellent novel about a black man (Lucas Beauchamp) falsely accused of murdering a white man and the boy who believes him and sets out to prove his innocence. On the one hand, it's about sticking to your guns when you know a man is being wronged (&quot;Some things you must always be unable to bear. Some things you must never stop refusing to bear. Injustice and outrage and dishonor and shame. No matter how young you are or how old you have got. Not for kudos and not for cash: your picture in the paper nor money in the bank either. Just refuse to bear them&quot; (p201)). On the other hand, Faulkner goes off a bit at the end about the Civil War (no surprise here) and says that the North stuck to its guns too severely -- that most Southerners believed slavery was wrong but just needed the time to work it all out, not the strongarming into a position weren't ready to assume: &quot;. . .and you [the North] say At least we perish in the name of humanity and we [the South] reply When all is stricken but that nominative pronoun and that verb what price Lucas' humanity then?&quot;(p. 212). God, I love that man. This is a good one to start with if you're a Faulkner rookie -- it's pretty short and doesn't do any flipping around in time.As for all the comments about how bad Faulkner's grammar is (run-on sentences, no punctuation, etc. etc. ad nauseum), you guys are all forgetting that there are only rules governing these things when you're writing a paper for English Comp. In the real world, manipulating the language is what makes writers great. Say you don't like it, but don't say it's garbage just because it doesn't live up to Strunk and White. Being a critic is cool, being a criticaster is not."},{"Title":"Intruder in the dust: A novel","review":"This is a story about a post-Civil War pre-civil rights southern town that almost gets up the gumption to lynch a falsely accused black man. This is also the coming-of-age story of one Chick Mallison, I think his last name is, who takes the initiative to prove the accused innocent. This is a platform for Faulkner to vent some political views through Chick's uncle, a successful southern lawyer who defends the prisoner. There's nothing really new about any of these themes.Really and truly what makes this book one to be remembered is that somehow Faulkner managed to write in such a way that he captured the way time and thought bend, expand and contract around each other. It would be impossible to give you a taste of this without inserting a quote that's two pages long, but once you get caught up in his long dream-like stream-of-consciousness flows, you almost find yourself jerking back to reality along with Chick when he is moving in and out of a sleep state over his breakfast after a long night of digging up graves and eluding murderers.Faulkner also manages to capture the ambiguous emotions that we all have around the powerful events and people in our lives. No human emotion or action is ever purely black or white; in Chick's case we get to hear all of the inner voices--need for love and approval, order and security; shame, anger, pity, wonder, fear, love--really I could go on and on, but the point is that they are mixed and presented on the page in the way that our emotions are--a constant flow of thoughts and voices, sometimes linked, sometimes random, sometimes contradictory, and often below the surface of our conscious mind.In truth, I have never really read anybody else who writes like this. I read the Sound and the Fury in my early twenties and found it a bit daunting, but now having read As I Lay Dying and Intruder in the Dust (at the age of 34) I think I'd like to give it another read, along with the rest of his works. By the way, for those of you who are struggling with any of Faulkner's works, try picking up a literary bio that explains the order in which he wrote them, where he was in his life, and what he was experimenting with (and I don't mean drugs). I have found all of that info to be enormously helpful and a spur to further reading. Good luck!"},{"Title":"Intruder in the dust: A novel","review":"While not one of Faulkner's classics, this book is a fine introduction to the writer, his myth, his style and his story telling. While it appears on the surface to be a mystery, the book is deeply involved with southern consciousness attempting to deal with its own racial identity and the perceived impossibility of resolving it. Chick Mallison's quote regarding Pickett's Charge is the core of this work. \\"For every Southern boy fourteen years old, not once but whenever he wants it, there is the instant when it's still not yet two o'clock on that July afternoon in 1863...\\" Seems to me that there are still a lot of folks trying to work that out.Faulkner is never easy to read. It is dangerous art, and requires work on the part of the reader. If that is not your cup of tea, stay away. Ignore the one-star reviews written by the impatient people who seem to think that literature should be as easy to read, approachable and safe. If you are willing to do the work, there is great treasure in Yoknapatawpha County.In regards to the one-star review by the gentleman who intercepted the book because his fourteen year old had been asked to read it as a class assignment: yes, there are rules, but the dangerous artists know how to break them and in doing so transcend normal story-telling."},{"Title":"Intruder in the dust: A novel","review":"I had to choose a novel for an independent reading assignment, so of course, being the striver I am, I had to choose an obscure Faulkner novel. I thought the book was excellent. Faulkner's rich prose helped to develop his deeply southern charachters. The culture of the South and it's deeply imbedded morals were brought out through Faulkner's lengthy sentences and gothic elements such as suspense and enhanced senses. The coming of age story of Chick Mallison and several subplots gave the novel many layers with which to envelop the reader. Overall, the novel turned out to be a tough read that was well worth the time."},{"Title":"Intruder in the dust: A novel","review":"Stream of consciousness is not an easy form to read, but it is well worth the effort. This book is actually a mystery, so the ambiguities of the form are appropriate to the story. The language is poetic, very Southern. It reads like a murmur, a drawl. I tried to say it in my Brooklyn accent, and it doesn't work. It takes place in Mississippi in 1948, at the beginning of the civil rights movements in this country and addresses some of the questions raised by the sentiments in Congress at the time, in a very literary way. The characters are three-dimensional and paint a picture of the town: rednecks and middle class, farmers and townspeople, boys and old gentlewomen, deputy sheriffs and lawyers, blacks and whites. You may not agree with Faulkner's musings about the American character and the American destiny, but his thoughts are well worth reading."},{"Title":"Intruder in the dust: A novel","review":"This is not my favorite Faulkner book, but it's not painful. However, it is a really interesting read for anyone familiar with To Kill a Mockingbird as it becomes exceedingly clear that Harper Lee ripped off an enormous amount from this book. Ok, I know, good writers borrow, great writers steal, but beyond the general plot similarity: black man accused of a crime he didn't commit told from a child's point of view saved by a goodly lawyer pillar of the community, there are some unbelievable details as well.For one, there is are two references to the shooting of a mad dog in Intruder, an event used to establish a character in an offhand way. That scene is extended memorably in Mockingbird. Another clincher for me is the closing of chapter X in Intruder where the sheriff is complaining about the racket made by, and I'm not kidding, a mockingbird. The fate of the mockingbird is left undetermined in a singularly Faulkner manner, but the intent to kill is clearly there. Twenty years later, we can assume that the bird is still alive because Harper has taught us it is a sin . . .I'm surprised I don't hear this shouted from the rooftops. It's not exactly Dark Side of the Moon and Oz, but you can't chalk this up to coincidence."},{"Title":"Intruder in the dust: A novel","review":"&#34;Intruder in the Dust&#34; is another of the many faces (or facets) of William Faulkner. It's a fascinating tale of the efforts of two boys (one white, one black) to save the life of a Mississippi black man accused of shooting a white man in the back. The writing includes some of Faulkner's interesting---and to some readers, maddening---techniques of writing, including motives, thoughts, scenes described in the negative (what they are not) and the use of multiple nearly synonymous verbs side by side, as if he couldn't make up his mind which to use. While that may be true, I prefer to see it as his attempt to find the most precise nuance to given actions in which a single word doesn't quite &#34;get it.&#34;"},{"Title":"Intruder in the dust: A novel","review":"Panned by critics and written strictly to make money, I still find the story compelling and Faulkner's treatment of it excellent."},{"Title":"Intruder in the dust: A novel","review":"Although not one of his major novels, Faulkner proves his worth in this unrelenting account of social conditions in the deep South.

I find that's the best way for me to study but this book was a little frustrating to go through at times because of the following reasons:1. Inaccurate answers. Some of the inaccuracies were because of more recent recommendations that have since come out and the book can't be faulted for that. Other mistakes were made because of either poor editing or inconsistent answers. These were frustrating. Some would give the correct answer and in the explanation part tell us another answer was the correct one (poor editing). Some would give different answers to the same topic in different parts of the book (inconsistent). Most of the answers were just fine but these type of mistakes happened often enough to be noticeable.2. Poorly worded questions. Some questions were not that well worded and I think left the door open for multiple interpretations.3. It would have been nice to have a quick blurb at the end of each explanation as to why the incorrect answers were incorrect. This obviously didn't have to occur for every question but it would have been nice for certain ones. For example, it asked which of the tests can be used for the diagnosis of celiac sprue. Answers included Shilling's test (I assumed this was a spelling error and they meant the Schilling Test), String Test, Xylose absorption test, withdrawal of lactose, or scotch tape test. It would have been nice if they included something at the end like - \\"The Schilling Test is used to test for Vitamin B12 malabsorption, etc.\\" or something like that. I would have made the answers that much more useful for studying.4. The last questions are Clinical Problem Set questions, which are no longer on the Boards. The book mentions this and says it includes it since it can still be useful for studying. This might be true but I would have just preferred to have more questions in the other format since I think those are more useful.Most of my complaints (except for the first one) are very minor so I think the book still does a decent job in doing what it sets out to do.

The questions focus on perhaps more obscure topics (or at least more obscure topics within common clinical problems) which is good for review. It also has images (photos, ECGs, radiographs) at the end for those of us who are not radiologists or dermatologists.Though you'll probably score the same on Step 3 as you did on Step 2 and Step 1, this book might help you if you need some reassurance or just want to do some light review."},{"Title":"Family Practice Board Review","review":"Fair amount of questions for review but not as intensive as other books.

Several of the questions on the pre-test do not even have the correct answer as an option. There is an email given for questions and concerns, but it is not a functioning email address, at least not at this point. I thought maybe there was a way to get corrections but there is no way make contact. If corrections become available, the book will be very valuable. Also, the website offered does not exist, at least not yet (it claims it will be up by January 31, 2011). There are many errors, but it is very well written and easy/fun to read, with great coverage of topics on the boards.But it makes me nervous that I might not pick up all the mistakes, and learn some of the wrong things!"},{"Title":"Family Practice Board Review","review":"I used this to study for the recertification exam in the summer of '09. I passed the exam, but I'm not sure how much this book helped. It focused a lot of questions on certain diseases that were not on the exam, and some diseases that were hit multiple times on the exam were never mentioned in the book. Also, like other reviewers have mentioned, there are numerous mistakes and dated practice guidelines in the book. If I had to do it over again, I would try a different book."},{"Title":"Family Practice Board Review","review":"If you're looking for a decent summary of the questions for the exam, forget about this book.It's just a book of questions with very little content covered between the pages. The questions are largely random and all over the place. Some content is even repeated. They do not provide a proper framework for the knowledge you need to pass the exam. In addition, it sports several incorrect answers which definitely demonstrates poor editorial work.A selling point is supposedly access to a online podcast/online questions to help with the exam. First of all, the question bank is comprised of all the questions you have in the book anyway. Secondly, the podcasts ar a bunch of random facts read by a monotonous voice who pronounces a majority of the words wrong. Plus, I fail to see how 5 minute podcasts are going to prepare you for the ABFM exam anyway. Call it extremely wishful thinking.To be honest, the question bank from the American Academy of Family Practice in their CME section had more relevant and current content for studying."},{"Title":"Family Practice Board Review","review":"The back cover states \\"Thoroughly updated for it's Fourth Edition\\". Not true. The only difference between this and the 3rd edition is that the three Clinical Problem sets at the back of the 3rd edition (pages 347-383) have been replaced by a set of additional questions called the Maintenance of Certification Primer (pages 345-375). In the first 345 pages there may be a few questions that have changed between the 2 editions but I haven't found one yet - even chapter 7, the Pictorial Atlas, is unchanged. And I suspect the same will be true for the 4 online practice exams. Bottom line - buy the 3rd edition used for about $2 and save yourself $60. Still, this book is ok for FP boards as is Swanson's."},{"Title":"Family Practice Board Review","review":"This is a good review book and it helped point out some weak areas that I had to do further studying in. One mistake I made was making this text my main part of studying for the boards, I went through some sections several times and was doing fairly well on the practice exams. What I did not realize is that I was starting to recognize the right answers since the questions are used over again for the online banks of questions, so when I took the board exam my score was actually lower than what I was getting on the practice exams for the book. If you are making this the core part of your review and your practice scores from the book are not above 80%, make sure you take some practice tests from other sources to evaluate your knowledge base for the actual board exam. Overall, a solid review book."},{"Title":"Family Practice Board Review","review":"I thought that the book was a great review for the test and saw much of the material on the test. However, the test bank was down the week before my exam which was when I wanted to do the questions. That was very disappointing, but I did the test questions on the AAFP website which were both helpful and provided CME credit as well.Addendum: I just got my scores today, and I rocked the boards! I ended up in the 95th percentile. I also attended a course, but I felt that this book really put me over the top. It was great at some of the esoterica on the boards. My only beef is that I could not gain access to the online questions at all. Mine did not come with a CD, you had to log onto a website with a number provided in the front of the book. The week before my exam the website was down completely. I ended up not needing it, but it did stress me out right before the boards.

As such, I had very high expectations and unfortunately these expectations were not met. I am taking the boards for the first time and can not speak to how these questions compare in regards to difficulty, but they seem a bit too easy at times. My main complaint is the amount of spelling errors and answers that were contradicted in the following questions. There was even an answer that did not have to do at all with the question so I had to look up the correct answer using another source. There were also multiple questions throughout the book that were identical; not just similar, but they were obviously copied and pasted to another section. These issues were very frustrating to me. It may just work out well and help my score...that's to be determined. I purchased the book new for $80 and am thinking I did not get my money's worth."},{"Title":"Family Practice Board Review","review":"I used the book for my Family Practice Boards in 2008 and did better than before.

Medicine changes rapidly so this is not acceptable for me.

In good order Elaine and Peter use discriptive pictures that wisk you into action, instead of lengthy paragraphs and tired eyes."},{"Title":"Illustrator 9 for Windows & Macintosh","review":"I learned long ago that the Visual Quick Start books are better as a reference tool than as a tutorial bookl; this book is no different. At 488 pages, it is about twice as thick as the usual Quick Start Guides. This should also give you an indication to the large amount of content the authors put into it.I bought the book to use as a study aide for taking my ACE Exam in Illustrator. It was not very helpful for this. I wasn't totally disappointed however. It is a great book for when I am actively using Illustrator and need to remember some activity that I don't do too often and need to look it up. Think of it like a giant list of organized directions for doing things in Illustrator. As this kind of reference, it is quite useful.In order of (chapter)number, the authors cover: Interface (1), How Illustrator Works (2), Startup (3), Views (4), Objects Basics (5), Select/Copy (6), Transform (7), Reshape (8), Fill &amp; Stroke (9), Pen (10), Layers (11), Create Type (12), Style &amp; Edit Type (13), Acquire (14), Brushes (15), Combine Paths (16), Gradients (17), Appearances (18), Masks/Transparency (19), Filters (20), Precision Tools (21), Actions (22), Preferences (23), Output/Export (24), Separations (25) and Web (26).If you are a beginner, buy something else like Deke McClelland's Real World Illustrator 9. Once you get grounded, buy this as a reference tool when you are trying to remember how to do a particular task. If you are studying for your ACE Exam, buy both Deke's book and the Adobe Classroom in a Book for Illustrator 9."},{"Title":"Illustrator 9 for Windows & Macintosh","review":"Elaine and Peter are career authors. They obviously don't use the products they write about, and this book is no exception. It is lacking in common sense, good advice, and practical tips and techniques. This series tends to be quite good overall, but the authors' obvious unfamiliarity with the product they are writing about shines through vividly.If that weren't bad enough, many of the examples are poor quality and look bitmapped! In a vector book! Shame!"},{"Title":"Illustrator 9 for Windows & Macintosh","review":"I like this book - it's very comprehensive and helpful. In contrast, books such as the Illustrator 9 Bible couldn't hold my interest: too much time was spent in the first four chapters describing processes, rather than *showing* them with more practice examples and screen shots (as this book does).In the Illustrator 9 Bible, there was some rather annoying fluff such as the jokey conversation transcripts - and one of the earliest chapters dealt with creating *graphs*, of all things, in Illustrator. By the time I had gotten to Chapter 4 I knew I needed a Visual Quickstart (VQS) Guide.In short, I don't know why this VQS book is getting such a bad rap. I'm surprised that other reviewers rated this book so poorly. I've gotten through 17 chapters already during the past few weekends and am proud of my level of progress. With this book, I feel I am learning Illustrator well enough to pass the Brainbench certification exam (when the exam for version 9 becomes available).I didn't encounter any mistakes (except for a minor one) while following practice examples. Occasionally, one minor thing or another wouldn't work, but then I was able to either figure out a way around it or overlook that.

If right now I want to know how to put type in a circle then that's ALL I want to know and I want to find it very fast. This book does that job for me.

After reading and studying all the chapters in the first part, I discovered that I didn't know much more than when I started. How utterly disappointing.I evenutally learned to use and love Illustrator, but not because of the book, but because of using Illustrator for 5 months at work! To say it quite simply, the book is TERRIBLE for the actual content and examples. Furthermore, the majority of steps towards the end of the book not only had some errors in the processes but they didn't even come close to the actual way Illustrator works. Also, the book seems to have been made directly from the previous version (I saw a copy at the bookstar nearby)! For the price you pay for this book, it's not worth it, but then again, you get Illustrator online help for free!I bought this book with the intention of getting a feel for what Illustrator was about, but I was wrong.All-in-all, I don't recommend this book if you plan on using Illustrator for anything more than text on a path."},{"Title":"Illustrator 9 for Windows & Macintosh","review":"After picking up this book and trying to follow along, I found that there were several innaccuracies in the steps.

But that's mostly what this book gives - highlights with not nearly enough description, details, or explanations. It's not that you'd waste your time reading the book (you can finish it in about an hour), but you might not feel you got your money's worth. You might want to try &quot;School as a Journey&quot; by Torin Fisner (about the same cost but nearly 3x the length!) which gives outstanding detail (including actual stories and poems told in class) and theories behind classroom instruction when he shares his teaching experience of his own Waldorf Classroom from Grade 1 through Grade 8.Bottom line - if you want a light introduction to Waldorf Kindergarten, this book is fine. But if you love details with the how's and why's, you'll be disappointed."},{"Title":"Work and Play in Early Childhood","review":"I read this short (78 pg.) and easy to read book to learn more about Waldorf education in general, specifically, the Kindergarten years (ages 3-7). This book begins with Rudolf Steiner's view of child development from birth through age 7. Not much explanation is given, sometimes just one or two sentences to give a reason for why something is done a certain way. The author quotes Steiner a few times but I felt there was not quite enough information given and I feel some of the theories behind the actions are a little wacky and go against proven science and biology. For example, Steiner is quoted as saying the internal organs are not shaped fully until age 7 and that every exposure to external environment (parents, school, TV, radio) affects and shapes the internal organs. I learned that Waldorf schools' Kindergarten is a mix of ages 3-7. An outline of what activities are done throughout the day is covered, story time with fairy tales, song time, outdoor play and games, etc., with explanations as to why those activities are done and why they are done in a certain order. Extremely briefly described is that Waldorf schools celebrate many different seasonal festivals and Christian festivals throughout the year, and are repeated every single year. Very brief mentioning of the different drawing with beeswax crayons, painting with watercolors, using very crude/not very formed toys out of natural materials (and why), knitting, embroidery, and woodworking. Explanation that the children are introduced to work such as cleaning, washing cloths with a washboard, and ironing. Also discussed is the general tone and environment of the class which is described as a &quot;protective mantle&quot;. I was disappointed that the topics were covered very briefly; I would have liked more detail. Seems like a big price for such a small and short book but it did give me a brief introduction to what the Waldorf Kindergarten schools are all about (no mentioning of what goes on in higher grades is written about here). I was left with wanting to know still more before I decide if Waldorf education is something that I want for my children. Currently I plan to homeschool and this book didn't give me much information on how to incorporate Waldorf principals into homeschooling, I guess I'll have to read &quot;Waldorf without Walls&quot; for that information. Lastly, I'd like to say I like the general activities that the children do in Kindergarten but just don't know if I agree with or know enough about Steiner's reasoning behind them, I will have to do more reading about Steiners' views before I can form that opinion."},{"Title":"Work and Play in Early Childhood","review":"As the other reviewers mentioned this is not the deep introduction to Waldorf Education parents might be looking for. But I consider it required reading for my assistants and co-teachers. Freyja Jaffke has an elegant way of describing the work that the teachers and children are doing. It is a constant inspiration to me, and I've had to replace my own book many times because I keep giving it away!If you are a teacher, this book is for YOU! Don't pass it up."},{"Title":"Practical Course in Esperanto","review":"I've been an esperantist for more than 20 years and a teacher of modern languages for a lot longer than that. Thisbook is the best direct language book I've seen in any language.I have only three problems with it. While I know enough about Szilagyi to know he wasn't a bigot, the 1930's style ethnic humor used in two or three places in the book could definitely give offense today. The second is that the grammar notes and pronounciation guides are modest. The other is that the reading material in the back of the book is skimpy and, again, dated. If anyone ever had the desire to issue a text book of Esperanto they could do a lot worse than to update this one.If you're interested in Esperanto you can find an amazing amount on the web. Just type Esperanto into your search engine and you'll see it is far from a dead language."},{"Title":"The Good Priest's Son","review":"In THE GOOD PRIEST'S SON, Reynolds Price continues a theme that runs throughout his recent fiction: redemption based on some sort of repentance-- perhaps having to do with black characters-- by a middle-aged white sinner, usually male, i.e., prodigal son, whose roots are in North Carolina. The character here is Mabry Kincaid, who at 53 is staring down the barrel of a gun-- he is awaiting further tests to determine if he is in the early stages of multiple sclerosis. A restorer of old paintings, he is on a flight back to the United States from Paris when the twin towers of the World Trade Center are hit by the terrorists on September 11, 2001, and his plane is diverted to Nova Scotia. He then returns to his old home in North Carolina to visit his ailing father, a retired Episcopal priest whose live-in housekeeper is Audrey Thornton, an African American doctoral student in divinity at Duke University. She is also the mother of Marcus, a 19-year-old who has fathered at child at 17 with his cousin and has hopes of becoming a successful artist one day.The earmarks of Price's recent fiction are all here. A middle-aged Caucasian male apparently has just discovered that African Americans might be his equal. I suppose Mr. Price is to be commended for finally writing about sympathetic black characters. Both white Southern writers and readers certainly had to get to this place although other Southern artists were way ahead of Mr. Price. Carson Mccullers who over 60 years ago created memorable, decent black people in THE HEART IS A LONELY HUNTER as well as William Styron in THE CONFESSIONS OF NAT TURNER come to mind, just to name two. Mabry does much soul-searching and opines frequently about the cosmos. Some of his findings: men are base; men love nobody; men are sexually promiscuous; women are better; men have no friends; black people are better than white people, all other things being equal. Perhaps America on 9/11 was being paid back in part because of slavery. The contrast between whatever Mr. Price would call the North Carolina he writes about, whether rural or small town, and the rest of America. Then there is the religious overlay. The characters are usually pretty much main-line Protestant with a quirk here or there. Mabry, who has some residual religious feelings but not too many, is mildly repentant of his past life. He had many affairs while married but did see his wife through her final illness.Whether you care for Mr. Price's story or not, he certainly can spin one and obviously knows his territory. Remember when folks put peanuts in their Cokes and ceiling lights were often turned on with a string suspended from the bare bulb? What man hasn't checked, for instance, to make sure his pants are zipped up before he enters a room? And most of us have acquaintances we only regard as \\"Christmas card\\" friends.Price's characters sometimes stretch credibility. Some for instances: Mabry, who describes himself as not having one \\"gay gene\\" when the Australian Man Friday for a gay attorney who most assuredly was killed in he World Trade Center, thinks Mabry is making a pass at him, apparently has been totally comfortable from day one that his daughter is lesbian and is living with another woman. He is 53 and totally okay with that? Maybe. And, of course, the author's insistence on making saints out of his black characters although he does not go quite as overboard here as in his last novel, if I remember correctly. Marcus does have a child he's not supporting but then he's only 19. (There is a strange exchange between Marcus and Mabry when each person is to tell the other one \\"sixty seconds' worth of some private business that eats him up\\" They both relate stories of sexual excess. I suppose that shows that both black men and white men are roosters and equally red-blooded, equally decadent.) Finally, without giving away the ending, I'll point out that the priest's housekeeper has only worked for him for a month.As always Mr. Price's language is beautiful. I just wish I liked these characters more, particularly Mabry."},{"Title":"The Good Priest's Son","review":"to start with,i'll admit i am more than a little prejudiced when it comes to the very talanted mr. reynolds price. his books as well as his characters are always compelling and are much anticipated by me, considering i read very few modern authors.what i like most of price's characters is though they are flawed,they have an obtainable redemption that they seem to either be chasing, or is chasing them. in this novel the character mabry is no exception. mabry is a man who is spending his time chasing the living ghosts who have comprised his life, and is coming to terms with each of them, but not always in the way he intends.this book is very well written, but as always when you read a novel by price, you also have to kind of breathe in the words as you go along, because as an author, mr. price has more to be said in his prose than most writers say. that is where the beauty of price's writings really shine.this book however moves very slowly, and i have seen a few reviews complaining about that. i believe the pacing in this book gives it a more meaningful quality. i believe that it is not just a book, but another fine piece of craftmanship that needs to be read by a large audience, like all of his works. for price is not only a fine novelist, but also a poet, commentator, religious scholar, essayist and playwrite."},{"Title":"The Good Priest's Son","review":"Having some familiarity with the Episcopal Church, with the life and character of priests, and with the work of Reynolds Price (much admired by me in the past), I took up this novel with great interest and high expectations.I was sorely disappointed. Mr Price seems remarkably unfamiliar with Episcopal theology and practices--for example, when he's discussing Communion (Episcopalians believe in the Real Presence but don't confuse it with transubstantiation; they don't talk about \\"pouring\\" communion) and even the benefits of the Church Pension Fund. And where were this priest's bishop and other clergy?More importantly, the characters' speech is about the worst I've ever read. It's stilted, phoney, and completely unrealistic. Moreover, all the characters AND the narrator sound the same. And this novel takes Political Correctness to an absurd extreme. The main character, Mabry, not only speaks in a way that's at odds with how a 53-year-old white heterosexual male would talk; he's also one of the least-interesting, in fact off-putting characters in recent fiction. The only appealing character, Audrey (misprinted as Aubrey at one point), is sketched in two dimensions.This book seems hurriedly written. The review above is correct when it says that \\"the major plot elements do not coalesce into a strong, single story.\\" That's for sure. I am not even sure that this piece, as composed, would have made a good short story; maybe."},{"Title":"The Good Priest's Son","review":"A thoughtful perspective on America immediately post 911. If you enjoy Reynolds' other work, this is definitely worth reading."},{"Title":"The Good Priest's Son","review":"This book is a gem. Southern fiction at its best. Price is a master at the art of story telling. History will regard Price as one of the finest, if not THE finest, southern writer of our times. Don't be misled to think this book is all about Sept. 11th, however. That is merely the setting for this master's tale."},{"Title":"Anna of the Five Towns (Modern Classics)","review":"Described by the prolific author as &quot;my serious novel,&quot; _Anna_ is the story of a young woman's struggles to free herself from the oppression of her domineering father. The title character is given a chance to live undreamed-of experiences when she inherits a fortune in properties and business ventures on her 21st birthday. Simultaneously, she finds herself the declared object of affection of one of the town's most desirable men. As her story unfolds, she is attracted to another man, more vulnerable, and must try to resolve many different demands on her sense of duty and her emotions.Set in the early 1900's, Bennett succeeds in evoking a strong sense of place with his fictionalized Five Towns of the Staffordshire Potteries. Critics have praised his full description of Methodism and Methodist church life of the time, as well. Bennett conveys sympathy for his protagonist and portrays the limitations placed on her for her gender without falling into condescension, concluding, &quot;She had sucked in with her mother's milk the profound truth that a woman's life is always a renunciation, greater or less.&quot;Anna's attempts to expand herself spiritually and personally, and to gain a sense of personal efficacy, make for an interesting read. However, Bennett violates flagrantly the old writer's adage, &quot;Show not tell,&quot; as when we are told repeatedly Anna's father is a miser and a tyrant long before we see him saying or doing anything miserly or tyrannical. Further, anyone looking for an intensely psychological novel with thoughts portrayed as stream of consciousness should be aware that Bennett's style descends from a Realist tradition."},{"Title":"Anna of the Five Towns (Modern Classics)","review":"When Anna turns 18, she inherits a large sum of money (and property) from her dead mother. Her miserly and cruel father discourages her from spending a penny of it and even forces her to extract high rents from her tenants. As if this weren't enough trouble, she falls in love with Harry Mynors who is only interested in her money. When she realizes this, she has become so used to this kind of treatment that she decides to marry him anyway. Naturalistic and depressing, Bennett portrays his main characters well. Poor Anna--you really feel for her by the end of the book."},{"Title":"Anna of the Five Towns (Modern Classics)","review":"Excellent. Arnold Bennett has such a wonderful way of capturing the way people think and speak - or rather as they thought and spoke 100 ago.I used to live in the Stoke on Trent area and am at home with the dialect words and phrases. Also with the area. Arnold Bennett uses slightly fictionalised names for the towns (Bursley instead of Burslem, for instance) and streets (Trafalgar Street instead of Waterloo Road) so anybody familiar with the area knows exactly where his characters live, where they tread.During my recent walk from SW France to NW England (Vic's Big Walk, followed by the book of the same nameVic's Big Walk)I walked the length of Trafalgar/Waterloo and also had a nostalgic mosey around Bursley/Burslem.Anna of the Five Towns is an enjoyable and informative read and also helped me to continue last year's experience."},{"Title":"They Wrote on Clay: The Babylonian Tablets Speak Today","review":"Before the beginning of this century, the only information we had about Ancient Babylon was from the Bible. Consequently, most of the literature that I have read on the subject (written during the height of Iraqi Archeaology in the 1920's and 30's) has been on a religious note rather than a historical one. This book changed all that. It brought a highly academic subject to the layman. It is a simple, informative account of how the real Babylonians lived. It describes the Babylonians as an advanced people who appreciated art and literature, as well as entering into contracts and having mortgages. It is a great introduction to an ancient civilisation."},{"Title":"They Wrote on Clay: The Babylonian Tablets Speak Today","review":"THEY WROTE ON CLAY : The Babylonian Tablets Speak Today. By Edward Chiera. Edited by George G. Cameron. 235 pp. Chicago and London : The University of Chicago Press, 1964 (1955). (pbk.)The civilizational achievements of the Sumerians, Babylonians, and Assyrians only started to become known over the course of the last century or so. For our new understanding of the past we have to thank archaeology, in particular for its discovery of many tens of thousands of baked clay tablets which have miraculously preserved the complex cuneiform writing system, languages, and literatures of the ancient Mesopotamians, and for the patient decipherment of these tablets and other cuneiform-bearing artefacts by a small and dedicated group of international scholars.The literature on this subject today is vast, and much of it is accessible only to specialists. Of the studies that are generally available - such as those by A. Leo Oppenheim, Samuel Noah Kramer, and Thorkild Jacobsen - most tend to be aimed at a more scholarly type of audience, the kind of people who like detailed footnotes, precise references to sources, bibliographies, etc., and little seems to be available in the way of a more popular treatment for the general reader.This is where the present book comes in. Edward Chiera, though a competent and respected scholar, was exceptional in having an ardent desire to share his knowledge by making the results of his research readily and entertainingly available to the general reader. Consequently, instead of giving us, for example, a lengthy and detailed analysis of the religious ideas or political history of the Babylonians, he has chosen instead to offer an absorbing excursion into the common life of this ancient civilization.Chiera's 'They Wrote on Clay' is both well-written and easy to read since the pages are small, the font used is gratifyingly large and readable, and there are numerous black-and-white photographs and line drawings which illustrate various aspects of life in the near East : people, places, animals, domestic scenes, archaeological sites, buildings, artworks and other artefacts etc. These illustrations perfectly supplement Chiera's written account, and although many are contemporary, they do serve to suggest something of what life must have been like in the past.Chiera has managed to pack an awful lot into this small book. We learn about the discovery of the ancient cities, the amazing libraries of clay tablets that were unearthed, the exciting story of the decipherment of the complex cuneiform writing system, the worlds of business and religion, of kings, priests, scribes and ordinary folk, and of their multifarious doings, and of much else besides.The author clearly loved his subject, and it's invariably from such writers that we get the best books. So if you're looking for a well-written, well-illustrated, easy-to-read popular treatment of this fascinating world, a world that is vastly more important to you than you may realize since it is there and not in Greece that the real roots of Western civilization lie, you'd be hard put to better 'They Wrote on Clay.'And if Chiera succeeds in whetting your appetite, as I'm sure he will, you might go on to read one of the best-loved stories to come out of that world, the deeply moving story of the adventures of Gilgamesh, his friendship with the wild man Enkidu, and his search for immortality. I'm pretty sure that, if you don't already know it, you would very much enjoy that too. One good popular edition of this story that can be recommended is:THE EPIC OF GILGAMESH : An English Version with an Introduction by N. K. Sandars. Penguin Classics Revised Edition. 128 pp. London : Penguin, 1972 (1964) and Reissued."},{"Title":"They Wrote on Clay: The Babylonian Tablets Speak Today","review":"I found this interesting book to be a very good source of translated inscriptions, some of which found their way into my own recent compilation \\"Wetlands of Mass Destruction: Ancient Presage for Contemporary Ecocide in Southern Iraq\\".

She has obviously become an expert in a field where she never thought she'd be, and she's here to share everything she knows with you: all the small details and the good news, too. She tells you up front that you don't have to make immediate decisions -- you have some time to weigh your options. She describes what you can expect to experience during various courses of treatment and what worked for her. This book is filled with all kinds of information and resources in an easily accessible format. It would be a real service if doctors would recommend this book to their patients, especially those who are newly diagnosed."},{"Title":"What's a Body to Do: The Breast Cancer Case Manager","review":"There are lots of words written every year on the subject of breast cancer, and lots of confusing information circulating about it. But this book does something unique -- walks a patient through not only the personal side of what it means to work through the treatment, but offers informative, thoughtful and well-researched advice and suggestions. From insurance, to diet, to treatment options, to, well, even hair, this book takes a good hard look at so many issues, yet Chartock (a breast cancer survivor herself) never loses sight of the compassionate side of the story.Particularly helpful are the diary entries, which give the woman not only some suggested questions to ask her doctor about, but also space to write down the answers. If you or someone you know is dealing with breast cancer, this is one book that will make the process just a little easier on the heart, soul and mind."},{"Title":"Owls and Pussy-cats","review":"This is a collection of great nonsense verse from Lewis Carroll and Edward Lear, most of which stands the test of time - beautifully illustrated by Nick Palin. My children (2 and 4) have adored this book for over a year now. They read it themselves - or at least look long and hard at the illustrations, and bring it to me to read to them over and over.Most of these poems can easily be found in other books or collections. The advantage of this collection is that it is a small number of very good poems and (as I said before) they are really well illustrated. My children have rapidly learned quite a bit of each of the poems just from frequent re-reading.Poems include The Crocodile, the Owl and the Pussycat, the Dong with the luminous nose, the Walrus and the carpenter - and my children's favourite - the Jumblies. I really enjoy The New Vestments which is one I had not seen beforeIn the rear of the book is the Index of titles and first lines which makes it simple to track down anything you particularly want to read.I would definitely recommend this as a must have for a children's library. It is one of those lovely books which has opened my children's eyes to poetry and reading."},{"Title":"Tizzy","review":"Tizzy lived on Monster Planet.

By mixing skilfully crafted music, and in language that everyone can follow, he carefully guides the listener through many of the concepts of meditation. But more than this the CD gives anyone the chance to experience some of the altered states of consciousness that meditation promises. The music may remind you at times of \\"Revolver\\", while the opening tamboura-like drone, and tabla, point to the source, Nada Brahma - Sound Is God. Truth seekers and sceptics alike will find flashes of insight here that might lead to further exploration, which I guess is what Nick Kemp has set out to encourage.

I thought Marie Killilea's attempt to synopsize the story of Karen for young readers was a disaster. As much as I like &quot;Karen&quot;, that is how much I dislike &quot;Wren&quot;.In my opinion, the tone was cutesy and patronizing, some of the anecdotes were poorly chosen, and there were some real howlers, such as a bunny named &quot;little black sambo&quot; (which may have been acceptable in 1954). Also, the statement that Karen is a wonderful child because she never complains, works hard, and always has a cheerful attitude. This is an unfair burden to put on any child, much less a child with a severe physical disability. Also I disliked the repeated admonitions to Marie and Karen that they should not misbehave because that makes God sad and angry with them. That struck me as emotional blackmail.The technique of going back and forth between Karen's story and the happy, lively Killilea family worked very well in &quot;Karen&quot; because there was room for it. It did not work so well here. A few stories about the family are fine, but not this rambling about the Killilea animals (the bunnies chew the furniture; one bunny has a litter, the details about the wrens, etc.). This was meant to be cute but seemed pointless to me. The only animal who deserved the detailed description was Shanty, because he was Karen's &quot;second guardian angel&quot; (a phrase I liked).I also thought this book did not do a good job of explaining cerebral palsy at all, nor why Karen needed so many years of physical therapy. And characterizing therapy as a fun &quot;Game&quot; is patronizing in my view because it overlooks the years of hard work and dedication needed for Karen to gain use of her arms and legs. The therapy was described very well in &quot;Karen,&quot; but not here.I did like some aspects of the book. Starting out from Marie's point of view is a great idea. I also liked some anecdotes, such as teaching Karen how to hold her breath underwater, and the Christmas story at the end of the book. The illustrations, done by Bob Riger, are absolutely beautiful.On the whole, however, I thought this story was a jumble of unrelated, cutesy, somewhat patronizing little anecdotes and I would not recommend it to anyone with CP or their families. CP can be made understandable to young readers. A good book is Marylin Gould's &quot;Golden Daffodils&quot;."},{"Title":"Wren","review":"&quot;Wren&quot; tells for children the inspiring story of Karen Killilea, the child who lived a miracle, and of her remarkable family.

My other favourites are &quot;Karen&quot; and &quot;With Love From Karen.&quot; I think Marie Killilea is one of the best authors ever!"},{"Title":"Wren","review":"I think what some people who gave this book negative reviews aren't getting is that this book is for children, not adults which is the reason it might seem to \\"talk down\\" as one reviewer said. I read this book many years ago in 3rd or 4th grade and since I was a child, I did enjoy it. This children's book was also influenced me to read both \\"Karen\\" and \\"With Love from Karen\\" some years years later. Both of these books were written for teens and adults and as a teenager, I enjoyed both these books as well.Someone else suggested that parts of the story were insulting because of the manner in which certain terminology was used. I think some readers are not aware ORIGINAL book was published in a much earlier time (late 1940s or very early 50s, I believe) at a time before awareness of how politically incorrect statements can, and ARE hurtful. However, I am not sure the author is living anymore to make the editorial changes in order to keep up with the more enlightened readers of today. Marie Killilea was an adult and Karen was already older than I when I read the book as a child.In order to enjoy this book, it has to be taken for what it is, a CHILDREN'S book written many years ago and, therefore, rather dated as compared to children's books of these times.I gave the book only 3 stars because it has been many years since I read it. However, I feel that since it was the reason for reading the other 2 books about Karen when I was a teenager in the 60s, it deserves at least this many."},{"Title":"Wren","review":"I read Karen & From Karen With Love when I was a young girl.

I also did not like the way the author refers to herself as &quot;Mom Pom.&quot; It is one thing if the children called her that, but for a competent adult to refer to herself that way is ludicrous. The book reads like a little homespun saga, but in real life nobody is that loving and 100% self sacrificing. Even the &quot;nice appearance&quot; is a facade. I didn't like the fact that the rabbit was named &quot;little black sambo,&quot; which I felt was a racist slur. I also did not like the way Karen was portrayed as a 100% cheerful, uncomplaining little martyr. She wasn't. She was a bright, delightful, adorable little girl who had a physical challenge and who learned to cope with it. She got tired. She was ashamed of the &quot;ugly, yellow leather stains&quot; the braces left on her legs. She regularly saw her older sister Marie get relegated to the background while their foster sister stole the limelight in the books and in their mother's eyes. Wren is stupidly written and makes light of how serious an effort physical therapy is. Calling Karen's hard work &quot;games&quot; is insulting at best, misleading at worst. Wren really is for the birds!"},{"Title":"Wren","review":"I didn't like this book when I was a child. I don't like it as a an adult. It is a farce, plain and simple. The reviewers who panned it for its absurdity were right on target. This poorly written tale just constructs a nice little fantasy about a martyr instead of a real child and it sounds like &quot;Ozzie &amp; Harriet Confront C.P.&quot; Although the anecdotes about the aminmals were cute, the whole book is written in a condescending tone. The racist name that one rabbit was given was insulting. Read &quot;Karen&quot; and &quot;With Love from Karen&quot; instead as these books complement your intelligence instead of insulting it like &quot;Wren&quot; does. I didn't like this book at all. I agree -- &quot;Wren&quot; really is for the birds."},{"Title":"IT Measurement: Practical Advice from the Experts","review":"This book is a panoramic view of metrics across the enterprise. Although the book is written by members of the International Function Point Users Group it goes well beyond software estimating. It encompasses measurement techniques that are consistent with function points, but are also useful when applied to other methods.As expected, the book starts with a discussion of function points, its evolution as a methodology, and how it has evolved as a means of measuring a full spectrum of attributes, such as quality, productivity, time and effort. In addition to generic attribute metrics this book shows how function points can be applied to earned value project management, developing a balanced scorecard that views the enterprise holisitcally, business and e-commerce metrics and evaluations and benchmarking.Parts that I especially like include:* The complete data collection, analysis and action process that is embodied in the book. This can be used in any setting, such as the Constructive Cost Model (CoCoMo), as well as FP.* IT work units, which are applicable to production services and support. This dispells the notion that function points are only useful for software estimating. This is also augmented by a later section in the book that addresses IT and business measures that is sure to change the way you approach measuring the overall value of IT.* Demonstrated use of function points as a viable project estimating technique that extends to projects other than software development.* Clearly written explanation of statistical process controls.I've only highlighted the parts of the book in which I have personal and professional interests. The book contains much more material that covers the entire spectrum of enterprise metrics, including case studies and reflecting the views of each individual author who contributed chapter(s). In my opinion this book is, and will remain for years to come, one of the most important texts on IT measurement. Time will tell, of course, but I haven't found a more complete book on the subject."},{"Title":"The Bing Book for Trumpet","review":"I recently picked up a copy of The Bing Book and have been enjoying it tremendously.

However, except for the cover, however, all the illustrations are by John Nez, who draws in Wells' familiar style. However, there are subtle yet noticeable differences between Wells' cover illustration and those done by Nez. There's a sly look in the eyes and some shading and coloring effects that are missing from Nez's work. The animal pictures are simply less compelling and mischievous than what Wells draws. Fortunately, Wells wrote this story and it is funny in the way that Wells is always funny: A basically well intentioned but still disruptive animal creates some benign trouble, incurring the anger of those around him. These snippets of dialogue are funny when read out loud and our child loves Wells' writing.\\"I am making beautiful music!\\" said Timothy.\\"It is a beautiful noise.\\" said Yoko, \\"but it is not music....\\"Timothy the raccoon can't find an instrument to play for the school talent show, and he when does, he plays too loud! He learns to play the bells (and to read notes with a clever numbering system), and the book shows that while music is lots of fun, it also requires practice.Ms. Wells, in a note following the book, introduces the \\"Yoko\\" series, and encourages parents to spend time reading with their kids. She notes that \\"the stories are all drawn from the experiences my children had in school.\\" It's not clear why Wells didn't do all the pictures; the same is true in another Yoko book I picked up. Still, Wells wrote the story, and her influence is felt in the pictures. I also like the smaller, more portable size of these books. However, get some of the \\"Max\\" and \\"Ruby\\" books for a more complete and satisfying Wells experience."},{"Title":"Not to Be Taken (Black Dagger Crime Series)","review":"John Waterhouse is a burly, energetic man who stamped his mark on great works in all corners of the globe, but who has now retired to the country with his ailing wife. The village is small and the neighbours friendly (to the extent one can choose one's friends in the country!). When one day sickness comes to the Waterhouse mansion, everyone is astonished that rather than wispy Mrs Waterhouse who suffers an illness it is strapping John.As John's condition worsens, tongues start to wag, and Frances presents her husband Douglas with a half full medicine bottle she has sneaked from beside the sick bed, suggesting they get it analysed. As John dies, Douglas resolves to take the bottle to the police, only to discover it has vanished. At that moment Cyril, John's brother, arrives, and the exhumation he orders reveals John died of arsenic poisoning - but there's no arsenic in the house! As Douglas frets about the missing medicine, secrets come tumbling out of closets, and everyone suffers a hair-raising time at the inquest until a surprise message arrives from a most unexpected source....Well, what a belter! Berkeley is on top form with this novel. Written from Douglas's point of view, we follow his bemused progress through the days of the death and inquest until eventually he realises who is responsible for the mayhem, and confronts them. Berkeley has also taken a leaf from Queen's book, and includes a challenge to the reader just before the denouement. The writing is as clean, witty and enjoyable as ever, and it's all very well presented in the Langtail house-style of this new edition.Hugely enjoyable!"},{"Title":"Seahenge: A Quest for Life and Death in Bronze Age Britain","review":"First the negative, minor though it might be. The book is really rather misnamed. If anything, while Seahenge is a captivating title, it is way too limited. While the author discusses the wood circle at Holmes, he does so only briefly in the introduction and over a couple of chapters at the end of the book. What the main body of the volume contains is a very pleasant recitation of a life spent working in Neolithic and Early Bronze age archaeology in England.For those looking for a more thorough description of the work and story of the remains at Holmes, it would probably be better to look to the journals. A visit to the local reference library for a bibliography will probably come up with what you want, and large public and certainly most university libraries will carry many of the journal entries on your list. These are likely to be quite technical, though, so be forewarned. More popular accounts might be available in journals like Archaeology, Archaeology Odyssey, or Scientific American.Next, the positives. And they are major positives. First and foremost, the author has a very nice narrative style. It's readable and friendly, and while laced with some technical terms and ideas, these are usually fully explained without being labored. Furthermore, the author shares his knowledge of his field in practice so the reader has a first person, first hand account of an archaeologist at work. At one point Dr. Pryor quotes from his site diary, letting one in on his personal thoughts and experiences at a crucial point of his work at Seahenge.Probably more than anything, the book offers a glimpse of what it means to be an archaeologist. In particular the reader learns how one goes about acquiring ones credentials, what the management of daily routine on the site is like, under what conditions one works and lives, what job opportunities there are, and how these effect ones personal lifestyle.If one is inclined to follow up the information on archaeology and the archaeologist, the bibliography provides a good deal of material, some on specific topics from the journals and some on more general topics from books, most from 1980 to the present and some of historical interest from the 1960s and later.I would definitely recommend this book for a school library serving students from forth grade and later. The book would be comprehendible to good readers of whatever age and gives a clear account of an archaeologist's life and what one has to learn to become one."},{"Title":"Seahenge: A Quest for Life and Death in Bronze Age Britain","review":"The author has a wonderful style that combines a hands-on experience with digging up Neolithic and Bronze Age sites with relections on the human understanding of landscapes in the prehistoric world. Lots of local color and opinions enhance the read. I will read more from this author."},{"Title":"Seahenge: A Quest for Life and Death in Bronze Age Britain","review":"More of a book on the life of an archeologist than the discoveries themselves it nevertheless makes for an interesting read. I think many will be surprised, as I was, at the various facet involved in the life of an archeologist. In that way is it is a very generous book. A tale worth telling."},{"Title":"Dwelling in Possibility: Women Poets and Critics on Poetry (Reading Women Writing)","review":"This book would perhaps benefit from a greater amount of consideration of the most important poet writing today, Adrienne Rich; other courageous voices, such as Marge Piercy and bell hooks, are also largely left out, which is a shame. As Women challenge the agenda of white males and their eurocentric paradigms, their voices must be heard, inspite of the efforts to keep them quiet."},{"Title":"Casey at the Bat","review":"Having a son named Casey, I have many copies of \\"Casey at the Bat\\". Each and every one of them has Cooney and Burrows die at first. The new Harper Collins edition reads..\\"And then when Cooney died at second, and Burrows did the same...\\" Not only does this interrupt the meter of the poem, it doesn't make any baseball sense. Mudville is losing by two runs in the bottom of the ninth. When Cooney gets up there are no outs. How does he die at second? How does Burrows do the same? Did they try to stretch a single into a double? I can just see the veins popping out on the managers forehead when they pulled that stunt. This line is really something to think about and I am wondering where the editors at Harper Collins came across it.The illustrations by Leroy Neiman are wonderful. Here you see a very Mantlesque looking Casey straining every muscle to connect with that pitch and end the game with a towering blast. I also loved the fact that they are not in color. The only disturbing part is that before the final verse of the poem, you are clearly shown that Casey has missed the ball. Now we all know that Casey struck out, but you don't want to know that until the text tells you. To this day I always hope that air which is shatterd has been the result of his hitting the ball. The placement of Mr Neiman's illustrations takes that hope away. If I had been reading this to my son for the first time, he would surely have seen that the mighty Casey had failed. There would have been no need to read the last stanza. I certainly do not recommend this as a childs first introduction to this poem. The format and illustrations are wonderful, but save it for your second purchase!"},{"Title":"Casey at the Bat","review":"What do you get when you combine Ernest Thayer's beloved, boys of summer poem and artist, Leroy Neiman's rich, charcoal illustrations? A unique and evocative rendering of Americana that adds an additional rare gem to the rich collection of Casey At The Bat books. Mr Neiman's unique, expressive, and dynamic artwork brings the poem to life in all its emotional splendor and glory. From the introduction by New York Yankee's manager, Joe Torre, to the very last page, as muscular Casey, bat in hand, hangs his head and takes that lonely walk from the plate into fictional history, young and old alike will be entranced by this powerful and engaging, larger than life story. Perfect for youngsters 8 and older, Leroy Neiman's, oversized, coffee table-like Casey At The Bat is a combination of verse and artwork at its finest, and a must for both baseball fans and art lovers everywhere."},{"Title":"Casey at the Bat","review":"One of the book covers was torn and covered with a black substance. It was unsuitable to gift to the intended recipient. I had to obtain another book locally. I tried to contact Horizon Books via telephone, but never got an answer. I would appreciate a replacement copy!"},{"Title":"Casey at the Bat","review":"In my opinion, it is a healthy thing to modernize the classic baseball poem \\"Casey at the Bat.\\" Written over a century ago, it is still an excellent description of a wonderful game. In this book, Neiman uses some superb sketches that depict the players of today. Names and numbers are on the backs of the uniforms, Casey wears a batting helmet, the fans are wearing modern clothing and Casey looks like a slugger. Depicted as a muscular behemoth, his arms look like he could crush the life out of a bear.Reading \\"Casey at the Bat\\" is a delight in any form and I highly recommend this one."},{"Title":"Casey at the Bat","review":"Ernest Lawrence Thayer's classic baseball poem about the small town of Mudville and its beloved baseball hero is superbly enhanced with LeRoy Neiman's charcoal drawings in this illustrated coffee table book. This splendid edition of Casey At The Bat is enhanced with an introduction by Yankees manager Joe Torre and filled with soulful, blending of Thayer's words and Neiman's illustrations blending together to bring the spirit of this memorable and beloved poem to life. Casey At The Bat is to be treasured by all baseball buffs, and heartily recommended for school and community library collections."},{"Title":"Casey at the Bat","review":"There are several altered versions of Thayer's classic poem in existance.This book uses one of them.I love this poem, and I wish the author had stuck with the original.Especially when Ernest Lawrence Thayer is listed as the author!Also- the images of Casey and the spectators are of modernday participants. Casey is wearing a helmet and his name andnumber are on the back of his uniform. Not like a playerin 1888 at all.Leroy Neiman is a great artist, and that is the only reason I give this2 stars."},{"Title":"The PRS Guitar Book: A Complete History of Paul Reed Smith Guitars","review":"All the beautiful guitars are here, in a lavishly photographed, well documented and thoughtfully laid out narrative.

Shortcomings: the photos are up to a professional standard, but many of them are accompanied with a white bar in the upper body of the guitar due to shinny reflection. This effect can illustrate how shinny the guitar can be, but can be quite obstructive to the eyes.

The information is current and interesting. Yes, this book is expensive, but it is beautifully laid out. All the models are here, along with Paul's philosophy on instrument making and sound characteristics. There is even a step by step illustrated description on how a guitar is made. I have one small complaint - the fold out pages should have been cut just a tad shorter on the outside edge. Careless re-insertion upon closing the book will lead to unwanted creases. Other than that, you will be more than happy with this book."},{"Title":"The PRS Guitar Book: A Complete History of Paul Reed Smith Guitars","review":"This numbered limited edition may not reach all audiences but it provides an excellent survey of the PRS guitar built by Smith for a range of famous players.

As usual, it contains a section about spearfishing and freediving gear, accessories as well as a little history. It includes also some uncommon information, like oil platforms diving.However the main strength of the book are the chapters about the fish species, spearfishing techniques and about maximizing the freediving abilities. There are whole chapters about types of fish and about where to find them - these give quite a lot of information about main game fish, their range of presence and habits. Particularly, I like two chapters about developing the spearfishing technique and about maximizing the freediving abilities. It says a lot about main threats of the sport, how to avoid them, explains the basics of the freediving physiology and points out several tips useful in making the spearfishing activities safe and pleasant. Everyone can also learn also about staying fit for freediving.The book also treats about the ecology, security and ethical aspects of the spearfishing sport.I like the small format of the book, you can easily take it with you on the fishing trip. The drawing's quality is good, but on the other side almost all of the photos are far too dark and you can't see much on some of them. Several pages and the cover got partially apart before finishing the first reading...So, generally the book gives a lot of information and many answers, including the ones I couldn't find in other spearfishing titles for beginners. I recommend the book to every newcomer to spearfishing, if you just want to get only one title to learn about the sport - go for it. You will probably have to buy several books to learn about whole spectrum of issues, but this book in my opinion is perfect to start with. I think it is worth buying, it will be useful for more advanced sportsmen and on beginner's level - as the book is addressed to - it is a complete, five stars title."},{"Title":"Spearfishing for Skin and Scuba Divers (Diversification Series)","review":"If you are going to spend the money on a book regarding spearfishing, spend the extra money for \\"Bluewater Hunting and Freediving\\" by Terry Maas. It has much more info that this book.This book is elementary at best."},{"Title":"Spearfishing for Skin and Scuba Divers (Diversification Series)","review":"This book was very informative to the new spearfisher person.

As a begining spearfisherman I found this book extremely helpfull. It does not go into long stories to explain information, but just gives it to you upfront."},{"Title":"Spearfishing for Skin and Scuba Divers (Diversification Series)","review":"This book is well suited for those that have never touched a speargun and are thinking about picking up the sport, but if you have any experience whatsoever, or are willing to do some research on the internet, this book is a definite pass; information given on most subjects is maddeningly limited for those with any experience."},{"Title":"Spearfishing for Skin and Scuba Divers (Diversification Series)","review":"Although this book has some decent pictures the writing and analysis is below average. Writer appears more interested in underwater photography. His coverage of spearguns borders on the flimsy. He appears to have little actual experience in this area. Book is only 133 pages. 1. I saw no pictures of author with fish. 2. Written in third party format. Appears to be commercial diver or instructor. 3. Speargun coverage lightweight, knowledge of powerheads insufficient. Nothing on shark defense. 4. Seems to condone not using safeties on guns. 5. Does not use own equipment in book but refers to borrowed spearguns, etc.. 6. Appears to own little or none of his own spearing equipment. Written from the reporter, photographer point of view. I recommend looking elsewhere."},{"Title":"Spearfishing for Skin and Scuba Divers (Diversification Series)","review":"This book provided an excellent overview of spearfishing.

But this is not the point. I will compare it to Giles. Much better, both construction of the studying material and exam question-answer part. Unlike Giles, NPTE has thorough explained question and answer choices, and an option of pausing the test. NPTE has three exams. Giles though has four exams and visually it is constructed very closely to a real one, little if any question explanation. Bottom part you'll benefit from both. But if you're short of green go with NPTE. Don't know the difference between NPTE 2008 and 2009 editions though. I'd be thankful if you'll provide that info.Thank you,PoleginI just had a look at 2009 edition. All that's been added is a color print, that is it.

It is a good source of review along with you.I am highly recommending this book to anyone aspiring for more knowledge in the exam."},{"Title":"The Practice of Prayer: A Companion Guide","review":"I just finished reading this book this morning with my son sleeping on my chest. It took me over a year to finish it. Not that it was long or hard to read but it is written as a prayer journey - so you can't read it in a weekend. The book is comprised of chapters which talk about prayer and then at the end of each chapter there is a prayer exercise. The prayer exercises are what make the book. In doing the prayer exercises you actually feel God's presence. Your relationship with God grows. It is as simple as that. Robert Warren is of the Catholic faith but this book can be enjoyed by all Christians - it is written for the unified Church of God. I mention that my son was sleeping on my chest as I finished this book - after doing the exercises and watching my closeness with God grow that is how I felt - as a child embraced by God. Robert Warren makes a strong point that he was going to write on evangelism but the book turned to prayer. To Robert the reason was simple - if your walk with God is close evangelism becomes natural. If you want to grow with God, see a change in your prayer life and understanding of prayer buy this book and practice it."},{"Title":"Italy With Kids, Second Edition","review":"Using this guidebook, I think you'll have a trip memorable not only for the tips that allowed you to enjoy your own travel, but also as a journey that became that much more interesting because you had the little ones along. Enough of the poetic antipasto, let's tuck in.The book was written by two obvious parents; they refer to their children throughout the book and include their kids' comments and suggestions. A couple of parenting examples: whilst Mom and Dad gazed upward at the Sistine Chapel ceiling, it was their daughter who pointed out the work of art in itself that was inlaid in the floor (intarsia).Suggestions on places to stay include the needed price ranges and contact info, but also note which hotels are near noisy piazzas, which have laundry service (the three coins in the coin washer joke will get old fast), which offer a non-smoking room (rare) and which seemed to welcome children instead of merely tolerating them along with the pets and soccer louts.The book includes the usual and useful staples of suggested web sites, lists of Italian foods with their real names and a brief description (helpful to plan ahead for picky eaters), Italian travel promotion office addresses, the entire history of Rome in eight pages and couple of pages of Italian phrases.Bless the authors for their phrase section, for instead of the usual junky words (\\"Benito, your swift motorcycle has crushed my foot\\"), you get stuff like \\"Do you sell diapers?\\", \\"We need a babysitter\\", \\"My child is allergic to penicillin\\" and other things of use to us parents. The suggested reading lists include one just for kids, singling out some picture books for the youngest travelers.My favorite travel tips in the book relate to helping kids weather art galleries: for older children, bring a pencil and sketchbook, and have your heirs join the art students sitting on the floor drawing \\"notes\\" while gazing at the best thing oil and paper can do outside of a super-sized McFries.For younger children, buy postcards or an exhibition catalog on the way into the museum, and task the tykes with finding in the book the art you happen to be gazing at. We tried this with our five year old and it actually worked, though we did have to improvise a bit when she got bored and offer the promise of extra dessert if she could keep finding the stuff until 4 PM.The book not surprisingly places great emphasis on Rome, but you also get individual chapters titled Venice with Kids, Verona with Kids, Florence and Tuscany with Kids, Naples and the Amalfi Coast with Kids and Milan and the Lake Region with Kids.Each of these chapters include sections on how to get there, where to stay (with price ranges), places to eat (annotated to note places especially nice to kids), a splash of history and of course, pages of things to see and do. Each of these chapters can stand alone as its own mini-guide book.Ah, but then there is Rome.With a nod toward at least getting you close to the romance and magic we all die for from a thousand movies, the focus is squarely on enjoying the city with your kids. You get advice on transport (subway: YES, with details on navigating the ticketing system, walking: YES, buses: SORT OF, driving: NO).There are many references to gelato, as well as tips (order inside at a caf&eacute;, cheaper than ordering outside at a table). Suggested tours are narrated in a way that makes both good armchair reading as well as useful prose to read aloud as you visit places.Little touches-look out for cats at the Coliseum, mail postcards home from the efficient Vatican post office instead of the creaky Italian one-enliven the whole text. One suggested itinerary in Venice begins \\"sip cappuccino at one of the cafes while the kids entertain themselves by feeding the pigeons.&quot;The moment of truth here is that this is a great guidebook, witty, useful and, best of all, written by parents who walked the same streets as did the Caesars and soon, maybe you. If you aren't willing to take me along with you to Italy, go ahead and take this book instead."},{"Title":"Italy With Kids, Second Edition","review":"Thank you, Barbara and Michael Pape, for doing the research and sharing your insights in this book that was constantly at my side during our recent trip. We read, and carried along, a few of the best guidebooks recommended, but Italy with Kids is the one that was the most helpful. Without repeating the well-deserved praise heaped on this book by a previous reviewer, I want to add some comments from our own experience:First, the book reveals information about many places and activities that we would never have found on our own. For example, instead of carting the kids through Milan, we chose instead to visit Vinci based on the authors' discussion of this tiny town nestled in Tuscany where da Vinci was raised. Our visit to the Museo de Leonardino in Vinci which is housed in an old castle, was enchanting to the kids who could come up very close to many of da Vinci's inventions and notes. The museum was small, extremely child-friendly, and best of all - uncrowded (and for Italy in June that is rare indeed).There are numerous other examples like this, and the section on Tuscany where we were based for much of our trip is outstanding. What other book mentions Snoopy's, a terrific gelateria in Cortona? Our 7-year-old had the important task of &quot;rating&quot; the gelatos we tasted in Italy, and found this one among his favorites. The book mentions the best gelato shops in many towns, a welcome treat after a day of sight-seeing and hiking up and down the steep streets. Unlike many other guidebooks, such small details as Pinky the cat who resides in the Fortress at Sirmione on Lake Garda were mentioned, and really drew the kids' attention. Of course, as soon as we arrived at the entrance, they asked where Pinky could be found and spent a good part of this visit entertaining the good-tempered feline, allowing us to spend some time enjoying the views and reflecting on the history of this intriguing fortress. In fact, I doubt whether we would have spent time at Garda at all if we hadn't read the book, heading instead for the more popular Lake Como on which most other guidebooks focus. Just as the Papes' noted, we were among the only American tourists in Sirmione, and we enjoyed several days with Italian, German and other European families. As for Hotel Sirmione, suggested by the authors, it went beyond our expectations. Ever swam in a 80+ degree mineral swimming pool, surrounded on three sides by a mountain lake? Other accommodation and restaurant recommendations were also excellent. What the book says is exactly what you will find, and its descriptions go well beyond what other guidebooks typically provide.In summary, this book is an outstanding resource for anyone traveling with kids...or who is a kid at heart. I am now waiting for books to be written on traveling with kids to other European countries. They will have a tough act to follow."},{"Title":"Italy With Kids, Second Edition","review":"I bought this book prior to a trip to Italy with my 3-year-old son and was highly disappointed. The authors stick to only the most obvious siteseeing destinations and didn't provide the nitty gritty that a traveler with children really needs. For example, the chaper on Venice of course describes St. Marks, but makes no mention of the playground right near the train station. The Milan chapter mentions &quot;The Last Supper&quot; but overlooks a park we discovered that has a collection of dinosaur statues and a carousel.Another major omission: the authors made no mention of the fact that many youth hostels offer accommodations for families, and the YH in Verona was a real gem -- gorgeous grounds to run around on, a spacious room, and cheap meals. It was also about one block away from a playground. None of the accommodations listings mention the hostel option.Bring Lonely Planet and leave this book behind -- the luggage space is better used by a spare coloring book or toy."},{"Title":"Italy With Kids, Second Edition","review":"There aren't a lot of books available about traveling in Europe with children, so I snapped this one up awhen I saw it. It has helpful information and good tips, but I was hoping for more. I found it lacking in giving specific activities that would interest children in given cities. The list of suggested book for kids was excellent, however. This book is a good start if you're heading to Italy with your children, but it won't be the only homework you'll need to do."},{"Title":"Italy With Kids, Second Edition","review":"This book was quite helpful to us in our trip to Northern Italy. All the restaurant suggested turned out well and the book gave us some great ideas of things to do with the kids. It is probably more useful with children 10 and under than for older kids although some of it is still applicable."},{"Title":"Italy With Kids, Second Edition","review":"As other reviews have stated, this book is far from perfect. But I bought it as soon as I read the art-gallery hint (take crayons and paper). We just got back from a Picasso museum, and our 6-year-old was begging for freedom even though she learned about Picasso in kindergarten. The crayons would have been a lifesaver.On the upside, the authors understand what kids like and need, and give good hints on things they will like. On the downside, they don't seem to be the brightest bulbs on the planet (the book is filled with howlers like \\"wet your appetite\\" and \\"taxi cues\\"). They also seem to have a heck of a lot more money than I do (and I'm far from poor). Their idea of an inexpensive hotel is 95 Euros a night for a double (and the kids are extra!). That's my idea of splurging. I shudder every time they tell me that a particular cafe is \\"a bit pricey, but a good place to relax\\". I translate that to \\"lunch will cost more than you ought to be spending on a room.\\"The second edition also suffers from sloppy proofreading. There are lots of places where prices are still given in lira. The Euro has been around long enough now that I have no clue what 5,000 lira would equate to.Even so, I'm glad I bought the book. I'll be able to sit down with my daughter and plan the trip together, and that alone is worth the price."},{"Title":"Italy With Kids, Second Edition","review":"We own every European travel book that exists. I can honestly say that this one is by far the worst one I have seen, hands down. The coverage of accommodations is sparse and only includes extraordinarily expensive hotels, for the most part, and the dining recommendations are little better. There are no unique tips in this guide and it really covers 6 cities, and not very comprehensively. I give an extra star for making the attempt to write a kids travel guide, since they are not common."},{"Title":"Italy With Kids, Second Edition","review":"So far we have found this book helpful in planning our trip. It seems most useful for the larger cities.We especially like the section with the specific kid phrases to translate.However, we have found that we are still going online to get additional information.

It is the true story of Madalene DeLancey's Week at Waterloo and I am forever indebted to David Miller who found this incredibly hard to find book and added footnotes and narrative detail to what was a very thin story.Madalene was encouraged to write this story much later - and so it is done from memory rather than diaries and letters, but the detail is extraodinary. It was shown to Charles Dickens who wept over it. Her writing is very moving. It lacks deliberate pathos and yet it is so moving. She had married only a few months prior to battle of Waterloo and her husband had been called to serve at the last minute, they arrived in Belgium just days before the battle began and her husband was immediately swept into the organisation.The army was called up on the 15th and marched to Ligny and Quatrebras where the first battles took place. Back in the town no one knew what was happening, the dithering, the panic, the rumours, the deserters galloping through town are all revealed in her narrative.The most gut-wrenching part is when she finds out her husband has been injured - she hears numerous stories rumours and half-confirmed details until she finally tracks him down, injured near the battlefield. She then must nurse him.I find myself crying even as I write this review. The story had such an enormous impact. Miller has done a fantastic job of providing detail to throw light on it, without detracting from its power.One of the best books I have read 5 stars +A Woodley"},{"Title":"Lady De Lancey at Waterloo: A Story of Duty and Devotion","review":"Lord and Lady DeLancey married shortly before the Battle of Waterloo. While others were dancing at the Duchess of Richmond's ball on the eve of the battle, the DeLanceys remained in their hotel, hopefully in each other's arms. Once the trumpets are sounded, calling for all officers to return to their regiments, Lord DeLancey leaves his bride believing that she will make for the port of Ostend to return to England while he moves toward the front to face the reconstituted armies of Napoleon. But her gut tells her to turn back, which was a good thing, because she shortly received word that her husband was grievously wounded and was in a cottage near the battlefield. Lady DeLancey immediately went to her husband and stayed with him until he died three days later. This is a remarkable story, but even more so when you learn that the bride was only about 20 years old. Her ability to stay calm under such circumstances when armed men were walking outside her door and no one knew who had won the battle is a profile in courage. Most of the book is Lady DeLancey's own writings on what happened near Waterloo."},{"Title":"Slaves of Obsession","review":"i have been a major fan of this series since the first book. i have always found this series so much deeper and better written than her other series, and have always rushed to the bookstore to get the newest monk novel. however, even though, on an absolute scale, this was a very good book, it was, in my view, the worst in the series. i was always of the view that hester and monk should ultimately get married. unfortunately, however, as in tv shows when the lovers finally get together, they become boring. hester and monk just arent as much fun when they arent fighting. maybe she needs to introduce a real, rather than imaginary, love triangle with rathbone to spice things up. also, the plot here was fairly convoluted compared to the other books in this series. all in all, a somewhat dissapointing effort."},{"Title":"Slaves of Obsession","review":"While shelf-browsing my local library, I happened open this book and was intrigued by its attractive cover and its historical premise, so I picked it up.I, too, could not finish the book and stopped short of the trial in London. It opened fairly well with the moral issue of slavery becoming a heated topic at a London merchant's dinner table. The 16-year old daughter is indignant that her father is selling efficiently lethal rifles and ammunition to the Confederacy. Her passion has been influenced by a rival Union arms buyer who pleads the moral case as well, and with whom she later flees to the U.S.I found the characters convincing one moment, and then rather wooden the next. The same with the Victorian milieu -- it struck me as unevenly depicted. For me this was a major flaw as the best historical novels and detective stories have an optimal weaving of story, character and environment to make the \\"whole cloth\\", so to speak.In addition, the detective Monk seemed a rather lame chap in this work. Mystery detectives, even when they're not doing much or are hovering in the background, ought to have a looming presence as they are to a greater or lesser degree the moral presence in the story, the one who must discover the truth. The Adam Dalgliesh character of P.D. James is almost always successfully rendered in this way, even though he may be absent for a good part of the story.What went wrong with SoO? Look at the author's extensive credits at the front of the book. Ms. Perry is a \\"writing machine\\" if there ever was one, and prolific genre writers can get overextended, disconnected and thin from time to time. That's what happened here, I wager."},{"Title":"Slaves of Obsession","review":"I have read all the William Monk books up to this one, and am working my way through the series.

Several years ago, Monk was introduced in THE FACE OF A STRANGER, a man who awoke in a hospital bed after a terrible accident with his past a total mystery. He learns that he is a feared policeman, and many of the things that he gradually learns about himself are personally disconcerting and lead him to fear what he might discover about the blanks in his shadowy past.This story is set in 1861, just as the Battle of Bull Run, the first great battle of the American Civil War, is about to be fought. (ALERT: the next sentence has a spoiler to new readers of the series and those who have not read the previous book. Skip to the next paragraph.) Monk is newly married to Hester Latterly, and both she and to a lesser extent Sir Oliver Rathbone play important roles in the story as it develops.This is an intensely emotional story, with many disappointments and moments of frequent despair for all of the participants. While the novel has sufficient background information inserted into the storyline to be read on a standalone basis, I believe that a reader who begins the series by reading this will not appreciate the full impact of the interactions among the continuing characters in the series and many of the nuances of their relationships will be lost. The shared memories between the characters and readers will be missing, just as are in fact many of Monk's early experiences completely outside his ability to recall them. Therefore, I strongly recommend that the series be read in order. Many facts regarding both Monk's backstory and his evolving relationship with Hester Latterly, Sir Oliver Rathbone and Lady Callandra Daviot have been gradually developed in the previous installments.The tone and emphasis of the storytelling in this book is somewhat different from several of the earlier stories. It is much less simply a combination of a mystery and courtroom drama, and has much more exploration of the psychological state of the main characters and the impact of the events upon their emotions. However, it has the same interesting detail regarding English life and mores of the period.The story begins with Monk and Hester in attendance at a dinner party hosted by Daniel Alberton, an arms dealer who is involved in a deal to supply guns to be used by the South during the American Civil War, a business arrangement which his daughter Merrit views as supporting the morally repugnant institution of slavery. Also in attendance, are Daniel's wife Judith, Robert Casbolt, her cousin and Daniel's lifelong friend and business partner, and Lyman Breeland, who is representing the Union Army and attempting to convince Alberton to sell the guns to him instead. Merrit vocally supports Breland, and makes no attempt to hide her idealistic attraction to him. Alberton believes that it would be a stain on his honor to renege on his pledge to sell the guns to Philo Trace, whose deposit he has accepted, on behalf of the South. The conversation is interesting but tense at times, and that tension is heightened considerably when Trace unexpectedly arrives - in fact the hostility hints a barely suppressed violence.After the dinner Alberton approaches Monk concerning the reason for their dinner invitation. He is being threatened by a blackmailer who wants to use an innocent incident in his past in order to get him to agree to sell guns to pirates, and he wants Monk to learn the identity of the blackmailer, since for personal reasons under no circumstances will he agree to such a request.Soon the guns disappear, several murders occur, and Breeland and Merrit vanish. Monk cooperates with Inspector Lanyon who is investigating the crimes and they eventually conclude that Breeland apparently committed the murders, stole the guns, and then he and Merrit then transported them to America.Judith Alberton hires Monk to go to America and find Merrit and hopefully return to England with her and Breeland so that the truth may be revealed. Philo Trace offers to accompany him since Monk is unfamiliar with America, and Hester will also come to provide whatever assistance that she can and act as chaperone for merit on their return voyage.They manage to locate Merrit and Breeland just as the Battle of Bull Run is about to begin, and some of the most riveting scenes in the entire series involve their efforts to aid the dead and dying during the horrific slaughter which took place as the Union Army was eventually routed. Hester's nursing experience in the Crimea proves invaluable, but of course she is forced to relive those horrors as the carnage reveals the emotional toll the magnitude that he had been unable to comprehend until actually experiencing it himself. His admiration and love for Hester and awe of her fortitude and skills in the midst of such horrific conditions greatly strengthen the bond between them. At the same time, a strong bond forms between Hester and Merrit, who is forced to endure conditions unimaginable to most sixteen year old girls.Merrit's and Breeland's version of the events which led to their transport of the guns to America is completely at odds with the assumptions of the London police and Monk, and after they return to England Judith Alberton hires Sir Oliver to defend them at trial after they are arrested and Monk to investigate and hopefully find evidence to obtain a verdict of not guilty on behalf of Merrit, recognizing that her fateis inextricably linked to that of Breeland.I thoroughly enjoyed the story, and many aspects of it were the most enjoyable of any stories in the series to this point. However, while I rounded up my rating to five stars, I deducted half a star because the ending seemed rushed and truncated and detracted from my enjoyment for two related reasons. First, the conclusion of the trial was very abrupt and anti-climatic, with Rathbone's skills much less in evidence than in the previous books. Second, the final wrap up, including the discovery of the murderer, while very dramatic and interesting, seemed both contrived and with many elements foreshadowed and less surprising than readers have come to expect of the series.Tucker Andersen 1/28/2012"},{"Title":"Slaves of Obsession","review":"I have enjoyed Anne Perry's books for many years, but Slaves left me rather cold. The journey several characters make to America at the beginning of the Civil War seems so unreal, perhaps because I am a Southerner whose great-grandfathers fought on both sides of the the great divide. I think, though, that the lack of shame and consequences of a 16 yr.old girl's running away with a much older man, even crossing the ocean and becoming involved with the soldiers, is the greater cause of my dissatisfaction. Where's the outraged mother? Where are the conversations concerning her ruination and lack of future prospects due to her sullied reputation? Why did the Union officer not even think of sending her back home? The book seems hurried and Perry sounds out of her depth."},{"Title":"Slaves of Obsession","review":"Gun merchant Daniel Alberton has accepted a deposit on a huge shipment to the Confederate States of America, but an agent for the Union also wants to buy the weapons. Alberton's 16-year-old daughter, Merrit, believes herself in love with the Union agent, Lyman Breeland. After a bitter quarrel with her father, Merrit disappears from the family home; and so does Daniel. A few hours later, private investigator William Monk and Daniel Alberton's business partner find Alberton murdered and the guns stolen. Merrit Alberton and the man she loves are on their way to America - and so, presumably, are the weapons. Did Breeland kill Alberton to get the guns both sides in the American Civil War so desperately need? And if he did, was Merrit aware of fleeing the country in company with her father's murderer?William Monk and his wife, former Crimean war nurse Hester, set off for America after Judith Alberton hires Monk to bring her only child back and - if possible - also bring Breeland back, to face charges in Daniel's death. Judith does not realize that the same charges can and will be filed against Merrit. So Monk's next task, assuming he can bring the two fugitives back to England, must be to solve the case. In attempting to do that, the amnesiac Monk discovers facts about his own past life that disturb him so much that he fears telling Hester what he has learned. Will the woman he now loves so deeply, after doing his best to avoid the vulnerability of that love, still feel the same way afterward?While not perfectly plotted, this book is Perry at her best in one important respect. Her characters learn and grow as they experience the story's events, and this happens in a natural manner; at no time does it feel forced. An excellent read.--Reviewed by Nina M.

Good character development.A good read; as usual with Anne Perry! One can actually feel the quality of life in that era and the attitudes then prevalent."},{"Title":"Slaves of Obsession","review":"Ever since I began reading this series, the opening volume of which was set in 1856, I wondered if William Monk and Hester the Crimean nurse (and now Mrs. Monk) would at some point run up against the American Civil War. Well, now it's happened, and with a vengeance. It's the spring of 1861 and London arms dealer Daniel Alberton is approached by Lyman Breeland, a Union officer, in the matter of a large purchase of rifled muskets. Unfortunately for him, Philo Trace, an agent of the new Confederate States got there first and made a down payment on the weapons. Alberton's personal honor won't allow him to renege on the first deal in order to satisfy the second -- but Breeland, a coldly fanatical abolitionist, believes that anyone who disagrees with him must be evil and pro-slavery. Then Alberton is found tied up and murdered outside his warehouse and the Union agent apparently has taken the arms and boarded a ship back to America. To complicate matters, Alberton's sixteen-year-old daughter, Merrit (where does Perry get these names?), is deeply infatuated with Breeland and has eloped with him. Monk, with Hester coming along as a chaperone for the return trip, sails for Washington himself to retrieve the girl and, if possible, Breeland. While there, the wandering Brits get caught up in the opening battle at Manassas -- and Perry does an excellent job of describing the reality of 19th century warfare, as seen from just behind the lines and from a combat nurse's perspective. Sir Oliver Rathbone's skills as a trial lawyer play a smaller part in the story than usual, and the author does a better job than usual of stringing the reader along (she often telegraphs the solution rather early in the narrative). Although I kind of knew that neither Breeland nor Trace was likely to be the villain -- not if the author expected to sell many copies in the U.S. As an aside, though, I wish the writer of the jacket copy could be bothered to read the book first. Then he might not identify the Union officer as \\"Breedlove.\\" And a couple of volumes ago, William Monk was referred to on the jacket as \\"Thomas,\\" the writer obviously conflating him with the protagonist of Perry's other, longer-running mystery series. Very sloppy."},{"Title":"Slaves of Obsession","review":"This was my first Anne Perry novel (audio abridgment). I found it to be entertaining and it moved along quite well.William Monk is one of Perry's regular characters. Set in Victorian England there is a cast of characters with passionate beliefs and different motivations. I suspected one to be the evil antagonist--but discovered it was not him as the story progressed. (All the clues are not available within an abridgment.)There were a few interesting twists...and the break from the underwater sequence with Monk kept me on edge.In the book you embark on a voyage to America coinciding with the beginning of the American Civil War. Hester and William Monk travel by boat on a mission to bring back the run-away daughter of Albertson. Meritt's confused passion for the abolishment of slavery is exhibited as a romantic crush for Lyman...a Northerner bent on purchasing guns from her father-- despite Albertson's continued refusal to sell them to him. Albertson's murder just happens to concide with the gun delivery to Lyman.The return to England takes you through the trial and the revelation of what actually happens after both Lyman and Meritt are acquitted of wrong doing.This engaging work will put Anne Perry on my list of authors to explore further."},{"Title":"Slaves of Obsession","review":"This is a good Victorian mystery, but not as great as Anne Perry's other works. I am a particular fan of the William Monk series, so I was a bit disappointed with this one. I found that it was very easy to get the mystery. Ms. Perry's characters are still good, and very well drawn. Her description of the Battle of Bull Run was quite refreshing. Having the story take place in two continents is a bit different for her, but I like the American segment quite well. I do hope further William Monk stories will be as good as all the others previously were."},{"Title":"Slaves of Obsession","review":"In Slaves of Obsession, Anne Perry has expanded Hester and Monk's world to include a trip to America at the start of the Civil War. Monk finds war horrific. Having always considered himself a brave man able to face death he is frightened by his reaction to the destruction. On the other hand Hester rises to the occasion. Her battle experience puts her in the position of strength. This glimpse into his wife's past fills Monk with admiration and a greater understanding of Hester's past.All the characters have a noble obsession, which contributes to their downfall. Whether is it love or glory or freedom it infects their reason bringing death in its wake. The plot is clever and holds the reader's interest.An excellent novel, I highly recommend it"},{"Title":"Slaves of Obsession","review":"This is my first foray into the work of Anne Perry, noted English author of two extensive Victorian detective series, those featuring William and Hester Monk and those with Thomas and Charlotte Pitt. This is a Monk mystery. It is my belief that a mystery to work must be believable, both in it character motivations and plot twists and turns. With that as a benchmark, several things about this book trouble me. I didn't believe the critical love story aspect of a 16-year old girl and a man more than twice her age; nor did I believe that this cold and distant man would have given her an expensive watch as a keepsake. It seems like just a gimmick so that when the watch shows up at the scene of the crime it becomes a red herring. And although this event was much discussed, it was never rationalized as to how it happened. Further, the crime involved the stealing of state-of-the-art guns and ammunition to support the Union troops in the Civil War. Although the crime was supposed to have happened and the weapons reached American (how I still do not understand), no tangible evidence showed this, especially with the Union soldiers being badly beaten in an initial conflict by the confederates with one of the reasons for the loss being their unreliable arms. The climax of the novel came out of nowhere with Monk descending in complicated and heavy scuba gear for the very first time to search for a missing barge. Why didn't he send police divers? Obviously, Perry was looking to increase tension at any cost to the believability of the book. And the resultant find of unusable weaponry makes no sense to me at all. Nor does the conclusions drawn from this episode. Another thing I found annoying was the repeated writing style of having one of the characters ask a very important question, then Perry giving a long descriptive paragraph before telling us the answer to the question. I did give the book two stars, because I did enjoy the Monk characters, but the plots and sub-characters lost me. Because of her reputation, I might try another Perry book, but one featuring the Pitts this time."},{"Title":"Slaves of Obsession","review":"SLAVES Of OBSESSION takes place in the year 1861 in Victorian England, and takes the reader across the Atlantic Ocean to the American Civil War and the Battlefield at ManassasThe story begins in England with a dinner party where William and Hester Monk are the guests of Daniel and Judith Alberton. The Alberton's are quite wealthy. Daniel, an arms dealer, has apparently made a fortune selling weapons. Merrit, their daughter is also there. She appears to hang on the words of one of the guests. The dinner is rather tense since two of the guests are young American men. Philo Trace is a Confederate sympathizer and Lyman Breeland is a Union officer. Both men are there to buy guns to be used in the American Civil War. Daniel Alberton has to decide to which of the two Americans he will sell his weapons.When an unexpected death takes place, William Monk, as an investigator, is determined to find the killer and travels to America to do so.This story really held my attention because it brought the American Civil War into the fray and gave the reader a different outlook of that time period."},{"Title":"Slaves of Obsession","review":"I have read each William Monk novel before this one and have enjoyed them all very much. I love the characters of William Monk and Hester Latterly and think that Perry has done a tremendous job of developing their relationship from antagonism to friendship and respect to love and marriage throughout the series. She also has a wonderful grasp of the Victorian era. I feel like the time period practically jumps from the page in her hands.However, Slaves of Obsession was not my favorite of the series (so far) which is unfortunate because I think the idea of the novel is wonderful. In my opinion, Perry should have spent more time with Hester and Monk in America and less time in the courtroom with Sir Oliver Rathbone. None of the characters, besides the ongoing characters of Monk, Hester and Sir Oliver, are any more than one dimensional. The courtroom verdict is rendered in two paragraphs and the resolution of the mystery is shoddily explained in the last few pages. It seems that with so many mysteries you can count on the person in the novel least likely to be the culprit will, in the end, be the guilty party. I don't remember that being the case with Perry's previous mysteries but it definitely is with this one.I highly recommend the William Monk series to everyone. But, I suggest reading the novels in order to fully appreciate the wonderful characters Perry has created in Monk and Hester."},{"Title":"Slaves of Obsession","review":"If I'd had known how good this book was, I'd have gotten it from the library when it first came out in hardcover!

The way she incorporates history into the story, you can believe that the tale is an actual part of the true history. She is so talented and creative.Slaves of Obsessions evolves with the guns needed for the Union and Confederate States of America to fight the Civil War. You will find a devoted family, the Albertons, in the center of it, complete with an idealist daughter passionate on the subject of slavery. There is a triple murder, the daughter disappears,and guns are stolen. Mrs. Alberton hires our heroes, William and Hester Monk, to find answers. The case takes them to the battlefields in America, the trial in England, with another hero, Oliver Rathbone, as the guy with the right questions. The story has Hester running for her husband's life, bringing the good guys to the rescue in the nick of time. And thank God, we do not want to be losing the Monks. There are more mysteries to solve."},{"Title":"Slaves of Obsession","review":"Anne Perry seems so thoroughly to have absorbed the Victorian zeitgeist that she writes like a paid-by-the-word contractor. Old acquaintances Hester (nee Latterley, now Monk), William Monk and Sir Oliver Rathbone assume their usual stances, although much less than usual is made of Monk's amnesia (now extensively but not fully resolved). The ingenious and gripping story travels from upper-class London to the US at the beginning of The War Between the States and back again to Great Britain and its judiciary system. Unfortunately, innumerable obsessively repetitive passages about the emotions and ruminations of our three major protagonists; about the beauty, loyalty and vulnerability of Judith Alberton and her daughter; about the physical details of London's streets and waterways; and about the horrors and carnage of war severely impair the narrative flow and this reader's patience. Once or twice through each of these digressions would have been enough. Ordinarily I consider abridgement an abomination but, since no editor wielded a pre-publication blue pencil, judicious post-publication condensation might just be the answer."},{"Title":"Slaves of Obsession","review":"Not one of the stronger entries in the series, SLAVES OF OBSESSION suffers from too many set pieces and not enough of the emotional complexity usually found in this series. Far too much time is spent on the philosophical battle between Union and Confederate issues; battles better detailed in many other works, and not enough on developing a strong narrative. The trip to America for Monk and Hester to recapture an American and his runaway English teen on a charge of murder is relatively ridiculous and only serves as an opportunity for Perry to showcase Hester's nursing ability. It's an interesting scene, but really just fills pages and does not move the narrative forward. Even the mystery's solution resolution left me less than satisfied, a perfunctory ending to a pedestrian entry in the series."},{"Title":"Slaves of Obsession","review":"This book brought the Civil War to life for me and showed the darker side of fighting for a nobel cause. This was the first book I have read by Anne Perry and I really enjoyed the simple, yet elegant way that she writes her mystery novels. She does not need to use overly elaborate symbolism or words to make a great novel. Instead it is a beautifully written &quot;who-done-it&quot; that keeps you guessing all the time. This is a good book for anyone who likes mystery novels from Nancy Drew to Agatha Christy."},{"Title":"Slaves of Obsession","review":"Starts off well, interesting characters, but I lost interest about halfway through.

I thoroughly enjoyed Ms. Perry's first William Monk story, &quot;The Face of a Stranger,&quot; as the character she created was interesting and his dilemma intriguing. However, I did not feel that &quot;Slaves of Obsession&quot; held the same fascination. There was very little about the inner workings and turmoils of Monk and, as always, there was too much time and attention devoted to Hester. &quot;Slaves of Obsession&quot; had the feel of a soap box rather than a tale of intrigue. I do not like Ms. Perry's obsession with placing twentieth century philosophy and social values in the nineteenth century--the characters' outlandish and grandiose future-reaching thoughts are misplaced and feel that way. Ms. Perry has the ability to weave a compelling story but this was not one of them.

The glimpse of the American Civil War from the British side is as enlightening as much as observing the English justice system at work. SLAVES OF OBSESSION is constructed in such a way so as to the make the mystery seem obvious until the protagonists begin to dig for the truth.

When the businessman is murdered, the Northerner flees to America with the guns...and the businessman's daughter. But did he kill the businessman? Monk and Hester are up to the task of sorting the whole thing out...or are they?I found the first third of the book to be very exciting, especially the scenes that occur in America. Monk, for the first time, now becomes graphically aware of what Hester has seen and experienced as he watches the brutal battles of the Civil War. (Monk also learns more about his forgotten past in this volume.) As Monk and Hester search for answers in America, they learn a lot about themselves.Sadly, after Monk and Hester arrive back to England, the book really drags down. Perry just keeps hammering the same clues over and over again until the reader finally doesn't care who is exposed as the murderer (although it's fairly easy to figure out). Monk's wit and intellect are usually sharp as a tack, but he really seems slow-witted in figuring out what's going on in this story. After her return from America, Hester might as well change the sheets on beds in hospital rooms...she has very little to do with the remainder of the story. The courtroom scenes in this story are the least inspired of all the Monk stories thus far. &quot;Slaves of Obsession&quot; feels like a book that was well thought out for about the first half of the story. After that, it feels like the ending was thrown together in time to meet a deadline.

I'm also glad that Perry doesn't have him simply recover from Hester's marriage to another man, but has him deal with the pain.Perry is extremely good at making her characters human. In these books, the &quot;good guys&quot; and the &quot;bad guys&quot; are not so easy to tell apart. In this story, the man who fights for the right cause is a pompous, vain jerk whom very few can sympathize with, while the man on the wrong side is a very likable person.

And with her usual writing abilities, Perry treats her readers to another exciting episode in this series.Extortion is the subject here, as Monk, former policeman and now working privately, is hired to track down a killer who has fled to America, and, combined with murder early on, this investigation begins to have so many aspects that it cannot be called \\"simple.\\" Perry is good at this, however, and never seems to lose track of her goal. She is also good at incorporating history into her police procedurals and pulls no punches as she addresses the slavery issue, arms shipments, and medical practices of the time (Remember, Hester was a nurse during the British Crimean War and now renders aid on the Manassas battlefield!).Perry, using her standard powers of description and episode, readily shows the carnage, the butchery of the battlefield in readily graphic depictions. Her descriptions, as usual, are not for the faint at heart. By the book's end, of course, Monk has sorted out the convoluted paths to justice and sensibility. American readers may praise \\"Slaves of Obsession\\" as one of her best, owing to the locale; regardless, this book shows a maturity that perhaps was there in, say, \\"Cater Street Hangman.\\" ..."},{"Title":"Slaves of Obsession","review":"A dark tale that deals with the concepts of obsession, betrayal and love. Anne Perry with her usual brilliance spins an intricate tale that will keep the reader glued to the page. A word of caution though: read the last third of the book with careful attention, otherwise certain facts that are revealed will be missed and the resolution to the mystery will make no sense. (Unlike some mystery writers, Anne Perry does provide the reader with all the clues to the crime that has been committed, so that we may arrive at the conclusion along with the detective.)William and Hester Monk are invited to dine with Daniel and Judith Alberton. Also at the dinner party are Robert Casblot, Judith's cousin and Daniel's business partner; the Alberton's sixteen year old daughter Merrit; and Lyman Breeland, an American from Conneticut. Soon it becomes evident to the Monks that there are some rather uncomfortable undercurrents swirling around at the dinner table. Soon all is revealed, especially with the intrusion of another American, Philo Trace, to the dinner party. Amongst other things Daniel Alberton also deals in guns. Both Breeland and Trace represent the North and the South respectively, and both want to buy guns from Alberton. Much to Merrit's disgust her father having agreed to sell to Trace first, will not renege on his word and sell to Breeland whose cause she believes in passionately.However it soon becomes evident that the Monks have been invited for a particular reason. Daniel Alberton is being blackmailed for an act of kindness that could be misconstrued. The blackmailers want him to sell his guns to pirates instead of the Americans. Selling to pirates is something Alberton absolutely refuses to do and so he hires Monk to try and discover who the blckmailers could be. But while Monk is in the middle of this investigation, Alberton is murdered in an absolutely brutal manner, and the guns that were to be sold to Trace are stolen. And there is horrifying fear is that Merrit may somehow be involved in her father's death. Both father and daughter had a really bad falling out and parted company bitterly; and at first it looked as if she had merely runaway with Breeland. But with Alberton murdered and the guns are missing, could there be a more sinister connection?. Could Merrit and Breeland really have perpetrated such a horrendous crime for a cause they both believe in?Judith Alberton hires Monk to go to American and to bring Merrit back even if she has to face the accusation of having conspired to murder her father. Monk undertakes to bring both Breeland amd Merrit back to England. It seems clearcut: somehow Breeland murdered Alberton and stole the guns, and has either kidnapped Merrit or is using her to cover his guilt. However, once Monk catches up with the couple, he begins to doubt if they had anything to do with the crime at all. Because there is no escaping a court case, Judith Alberton hires Oliver Rathbone to defend both Merrit and Breeland. So while Rathbone tries to fight for the couple in court, Monk works against time, scouring all over the docks and warehouses trying to find evidence to set the couple free.This is quite a complex tale eventhough it seems clearcut at first. Merrit's and Breeland's guilt seems obvious but once Monk starts investigating for the defense, other facts come to light that could save the two. Anne Perry does a wonderful job at drawing out the mystery and padding the novel with philosophical ideas on the concepts of obsession and love. Also, she does not preach one cause over the other, making us see both sides of the American Civil War debate. But where this book absolutely shines is in the glimpses of war that she provides us with through Hester Monk's eyes. Having survived the Crimean War, Hester is again thrown into the horrors of war when she tries to provide help at the battle of Bull Run. The absolute horror and wastefulness of a war is brilliantly captured in these few chapters, and is what makes this book really stand out.A book that will keep you ruminating long after you've finished the novel."},{"Title":"Slaves of Obsession","review":"I have been a fan of Anne Perry's Monk series since the start. During the first half of this novel I was impressed and felt this was the best in the series since the first two or three. Hester and Monk's relationship was better depicted in this book than in the last one, although at times their chemistry still seems a bit arbitrary. The battle scenes are compelling and gripping. I was fascinated by a British viewpoint of our Civil War. However, in too many of her recent works, the villain is predictable and obvious from the moment of introduction, primarily because she keeps using the same tired plot twist. As I read the second half of this novel, the &quot;trial with Oliver taking on yet another impossible defense&quot; half, I kept hoping that Perry would surprise me and I would be wrong about the villain. She didn't and I wasn't. As for the very end, Perry introduced us to the wonderful technology of mid 19th-century underwater diving, only to rush through it way too fast. The concluding paragraph is particularly hasty, as though Perry wrote it on her way to mail the manuscript to her publisher."},{"Title":"Slaves of Obsession","review":"I didn't expect much from this book, the reviews weren't great. I liked it a lot. I bought the book some time ago and hadn't gotten around to it because of the reviews. When I sat down and started reading I finished it which frankly is unusual for an Anne Perry book. I like her writing but sometimes it doesn't grab me right away. This book did grab me and I remain a devoted fan of Ms. Perry. I have ordered her next book and will not let it sit on the shelf before reading it."},{"Title":"Slaves of Obsession","review":"Anne Perry is an exqusite writer. Her prose is beautiful and she evokes the era of Victorian England in a wonderful and believable way. In the latest book of this series William Monk and his bride Hester are invited to dinner at the home of Donald Alberton, an arms dealer. An unpleasant scene occurs when Lyman Breeland, a passionate supporter of the Union discovers that Alberton has already promised a shipment of guns to Philo Trace, a southerner. Alberton's daughter, Merrit, is in love with Breeland and she argues with him for her father to support the anti-slavery stand. Alberton claims that he has promised the guns to Trace and cannot back out of the deal, despite his personal feelings about the war in America. Breeland and Merrit flee and one of the main characters is brutally murdered. Breeland's watch is found near the murder scene, which puts the suspicion squarely on him. The rest of the book shifts to American Civil War battlefields and then to a courtroom in England. The identity of the murderer is elusive and is twisted with personal and political motives. As always, Perry provides a very good read."},{"Title":"Slaves of Obsession","review":"I'm used to Anne Perry coming up with a twist in the motive that catches me by surprise even when the killer was spotted much earlier in the book. I wasted my time trying to think of the most lurid possible motive. On the other hand, the Secret of the Incredible Disappearing Barge was one I hadn't seen coming.I give nothing away by stating that Lyman Breeland is a jerk cut from the same cloth as Peter Kreisler from TRAITOR'S GATE. In fact, I could hear Lady Vespasia commenting on their type in my head during one of his early appearances. But does that mean he's guilty?Philo Trace seems to be a really great guy even if he is from the slave-owning South. Is it all just a mask?I'm not going to automatically condemn one side or the other in my country's Civil War. My father's family fought for the South. My mother's family is from the North. I thought Anne Perry did a pretty even-handed job of presenting Breeland and Trace's viewpoints. However, I don't recall any of the English characters comparing or contrasting the American Civil War with England's Civil War. I found that odd.At least having Hester and William at the scene of a bloody battle, besides being the best part of the book, enabled William to understand Hester better. I wonder if Hester is going to exhibit symptoms of post-traumatic stress syndrome in a later book.Speaking of later books, I hope Anne Perry follows up on the tantalizing clue to Monk's past discovered in this one. Could he really have done anything as disgusting as he fears he might have?Have fun speculating on whether Ms.Perry meant anything by giving her characters names such as &quot;Lyman&quot;, which sounds like &quot;lie, man&quot;; &quot;Meritt&quot;, and &quot;Philo Trace&quot;. Don't expect much from the courtroom scenes, although I did like the way Rathbone's opponent gave Breeland a well-deserved setdown."},{"Title":"Slaves of Obsession","review":"Having been intrigued by the characters in the Monk series from the first, I'm happy to have just read Slaves of Obsession. I don't always think the plots in this series run smoothly, but I think Perry did a nice job with this one. While there are of course characters going around broadcasting their philosophies (after all, this is Perry), they are different ones than we usually read, and by different people. The elements in the story seem to be well-balanced and the ending makes sense in light of the rest of the story. And how interesting to read about the American civil war from a British perspective! Perry has also done nice work with portraying Monk and Hester's relationship."},{"Title":"The Elton John Keyboard Book","review":"This book has exactly what Elton John plays on the piano, for pretty much all of his best songs. It even includes some of the other instrumental parts if you want to incorporate some of them into your playing. Awesome stuff for anyone who wants to learn to accompany these songs. Elton John was quite a good pianist though so some of the parts can be quite hard if you're not a competent piano player."},{"Title":"The Elton John Keyboard Book","review":"These songs are the real thing-written by SEJ himself! The level is intermediate to advanced but I am going to enjoy the challenge."},{"Title":"The Elton John Keyboard Book","review":"First of all this is a great keyboard book, for learning the precise methods for playing some of Elton's excellent work. The quality of the transcriptions is great. You'll learn a ton.My only complaint is with regard to 4 of the songs selected for this type of detailed transcription treatment. Specifically, you will find the following 4 songs to be uneducational:- Honkey Cat (10 pages of very repetetive material. Wasteful)- Crocodile Rock (Not a great song for learning the Elton style. If you want the chords, you can find them anywhere)- Empty Garden (Same comment)- Friends (Same comment)Now don't get me wrong; All of these are great songs, but these 4 are not worthy of a book devoted to detailed transcriptions of intricate material. Every other song in the book is worthy, and is also transcribed excellently. Again a great learning tool.Here are 4 songs that should have been done in place of the 4 above. Then the book would be a solid 5 stars!- Take me to the Pilot- Funeral for Friend- Loves Lies Bleeding- Skyline Pigeon (live version keyboard arrangement)Bottom line: Buy the book, it's great, but recognize that you will be disappointed with the 4 songs above, and wishing that the editors had done a little bit better."},{"Title":"The Elton John Keyboard Book","review":"Accuracy and helpfulness is high...generally accurate, and definitely helpful when trying to emulate Elton's songs,--especially if singing and working to catch essence of EJ's original recordings.Wish I'd had these in the 70's!"},{"Title":"The Elton John Keyboard Book","review":"This book is perfect for the advanced-intermediate piano player. After working with these songs you will see a great increase in your chord sight reading, plus these are a lot of fun, although Elton's vocal range is sky high. The down side is some of the songs don't include all the instruments (such as bass/backing vocals/guitar in Candle in the Wind) and some songs cannot really be played solo piano by the arrangement given because they incorporate xylophones, piano II, electric piano, or whathaveyou (Crocodile Rock, Honky Cat.) Still a tremendous amount of fun. Worth every cent."},{"Title":"The Elton John Keyboard Book","review":"I just received the three books and they are great. As you progress reading and listening to what you play, you can recognize their notes (BJ, EJ, Beatles) as actually performed. Great to see how those songs come out from your hands and piano!!!But..Song for Guy is missing!!! May be in a next edition. They are worth your money."},{"Title":"The Elton John Keyboard Book","review":"Item came in very good condition and is exactly that of which was described. Would recommend to others. A definitely deserved 5 stars."},{"Title":"The Elton John Keyboard Book","review":"This is a very good book for all the reasons stated (mainly that we have here the exact piano arrangements from the songs), but I think the song selection could have been better. Most of the songs that most piano-playing fans would want are here, but the omission of Levon is a real bummer. In fact, there are several great piano songs on \\"Madman Across the Water\\" that I would have included before fluff like \\"Don't Go Breakin' My Heart.\\" Let's hope there's a volume two where they go beyond the predictable hit songs."},{"Title":"The Elton John Keyboard Book","review":"My 13 year old Granddaughter wanted music by Elton John to play on the piano.

But much to my astonishment, it is'nt. Being a fan of EJ for over 20 years who enjoys playing his songs (for leisure only, of course), I can tell from the transcriptions, simply by looking at it, that the Publisher is true in advertising it as the authentic piano transcriptions. The only complaint I have with this book is that there are 2 to 3 songs which are in fact not that popular, and should have been replaced by more popular ones such as &quot;Sorry seems to be the hardest word&quot; and &quot;Skyline Pigeons&quot; etc. I am also puzzled why &quot;Friends&quot; were included but &quot;Seasons&quot; were not. Anyway, this is only a minute flaw which bears no significance comparing with the great joy that I get from this book. I hope that the publisher will consider publishing Vol. 2. One word of opinion : get the Billy Joel Keyboard Book as well. BJ is as good as EJ!"},{"Title":"The Elton John Keyboard Book","review":"Here you'll find Elton John's music transcribed down to a tee. This is a welcome change to nonsensical 'interpretations' that conspicuously sound exactly the same as the melody line. You want to play 'Bennie and the Jets' from the starting heavy chords to the verse to the jazzy piano solo, here you go. Blue Eyes, Rocket Man, Someone Saved My Life Tonight (excellent song)... it's all here. In some instances (like Honky Cat for example), there's just no point in bothering to learn the music EXACTLY, because Elton John just improvised within chords in the first place. So it's best for you to do the same unless you want to pore through pages of the same music phrased slightly differently. Next time it would be better to include the more 'precise' songs in Elton's catalogue.Anyway, this is a great collection. Some of the songs aren't very well known but get the album they're on and you're away.

The transcriptions are almost perfect. My only complaint is a couple of the songs that weren't included (Levon, Burn Down the Mission), but the songs that are included more than make up for it."},{"Title":"The Elton John Keyboard Book","review":"I bought this book a few years ago, and have been enjoying it immensely ever since. It is very true to the original recordings, and is good for several things. Students of music will learn piano voicings, chord changes, licks, and solos of one of the best piano players in popular music. That will make you a better player and better songwriter, if that's your thing. I'm not a great piano player, but my playing has vastly improved partly because of hours spent at the piano playing tunes from this book. Some are more difficult than others and will challenge the experienced keyboardists. Others are fairly simple and easier for the intermediate players. Either way you will greatly benefit from this book, whether you want to play these tunes backed up by a band, whether you are learning these tunes for your own gigs, or whether you just want to entertain yourself at home. (a big plus: you'll be a hit at parties if you can sit down at a piano and play any number of these tunes, like \\"tiny dancer\\" or \\"rocket man\\" or \\"goodbye yellow brick road\\"). Don't hesitate to buy this book, it is accurate and user-friendly."},{"Title":"The Elton John Keyboard Book","review":"I found this book to be a great resource not only for performing Elton's songs but to analyze his stylistic traits and chord progressions from a theoretical standpoint. After sitting down for two hours just listening and reading along (which I recommend doing), I feel like I real know Elton (musically, that is). A must-have if you plan to cover these songs in a band or just entertain yourself and your friends.Having said that, I think the editors got a little lazy in parts. The 'fills' as they call them are not consistently written and hard to follow when playing. There are also a few 'throwaway' songs, made to make the book longer but having no real appeal to anyone except EJ freaks. I'd much rather have Levon, Take Me To The Pilot, Grey Seal, Burn Down the Mission and Funeral for A Friend than Empty Garden, Blue Eyes, Friends and Little Jeannie. We'll have to hope for additions in the 3rd Edition, but what's in there is more than enough to get your feet wet!

Whilst there is an obvious overall work of transcribing the original recording, it's not fully perfect.I spotted a number of mistakes. Including:1) First bar of 'Your Song'.2) Forth bar of 'Mona Lisas And Had Hatters' (A-F chord descend).Dedicated Elton John transcriber Glen at Elton's Cafe pointed out that 'Crocodile Rock' isn't as accurate as his.Another big problem I have is on a number of songs, second verses (and sometimes beyond) are placed on the music transcribed for the first verse. I don't know if it was to save paper/costs, or just a naive idea?I'd also be careful with the UKElton John: The Piano Transcriptionsbook (sporting a few different songs as well), in which I've spotted similar issues. However, this (EJKB) does appear to have a more accurate (or possibly indeed 'accurate') transcription (note other instruments are usually covered too at select sections, which is nice) of 'Bennie And The Jets' compared to the UK book (which I believe, features no coverage of other instruments), which can be bizarrely different at times."},{"Title":"The Elton John Keyboard Book","review":"This book has revolutionized the way I play the keyboard. Often times, printed sheet music is only a loose guide for what is actually played on a recorded track.

Every inch of this small book has information on it: inside the covers are vintage charts, and each page is full of information rather than loads of illustrations. THe illustrations that are included are well-selected and useful (maps, labels from the most important makers, etc.)This book is organized in an encylopedia format, with everything from the wine-growing region of Abruzzo to the varietal Zinfandel covered. In addition Clarke includes his top wines of the year, modern wine style, matching food and wine, serving and storing suggestions.Moreover the book is readable--something that few wine encyclopedias are.

Some B/W illustrations too. I'm glad Duval left out the slang and misspellings of frontier English and used a normal modern English.We see Big Foot Wallace originally from Virginia living in Texas. We see him as a level headed frontiersman who hunted deer, turkeys and bear and honey. We see his escapades with rattlesnakes and tarantulas. Wallace did have a sense of humor. Parts of the book are funny.Then we see him as an Indian hunter who really wanted to be left alone by the Indians but if his possessions were stolen or if threatened would fight and kill them with a vengeance. We see him captured by Indians and living as an adopted \\"son\\" by an old squaw and later helped to escape by her other son.Later we see Big Foot Wallace as a ranger and a soldier against Mexico. He is captured and some men are sentenced to be executed by Santa Anna. They draw black and white beans. If black they are killed. Luckily Wallace draws a white bean and after a few years as a prisoner is released.We see him in New Orleans getting used to city life. Then he gets news he is to report to Virginia to get part of an inheritance.Later he tries his hand at farming on 200 acres he bought and built a small ranch house.

It's a great book for love, friendship and at a loss as what to do. The theme of this book is sometimes friends have to force themselves do something that he/she doesn't want to. I recommend this book to those young children and adults who have been lost as to what to do."},{"Title":"Of Mice and Men (Penguin Audiobooks)","review":"this book is an excellent between two friends in the heart of the Great Depression in the 30's.

I have read the book a few time and it gets better every time. John Steinbeck was very creative to think of the character Lennie, and the troubles he was in. I also watch the movie and it did give the book some justice. It was almost the same way I pictured it while reading. In this book you do see the side of someone who is not very smart at all. I enjoyed this book very much and Will more in likely Pick it up again."},{"Title":"Of Mice and Men (Penguin Audiobooks)","review":"Of Mice and Men was about the best book I have ever read. It's a story of George and Lenny, two men that have not much more than each other. It's a captivating book, but not one to read if you like exciting, happily ever after endings. John Steinbeck is not that kind of writer. Everything that happens in the book is foreshadowed, and by the end it has you saying, &quot;Oh, that's why he wrote whate he wrote in the beginning.&quot; It's a great book and a must read for high school students."},{"Title":"Of Mice and Men (Penguin Audiobooks)","review":"I thought the book was preatty cool.

Steinbeck\`s technique of making books come alive is very visible in this novel. The story between the two main characters George and Lennie was very touching, and their experiences on a farm were richly described. But I think that this coming-of-age tale could of been so much better if it were longer and more elaborate. Other than the length, &quot;Of Mice and Men&quot; is a fantastic book."},{"Title":"Of Mice and Men (Penguin Audiobooks)","review":"In this great novel, John Steinbeck captures the ever-hopeful aspect of human nature. He shows us how it's our dreaming that keeps us going, even when we know success is not likely. Of Mice and Men is a tale of hopes, dreams, and friendship. The two main characters, George and Lennie, illustrate how intelligence and capability are not the most important qualities in a friend. What's important are shared dreams and the willingness to simply be there for someone. Set in the ranch country near California's Gabilan Mountains in the 1930's, this tragic tale depicts the human condition in all its sorrow, beauty, and frailty."},{"Title":"Of Mice and Men (Penguin Audiobooks)","review":"I watched the movie first, starring John Malkovich and Gary Sinise and was so captivated by the touching story that I just couldn't get it out of my mind till I can buy a copy of the book and read it for myself. But boy, was I disappointed!! Although the movie followed the novel very closely, I was expecting more from the novel. The story was great but I really feel that the characterization of George and Lennie could be more developed in the novel."},{"Title":"Of Mice and Men (Penguin Audiobooks)","review":"This moving and interesting tale takes place during the great depression. It is a time when people look out for themselves and no one else. For some reason, George feels honour bound to take care of his mentally challenged friend Lenny.

I would strongly recommend reading the poem since it sheds light on the novel. It is very much in keeping with the naturalistic philosophy behind OF MICE AND MEN. (If you are a teacher and are teaching the novel, you might find it interesting to make the students predict, on the basis of the poem, what the outcome of the novel will be.)By the way, some critics say that OF MICE AND MEN is not a naturalistic novel, since George exercises his free will in his final decision. An interesting point to discuss, isn't it?"},{"Title":"Of Mice and Men (Penguin Audiobooks)","review":"Steinbeck spins a tragic tale of friendship between a nomadic working stiff and his dim witted friend, a legacy from his dying aunt. The story plays itself out in a depression era farm where the dim wit with his infantile obsession with touching soft things inadventently ends up murdering the attention starved farm owner's daughter-in-law.

It captures your heart. It is the story of George Milton and Lennie Small. They struggle together to fight the realities of the American society. All they want is to own a farm of their own with horses, chickens, cows and rabbits. George is short tempered but always looks out for his friend Lenny. Lenny is mentally ill to a degree and thinks like a kid, but he has unbelievable strength. He is a giant man. When he is scared he pets anything soft. It may be a dead mouse that he always carries in his pocket, a dress or a woman's hair. This book is written in a poetic form. It truely shows the struggle of men looking for jobs what the jobs consist of when they get them. Their relationship is stronger than any other relationship. They are bonded together by the care they have for each other. Unfortunatley, there is a time when you have no control of your friend's fate..."},{"Title":"Of Mice and Men (Penguin Audiobooks)","review":"\\"Of Mice and Men\\" by John Steinbeck remains properly on the reading lists of high school students because of the regional imagery through succinct dialogue. Unlike \\"Grapes of Wrath,\\" Steinbeck brings us swiftly into each moment, never letting us linger too long before walking us to the next place.The American Dream has many variations, but always, it is about independence and the pride of being one's own man. Lennie and George want this independence more than most men, but have less than most men to get there. In their case, it isn't a white picket fence, but a farm where they can raise rabbits.Lennie is not a bright man. He desires to care for someone and to be loved, but is unable to think past his own fear. George tries to protect him, but he too, although smarter than Lennie, is managed by his insecurity and foolishness.The story surrounds Lennie and George's efforts to get and retain work on ranch near Soledad, and more so, toward their American Dream. The big picture is always with them, but it is the day-by-day difficulties they have with being outsiders. Their intrinsic inability to be free is sheer tragedy, as they both fail again and again to make the right decision.It's a lonely story about two men who hope more than they can think, who are destined by their misery never to enjoy true companionship and happiness.Few books are as thematically pure as \\"Of Mice and Men,\\" which follows Man's search for self and meaning carefully. It is harsh in language and image, and the abstract ideas might be too much for younger readers to comprehend, but any intelligent teen will gain from it where John Knowles' \\"A Separate Peace\\" and J.D. Salinger's \\"The Catcher in the Rye\\" leave off.I fully recommend \\"Of Mice and Men\\" by John Steinbeck.Anthony Trendleditor, HungarianBookstore.com"},{"Title":"Of Mice and Men (Penguin Audiobooks)","review":"There is not a wasted word in Of Mice and Men. An unforgettable and brillaint work by John Steinbeck. It is clear why this is a classic. Every emotion on the spectrum is represented somewhere in this concise and gripping story of the enduring and heartfelt friendship/guardianship between Lennie and George. I loved it, and to think this was first published in 1937, it feels like much more modern writing. Reflecting on novelists since, it is clear that Steinbeck was ahead of his time and an early pioneer of captivating American writing. Splendid and tragic."},{"Title":"Of Mice and Men (Penguin Audiobooks)","review":"This story is a simple one in many ways. It's about the Depression, class relations, friendship, and how we treat people with disabilities. It has as much relevance today as it did when it first came out. I read it years ago, and I still remember it. As another reviewer mentioned, it says a great deal about the importance of Steinbeck's message that Lenny has been recreated in so many Warner Brothers cartoons -- he's an archetypical character.I loved how vividly Steinbeck brought the reader back to the Great Depression. He really showed how difficult that time period was, and the way the &quot;American Dream&quot; has been sold to people who will likely never reach it. The relationship between Lenny and George was absolutely wonderful -- I loved that George did try to take care of Lenny, even if I didn't like how he treated him at times. All the characters were full bodied, three dimensional people. The choices Steinbeck had them make seemed sensible. This novel is essentially flawless, and I would reccommend it to anyone over the age of about 12 -- it does have some rather serious themes, so readers who are very young, even if they can read it (its' written in fairly simple language) might find some parts disturbing. If you didn't read this book in high school, read it now -- you'll be glad you did."},{"Title":"Of Mice and Men (Penguin Audiobooks)","review":"I like it how john steinbeck picked the characters. George being the smaller individual who had the brains and was a nicer looking guy and Lennie being the very big strong guy with being mentally challenged. george could have went back on his word to lennies aunt and left him to be put in an asylum but he kept his word and took care of lennie and soon became best friends with lots of trusts in each other. Curley's wife now presomed to me as a kind of girl or woman that sleeps around alot a\\\\or thats how she acts when she was first introduced but come time to the end she was just looking for somebody to talk to. Curley was a little different he always wanted to picked a fight with the new people that are bigger than him so he would be known as the head huancho.this story was well put together as a wrighter for john steinbeck having his life time thirty years or more years between our time life is pretty much the same beside the migratoty workers which there are still some around."},{"Title":"Of Mice and Men (Penguin Audiobooks)","review":"George and Lennie are very good friends.

Lennie was not very smart. He got himself into alot of trouble because he could not understand many situations.

He did all the thinking that Lennie could not do himself. He had patience with Lennie, while other could not. No matter what he still stuck with Lennie and took care of him. Together, they had a dream and wanted so bad to reach it that they felt it was always within one step their grasp.This book showed the greatness of friendship.

I usually do not enjoy reading, but this book was able to keep me interested and I actually read it in one sitting, this book is one that you really cannot put down once you pick it up. The simplistic storyline allows readers of all levels to enjoy the story and not get lost, yet is not too simple that the novelette becomes boring.At the start of the novel, we are introduced to George and Lennie the novel's two main characters. They are fleeing from their former hometown because Lennie has gotten the duo into trouble again. It is not that Lennie is a troublesome character, as that he is unaware of his physical strength. This physical stature combined with his nave nature, which is due to his mental disability, causes many problems for him and George. The two dream of owning their own ranch one day with many fields and rabbits for Lennie. To fulfill this dream they work on a ranch to earn and save money. While on the ranch Lennie is subjected to many awkward situations. George's loyalty to Lennie is often challenged by his friend's mishaps, he always remains true.

It is a beautiful tale, written with great economy, and incredibly has little or no purpose beyond its universe of emotional trial and loss. There is no ideological mission, no politically correct mission. There is no propaganda, which is an incredible thing, given its subject matter. Here we have the real McCoy.

The book is short, however, the tale is told thoroughly. The reader feels so very sorry for George. George is a study of loyalty, decency and patience and how one feels so utterly responsible for the life of another human being-in this case his childhood friend, Lennie, who is somewhat mentally challenged. This book is a sad account of the fragility of human beings and how one person will be loyal to the other person til the end-even if he needs to commit murder to show it. The character, Candy, is so very pathetic too and his comments about \\" a stranger killing my old dog\\" are so very sad! One tends to think that it was because of Candy feeling badly about a stranger killing his dog that George does what he does.
